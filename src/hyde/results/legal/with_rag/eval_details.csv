How are fees structured and adjusted under Article 6?,"Fees under Article 6 are structured as a combination of three components for each individual system. The first component is the Individual First Phase Fee, calculated by multiplying the total quantity of product received in barrels at the applicable receipt point by the applicable Individual First Phase Rate. The second component is the Individual Second Phase Fee, calculated by multiplying the total quantity of product delivered in barrels to the internal transfer point by the applicable Individual Second Phase Rate. The third component is an amount representing the producer’s allocated share of the actual electricity costs incurred by Midstream Co to provide services, based on the total volumes of product received.

Fee adjustments occur through a redetermination process. Between November 1 and December 31 of each year, Midstream Co prepares and delivers a Redetermination Proposal to the Producer to review and comment on, which proposes changes to each individual fee unless the parties mutually agree not to redetermine a particular fee. If the parties fail to agree on a redetermination by the Redetermination Deadline, the fee remains unchanged. The year immediately following the year in which the proposal is delivered is defined as the ""Adjustment Year.""

Additionally, each individual fee is subject to annual escalation effective July 1 of each year. This escalation is calculated by multiplying the then-current individual fee by the Escalation Percentage. However, reimbursed amounts are not subject to this annual increase. The adjustment becomes effective on July 1 of the applicable year, even if a redetermination occurred earlier in the same year.","Fees are structured based on the Individual First Phase Fee and the Individual Second Phase Fee, calculated as a product of the quantity of Product and the applicable rates. Fees can be adjusted through redetermination proposals by Midstream Co, subject to Producer's acceptance, and are also subject to annual escalation as per Section 6.2.",4.5,0.9161288145118827,1.0,0.0,1.0

If the analysis confirms the product is non-conforming, the producer bears the costs of the analysis; if the analysis confirms the product conforms, the midstream company reimburses the producer for reasonable and documented costs. The midstream company may, at its sole discretion, use commercially reasonable efforts to blend and mix the non-conforming product with other products to meet specifications, potentially charging the producer a reasonable fee for these efforts. The producer must promptly take commercially reasonable actions to address the cause of non-conformance.","Article 7 requires Producer to ensure that all Product delivered meets the quality specifications of the applicable Downstream Facility.

The Defaulting Purchaser’s Purchaser Group cannot refuse to be replaced, and the Company within the Defaulting Purchaser’s Purchaser Group cannot consent to the assignment.

These allocations are strictly for federal, state, and local tax purposes and do not affect or influence the calculation of a member’s capital account, share of net profits, net losses, or any other distributions under the agreement. Additionally, if a portion of a membership or economic interest is transferred during a fiscal year or other period, the allocable share of net profits, net losses, and other income items is apportioned between the transferor and transferee using the ""interim closing of the books"" method as per Code Section 706 and related regulations.","Members are acquiring their Interests solely for investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the distribution or other disposition thereof.

What are the intellectual property rights ownership provisions in the Agreement?,"The agreement defines ""Intellectual Property"" to include patents, trademarks, and copyrights, covering both registered and unregistered rights globally. It includes inventions, patent applications, and related rights such as reissues, continuations, and extensions for patents; trademarks, service marks, trade names, and associated goodwill; and copyrights, including rights to reproduce, distribute, and display works, as well as moral rights and rights to derivative works.

Ownership of intellectual property arising under the agreement is governed by specific provisions. For ""Arising IP,"" ownership vests in Universal, and Adaptimmune is required to assign all rights to Universal. Adaptimmune must ensure that its employees, agents, and subcontractors execute documents and assist in actions necessary to transfer title and enforce rights. This includes the right to sue for past infringement and recover damages. Adaptimmune must have agreements in place with its subcontractors that assign or require the assignment of any Arising IP to it, ensuring such rights ultimately vest with Universal.

For jointly owned Arising IP, both parties are entitled to use the IP without restriction. Neither party may assign its interest without the other's consent, except to an Affiliate or an assignee under the agreement. Both parties can sublicense their interest without needing consent from the other, provided such sublicensing complies with licenses granted under Section 5.1.","Xencor retains ownership of Patents covering Xencor Inventions, while Aimmune owns Patents covering Aimmune Inventions.

What are the terms for the extension of the Commitment Termination Date?,"The extension of the Commitment Termination Date requires the Borrower to submit an Extension Request to the Administrative Agent at least 30 but no more than 60 days prior to the existing termination date. Each Lender must respond to the request by the 20th day (or a later date acceptable to the Borrower) after the notice is given, indicating whether they agree to the extension. A Lender that does not respond is deemed to have rejected the request. The Borrower has the right to replace any Lender that does not agree to the extension. The extension becomes effective only if the conditions specified are met or waived. On the extension date, the commitment termination date for agreeing Lenders and replacement lenders is extended by 364 days. Additionally, the Borrower must pay all accrued and unpaid interest, fees, and other amounts due to all relevant parties on the extension date.","The Borrower can request an extension of the Commitment Termination Date by providing notice to the Administrative Agent, and each Lender must advise whether they agree to the extension. If conditions are met, the Commitment Termination Date can be extended for an additional 364-day period.",4.5,0.9007769546622659,1.0,1.0,1.0
How can a Lender be replaced under the Agreement?,"A Lender can be replaced under the Agreement by following specific procedures outlined in the relevant section. If a Lender has notified the Borrowers of incurring any loss, cost, or expense under Section 2.12, the Borrowers may terminate the Commitment of that Lender (referred to as the ""Terminated Lender"") in whole but not in part. This termination requires a five Business Days' prior written notice to both the Terminated Lender and the Agent, known as a ""Notice of Termination.""

To effect the termination, the Borrowers must either obtain an agreement with one or more existing Lenders to increase their Commitments or request one or more other banking institutions to become a ""Lender"" in place of the Terminated Lender. These new institutions must be reasonably acceptable to the Agent and must become parties to the agreement by executing an Assignment Agreement. The aggregate increased and/or accepted Commitments from these replacement entities must equal the Commitment of the Terminated Lender.

Alternatively, if a Lender fails to consent to a requested amendment, waiver, or modification to a Loan Document, and the Required Lenders have already consented, the Borrowers may, within 45 days of the failure to consent, notify the Agent and the non-consenting Lender of their intention to obtain a replacement Lender. If a Replacement Lender is obtained within 60 days, the non-consenting Lender must sell and assign its Loans and remaining Allocation to the Replacement Lender at par, provided that the Borrowers have reimbursed the non-consenting Lender for its entitled costs. If the non-consenting Lender does not execute an Assignment within five Business Days of being notified, the Borrowers may execute the Assignment on their behalf, and it becomes effective upon execution by the Borrowers, the Replacement Lender, and the Agent.","A Lender can be replaced if the Borrower is obligated to pay amounts under certain sections (e.g., Section 3.6 or Section 3.10) or if a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender. The Borrower can replace such a Lender by finding a Replacement Lender who assumes the Commitment and Loans of the Replaced Lender.",4.0,0.7768863652499624,1.0,1.0,1.0
What are the consequences of a Lender becoming a Defaulting Lender?,"When a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the following consequences apply:

1. No commitment fee accrues or is payable for the period during which the Lender is a Defaulting Lender on the unused portion of its Commitment, as per Section 2.03.

2. The Commitment and outstanding Advances of the Defaulting Lender are disregarded when determining whether the requisite Lenders have taken any action under the agreement. This includes actions such as consents to waivers, amendments, or other modifications under Section 8.01.

3. However, if a waiver, amendment, or modification requires the consent of all Lenders or of all Lenders affected thereby and impacts the Defaulting Lender differently than other Lenders, such consent must still be obtained from the Defaulting Lender.","If a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, their Commitment and Credit Exposure are not included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action. Additionally, the Borrower may replace the Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 3.13.",4.0,0.7681940577323451,1.0,1.0,1.0

8. The increase must take effect as of the agreed-upon Increase Date.","The Aggregate Commitment Amount can be increased if the Borrower requests it and if no Default exists. The increase must be in an amount not less than $25,000,000, and the total increases over the term of the Agreement cannot exceed $500,000,000.",3.0,0.8105618826121244,1.0,1.0,1.0
What are the tax withholding obligations under the Agreement?,"Under the Agreement, the tax withholding obligations require that any payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower under the Loan Documents must be made without deduction or withholding for taxes, unless required by applicable laws. If such laws mandate the deduction or withholding of taxes, the Withholding Agent or Borrower is entitled to make those deductions. Specifically, if the Borrower or the Administrative Agent is required by the Code to withhold or deduct taxes—such as United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes—then the Administrative Agent must withhold or make such deductions, pay the deducted or withheld amount to the relevant governmental authority in accordance with the Code, and ensure that the sum payable by the Borrower is increased, if necessary, so that the recipient receives an amount equal to what they would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.

Similarly, the Buyer and its Affiliates may deduct and withhold amounts from payments required under the Agreement to the extent legally obligated to do so under any federal, state, local, or foreign tax law. These withheld amounts are treated as having been paid to the relevant recipient, and the Buyer or its Affiliates must remit the withheld sums to the appropriate governmental authority within five business days of the withholding. Additionally, they must promptly report the withholding and remittance to both the Seller and the relevant governmental authority.","The Borrower is required to make payments free of, and without reduction or withholding for, any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes. If the Borrower is required to deduct any taxes, it must increase the sum payable to ensure that the recipient receives an amount equal to what it would have received had no deductions been made.",4.5,0.7455996236461543,1.0,1.0,1.0
