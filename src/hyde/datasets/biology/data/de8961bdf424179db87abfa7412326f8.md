## 1 What is a Lobster?

The popularity of the Lobster extends far beyond the limits of our island, and he travels about to all parts of the known world, like an imprisoned spirit soldered up in an air-tight box.

W. B. Lord, 1867

I, for one, first came face to face with a live lobster at Main Line Seafood in suburban Ardmore, Pennsylvania. When I arrived on the first morning of my first summer job I thought the lobsters were staring at me from their tank. Their black eyes twitched and their antennae whiskered slowly but otherwise they sat menacingly still. They had piled on top of each other, backed into one corner in a rugby-style battle clump with their banded claws rested, in repose, yet seemingly eager to burst out and attack. The lobster tank had some algae growing on the glass, and I remember wondering if it would be more or less pathetic if we gave them some sand, a couple of rocks, maybe even a fake plant or two.

During my first summer I scrubbed fishcake pans most of the day but at the start of my second summer the owner promoted me to the counter. He prepared me for my new role by giving me a collared shirt and gripping my wrist to explain the most important thing for me to remember: 'Yes, ma'am! Just came in this morning.'

At Main Line Seafood we sold live lobsters from the tank at the front window. We also sold canned lobster meat, plastic containers of fresh lobster meat, frozen lobster tails, and we offered lobster rolls to the lunch-time crowd, which amounted to toasting a hot dog bun and dumping in some lobster meat on lettuce leaves, while a bag of frozen potatoes sizzled in the deep fryer.

Kosti Ruohomaa, _Maine Lobster, Monhegan Island_ , 1957, silver gelatin print.

Although the lobster species we sold, the American lobster ( _Homarus americanus_ ), ranges naturally from North Carolina to Labrador, it was, and still is, primarily caught in traps by small collections of commercial fishermen along the coast and islands eastwards from New York City. The largest populations of these lobsters, and subsequently lobstermen, are off the Canadian Maritimes and the state of Maine. Offshore trawlers and trappers in the deep waters of the northwestern Atlantic dragged up lobsters from the bottom, and these creatures might have found their way into our tanks, cans and containers, too.

When I worked at Main Line Seafood in the late 1980s the lobster fishery in the Gulf of Maine and around the Maritimes was just beginning a period of massive growth after a relatively stable forty years or so. Since then landings have tripled in weight, with no sign of any significant abatement. James Acheson, a scholar of this industry, wrote:

> The Maine lobster fishery is one of the world's most successful fisheries. It is distinguished by a sense of stewardship, political support for conservation rules, and effective fisheries conservation legislation. In these respects, it is different from most other fisheries in the industrialized world.

  | Gilbert's Lobsters in Pemaquid, Maine, 1938. Wherever you are in the world, eating lobster is as much about the experience, the event, as the flavour of the food.

I left Main Line Seafood after my second summer, heading off to university. Though my mother had occasionally ordered lobster for a special occasion while I was growing up, I never ordered this at restaurants myself because of disinterest (and the price). I didn't properly eat lobster meat until I was in my twenties when a friend invited me to his family's summer home in Maine. One foggy evening we ate fresh lobster on the dock. My friend's family taught me the intricacies of how to eat the animal, such as how to suck the meat from the legs and how to find the orange unfertilized roe in the female. With fresh salted corn and cold bottled beer that lobster was sweet and had a perfect texture. The smell of butter blended with that of the low tide and the exposed, popping rockweed. Eating lobster is as much about the experience as it is the taste itself. We sat with our feet dangling over the water, flicking the shells back from where they came. John Steinbeck said it better in _Travels with Charley_ (1962):

> Those dark-shelled Maine lobsters from the dark water which are the best lobsters in the world . . . There are no lobsters like these – simply boiled, with no fancy sauces, only melted butter and lemon, they have no equals anywhere. Even shipped or flown alive away from their dark homes, they lose something.

Years later I served as a sternman for a few seasons aboard the lobsterboat _Whistler_ , out of Noank, Connecticut, fishing the eastern waters of Long Island Sound. I was a part-timer, going out a few days a week in the warmer months. Lobster fishing is enormously satisfying. I relished the steam out to the fishing grounds, the curiosity of what's going to be in the trap each time it breaks the surface, the seabirds, the sunrises, the earned exhaustion, the watching of the other boats, the yarn-spinning when baiting-up at the dock, and the flavour of black coffee in a paper cup after hard work on the salt water. I liked eating for dinner the food we'd caught that morning. It doesn't escape me, however, that it's easy to love a job when you're a part-timer, working on a wage – when your livelihood doesn't depend on it.

My boss was Captain John Whittaker, a tall man who has been fishing for over 35 years. He lives in the house in which he was raised. His father was a boat builder who constructed wooden craft on the same ground where John stacks and maintains his gear. Whittaker has relatives in lobster-rich Nova Scotia and his wife, Elizabeth, is from Maine and is the daughter and sister of men who have made their living in the lobster business. Whittaker keeps photo albums of boats and local history, and he enjoys reading maritime nonfiction in the evening. He is a patient man, rarely drinks and rarely curses, preferring expressions like 'Holy crow!' He calls lobsters 'bugs'.

Whittaker looks out each morning on his own dock when he has breakfast. Lobstering is one of the few commercial fisheries these days that allows a person to sleep at home at night. He runs his own rusty old railway to winch his boat out of the water, and he has a refrigerated shipping container to store bait. Between and around his driveway, the dock and up the small hill to his house, are piles of old and less-old gear – barrels, coils of rope, stacks of traps and plastic totes, buckets of nylon bait bags – and a variety of other items that his wife might call junk, such as rotting boats, split buoys and a dead outboard engine. Though his bait barrels stink and his diesel engine starts rumbling and smoking often before daybreak, his neighbours like having him there, because they can buy the freshest, cheapest lobster right off the boat.

Whittaker is one of the few people in the area who fishes year round, usually by himself in frigid winters, but he also needs to supplement the family income – two of his daughters are in college – with other local work. He jokes regularly about ditching the lobster business and picking up farming or anything else. He has the skills to do a hundred other jobs, but he sticks with it. There is something in this catching of lobsters that is well beyond material gain.

The American lobster fished by John Whittaker, sold by Main Line Seafood, and eaten only on special occasions by my mother is not, however, the only lobster species worth catching, selling, eating – or reading about.

Though the American lobster is the best known and the most valuable lobster species commercially, for decades it has occupied less than 40 per cent of the world catch of lobsters by weight. A species quite similar to the American lobster is the European lobster ( _Homarus gammarus_ ), caught in the waters of northwestern Europe. Spiny lobsters (mostly _Panulirus cygnus_ ) have for many years been the highest-value fishery in Australia, worth AU$462 million in 2008–9, with the majority of the product exported in various forms to China and Japan. Ask for fresh lobster in a restaurant in the Bahamas and you'll get a plate of the Caribbean spiny lobster ( _P. argus_ ), otherwise known as rock lobster or 'warm water' lobster, a significant fishery throughout the Caribbean. Recently I bought a 'cold water' lobster tail at a Japanese restaurant in Morro Bay, California, and was served, I believe, a delicious portion of a California spiny lobster ( _P. interruptus_ ). The waiter was not certain. The United States imports spiny lobster from nearly fifty countries, including Taiwan, Oman, South Africa and Nicaragua. Brazil has regularly been the largest supplier.

The simple question 'What is a lobster?' turns out to be complicated. How is it different from a crayfish? a prawn? a shrimp? or scampi? It is similar to travelling the English-speaking countries of the globe and asking 'What is a biscuit?' No clear-cut definition of lobster exists for biologists or linguists.

This is not a new problem. Aristotle wrote: 'With regard to the crustaceans, one species is that of the crayfish, and a second, resembling the first, is that of the lobster; the lobster differing from the crayfish in having large claws, and in a few other respects as well.' It really depends on what part of the world you're in and whom you're asking. Most of the British know the spiny lobster of European waters ( _Palinurus elephas_ ) as the crayfish or crawfish, while, for most Americans, these are common inclusive names for numerous smaller crustacean species that inhabit only fresh water. One scholar identified in 23 different countries 53 different names for _Nephrops norvegicus_ , an important commercial species of the northeastern Atlantic and the North Sea, referred to most often as the Norway lobster, the Dublin Bay prawn, or scampi. In Australia _Thenus orientalis_ is known as the Shovel-nosed lobster or the Moreton Bay bug. Lobster krill are not actual lobsters by almost everyone's biological definition, nor are squat lobsters. I could go on. Not only are there language variations, but differences in common and regional names. Scientific nomenclature doesn't always make things easier: one genus is called _Palinurus_ , one is _Panulirus_ , and another _Palinurellus_. It also depends if your taxonomy is based on morphology or more recent genetic standards.

In 2006 the late great Dutch biologist Professor Lipke Bijdeley Holthuis, while updating with colleagues his report for the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, identified 149 species of lobster that were of interest or potential interest to fishermen around the world. I'll use his taxonomic nomenclature here.

Everyone can agree that a lobster is an animal. Whittaker isn't far off in calling them bugs, because lobsters are related to insects in that they are also arthropod invertebrates with a segmented body, jointed legs and an external structure of some kind. The English word seems to have derived from this insect-like appearance, evolving through various forms and spellings from the original Latin word for locust, _locusta_.

Everyone also agrees that a lobster, within the phylum Arthropoda, is an aquatic crustacean (think 'crusty'): it has no wings or neck, but has gills, two sets of antennae and a rigid exoskeleton. Taxonomists place lobsters under the order Decapoda, meaning 'ten feet'. As an adult, a lobster, unlike most shrimp and krill, is a poor swimmer, primarily crawling on the ocean bottom. A lobster has a fused head and thorax, the cephalothorax, under which are protected gills. It has an abdomen, called the tail if we're at the restaurant, under which are fan-like appendages called pleopods or 'swimmerets', and three sets of maxillipeds, 'jaw feet', that serve as mouth appendages to help still other mouthparts. Like a shrimp, a lobster's body tends to be more long than wide – as opposed to a crab, whose abdomen has evolved to tuck under its cephalothorax. What different cultures consider a lobster fits into several different families within the Decapoda. Some lobsters have claws to protect themselves, some have spines and some make do with camouflage. Lobsters vary greatly in the shape of their exo-skeleton, their behaviour, their habitat and their development.

Six different types of lobster as they appear in L. B. Holthuis's seminal _Marine Lobsters of the World_ (1991). Just two decades later, modern decapod taxono-mists, using phylogenetics, placed the poly-chelid lobsters in a different family and do not consider the mud lobster a lobster at all – more a shrimp. |

For a workshop in Perth, Australia, Stanley Cobb and Bruce Phillips once assembled a dream team of lobster specialists, leading to a two-volume book titled _The Biology and Management of Lobsters_ (1980). They state the matter of defining lobsters this way:

> The animals colloquially called lobsters, rock lobsters, or marine crayfish fall into several taxonomically distinct groups: the clawed lobsters (Nephropidae), the spiny lobsters (Palinuridae), the slipper lobsters (Scyllaridae), and the coral lobsters (Synaxidae). Despite the taxonomic differences, it seems appropriate to treat them together. As W. Herrnkind pointed out at the workshop, the lobster is a very significant biological entity. It is widely distributed, large in size, long lived, abundant, and ecologically consequential. Although lobsters are a morphologically diverse group composed of many species [Cobb and Phillips counted 163 at the time], the ecological differences between them are not great, and they appear to be physiologically quite similar.

Professors Cobb and Phillips are still studying and publishing about these crustaceans and still attending international meetings devoted exclusively to their study. Crustacean taxonomists continue to change and debate lobster phylogeny. Yet right now, indifferent to scientific nomenclature, some fisherman out there is licking his lips in anticipation of the food or money to be had from a catch of African spear lobsters ( _Linuparus somniosus_ ) or Arabian whip lobsters ( _Puerulus sewelli_ ) or Japanese spiny lobsters ( _Panulirus japonicus_ ). Lobsters are crawling ocean bottoms all over the earth, from shallow pits in intertidal regions to waters almost 10,000 feet deep. Lobsters hunt in the frigid Arctic Ocean and amidst the tropical reefs of the South Pacific. They breed around some of the most remote islands on earth, such as Easter Island and Tristan da Cunha. There have been lobster species that did not adapt fast enough and are now extinct, and there surely remain several species still undiscovered, flicking their antennae in a dim foreign ocean. The scientific community described in 1990, for example, the Musical furry lobster ( _Palibythus magnificus_ ) from only a few specimens caught in deep water off Western Samoa.

In this 2008 magazine cover illustration, titled _Summer Getaway_ , Peter de Sève shows how we culturally associate the lobster with luxury, sex appeal and humour – alongside a slightly nervous awareness that we regularly boil these animals alive.

I examine here how marine biologists, explorers, fishermen, divers, cooks, epicures, humanities scholars and a variety of writers, filmmakers and artists have perceived the lobster. I focus primarily on the marine clawed lobsters of the Gulf of Maine and northern Europe, which Professor Holthuis and others refer to as the 'true lobsters', since these are most familiar to Western readers and are the lobsters most commonly represented in the arts. I seek to examine if there is indeed something special about our perception of the lobster – whether you see one through a snorkel mask, in a fisherman's trap, in a fishmonger's tank or on your fancy dinner plate. Why is it, after all, that we so often associate the lobster with decadence, sex and a lemon spritz of absurdity?

## 2 Dissecting a Bug

A lobster is monstrous to the eye the first time it is seen, but when we have been shown the use of the case, the color, the tentacula, and the proportion of the claws, and have seen that he has not a scale nor a bristle, nor any part, but fits exactly to some habit and condition of the creature; he then seems as perfect and suitable to his sea-house, as a glove to a hand.

Ralph Waldo Emerson, 1833

When Professor Jonathan Geller was a graduate student he took a summer course in the town of Woods Hole, Massachusetts, renowned for its Marine Biological Laboratory and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He met a woman there, a fellow aspiring scientist, and asked her out to dinner. Young Geller, slender and earnest, thought he would treat his date to the most impressive meal he could offer, so he walked her to the Fishmonger Cafe and ordered two fresh local lobsters. When dinner arrived on the table, a sample of one of the largest extant species of crustaceans on earth, Geller could not resist approaching his dinner clinically. 'I gave her a lecture', he said. 'I thought it would be impressive, but after a lobster is boiled there isn't as much to see on the inside. So I was just really pulling the legs apart. She thought that was all kind of peculiar.' As the summer wore on, she either forgot that evening or, more likely, embraced his eccentric enthusiasm. They married four years later.

Geller earned his PhD at the University of California and has since led dissections of hundreds of lobsters, crayfish, crabs and other marine invertebrates for over a thousand students of marine biology. When I met him he was teaching and conducting research at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, beside Monterey Bay, California. He kindly agreed to do a lobster dissection for me.

Malcolm Cheape, _Lobster Sketch_ , 2006, mixed water-based media collage.

To get a couple of specimens I went down the road from his lab to a fish market where they had bubbling tanks filled with lobsters. The fishmonger said he hadn't carried California spiny lobster for years, but they sold live Maine lobsters year round.

I asked: 'Are these all from Maine'?

'Yes, sir.'

'But those have "Canada Wild" printed on their claw bands.'

'Well, you know, sir, Maine curls around all the way up there. To Canada.'

Perhaps he was thinking of the Gulf of Maine, rather than the state, and, to be fair, the American lobster is often known as the Maine lobster. If you're in Canada, it's the Atlantic Canada lobster. I asked how long they had been in the tank.

'Just came in this morning.'

I requested one female and one male. To tell the difference between a male and female clawed lobster, you need to turn the animal upside down. Females have smaller claws and a wider abdomen, but the easier diagnosis is to find the two small appendages near where the thorax meets the abdomen, the first set of swimmerets. A female's pair is flat and feathery. The male's pair is relatively thin and rigid, effectively two half-cylinders that act as a penis for delivering spermatophores into an external pouch on the female. When mating, the male lobster places the two swimmerets together, as if praying, thus making an enclosed tube to deliver. The female lobster uses these gametes to fertilize her eggs when she excretes them, sometimes more than a year later. Older, larger females often lay two sets of eggs with one deposit of sperm.

Spiny lobster females store their spermatophores in an open area in the same anatomical region as their clawed cousins. As opposed to those of the males, the swimmerets of spiny females are branched. Spiny males have an especially long second pair of legs. Another way to gender a spiny lobster is to observe the aftermost set of legs: if these have little hook-like structures at the tips, you've got a female. The females use the hooks to open up their 'tar-spot', the colloquial name for the external package of spermatophores.

Each lobster weighed about a pound and a half. I gasped at the price. The fishmonger said he purchased them regularly from a company in San Francisco that flies them across the country. I packed the lobsters on ice in a cooler and returned to the lab.

Professor Geller speaks softly. He pronounces taxonomical nomenclature with ease, can say the word anaesthetize aloud without lisping or tripping over it, and he weaves in beautiful technical vocabulary such as crypsis, a more exacting term for camouflage, and autotomize, which is the verb for when animals such as the lobster sacrifice a claw to escape a greater danger. Geller pronounces carapace, the exoskeleton covering the fused head and thorax of the lobster, to rhyme with grace, declaiming the word slowly as if it were a little poem. Yet Geller is anything but pretentious. He wears jeans, running shoes and uses the phrase 'narc-ed out' to describe the lethargic state of a lobster after freezing. He defines a lobster elegantly: 'It is a common name for any stout, heavily-armoured, marine, bottom-crawling decapod.'

Geller put the female lobster, narc-ed out from the ice, on a dissection tray. He brought out a preserved specimen of both a spiny and a slipper lobster, and placed them alongside. 'When you turn all three of these over and look underneath you see that anatomically there's not much difference. It's mainly in the shape of the antennae and in the number and size of the chelipeds.' Chelipeds are legs with claws at the end. 'For the slipper lobster you can see that its carapace is expanded laterally. Into a flat shield. It's as if it were made of rubber and someone just stretched it all out. Even a pair of its antennae has evolved to be flat shields. As a defence, slipper lobsters go more for armour and crypsis.'

Lobsters use their two pairs of antennae as feelers, like beetles, to probe their way around and to gather information. The smaller pair, which is branched on several lobster species, is less for touch and more for identifying chemicals in the ocean for feeding and socializing, for interpreting their environment and cues from other lobsters in a sensory form that is similar to an underwater mixture of taste and smell. With chemosensory neurons, lobsters can discern between other lobsters, respond to sexual signals and identify various other waterborne intricacies.

Perhaps due to claw-envy, an adult spiny lobster's primary antennae, depending on the species, can grow larger than 46 cm (18 inches), more than twice the length of this book. These antennae are thick and prickly, like little clubs or horns, which can taper to delicate, thread-like tips. Holding the preserved specimen Geller said: 'The spiny-ness of these antennae cannot be underestimated. Imagine this guy in a crevice, facing out. See how these spines are angled to also face out? It would be difficult to reach in there without shredding your hand.' Biologists think the Caribbean spiny lobster uses its antennae to stay in step during mass migrations. These lobsters may travel for perhaps as far as fifty miles in a single-file 'superhighway' of thousands of individuals, remaining in contact using their antennae, as if each probing with blind canes, thus keeping in touch with the lobster in front and reducing drag as they march their way to preferred waters.

---|---

To aid with gathering information lobster shells and appendages sprout thousands of sensitive hair-like setae that help the antennae with the lobster's chemosensory work and sense of motion. The setae help catch plankton and may also aid females with tending and grooming their fertilized eggs under the abdomen.

Geller picked up the American lobster to examine its compound eyes, which each contains some 13,500 reflective mirrorlike facets. Author Trevor Corson put it poetically: 'The eye of the lobster is of such novel and ingenious design that it inspires religious faith and scientific admiration alike.' Lobsters are nocturnal and live in the dark ocean bottom, crawling between rocks, coral and other crevices. Their eyes have evolved to function well in low light and to detect movement, but they are not as effective at discerning colour or identifying shapes. The eyes of clawed and spiny lobsters are on stalks for a 360-degree view, yet they can still quickly retract under their shell.

Lobsters migrate, tunnel and dig. They move sand, mud and stones to carve out protected dens, to which they can return and hide stashes of food. Lobsters respond to subtle changes in water pressure, currents and light. American lobsters seem to even respond specifically to the autumnal equinox and the winter solstice. And recent studies suggest that the Caribbean spiny lobster might be one of the only invertebrates we've identified so far that can navigate using the earth's magnetism. For one experiment in the Florida Keys biologists caught a group of these lobsters, loaded them in water-filled containers into trucks and suspended these containers inside the truck with ropes, surrounding them with magnets. (I'm not making this up.) They drove around in 'a series of erratic turns and circles', and before they put the lobsters back in the water at two sites, dozens of miles from where they were lifted off the sandy bottom, the scientists covered the lobsters' eyestalks with little rubber caps. A convincing majority of the lobsters turned and walked in the direction of where they were first kidnapped.

Geller pointed toward the tiny sacs at the base of the specimen's antennae, which regulate its equilibrium, helping the animal float right side up. These sacs infuse microscopic grains of sand that stick and weigh on hundreds of minute hairs within. Lobsters can detect slight changes in temperature and salinity, essential factors to their growth, moulting, migration and reproduction. Clawed lobsters seem to be capable of making and detecting small noises, and the Caribbean lobster, like others spinys, has evolved a file-like pad that rubs against a raised ridge at the base of its antennae to make a sound, probably for mating communication or defence. One biologist described this underwater noise as 'comparable to that of a moist finger rubbed against a window pane'.

Since at least the eighteenth century there has been speculation as to the lobster's sensitivity to loud noises, or at least the accompanying vibrations. In August of 1777 William Eddis, a seemingly trustworthy correspondent, wrote that huge lobsters lived in the brackish East and Hudson Rivers around Manhattan. Eddis explained that the Revolutionary War affected the creatures in the water: 'Lobsters, of a prodigious size, were, till of late, caught in vast numbers, but it is a fact, surprising as it may appear, that, since the late incessant cannonading, they have entirely forsaken the coast, not one having been taken, or seen, since the commencement of hostilities.' Professor Geller and John Whittaker are sceptical, but some contemporary lobstermen have claimed that after a night of fireworks the lobsters all go into hiding.

Geller put the female lobster he planned to dissect on its belly with its tail toward him, the 'Wild Canada' bands remaining around its claws. The American lobster is nearly identical to the European lobster genetically and morphologically, just larger and thicker on average and possessing a little ventral tooth underneath the rostrum. The rostrum is the projection of shell between the lobster's eyes, a flat spiked tusk known to fishermen in the UK as the 'beak'. The American and European lobsters both evolved, like all of the lobster species, from a common ancestor that scurried on the ocean's bottom over 250 million years ago (or millions of years earlier still if you choose the earliest decapods as their progenitors). The clawed lobsters seem to have emerged similar to their present state some 150 million years ago, sharing the Jurassic oceans with ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. These clawed lobsters then probably evolved well over a hundred million years later into separate species with different ranges on either side of the North Atlantic.

Both the American and European lobster have a relatively smooth mottled brown shell to blend into the rocks and seaweed. Some claim the American lobster is more green-brown while the European lobster dons on average more of a blue-black coat. Lobstermen on both sides of the Atlantic have hauled up exceptionally rare lobsters that are royal blue, red, yellow, pitch black, albino and a variety of mixtures, all a result of genetic pigment mutations. Very occasionally a clawed lobster is caught whose colour is split right down the middle like a practical joke, typically red on one side and the normal olive-brown on the other. A rare shell colour usually remains for the lobster's adult life, regardless of the number of moults, although temperature and the ocean bottom can affect the pigment, too. According to Diane Cowan, the founder of The Lobster Conservancy, who has been dubbed the Jane Goodall of the American lobster, you can make a lobster blue by feeding it squid. You can also make a clawed lobster red, of course, by boiling it, which breaks down the proteins in its shell pigment, the same process that occurs when cooking any crustacean.

In 1719 French naturalist Louis Renard illustrated a few lobster species from his travels in maritime Southeast Asia. Though he seems to have painted here the Ornate spiny lobster ( _Panulirus ornatus_ ), his description is of a 'Mountain Crayfish', which, he writes above, is caught in the woods, climbs trees, can be 3–4 feet long, and is very good to eat. Renard writes that they lay eggs in the sand (pictured lower right).

Spiny lobsters are the glorious ones when it comes to colour, with species exhibiting dazzling hues, and enough stripes and spots to rival the jazziest tropical fish. The Painted spiny lobster ( _Panulirus versicolor_ ) of the western Pacific and Indian Ocean has pink and white antennae and electric blue stripes along its legs, swimmerets and tail. Bright markings in lobsters tend to occur in warmer, shallower waters and are connected perhaps to mate attraction, although at least one biologist believes that a parallel row of spots might help them stay in line when migrating. The colours of spiny lobsters inspired artists of early natural history expeditions, painters such as Louis Renard and Olivia Frances Tonge. In 1867 British author and naturalist W. B. Lord wrote:

> The coral reefs fringing the islands of Mauritius afford shelter to members of the family of _Palinurus_ , which in both size and splendour of colouring far excel those taken in our seas. Some . . . looked so much like works of art that we could almost fancy Pallisey, that king of potters, must have returned to life, and that these were some of his choicest productions. Some were of delicate sea-green banded with white and ultra-marine blue, alternately. Others were striped with pale yellow, black, and green, whilst all were so highly glazed, and carried such a brilliant polish, that we deeply regretted the perishable nature of living things.

Professor Geller wiped his hands on a towel. He grasped the American lobster's two large front claws, calling attention to their asymmetry. The right was a crusher claw and the left a pincher claw. The crusher is also known in the US and the UK as the cracker, thumb or knobbed claw. The pincher is synonymous with pincer, cutter, seizer, decorative, toothed or quick claw. The crusher and pincher claws are not always on the same sides of the lobster. Biologists do not think this is genetic but determined in postlarval stages by environmental factors and chance. Geller knew of a few recorded instances in the wild where lobsters developed two pinchers or two crushers. Normally, once the sides and type of the claws are fixed in larvae, the same type of claw will grow back on the same side after each moult, even after autotomy. As lobsters grow larger and older, the claws grow faster than the rest of their body, changing from about 5 per cent of their total weight in early larval stages to nearly half for the old bully males.

Geller explained that the design of the tendons and muscles in a lobster claw has evolved to keep it closed, particularly the crusher type, thus increasing the force of its grip to hold on to crabs and crack the shell of a clam or a mussel. In other words, it is difficult for a fish, another lobster or your finger to stop the claw from closing but, at the same time, it's not terribly hard to stop the lobster from _opening_ its claws – an easy task for, say, a stiff rubber band. Geller compared the separate functions of these claws to the evolution of vertebrate teeth. The pincher claw has sharp denticles for tearing while the molars of the crusher claw are for mashing and holding. The pincher claw has more setae and more fast-twitch fibres. I can tell you that when you put your hand into a lobster trap, into a pile of clacking, glistening lobsters that have only just broken the surface of the ocean, the type of claw that is going to nab your finger, even through a thick rubber glove, and make you yelp between clenched teeth, will be the pincher. The pincher throws the jab; the crusher inflicts the vice. When lobsters battle each other on the ocean bottom and the fight gets serious, they each usually find the other's crusher, regardless of which side it is on. The two crushers lock and hold until the weaker animal loses the claw or shows subservience.

Sometimes aboard _Whistler_ when we hauled up a string of traps that were full of lobsters, a few of them would grab on to another's claw or wrist or tail, usually with their pincher. We could only get them apart by sticking a flat metal gauge between a claw and turning it sideways, or sometimes we dunked the lobsters in the tank, which seemed to distract them enough to release. If we forced the two clenched lobsters apart too roughly or at too drastic an angle, one or both of them would autotomize – always at the same joint at the base of the carapace, where it clots immediately. For the fisherman, this loss of claw can be the difference of two or three dollars per bug. An asymmetrical lobster looks less appetizing on a dinner plate, and some prefer claw meat to tail meat. At the market when a lobster has only one claw it's called a 'cull'.

In 1895 the first and most accomplished of American lobsterologists, Francis Hobart Herrick, PhD, ScD, published his seminal book-length report for the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, which he revised as _Natural History of the American Lobster_ (1911). Though most of what Herrick learned and described has been added to, little has been repudiated. His writings and illustrations remain a significant resource. Herrick is the Da Vinci, the Darwin, the William Shakespeare of lobster biology. He wrote at a time when a dash of lyricism or anthropomorphism didn't reflect poorly on a scientist. In his chapter on 'The Great Forceps', Herrick wrote:

> The big claws of the lobster are remarkable organs whether considered in the light of their structure, their development, or the process of their renewal, and the more we study them the more remarkable they appear. In most of the higher Crustacea the great claws are the chief weapons for both attack and defense and very efficient means for seizing and rending the prey, as well as for grasping and holding the female in the act of pairing.

Professor Geller took his hands off the claws and folded the lobster gently. He pointed to the space where the carapace meets the segmented abdomen. Here is where the lobster will back out of its shell, to escape in order to grow. Lobsters must moult to get larger since their shell is rigid. For the first five years of the American lobster's life it moults approximately 25 times, then sheds its shell twice a year until it reaches sexual maturity, which is usually between five and eight years. Once an adult, a male lobster tends to moult once a year, a female every other year, with both genders slowing down as they age. Moulting is affected by season, water temperature, salinity, mate availability, diet and other social and environmental conditions.

Geller said: 'When this lobster moults, it will split here at this suture site and back itself out. Then it has to pull all the appendages out the narrowest points. You can see how the claw has to pull through this slot here. Look how small that is.' A lobster will starve itself to prepare for moulting. Biologists believe it crawls to a protected place, since during the process and immediately afterward it will be immensely vulnerable. 'The muscles are really limp and watery so they can be squeezed. The animal is weak. It's a hard problem to solve, because it has to have enough strength to pull itself out, but the muscles can't be so well formed. Moulting can be the cause of death, a loss of claw, or the lobster could even get stuck.'

In 1875 Norwegian zoologist G. O. Sars described a European lobster in the moulting process off the coast of Tananger:

> It had just been taken out of a lobster-box [a submerged storage container] and could be handled without offering the slightest resistance. The shell on its back was burst in the middle, and the tail and the feet were nearly all out of the old shell, while the largest claw only stuck out half its length. This latter portion of the change of shell is evidently very dangerous, and although I observed it for quite a while, I could see little or no progress. It is certainly a painful and dangerous process, and probably many a lobster loses its life through it. Immediately after the changing of the shell the lobster is lean and miserable.

Mature females usually copulate immediately after shedding their shell. After a lobster of either gender has moulted, it starts eating and filling its body with water so that the new shell will harden around a larger form. In a single moult the American lobster can increase its volume by more than 50 per cent and its length by more than 15 per cent. Studies suggest the lobster will devour some of its own discarded shell, replacing some of the nutrients to rebuild. It generally takes weeks to fully harden its shell again.

When fishing in the waters of Long Island Sound, if we hauled up a recently moulted legal lobster, called a 'shedder', we brought it back to the dock and used special loose rubber bands that would not cut into its claws, yet would still be in place when the shell hardened. We put shedders in a cage underneath the water until they were rigid enough to send to market. In parts of the world you can purchase 'soft-shelled' lobsters during certain weeks of the year.

'All right, let's look at the mouth', Geller said. With a dissecting probe he clicked on the hard teeth inside the lobster's mandibles. Even in its narc-ed state out of the water, the lobster's appendages fanned and gathered toward the mouth. Though one of the lobster's defining characteristics is that it has three sets of maxillipeds, it also has three additional sets of appendages above, also around the mouth. Each of these six appendages is nearly impossible to discriminate for the non-specialist – don't bother if you're trying to impress someone on a first date – as these appendages are all branched and overlapping, appearing to be twice as many. Some look like little gills and others like legs, and all of them nibble around in their devotion to the primary business of macerating and gathering from the sea what the large claws have torn and crushed or what happens to be floating past.

Lobsters are omnivorous. They eat what is available on the bottom. As one Welsh fisherman put it, lobsters eat 'anything with flesh on it, that has once lived'. Lobsters eat (preferably living) marine worms, mussels, clams, fish, sea stars, sea urchins, octopus, squid, crabs, plankton, algae, sea grasses and decomposing organic matter of all kinds. The lobstermen of Western Australia have been fond of mixing with their baitfish a bullock hock, a piece of cattle hide and even a spot of kangaroo meat. Occasionally lobsters devour each other. Herrick wrote: 'Lobsters are cannibals from birth, owing, primarily, to their strong instinct of pugnacity. The small, as well as the large, are ever ready to prey upon those still smaller and weaker than themselves.'

An illustration by Polydore Roux in his _Crustacés de la Méditerranée et de son littoral..._ (1828) of a female _Scyllarus arctus_ , the Small European locust lobster. In the line drawings of the underside of the abdomen, the male is left (2), and the female right (3).

Geller turned the lobster around. He explained that the true tail of the lobster is only the set of four fins, the uropods, at the end of the abdomen on either side of the telson, which is the rigid middle plate between these four fins. He held the specific uropod where American and Canadian lobstermen would notch out a 'V' with a knife to mark that this female has had eggs recently.

The lobster began to wake up a little. 'This tail flipping behaviour is a neurological hallmark', Geller said. 'It's an escape response. If this were in water it would go jetting backwards.' Except in a larval form, nearly every species of lobster, besides crawling forward, can only flip itself in reverse through the water, which is most useful as it expertly backs into a shelter – seemingly without looking. The swimmerets under the abdomen help the lobster move forward when it is crawling high on its legs, but they are too small to be especially effective. The swimmerets are better for clearing out sand or holding and aerating eggs.

Linguists and authors have enjoyed the lobster's characteristic of essentially only being able to swim backwards. The French word for the clawed lobster, _homard_ , Milne-Edwards's genus name _Homarus_ (Latinizing the French) and the German and Norwegian word _hummer_ all might have their roots in the Old Norse verb _homa_ , meaning to go backwards. In the seventeenth century Jean de La Fontaine seized on the metaphor, beginning his Aesop-inspired fable 'The Lobster and Her Daughter' this way:

The wise, sometimes, as lobsters do,

To gain their ends back foremost go.

It is the rower's art; and those

Commanders who mislead their foes,

Do often seem to aim their sight

Just where they don't intend to smite.

Geller stroked the flesh of the underside of the tail to make it curl. 'What is especially cool is that to do this tail flip response, there is really just one large nerve to control this huge muscle. The nerve runs down ventrally, longitudinally. Otherwise there's nothing inside this abdomen beyond muscle and intestine, which comes out here. This is the anus just underneath the telson.'

To begin the actual dissection Geller used a small pair of surgeon's scissors to cut a square out of the female's carapace, beginning aft where the animal would crawl out of its shell. I asked him about the ethics here, of dissecting a live lobster.

'With an invertebrate you can anaesthetize them or relax them. Often we use magnesium chloride, which debilitates their muscles. It's really hard to know what they're sensing. You have to be honest about that. You don't know. They have a small brain. There's no question they perceive, well, irritation. You give them a stimulus and they respond. But pain? It depends how you define pain. It's definitely nervous irritation, a response.'

Francis Hobart Herrick's 1911 'Half section of lobster cut in median plane to illustrate general anatomy' remains both accurate and useful a century later.

The lobster showed no reaction to the cut in its shell. Geller pointed to the exposed heart, a white rectangular bag that pulsed visibly. He explained that the circulatory system is primitive, an 'open system' without veins. There are holes in the heart that pump a watery, greenish fluid into arteries and across all of the body parts, bathing the organs under the carapace. As he cut into the shell, fluid leaked onto the tray. This blood is the white, creamy substance that rises to the surface when boiling a lobster.

Geller continued to cut open the carapace, adroitly pulling the shell from the connective tissue, which revealed a red-flecked, film-like material. This would have been the new shell when the lobster moulted. Forward of the heart and about four times the size was the stomach. This two-part organ is ridged like a baleen hoop-dress and has three hard molars on the inside, serving a purpose like a bird's rock-filled gizzard. The lobster's stomach not only grinds and sifts food but also stores material. Herrick wrote of the lobster's stomach when discussing recently moulted specimens: 'I have found soft lobsters with their stomachs stuffed full of the shells of mollusks and other calcareous fragments, actions which point clearly to the need of the animals at such times to obtain a supply of lime as quickly as possible.'

Professor Geller cut a wider opening in the shell up to the rostrum and showed the digestive glands, which, if cooked, would remain soft and the colour of the inside of an avocado. This is gastronomically known as the 'tomalley' or 'the mustard'.

Geller next touched his probe to the brain, a white nub of tissue about the size of the tip of a ballpoint pen. 'That's about as big as it is. That little bulge there.' The lobster has a dozen other smaller nodes of nerve tissue, but this brain, according to neurobiologist Barbara Beltz (who also calls it the supraesoph-geals ganglion), is 'generally concerned with primary processing of visual, chemosensory, and mechanosensory inputs, as well as higher-order processing and integration of these modalities'. By touching a white stringy nerve beside this ganglion Geller elicited a twitch from one of the antennae, but by then the heart was barely moving. He assumed the lobster was now 'brain-dead' due to lack of circulation.

Snipping the carapace further, Geller revealed that the gills are outside the body cavity on both sides of the lobster – under the carapace, but separated by a thin wall. The lobster's feathery gills and their paired fan-like parts, which serve to draw in salt water, are actually branches formed out of the base of the legs, as if we had breathing apparatus on our upper thigh. The in-flow of water facilitates the movement of blood across the gills-the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The water is then expelled out of both sides of the lobster's head. Geller pointed out the two bladders that connect to a set of pores at the base of each antenna, from which the lobster urinates. The seawater flowing forward from the gills can send this urine several feet in front of its body, allowing it to communicate a variety of social functions. Trevor Corson described the process: 'Quite possibly, lobsters [are] sensing each other and sending signals – "I beat you up last night, remember?" or "Would you like to mate with me, I'm about to get undressed?" – by pissing in each other's faces.'

---|---

The last thing Professor Geller examined during this dissection was an unexpected find underneath this female's carapace: a long dark-green organ with little yellow specks. It had two lobes and rested dorsally on either side of the heart, extending underneath the shell of the abdomen. It was a well-developed ovary packed with eggs. If the cooked lobster Geller dissected for his future wife had been a fertile adult female, he would have found this as dense, bright orange roe. Chef Jasper White, author of an entire cookbook on preparing lobster, uses these cooked lobster eggs, the 'coral', to 'add little bursts of flavor and texture to sauces and soups'.

Beginning as a small white glob, a mature female's ovary develops eggs for a good part of a year until the organ turns dark green and expands to crowd the upper part of the lobster under the shell – from behind the eyes to well inside the abdomen. When ready, the female lobster secretes the eggs and releases the previously deposited sperm to fertilize. Herrick wrote, rather excitedly: 'The crustacean sperm . . . is like a submarine torpedo, loaded and primed, capable of piercing the membrane and forcing a passage into the egg the moment its latent energy is set free.'

---|---

Herrick found, depending on the size and age of the female, that an American lobster can carry anywhere from a few thousand to nearly a hundred thousand eggs. The lobster Geller dissected was carrying several thousand. In the wild the female lobster arranges the fertilized eggs underneath the abdomen, held in clumps by a cement-like substance on the swimmerets. The female carries these fertilized eggs for another nine to eleven months until the lobster larvae hatch at night, floating to the surface to a planktonic start to life. Thus the entire gestation period for a lobster can be almost two years.

Each tiny American or European lobster larva, now open to predation and subject to wind and tides, will as it moults transform itself over the course of about four to eight weeks, depending mostly on water temperature, into four distinctly different, gradually larger, swimming forms. If by enormous odds it survives life as plankton it will develop to look like a tiny baby lobster. Then it will sink to the ocean bottom to hide and feed within the protection of a safer substrate, such as gravel or dense seaweed.

Illustration of a phyllosoma larva of the Common spiny lobster of Europe, _Palinurus elephas_ [then _vulgaris_ ], by German scientist and artist Ernst Haeckel, 1904. Haeckel wrote: 'The common spiny lobster _[Languste_ ] . . . goes through a series of remarkable metamorphoses when it is young; the strange larva depicted here appears as a thin, round, glass-like transparent disc, bearing no resemblance to the adult . . . this larva was earlier described as a separate genus _Phyllosoma_.' |

---|---

While putting away the preserved specimens Geller explained that spiny and slipper lobsters evolved to have a much shorter egg gestation – usually just a few weeks or months – yet the young of these species spend months and even years in a transparent larval form called a phyllosoma ('leaf body'), which can grow to be the size of a credit card. These larval lobster species then change into another form in order to settle to the bottom and grow into adults. The Western rock lobster, for example, transitions through a planktonic phyllosoma stage that can last almost a year and may float some 2,000 miles offshore into the Indian Ocean. Some might even settle on the coast of Africa. A coral lobster of the West Indies, _Palinurellus gundlachi_ , develops through a dozen different stages before becoming an adult. Various larvae of spiny lobsters are so large and ornate that they were interpreted by naturalists up until the twentieth century as their own species, just as caterpillars were not first associated with butterflies.

After Professor Geller finished the dissection, as we were cleaning up, I told him that I planned to boil the lobsters straight away. Would he accept them for dinner?

'Absolutely. Thank you,' he said. 'My wife will appreciate these.'

## 3 Ancient, Giant and Plentiful

The wave-horses [ships] run over the fields of lobster.

Norse Saga, _c_. 12th century

The legend goes this way: a North Sea gale on 29 October, 370 CE, tossed around a small wooden craft carrying seventeen monks, three nuns, the Abbot Regulus and a holy box containing a selection of the bones of a dead fisherman, the apostle St Andrew. They had set sail some two years earlier from Greece on a mission inspired by a divine vision. As the pitiless gale wore on, the pilgrims steered toward what appeared through wind-whipped sheets of water to be some sort of harbour – but with the seas erupting, the best they could do, exhausted, was to bash their boat to splinters on the shore near the mouth of a brook, barely swimming to safety while clutching the box of relics. With the vessel destroyed and the pilgrims shipwrecked, Regulus decided God wanted him to stay put. Later known as St Rule, the Abbot Regulus reportedly lived another thirty years, helping to establish a Christian stronghold that became a popular destination for pilgrims of the Middle Ages. This town would be named St Andrews, Scotland, and if it is not the most ancient little lobster port in the British Isles, it is certainly a village today where you can learn and see practically everything there is to know about lobsters and our historic relationship to these crustaceans.

On the hill just up from where his boat might have been wrecked stands St Rule's Tower. It is square-sided and about 33 metres (108 feet) high, seemingly erected in the twelfth century or earlier as part of the church to hold those alleged bones of St Andrew. The stone remnants and ruins and foundations of more than a millennium's worth of cathedrals, churches, castles, homes, schools, walls, wells, graveyards, dungeons, turrets and towers overlook the ocean from atop this hill. Many of these early stone structures are now windswept, guano-pitted and crumbling into the edge of the sandstone cliffs.

If you climb to the top of St Rule's Tower, up a narrow spiral of steps inside, you can see an old pier that extends into St Andrews Bay and toward the North Sea. This pier is famous because on Sundays a group of undergraduates wearing the traditional scarlet gowns of the University of St Andrews, given a charter in 1411, process casually from chapel, down the hill and out to the end. A pier has welcomed boats there since about 1100, but the first _stone_ pier, a wide, tall wall in the sea, was constructed in the sixteenth century, in part with stones from the cathedral ruins. The pier has since shielded the harbour from almost all of the arching, thunderous swells that occasionally barrel in from the North Sea. On the northern side of the pier is a series of parallel rock ledges, called skerries, which extend obliquely from the cliffs and are submerged at high tide, providing ideal caverns and nooks for invertebrates and fish. On the southern, protected side of the pier is a narrow channel out of the harbour. If you sail straight out and continue northeastwards, you will eventually arrive at the mountainous coast of Norway after a brief but seasickening voyage of some 350 miles.

From the tower you can see the university's Gatty Marine Laboratory, with its back to the harbour and its front facade facing the sea. William Carmichael McIntosh, an earnest biologist and writer about the local invertebrates and fisheries, founded this laboratory in 1896. On the other side of the pier, farther east along the coast and built into the cliffs, is the St Andrews Aquarium, which displays in tanks both a European spiny lobster and two resplendent royal blue specimens of _Homarus gammarus_.

The libraries of the University of St Andrews are visible from St Rule's Tower. Inside these stone buildings are stacks with brittle old manuscripts and volumes of history with odd lines, paragraphs and occasional articles on mankind's past relationship with the lobster. Also from the tower you can just see the slate-tiled roof of the building that houses the Bell Pettigrew Museum of Natural History. Here resides a giant pair of dusty old lobster claws and, preserved in jars of spirits, several pickled nineteenth-century lobsters collected from local Scottish waters or brought back from distant sailing voyages.

Tucked between all of this history and scholarship, perhaps in spite of it, is a tiny port at the base of the pier and the mouth of the Kinness Burn. St Andrews Harbour shelters a small fleet of fishermen, most of whom catch lobster and crab in the warmer months, just as men have done here for hundreds of years. The fishermen do not need to travel far to catch the European lobsters, which crawl around the rocks on the seaward side of the pier. The animals hide amidst the skerries and all around the dark bouldered coasts of St Andrews Bay and the rockweed edges of the Fife peninsula.

By the time Regulus arrived lobsters had been eating, moulting, copulating, releasing eggs and grazing their antennae on the floor of the northern seas for tens of millions of years, looking almost exactly as we know them today while they watched (and ate) the evolutionary progression of a new group of animals we now know as cod, migrated around a few ice ages, and nibbled the remains of several drowned woolly mammoths.

Humans have been using shelled marine creatures for food or bait as long as our ancestors have been sitting heavy-browed around a campfire. Excavations of the Lussa Wood site on the island of Jura, on the west coast of Scotland, reveal the remnants of shelled oysters and mussels as early as 6500 BCE. The Morton shell mound in Fife, a spear's throw from St Andrews, also dates back to the Stone Age. This midden was once a pile of some 10 million shells. The Picts, at the time when Regulus allegedly arrived, surely ate a great deal of shellfish from the shores. Mussels, scallops, limpets and oysters could be picked directly off the rocks, while more mobile animals such as lobsters and crabs would have required a bit more skill: a chilly swim or a deft spear or hook. At the very least our ancestors probably gathered large crustaceans stranded in tidal pools or washed up on the beach after a storm.

Archaeologists have not identified many lobster and crab remnants in early shell middens in the UK – or anywhere on earth really. Perhaps these animals weren't eaten in any great quantity, but more likely few records remain because the thin shells of crustaceans are more biodegradable: the exoskeletons haven't survived as well as did the more calcified shells of molluscs. Only particularly hard parts of a lobster shell, such as the edges of large claws or the grinding mandibles, survive centuries of exposure or burial. Perhaps sessile creatures and fish were so plentiful for ancient peoples that lobster was a smaller part of their diet. Maybe in some ecosystems vast fish populations kept lobster numbers down by gobbling their planktonic larvae, or ocean temperatures were such that lobsters didn't populate areas where they are now quite common. Yet archaeologists have, for example, excavated mandibular parts of the Cape rock lobster ( _Jasus lalandii_ ) from Stone Age human rubbish in South Africa, as well as remnants of parts of the Red rock lobster ( _Jasus edwardsii_ ) within Polynesian middens in New Zealand.

When combining these rare archaeological finds with early depictions on artefacts and the accounts of European contacts with native peoples, we can rest assured that the gathering and eating of lobster or the use of lobster as bait or for other purposes was a part of pre-colonial coastal cultures on each and every populated continent and throughout the South Pacific and Caribbean. French explorer Nicolas Baudin, for example, observed during his visit to Tasmania in 1802:

> The oysters were of good quality, but the lobsters were far superior to those eaten in Europe by reason of the delicacy and lightness of their flesh. The natives appear to depend on these two creatures for their principal source of food, for everywhere one finds piles of remains which indicate their heavy consumption of them.

The earliest depiction of a lobster seems to be in a carving on a temple wall in Deir el-Bahri, Egypt, recording a voyage to the Red Sea in 1493 BCE. The Peruvian Moche peoples created lobster motifs on ceramic vessels in the early centuries of the Common Era, and sources describe impressions of lobsters on early coins of the Mediterranean.

The bold Abbot Regulus would have sailed from a part of the Roman-dominated world in the fourth century where this crustacean was well known. Craftsmen decorated the utensils of the Roman table with lobster designs. However, beyond Aristotle's excellent biological descriptions and a few artefacts, much of what remains on record about the human relationship to lobsters in ancient Greece and Rome, in the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance is difficult to substantiate and at times dubious. Charlemagne supposedly ate them nearly every night; he created legislation for regulating the lobster fishery that punished fishermen who brought rotten lobsters to market. Tiberius allegedly ordered the face of a fisherman who had offended him to be shredded with a spiny lobster's shell. One yarn goes that a supper of stewed lobsters inspired one of Cicero's greatest speeches, and another spins that the Roman emperor Maximinus ate twenty lobsters at one seating. A nineteenth-century British professor wrote that 'one Pope is said to have hastened his death by their intemperate use'.

In the first century Pliny the Elder wrote in a chapter on sea monsters about spiny lobsters in the Indian Ocean that were 'four cubits in length', the equivalent of 1.8 or 2.4 metres (6 or 8 feet). Tales of leviathan lobsters have since persisted, perhaps in part due to Pliny's account, or maybe because they were indeed once much larger.

A fascination with giant individuals has been a signiicant part of our cultural relationship and interest in the lobster. Illustrations in sixteenth-century European natural histories by Albertus Magnus of Cologne, Olaus Magnus and Conrad Gesner depict man-eating lobsters capable of hauling sailors off their ships. In the mid-eighteenth century Erich Pontoppidan wrote that off the coast of Norway fishermen reported lobsters that could spread their claws 2 metres (6 feet) wide and were 'so large and frightful' that no man was willing to attack them.

Though individuals of a few spiny lobster species can grow quite large, such as the Green rock lobster ( _Jasus verreauxi_ ) found off the coasts of New Zealand and eastern Australia, the biggest and heaviest are the North Atlantic clawed lobsters, with the American lobster the largest on average.

To put some of the following in perspective, the majority of American lobsters caught and served today in restaurants weigh between 450 and 900 g (1–2 lb) alive, less than the weight of a small jar of pickles.

Europeans who sailed to North America in the seventeenth century wrote about exceptionally big bugs. They probably would not have recognized the American lobsters as a separate species, adding further to their surprise at their girth. William Wood and fellow Englishman John Josselyn both described twenty-pounders (9 kg) in separate accounts. In 1630 Reverend Francis Higginson practically swore on his Bible in his narrative, assuring his readers back home that he was not exaggerating any of his observations. Relating only the truth 'without any frothy bumbasting words', Higginson wrote:

> And besides Basse wee take plentie of Scate and Thornbacks, and abundance of Lobsters, and the least Boy in the Plantation [on Massachusetts Bay] may both catch and eat what he will of them. For my owne part I was soone cloyed [satiated] with them, they were so great, and fat, and luscious. I have seene some my selfe that have weighed 16 pound, but others have had divers [several] times so great Lobsters as have weighed 25 pound, as they assure mee.

In 1911 the pre-eminent American lobsterologist, Francis Herrick, published his own investigations of claims about huge clawed lobsters. He confirmed several individuals over 9 kg (20 lb). The largest he endorsed at the time was a 15.5 kg (34 lb) lobster, whose carapace was 31 cm (12¼ inches) long and measured 52 cm (20½ inches) _around_ the crusher claw. A schooner off Sandy Hook, New Jersey, caught this male and brought it to Fulton Fish Market, making the _New York Times_ on 20 March 1897 with the headline 'KING OF ALL THE LOBSTERS':

> He measures nearly four feet and a half [1.4 m] in length from the tip of his formidable claws to the end of his tail. If he could stand erect he could clasp an ordinary man about the waist. His claws are strong and big enough to crush the wrist bones of a strong man . . . Estimating according to scientific rules of lobsters, the new acquisition is declared to be between thirty-eight and forty-five years old . . . He is the oldest and biggest lobster ever seen, and will be under scientific observation from now to the day of his death.

Unfortunately, that day came within a week. This king lobster is still preserved, however, at the American Museum of Natural History.

Twentieth-century fishermen, with the ability to trawl nets in deep water, have dragged up a few American lobsters weighing over 18 kg (40 lb). The shell of a 19 kg (42 lb) specimen is mounted at the Museum of Science in Boston. According to the _Guinness Book of World Records_ the largest lobster ever captured weighed 20.1 kg (44 lb 6 oz) and measured 107 cm (3 feet 6 inches) from tail to claw. This beast was netted off Nova Scotia in the winter of 1977 and met its demise at a seafood restaurant on Long Island.

If you descend St Rule's Tower and walk away from the harbour, along cobbled old North Street and into the main library at the university, you can watch from the windows of the upper floors the lobster fishermen hauling their pots on the bay. The men motor out on most mid to low summer tides to tend their traps, called 'creels'. With usually one or two men per vessel they steer their boats tight along the coast, fishing at lower water so they can better see the rocks and place the creels.

Beginning to search through the stacks in the library, through the early narratives, you'll find that it was not only stories of gargantuan lobsters that intrigued travellers, but the animal's abundance and ease of capture. In 1521, the year before he became a lecturer at St Andrews, John Major described fishermen catching lobsters, which he called 'polypods', on the south side of the Firth of Forth. The townspeople did not even need bait:

> In Lent and in summer, at the winter and the summer solstice, people go in early morning from my own Gleg - hornie and the neighbouring parts to the shore, drag out the polypods and crabs with hooks, and return at noon with well-filled sacks. At these seasons the tide is at its lowest, and the polypods and crabs take shelter under the rocks by the sea. A hook is fastened to the end of a stick, and when the fish becomes aware of the wood or iron, it catches the same with one of its joints, thus connecting itself with the stick, which the fisherman then at once draws up.

A 25 lb (11.3 kg) American lobster caught in a trawl net off the coast of New England.

When European explorers arrived by ship at the coast of North America, they trusted lobster as a familiar food from home. In 1578 Anthonie Parckhurst wrote to encourage settlement in Newfoundland: 'No surely, but thus I doe: with three hookes stretched foorth in the ende of a pole . . . I may take up in lesse then halfe a day Lobsters sufficient to finde three hundred men for a dayes meate.' A 1597 account of a voyage visiting Cape Breton Island found 'the greatest multitude of lobsters that ever we heard of'. The men caught over 140 lobsters with one haul of a 'little draw net'. The chronicler of a 1607 expedition claimed that in shallow water off the coast of Nova Scotia they gaffed fifty 'great Lopsters' within an hour: 'Thear ar great store of them you may near Lad a Ship wth them. & they are of greatt bignesse I have nott Seen the Lyke in Ingland.'

Writing about the mid-coast of present-day Maine, James Rosier described how his expedition caught enormous quantities of fish and 'very good and great Lobsters'. A decade later John Smith wrote about the entirety of New England in 1616: 'You shall scarce finde any Baye, shallow shore, or Cove of land, where you may not take many Clampes [clams], or Lobsters, or both at your pleasure, and in many places lode your boat if you please.' Thomas Morton in his _New English Canaan_ (1637) described lobsters 'infinite in store in all the parts of the land'. He explained that he grew bored of eating them after one day, using them instead for bait to catch bass.

Several explorers described how the Native Americans used lobster. Frenchman Marc Lescarbot wrote that the natives along the coasts of the Canadian Maritimes gathered large quantities of shellfish, including lobsters. Native Americans invited Rosier's party to sit and smoke from a pipe made from the 'short claw' of a lobster, 'which will hold ten of our pipes full'. Morton described the 'Salvages' gathering at the shore for several weeks to eat and dry lobsters for storage. In 1634 William Wood wrote in _New England's Prospect_ :

> In the summer these Indian women, when lobsters be in their plenty and prime, they dry them to keep for winter, erecting scaffolds in the hot sunshine, making fires likewise underneath them (by whose smoke the flies are expelled) till the substance remain hard and dry.

Sailing to farther parts of the globe, European explorers wrote of the plentiful supply of spiny lobsters in the Southern Hemisphere. Several voyagers described the lobsters of the Juan Fernández Islands. This tiny archipelago off southern Chile became famous thanks to the marooning of Andrew Selkirk, a Scottish sailor raised on the south side of Fife. Selkirk's four-year trial was the inspiration for _Robinson Crusoe_ (1719) and though Daniel Defoe chose not to describe his hero dining on the Juan Fernández crawfish or spiny lobster ( _Jasus frontalis_ ), Selkirk surely did – or at least according to his rescuer, Captain Woodes Rogers, who wrote: 'Immediately our Pinnace return'd from the shore, and brought abundance of Craw-fish, with a Man cloth'd in Goat-Skins, who look'd wilder than the first Owners of them.' John Howell, who wrote a biography of Selkirk, explained that the castaway often captured huge lobsters, then either broiled (grilled) or boiled them, seasoning with pimento. After his years on the island and the voyage home, Selkirk returned to Fife and some peaceful time as a gentleman lobsterman:

> He purchased a boat for himself, and often, when the weather would permit, he made little excursions, but always alone; and day after day he spent in fishing, either in the beautiful bay of Largo or at Kingscraig Point, where he would loiter till evening among its romantic cliffs, catching lobsters, his favourite amusement, as they reminded him of the crawfish of Juan Fernandez.

Lord George Anson, who visited Juan Fernández aboard the _Centurion_ in the eighteenth century, wrote that the 'sea craw-fish' were likely the best in the world for their flavour, abundance, and size, weighing 'eight or nine pounds apiece' (3.6 or 4 kg). There were so many spiny lobsters that their boat hooks speared them by accident when the men manouevred their launch on and off the shore. When the _HMS Collingwood_ visited Juan Fernández, Lieutenant Frederick Walpole became intoxicated with lobster:

> The bottom was literally lined with crawfish of a large size; some must have weighed five pounds [2.25 kg] at least . . . Catching crawfish was one of the favourite amusements of the seamen: one man held a pole, on which was fastened a bait, thrown into the water near the beach; one or two others stood ready, and when the crawfish, allured by the bait, had approached within attainable distance, these dogs of war pounced upon him . . . The boat-keepers in the boats alongside used to let down pieces of net spread on the hoop of a cask, with a piece of bait inside it: in a few minutes this was hauled up, and one of our simple friends generally appeared seated on it, greatly enjoying the travelling; sometimes two or three came up, struggling for standing-room. But enough of crawfish: I will only add, that we thoroughly enjoyed both the catching and the eating. We had crawfish for breakfast, crawfish for dinner, crawfish for supper, and crawfish for any accidental meal we could cram in between.

Joseph Lycett, _Aborigines spearing fish, others diving for crayfish, a party seated beside a fire cooking fish_ , _c._ 1817, watercolour leaf in an album. This depiction of people catching crayfish suggests lobster was a part of native diets in New South Wales before European contact.

Explorers throughout other parts of the Pacific were similarly impressed with the numbers and taste of spiny lobsters. Sir Joseph Banks, for example, when off the coast of New Zealand with Captain Cook, wrote: 'But above all the luxuries we met with the lobsters or sea crawfish must not be forgot . . . Of them we bought great quantities of the natives every where to the Northward, who catch them by diving near the shore, feeling first with their feet till they find out where they lie.' Nearly two centuries later archaeologist and adventurer Thor Heyer - dahl described native women catching spiny lobsters this same way, at night, from the shore of Easter Island.

Despite the large size and surprising plenty reported in so many of these narratives, Europeans never developed either the skill or the taste to dry lobster or smoke the meat. Lobsters can survive for hours without water. I've biked home after fishing on several hot afternoons with a few bugs in a plastic bag, and they were just as active when I went to cook them several hours later. Lobsters can survive days when packed in something cool and damp, but they degrade rapidly once killed or cooked. They die quickly in fresh water. Either picked or whole, the flesh doesn't hold up to salting, so early explorers and settlers never developed lobstering as a commercial venture despite their abundance. Colonists thought of them primarily as a useful local supply of fresh food or a convenient source for bait to catch fish that _could_ be salted and shipped.

  | Adriaen van Utrecht's 1644 oil of a _Festive Meal_. Dutch and other European painters regularly included lobsters in their still lifes, surely for the splash of red as much as the intimation of wealth and sexuality. The lobster's widespread appearance in these paintings provides rough clues for environmental historians; evidently _Homarus gammarus_ was fished and available at the market.

The first substantial lobster industry seems to have originated in Norway in the seventeenth century, arising to supply the demand for lobsters in Holland, which had exhausted its own stocks. According to nineteenth-century biologist and historian Axel Boeck, Norwegians knew of lobsters for centuries – they appear briefly in the poetic lines of their sagas – but the country's citizens, even fishermen, had little taste for them at the table. It was not until the Dutch sailed across the North Sea to search foreign waters for lobsters that a Norwegian commercial fishery began. Boeck writes that by 1674 the port of Flekkefjord 'was visited by ten lobster-ships', and from this starting point various other harbours grew quickly into lobster ports around the south coast of Norway. Merchants shipped the live lobsters in sea-water compartments, 'wells', or packed them in boxes with seaweed. The Dutch sent gifts to the clergy of these ports in the form of cheese and cakes, hoping they would encourage the locals to catch and sell them lobster. Boeck reports: 'This succeeded so well near Lister that I find that a man on July 7, 1699, had his ground solemnly consecrated so as to prevent other people from catching lobsters there.' When the clergy was no longer relevant, traders gave the fishermen clay pipes and provided twine to tie up the lobsters' claws during shipment.

Boeck writes that by the eighteenth century Norwegian lobster ports received Dutch ships at least twice a year, in late autumn and early spring. Norwegian lobstermen organized to raise their price, then began to bicker in court over valuable lobstering territories, which ended in a decree in 1728 that lobster fishing was free and open to all. The Norwegian ports expanded to serve a growing demand from English merchants who had been supplementing their own domestic catches by importing tens of thousands of lobsters from places such as the islands of Helgoland off Germany. In 1733 alone Norwegians waved farewell to 23 shipments sailing for Holland, a total of 160,000 lobsters, as well as 41 apparently smaller cargoes bound for England.

Though signs of depletion along the Norwegian coasts had been observed some seventy years earlier, with officials urging conservation, Norway still exported nearly 350,000 lobsters between 1804 and 1806, according to Boeck. The historic Nor-wegian lobster industry peaked in 1827 and 1828, when merchants sent from a wide variety of ports some 1.5 million lobsters each year to Holland and across the North Sea to Britain. The fishery then dipped for over a generation as conservation laws were finally put in place and enforced. By the 1860s exports were back at a new high.  When Boeck completed his account of the Norwegian lobster fishery in 1869, fishmongers at Billingsgate Market in London sold hundreds of thousands of lobsters a year from Norway, stacking them alongside bugs fetched up from around the British Isles. That same year M. Scheie de Vere wrote that a visitor to Billingsgate would see 'pyramids of lobsters, a vast moving mass of spiteful claws and restless feelers, savage at being torn from their clear, cool homes in Norwegian waters'.

Historian James Coull wrote that demand for lobster was so high in London from the late eighteenth century that the market 'was almost insatiable'. Responding to the depletion of more traditional food fisheries, the cod and herring, Scottish fishermen from ports such as St Andrews gradually began to pursue lobsters with greater attention, whereas previously the catching of these crustaceans was only an occasional practice. The fishermen sent the lobsters to London by sail, then steam, then rail, in vessels with flow-through wells to keep the lobsters alive or in boxes packed with seaweed.

St Andrews was a much busier harbour in earlier centuries, supporting a larger fleet with dozens of vessels bound beyond the stone pier for international trade or sailing out to net herring, sprat or groundfish. The commercial lobster fishery started in St Andrews in the early 1800s and has remained steady and profitable, but it has never been more than a small affair compared to larger lobster fisheries in the Orkney Islands and the western coast of Scotland, or even the more productive ports around Fife such as Crail or Anstruther. As William McIntosh predicted, in the twentieth century the most valuable commercial crustacean in the area was actually the Norway lobster, or scampi, a much smaller clawed lobster caught with nets beyond St Andrews Bay.

Our man Francis Herrick made a voyage to St Andrews in 1896, probably in part to see the Gatty Marine Laboratory and visit with Professor McIntosh, who shared his concern about the depletion of _Homarus_ species. Herrick wrote of the fishermen's traps:

Telfer Thomson from Buckhaven, Fife, dressed for fishing and holding a creel for lobsters and crabs, 1900. The men crafted these traps from branches, typically ash, and made the netting by hand.

Men working on creels beside the famous pier of St Andrews Harbour, 1908. |

---|---

> Those examined . . . were small cylinders, made of a wooden frame covered with netting, and were anchored by means of a flat stone tied to the bottom. A fisherman with whom I conversed on the beach had 40 of these creels, and was going to haul them at 5 o'clock that evening, but with no expectation of taking any lobsters, for, as he expressed it, the sea was too calm; rough weather brought better luck.

If you stroll down to St Andrews Harbour today, you'll find the Gatty laboratories still buzzing with activity, although they have long since sold their research boat, the _RV Homarus_. Closer to the pier the majority of the fishermen's craft fly the flag of Scotland off their stern, the white cross of St Andrews on a blue field. These creel boats are squat, constructed of wood and fibreglass, and are generally between 6 and 9 metres (20 and 30 feet) long, although I've seen one man still lobstering with a rowing boat.

The fishermen's traps, small by international standards, are hemispheric in shape and built with plastic frames and plastic-coated mesh. The men fish from 300 to 800 traps per boat. They mark the whereabouts of their creels with lines attached to buoys that are fashioned out of brightly coloured plastic detergent bottles and sometimes a flag on a pole. They almost always use frozen bait, because that's what is available. The St Andrews fishermen sell their catch to wholesalers in town. If the wholesalers don't sell it to local fishmongers or to the fancy local restaurants that serve the wealthy golfers, they load the animals in a lorry bound for Edinburgh or across to Glasgow or maybe on a train down to London. In 2010 some thirty men were involved in the St Andrews lobster and crab fishery, mostly older chaps, and nearly every one of them had at least one other job, storing their boats on the dock during the dark, gale-filled winter.

None of these fishermen can afford to stay in the quaint mediaeval homes up the hill or beside the harbour, even though these were once the tiny, draughty stone shacks of their grandfathers and great grandfathers, fishermen who told stories of huge, plentiful, 'muckle' lobsters.

## 4 Building a Better Lobster Trap

The lobsters catch themselves, for they cling to the netting on which the bait is placed of their own accord, and thus are drawn up. They sell them for two cents apiece. Man needs to know but little more than a lobster in order to catch them in his traps.

Henry David Thoreau, 1865

John Whittaker's lobsterboat _Whistler_ smells of fishy labour, but it is not rank unless a bait barrel is left open, attracting both flies and gulls. _Whistler_ is 13 metres (42 feet) long and has the classic lines of a New England lobsterboat: a high, proud bow to cut through the seas, a covered house forward, then a rail that smooths aft into a low, wide stern that adds stability and is easier for working the traps. The boat is fitted with radar to find the way in the fog and with a modest array of electronics to help find his gear. Whittaker can steer from inside or from the open area beside the port rail, from where he hauls the traps. He brings these pots to the surface by hooking a buoy with a gaff, leading the attached line through a pulley on a davit, and then inboard around a spinning hydraulic drum. Banging hundreds of pots each day against the port side of the hull has rendered it scratched and scarred, like the skin of an old warrior seal.

Securing a lobster, like catching a mouse, is a simple matter in concept but not always so in practice. Historically, people throughout the world waded into shallow waters for lobsters, hitching them with gaffs, poles and spears. They tangled lobsters in nets, nabbed them with snares or free-dived and snatched the lobsters out of their dens. All sorts of commercial and recreational fishermen searching for clawed, spiny and slipper lobsters – from Norway to Namibia, from Belize to Bangladesh – have tried at its plainest to attract these crustaceans, pull them undamaged to the surface and then have a method to bring the lobsters ashore and preserved for the consumer's kitchen. In recent times, almost wherever you are, catching a lobster is rife with complications and intricacies. As a commercial or even a recreational endeavour it usually requires a significant financial investment, an understanding of government regulations and an enormous and varied store of knowledge, experience and good fortune.

Even in the same general location fishermen often employ a few different strategies to catch a lobster. Around the coasts of Ireland and England, for example, fishermen have been catching clawed and spiny lobsters by traps, diving, and thin-meshed nets. In the waters of Hawaii Euell Gibbons described his experience as a commercial and recreational catcher of spiny lobster. He caught these animals with traps, with nets at times 1,000 feet long, and even with a fishing pole with a three-pronged hook and a piece of bait. Gibbons wrote:

> All these ways of catching Spiny Lobsters are fun, but the way to wring the maximum amount of sport from this creature is to dive down to the bottom and catch it with nothing but your hands . . . Wear a pair of heavy gloves . . . You may carry a spear, but use it only on those that are in holes too deep for you to reach them. When you get a Spiny Lobster in your hands, hold on for dear life. It will flap that strong tail mightily, and set up a terrible commotion, and the first time this happens most neophyte divers panic and let go. It is all bluff, and you can soon have your Spiny Lobster safely into a bag if you just hold on.

With the popularization of scuba diving, beginning in the 1950s, people began collecting underwater animals more easily and in deeper waters, rendering lobsters, as Gibbons put it, 'at your mercy'. Diving for lobsters has since been regulated on several coasts. In southern California, for example, a diving recreational fisherman is restricted to a certain number of legal-sized lobsters per day, scuba gear isn't allowed in all areas, and a person may only dive during a specified season and only with hands – no spears or other tools. The Kuna Indians of Panama's San Blas region have outlawed scuba diving for the commercial catch of their spiny lobsters ( _Panulirus sp_.), allowing only free-diving with masks, flippers and snares from canoes during daylight hours. The regulations for the Galápagos Islands aren't quite as strict, as they allow diving for spiny and slipper lobsters ( _Panulirus penicillatus_ and _P. gracilis, Scyllarides astori_ ) from a small boat, usually at night, with the aid of hoses pumped with compressed air, a 'hookah' system. In Australia and Papua New Guinea lobstermen use a similar hookah method in the Torres Strait; they also free-dive for their Ornate spiny lobster (P _ornatus_ ), as do men in Thailand and the Philippines.

If you don't want to get wet, a popular early lobstering device used into the nineteenth century in Britain and consequently in North America was the hoop net: a netted pouch woven onto a cylindrical wood or metal ring, often made from a barrel hoop, with bait suspended over the top. The hoop net required tending from a rowing boat, and a fisherman had to pull up the line at the right time, before the lobsters crawled elsewhere. Recreational fishermen still occasionally use hoop nets today, often from a kayak.

In the early Norwegian lobster fishery men used tongs that measured about 3.5 metres (12 feet) long, which they wielded over the side of a boat in the same way oyster tongs were once used. Some Norwegian lobstermen used lobster tongs into the nineteenth century but the Dutch, encouraging them to catch lobster more efficiently and not damage the animals with the tongs' tines, introduced as early as 1717 a basket-style trap to the Norwegian coast. The Dutch seem to have adapted the idea from their eel trap. It remains difficult to say, however, which culture _first_ invented the transportable trap intended primarily for lobsters–one that allows a fisherman to leave it and return some hours or days later to retrieve his or her loot. This type of trap enables a lobsterman to fish deeper waters and set more pots.

Traps remain the most common lobstering tool around the world. Numerous types, assembled in a variety of shapes and sizes, have been used and deployed in all oceans, for dozens of species of lobster. Fishermen along the coasts of Japan, India, South Africa, Hawaii and the Canary Islands all use different styles of lobster traps, yet all the pots serve in roughly the same way. British fisherman-author Alan Spence, writing about the different traps around Britain such as the 'inkwell' design of the English Channel versus the French 'barrel-style', explained: 'Each community likes to think that their design is superior to all others in catching and holding qualities.' Some variations are better suited to local conditions and supplies, while others are simply regional, traditional constructions, no more effective than any other. Fishermen first built their traps with materials such as wood, bamboo, willow, wicker, leather and natural fibre netting, but now most are made with at least some metal or plastic. Nearly all types of traps have a funnelled entrance, which serves as a type of one-way valve, designed so lobsters cannot climb back out after they've been enticed inside by some sort of bait.

John Whittaker's lobster pots, like those throughout New England and Canada, are built of vinyl-coated wire, are rectangular and are larger than most dormitory refrigerators. Even before anything is caught inside or growing on the frame, Whittaker's traps are back-breakers, each weighing 29–32 kg (65–70 lb). In part this is because every pot is fixed with several bricks or a slab of cement so it will sink quickly, land correctly and stay put against powerful currents, even when dropped as far as 107 metres (350 feet) below the surface. Each trap has a door at the top to allow access for hanging bait and removing, 'picking', the lobsters, and two compartments. One, called 'the kitchen', has two netted funnel heads for the lobsters to enter as they hunt for the bait hung in the middle of the trap. After snacking in the kitchen, the lobster then crawls through an internal funnel that is presumably easier to navigate than the ones it used to enter, but this funnel leads into a second compartment, 'the parlour', in which the lobster cannot seem to go anywhere.

From an environmentalist perspective lobster traps are much better for ocean ecosystems than trawl, trammel or tangle nets. Pots have minimal by-catch and they do much less damage to the sea bottom since they remain relatively stationary. Wooden traps – still used in many parts of the world – cost more these days to make and maintain and are subject to rot and marine fouling. This degradability is a positive feature if you're a lobster. If a fisherman loses a trap on the bottom, perhaps due to a storm or the cutting of the buoy line by a propeller, a wooden pot will eventually break up. Plastic or metal gear, on the other hand, takes longer to decompose and can continue catching lobsters for years, known as 'ghost fishing'. Lobsters can survive quite a while in a trap. They can eat plankton or dine on other captured creatures – a crab, a fish, an eel, another lobster – or find sustenance from the thick fouling community that often forms on the pot itself. Depending on the coast and the nature of the bottom, traps regularly arrive on the boat's rail with little jungles of algae, barnacles, mussels, sponges, sea squirts, skeleton shrimp, crabs and sea stars. And even if a lobster starves to death in the pot, it might serve as bait for other animals – so this ghost trap business can be an unseen cyclical problem.

To avoid ghost traps, laws in several lobster fisheries require a removable 'escape vent' fixed with biodegradable metal clips. If the pot is lost on the ocean bottom, this vent will eventually break off and the lobsters can climb out. Some regulations require that the vent has a plastic opening of a specified width, allowing smaller lobsters that are not close to legal size to swim free.

Though wire traps stack more easily, last longer and are cheaper to make and repair, their use, first developed for the offshore lobster fishery, has not come without a certain reluctance. Like most new fishing technologies, especially sonar and the hydraulic trap hauler, the wire pot is one more convenience that encourages more people to go out and lobster. Vivian Volovar, author of her own children's book, _Lobster Lady_ (2007), has been fishing for bugs almost as long as Whittaker. Volovar said:

> Most of these fishermen, they can't fish now without all the electronics, they can't tell what the wind's doing or what's going on . . . They got all the brand new wire gear because they got something else supporting them . . . Can you knit funnels? No. If they couldn't buy everything they had, they couldn't fish. They don't know how to build pots or do any of this stuff. They got into the business because they had a lot of money behind them. And a good credit card.

The majority of lobstermen fish in fairly shallow water and close to the coast, but a few lobster fisheries seek the animals in deeper seas. The North American offshore lobster fishery peaked in the 1970s, but a small number of boats still lobster hundreds of miles from land. They fish more traps on a string and use larger boats that require more industrial gear. One offshore lob-sterboat in 2008, for example, fished over 240 km (150 miles) off the coast of New Jersey in approximately 150 metres (500 feet) of water. The crew hauled strings of 50 pots, each weighing some 45 kg (100 lb). They were out for a week at a time. Large fishing vessels engaged in the spiny lobster fishery ( _Palinurus gilchristi_ ) off South Africa can carry some 2,000 plastic traps aboard and set strings of 100–200 pots on one string, sinking them as deep as 200 metres (650 feet). A few of these vessels have the technology to freeze the tails immediately on board.

The faster and bigger boats, the improved navigation systems, the wire traps, the synthetic ropes, the powered pot-haulers – it all just means that lobstermen can fish more gear, more often, in deeper water and in most weathers. More lobsters are being caught globally and there are more traps on the bottom trying to capture those that are left. Several lobster fisheries have experienced booms and busts, as seen in Brazil ( _Panulirus argus_ and _P. laevicauda_ ) and India (e.g. _Thenus orientalis_ ), which both saw prolific years in the second half of the twentieth century, fluctuations and then a steady decline, from which the stocks remain tenuous. On many coasts, such as in the Galápagos, when spiny lobster populations were overfished, men went after the less profitable slipper lobsters. Fishing practices have had an effect. Throughout Europe and the Mediterranean, for example, the use of thin-meshed nets beginning in the 1960s put a huge strain on the spiny lobster populations.

In the 1960s the South Africa deep water lobster fishery boomed, with occasional 'jackpot hauls' of the Natal spiny lobster, _Palinurus delagoae_. Today, the fleet and catch are a fraction of what they were. |

Government managers have used a variety of tools to regulate regional lobster industries. It can be slightly easier than other fisheries since crustaceans are less mobile but, at the same time, the variety and length of highly transient larval stages make predicting stock sizes a challenge. There is never enough ecological information to make confident management decisions, especially with lesser known spiny and slipper species.

Several lobster fisheries limit the number of commercial or recreational traps per person, and some have limited the number of people that can be involved at all. A few countries have lobstering seasons, such as Spain, Greece, Australia and Canada. One management strategy, recently put in place by Brazil in an effort to keep track of its fleet of 800 or so lobsterboats, requires that every vessel be equipped with a satellite monitoring system. A strategy enforced in most spiny fisheries, as in Western Australia, is a scientifically determined annual quota that the collective fishermen in a given area may not exceed. This total allowable catch can keep prices in check while maintaining stocks.

One of the most common management tools used in nearly all lobster fisheries is the mandate to refrain from harvesting female lobsters with eggs visible under the abdomen, known as 'eggers' or 'berried', or even to gather 'brood-stock' female lobsters that have been recently identified with eggs. To identify the latter, fishermen and managers in some countries cut a 'v-notch' in the tail-fin before they return an egger into the water so as to notify the next lobstermen. A v-notch can last for a couple of moults after a female has laid her eggs. Regulations in nearly all lobster fisheries declare a minimum size bug that can be brought ashore, usually measured by the length of the carapace. Managers sometimes set a maximum size as well to protect the most prolific breeders (while also helping the live-market dealers who have difficulty selling larger individuals to restaurants). Given these restrictions, most trap lobstermen spend the majority of their time _throwing back_ lobsters, usually hoping for just a few keepers per pot.

After a lobsterman has learned the local regulations, he or she needs at least some understanding of economics. Lobster is a luxury commodity. The price a lobsterman gets for a catch is often out of his or her control and not even necessarily based on the health of the local population. Within the basic tenets of supply and demand a lobsterman is dependent on the consumer's willingness to go out for a fancy meal – and lobster markets and products are expanding to literally all corners of the earth.

Because of the price fetched for a single animal and its coastal habitat, lobstering is one of the few commercial fisheries remaining that can be viable for one or two people. John Whit-taker, for example, is a single owner-operator. This makes him vulnerable to the cost of fuel and the price the draggers set for catching the majority of his bait. These bait-catching men, in turn, are also dependent on fuel costs, as well as immensely strict limitations for conservation purposes. Once Whittaker has caught the lobsters, he sells to a wholesaler, a fish market or directly to a restaurant. He does not have access to winter storage facilities, known as lobster pounds, to keep the animals alive to wait for better prices, as they do on a large industrial scale in Canada. Whittaker also has no local cooperative that he might join, which can help cut costs and negotiate collectively, a technique employed by fishermen in other parts of the US and Mexico. Meanwhile, to make matters still more competitive for Whittaker, the supermarket just a few miles from his dock offers frozen spiny lobster tails from Nicaragua and South Africa. Across the aisle gurgle live clawed lobsters in a tank with claw bands that say 'Canada Wild'.

Beyond fishing technology, government regulations and the fluctuations of global trade, the lobsterman is also subject to small and large-scale environmental factors beyond his or her control. In Whittaker's Long Island Sound the health and productivity of the lobster population has diminished due to several factors: large-scale die-offs to the west, an oil spill to the east, various types of industrial and coastal pollution, rising water temperature and a significant intraspecies shell disease. Somehow he has held on to his business, largely due to his experience, skill and hard work. Yet on the morning of 11 June 2010 he picked up his local newspaper before going aboard _Whistler_ and read this headline: 'Regulators weigh five-year lobstering ban in southern New England'.

Several of the global commercial lobster stocks, like all the world's fisheries, are in some level of decline. Diseases, viruses, overfishing, human pollution and climate change all threaten once vibrant lobster stocks in every ocean. A few lobster species are especially threatened regionally, such as the spiny lobster off the coast of South Africa and Namibia ( _Jasus lalandii_ ), the spiny lobster off Taiwan ( _Panulirus japonicus_ ) and the European lobster off the coast of Turkey. As of now, however, no commercial lobster species is on the endangered species list, although, in truth, it is difficult for invertebrates to get that sort of status. In 2009 a group of international experts met in Taiwan to determine if any lobsters deserved to be listed on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's 'Red List Index'. British zoologist Nadia Dewhurst wrote:

> Preliminary results from the workshop indicate that a low proportion of the world's lobster species [they count about 250] are threatened with extinction. However, over 40% of species have been preliminarily placed in the Data Deficient category, of which 80% are known from the Indo-Pacific region particularly around Japan, Taiwan, China, the Philippines, and Indonesia . . . The results do however highlight that lobster fisheries are in fact some of the best managed fisheries: all of the major commercial species . . . were assessed as Least Concern.

The group pointed out that many lobster species have wide geographical ranges, which has helped their status, regardless of regional depletions. They felt that 'poor fisheries management' has led to their concern for the health of populations such as the Caribbean spiny lobster, the Juan Fernández spiny lobster, and the St Paul spiny lobster ( _Jasus paulensis_ ).

Meanwhile, a surprising and inexplicable success story has emerged with the American lobster in the Gulf of Maine, just a few hundred miles to the east of Whittaker's Long Island Sound. These lobstermen are catching the same species but doing immensely better. _Homarus americanus_ remains the lobster of highest international value and tonnage caught. Fishermen haul out of the sea tens of thousands of tonnes more of these bugs each year than those of any other lobster fishery on earth, employing some 40,000 commercial lobstermen and thousands more in shoreside industries. In 2004 The Lobster Institute estimated the economic impact of this fishery to be from US$2.4 to 4 billion. This craggy stretch of coastline, with its endless coves and islands, extends from about the Isle of Shoals eastward and northward, up around Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. On a much larger scale than anywhere else in the world the communities around the Gulf of Maine are dependent economically and even culturally on the harvest of lobster. Thankfully for them, despite highly intense fishing effort over the last half-century, this lobster population has remained seemingly vigorous. Many believe that it is one of the few healthy wild fisheries–of any marine species–left on our planet.

Landings of _Homarus americanus_ in tonnes, 1880–2008. Several data points are missing for the US before 1950, and US landings before then include only those from the major lobster fisheries states, from Connecticut to Maine.

So why has this _Homarus americanus_ fishery in the Gulf of Maine and the Canadian Maritimes fared so well? As with all fisheries questions, the answer is complicated and requires a look backward.

Commercial lobster fishing along these coasts actually did not get going until the mid-nineteenth century, primarily because of the challenges of shipping live product. Early settlers perceived abundant lobsters more as a local food source, as livestock feed, crop fertilizer or bait. During the eighteenth century, when the rebellious colonists were calling the red-coated British soldiers 'lobsters' and their ships 'lobster boxes', the fishermen in the regions of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New York delivered live bugs in well boats to the urban centres of New York City and Boston. When these men could not meet the public demand, often because of overfishing, they sailed farther east, into the cold, productive, unspoiled waters of Maine. Here they set their traps, beginning around the 1820s. Just like the Norwegians toward the Dutch, the fishermen in Maine soon realized they could do the lobstering themselves, so they restricted this fishing to Mainers and began sailing their own vessels to deliver _their_ bugs to the cities.

When canning technology, first invented and perfected in France and Scotland, arrived to the region in the 1840s, the game changed completely. Here was a shipment and preservation solution, able to expand both market and demand. Historians Martin and Lipfert point out: 'It is a measure of _Homarus americanus_ 's reputation among gourmets that it was one of the first items canned commercially in the United States.' The Lobster Rush was on.

H. W. Elliott and Capt. J. W. Collins, 'Lobster fishing-boats of Bristol, Maine', 1887. This type of craft, known as a smack, often had flow-through wells to enable it to travel significant distances or several days to market with the lobsters kept alive. |

---|---

  | W. K. Lewis, _c_. 1860s, made his fortune canning lobsters and other foods, beginning with his first factory on Isle au Haut, Maine. By 1883 the firm of W. K. Lewis & Brothers owned fifteen canneries in Maine and the Maritimes.

---|---

Canning overtook the live market and dozens of canneries sprouted up along the coast. By 1880 there were 23 active canneries in the state of Maine, the majority built exclusively for lobster. Steamships carried about half of the canned Maine lobster and nearly all of the Canadian meat back to Europe, whose own lobster fisheries were much smaller due to oceanographic limitations and the fatigue of centuries of human impact.

The Canadians were a bit slower to capitalize on the international value of lobster, but the fishery moved inevitably eastward. The lobster stocks around their coastline, according to a major government report, 'need only be restricted by the demand, for the supply is almost unlimited'. In 1881 an English visitor named John Rowan observed with amazement that 'lobster spearing' was a sport in Halifax and that little boys collected hundreds with hooks and sticks off the shore. Rowan described farmers in New Brunswick fertilizing acres of potato fields with lobsters gathered from the beach after a gale. He wrote: 'To give some idea of the little value put upon lobsters by the country people, I may mention that on some parts of the coast they boil them for their pigs, but are ashamed to be seen eating lobsters themselves. Lobster shells about a house are looked upon as signs of poverty and degradation.' There are accounts that fishermen bound for groundfish off the Grand Banks loaded their hold with lobsters to chop into pieces and stick on their hooks. Rowan anticipated that the Canadian lobster would be a high value export: 'Is it unreasonable to expect that sooner or later some ingenious persons will turn these Nova Scotian lobsters into British gold?'

The lobster canning industry spread further into Atlantic Canada. According to Farley Mowat, in 1873 there was one factory all the way north in Newfoundland. Just fifteen years later 26 small canneries were boiling along, contracting over 1,000 fishermen and filling some 3 million 1 lb (450 g) cans of _picked_ meat. Canneries used only the claws and tails, tossing or composting the remains. In 1881 W. H. Bishop observed at a cannery: 'The scarlet hue is seen in all quarters–on the steaming stretcher, in the great heaps on the tables, in scattered individuals on the floor, in a large pile of shells and refuse seen through the open door, and in an ox-cart-load of the same refuse, farther off, which is being taken away for use as a fertilizer.'

The Lobster Rush around the Gulfs of Maine and St Lawrence reached its peak in the late nineteenth century. Canadians averaged over 41 million kg (90 million lb) of lobster landed annually in the late 1890s, a harvest bonanza that they would not achieve again for nearly a century. As more men had been entering the business full-time, lobstering required more traps and more effort to gather continually smaller and smaller lobsters to fill the tins.

It is worth emphasizing here, however, that this nineteenth-century depletion of American lobster stocks, as had occurred earlier in northern Europe with _Homarus gammarus_ , seems to be a result of intense effort and lack of regulation, _not_ advanced technology. The regular use of the internal combustion engine and even the motorized trap hauler was still decades away.

Meanwhile concern for the lobster population consistently grew louder during the Lobster Rush, as voiced in two major, separate reports by the Canadians and the Americans in 1873 and 1887. As European countries had done, American states and the Canadians began to pass a series of conservation laws, but they were not easily regulated or nearly effective enough. In 1905 naturalist Alfred Goldsborough Mayer admonished: 'Unless wise laws are soon enforced for their protection the ruthless persecution to which the lobsters have been subjected will practically exterminate them, in so far as commerce is concerned.' More humorously and perhaps indicative of public concern, Holman F. Day published a poem in 1900 titled 'Good-by Lobster', which ends with this verse:

I see, and sigh in seeing, in some distant, future age

Your varnished shell reposing under glass upon a stage,

The while some pundit lectures on the curios of the past,

And dainty ladies shudder as they gaze on you aghast.

And all the folks that listen will wonder vaguely at

The fact that once lived heathen who could eat a Thing like that.

Ah, that's the fate you're facing – but laments are all in vain

– Tell the dodo that you saw us when you lived down here in Maine.

In 1915 our lobster expert Francis Herrick stood before the committee on fisheries in the Maine state legislature. He sounded the alarm of still worse times to come and argued for a maximum size limit to protect large females and all the eggs they produce. Herrick declared: 'The conservation of the lobster fishery is a purely economic problem, and if we strive to solve it upon the grounds of political bias or personal gain, we shall assuredly fail.'

At least in terms of recorded landings, lobster populations in North America stabilized as regulations were added and enforced, but did not approach the tonnage of the nineteenth century. It was not until the 1940s that lobster landings increased significantly again, then absolutely exploded in the late 1980s. No one knows the exact cause for this unprecedented rise, seen in no other lobster fishery – or barely _any_ fishery – but theories abound. Anne Hayden and Philip Conkling, frequent writers on the marine policy of the area, wrote: 'There's a saying in the region: ask two lobstermen why there are so many lobsters in [Penobscot Bay], and you get three different answers.' The same could be said for biologists. And policy makers.

Hayden co-authors a column for _National Fisherman_ and has been involved in local fisheries issues for over twenty years. She told me: 'I've been accused of being obsessed with lobsters. But mostly by my family who are sick of hearing about them – though not sick of eating them for dinner.' Hayden explains that landings do not always indicate the health of a population, but there are a variety of theories beyond an increase of effort as to why the lobster catches have skyrocketed in the Gulf of Maine. Predation by groundfish, such as cod and haddock, decreased due to overfishing of those species. In some areas a vigorous urchin fishery, fuelled by Japanese demand, cleared the sea floor of these herbivores, allowing an increased growth of coastal seaweeds, which gave more safe habitat for moulting lobsters. Subtle changes in water temperature and currents might have favoured reproduction. There may be an 'aquaculture effect', in which there are simply so many lobster traps in the water that the lobsters are actually being raised and fed until they get to legal size. In addition the coast of Maine and the Maritimes, in contrast to that of Long Island Sound and parts of Europe, has been less developed by industry and residential construction. Their waters are cleaner. Yet none of these arguments alone can explain it all. Hayden says that even the biological premise for shaping policy – the most basic logic that the more eggs there are in the water, the more lobsters there will be – doesn't receive much credence any more.

Conservation and enforcement measures put in place seem to have helped, but state officials and the Coast Guard are unable to patrol every harbour and cannot, for example, make sure every fisherman isn't picking the meat from 'shorts' or scrubbing the eggs off legal-sized females. What seems to be different in Maine, for example, in comparison to the lobster industry in Long Island Sound or that of Brazil, has been voiced by anthropologist and economist Jim Acheson, who writes that regulations have not only been accepted and formed by local lobstermen, they are _enforced_ by them. This lobster fishery has climbed out of a get-all-the-bugs-before-the-other-guy-does mentality, a 'tragedy of the commons' scenario. Those that do not observe the local rules are punished by their peers. It works, but it can get violent at times. In the summer of 2009 lobster-men sunk three of their competitors' boats at the dock in Owl's Head Harbor. Out on remote Matinicus Island, one lobsterman shot another in the neck, in part over territory. The man lived. Months later the lobsterman with the gun was acquitted with a self-defence plea.

Meanwhile, as the landings of _Homarus americanus_ have steadily increased, scientists and environmentalists have consistently predicted a devastating crash. In 1973 Luis Marden in _National Geographic_ worried that 'this delectable gift from the sea is in danger of disappearing, not from the bed of the ocean, perhaps, but quite possibly from our tables'. Steven Murawski, a biologist at the National Marine Fisheries Service, said in 1988 that 'there's no way in God's green earth that these catches could be sustainable'. The Monterey Bay Aquarium's 'Seafood Watch' guide, one created specifically for the North-east of the United States, does not even list American lobsters as one of their 'best choices' in 2010, recommending instead spiny lobsters flown in from Florida or California. They list _Homarus_ _americanus_ only as a 'good alternative'. Ironically, they use an illustration of the American lobster on the cover of this guide. (One concern of theirs is the threat of lobster gear to severely endangered whales.)

If anything there are actually _too many_ lobsters in the waters of Maine and the Maritimes, at least in terms of the market. Canadians have invested a great deal in developing the ability to process lobsters: frozen tails and a whole range of products. These Canadian companies buy up the lobster caught by Canadian and American fishermen when they can't sell it in their local markets, then the companies store it in sprawling facilities. The Canadian companies sell their processed lobster all year round to the US, Europe and Asia. They supply casinos, cruise ships and seafood chain restaurants such as Red Lobster. They have even found a pharmaceutical and biomedical demand for the vast numbers of previously discarded shells, which includes use in wound-care products and surgical drapes.

Canadian fishermen consistently catch millions more bugs than US lobstermen. The 'Maine' lobsters shipped around the world are often from Canadian fishermen, and when you order lobster tails, lobster linguini or lobster sushi at a restaurant, whether in London, Moscow, Chicago or Tokyo, you might very well be getting spiny or slipper lobster meat – which, to most palates, is by no means inferior – though to others, notably Alexandre Dumas in 1870, 'the spiny lobster is not so finely flavoured and not so highly prized'.

Just as sailing vessels once opened up markets for Norwegian lobstermen and canning once opened up markets for trap fishermen in Nova Scotia, freezing technology and air shipping has probably done more to affect world lobster populations and lobster fisheries than any advancement in fishing gear or strategy of management. The ability to freeze and ship to match international demand expanded trade for fishermen in areas rich in spiny lobsters, such as Western Australia and Brazil, allowing them to compete with clawed lobster fishermen. High prices from tourists and the opportunity to sell to lucrative foreign markets encouraged small artisan spiny and slipper lobster fishermen in remote areas in the Caribbean and across the southern hemisphere to fish once pristine coastlines all too thoroughly. Some of these newer fisheries are in it for the long haul, however, hoping not to replicate historical boom and bust patterns. The spiny fishery off New Zealand (mostly _Jasus edwardsii_ ), for example, has a progressive individual transferable quota system that seems to be working well in terms of both stocks and fishermen's profit.

To illustrate the global nature of the lobster as a luxury international commodity, I can tell you that I recently went to Pike's Place Market in Seattle on a Sunday morning in February. Displayed in ice in front of the men throwing salmon were four gigantic spiny lobster tails. 'We get them from all over', the fishmonger said. 'These? Just came in this morning. From the Dominican Republic. We make a killing before Valentine's Day. All the guys want to impress their dates. "Lobster", they say. "Get me some lobster!"'

## 5 To Boil or Not to Boil

Arrange your lobster meat in the shape of a crown on a platter. Put the tomatoes on top, and between them pour the lobster butter you have just made. Glaze with sauce (step 4) and serve. Since this dish is a trifle complicated, a novice should not attempt it. It takes quite a cook to tackle it.

Alexandre Dumas, 1870

Rockland, Maine, proclaims itself 'The Lobster Capital of the World'. It is the largest town and primary port of lower Penobscot Bay, the centre of the lobster fishery in the United States. All across the bay and around its islands brightly coloured lobster buoys dot the surface in mesmerizing densities. Flying over the area in a small plane on a summer day it's as if hundreds of thousands of candies were strewn across the water from the smashing of a zeppelin-sized piñata.

Every year since 1948 supply and demand come together in mid-coast for a whirling crimson party: the Maine Lobster Festival. Lasting five days in 2009 the festival hosted approximately 75,000 visitors and boiled some 8,850 kg (19,500 lb) of lobster. There are at least a dozen other lobster festivals of various sizes and angles around the USA – from Redondo Beach, California, to Panama City Beach, Florida. Both Boston and Reno have staged competitions for the speed eating of lobster. Sonya Thomas holds the current record after she downed in twelve minutes 44 American lobsters – over 5 kg (11.3 lb) of meat – at a contest in Kennebunk, Maine. On the Fourth of July in Bar Harbor, Maine, people gather to watch lobsters with names such as 'Butters' and 'Suppa' race in lanes filled with seawater. Bar Harbor got the idea from a similar event in South Carolina.

Half a dozen lobster festivals run every year in the Canadian Maritimes, too, including the 'Lobsterpalooza Feastival' in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. The town of Shediac, New Brunswick, which refers to _itself_ as the 'Lobster Capital of the World', also hosts a festival. Nova Scotia declared 2009 the 'Year of the Lobster', and their Shelburne County Lobster Festival is in the region that more humbly calls itself the 'Lobster Capital of Canada'. One year the Shelburne festival featured at separate events: creamed lobsters, boiled lobsters, lobster burgers and lobster chowder. Their logo is a cartoon of a lobster in a chef's hat with a fork standing beside a terrified man in a pot of boiling water.

Yet somehow, despite these somewhat low-brow lobster hullabaloos, we, worldwide, continue to perceive the lobster as a high-end, luxury food: to be eaten on special occasions and as an experience worth travelling for. Is lobster genuinely that delicious, or are other historical, sociological and psychological factors at work?

A story is often told that early American indentured servants or slaves protested against being served lobsters too often, that they demanded various laws limiting this diet. There are indeed narratives describing lobster as so plentiful that it's not highly valued, such as the nineteenth-century account of the Canadian Maritimes by John Rowan. In 1623 William Bradford wrote that the first settlers of the Plymouth Colony could only serve newcomers 'lobster, or a peece of fish', with no bread or anything else but water. Another early seventeenth-century account by William Wood declared that lobsters are 'very good fish, the small ones being the best; their plenty makes them little esteemed and seldom eaten'. Yet Wood also called the lobsters 'luscious' in another section of his account. Regardless, these 'please-no-more-lobster' laws or a sense that this was _only_ peasants' food – because lobster was also used for bait and fertilizer – seem greatly exaggerated, if not apocryphal. Food historian Sandy Oliver wrote that she has neither found nor heard of a single primary document of one of these complaints or ordinances against eating lobster. She told me: 'I have been pounding away at this lobster question for the longest time. You'd be pretty surprised at the violence of the reactions I get. People love this myth.' Oliver summarized lobster as a food in early New England: 'Like the oyster, the lobster had a dual identity as a luxury food in cities and inland where it was not native, and as a food for all classes, including poor fishermen, along the coast.' In 1887, at the height of the canning era, Richard Rathbun wrote in his government report:

Canned lobster label, Portland [Maine] Packing Company, _c._ 1867. Under 'Bay Lobster' the label says: 'This favorite Crustacea has become so important an article of food, that a statement of the best methods of preparing it for the table will be useful. Many prefer it cold, just as taken from the Can, it having been boiled before sealing'. The label goes on to give directions for preparing 'Lobster Curry', 'Balls', 'Salad', and 'A La Creme'.

> On the sea coasts where [lobsters] occur, except in the vicinity of large towns and cities, they are not generally much, if any, more expensive than the common fish of the same region, and they are, therefore, quite extensively eaten by all classes, and many of the fishermen and others also catch them for their own use. Away from the sea-shore, and even in many of the larger markets located near good fishing-grounds, the prices are generally much higher, placing this class of food beyond the reach of the poorer people, and often raising it to the rank of a luxury.

Of course, just as the pizza chef has difficulty eating his own pie, not all fishermen salivate at the thought of a lobster dinner. Thomas Fairfax, a nineteenth-century lobster smack captain, said: 'Lobsters are very good as an article of commerce, and pretty enough to look at, after they're b'iled; but, as to eating them, I prefer castoff rubber shoes.' More recently, a man named George Hoag from inland Maine said: 'If them tourists want to come up from Boston and pay them prices, then, by Christ, let 'em. Damn fools. Lobsters, hell, they're big cockroaches, that's what they are. You ain't gonna catch me eatin' one, even if I could afford the damn thing.'

Yet for every Captain Fairfax and George Hoag there are thousands of people who drool over the prospect of lobster as food, who adore a quiet evening at the edge of a dock eating fresh lobsters with family and friends, or have a blast at a bustling, buttery lobster festival. Accounts abound of people positively adoring the firm, salty-but-not- _too_ -fishy flesh of lobsters, along with the process of eating them out of the shell. Robert Blakey, a nineteenth-century British professor, hyperbolized:

> Only think of Adam and his immediate descendants regaling themselves on boiled lobsters, or indulging in the stimulating properties of its various forms of sauces! Who knows the part lobsters may have taken in the roystering and Bacchanalian revelries among the citizens of the Plain – how many convivial spirits were wont to gather in the evenings around its savoury fumes preparatory for whetting the appetite for more varied and sensual indulgences, ere their gluttony and other sins consigned them to Divine chastisement? Speculations crowd on the mind, in all shapes and forms, when we think of the lobster feasts before the Flood.

The Greeks and Romans seemed to have enjoyed eating lobster. The Roman chef and author, Apicius, was reportedly so fond of slipper lobsters that once he heard about their size and excellence on the coast of Tunisia he mounted an expedition to sample them for himself. Apicius wrote of recipes for boiled and roasted lobster, including one with a sauce made from 'pepper, cumin, rue, honey, vinegar, fish stock, and olive oil'.

Though it seems shellfish fell out of favour for a good part of the Middle Ages, food historian Terence Scully explained that European nobles and affluent townspeople ate and could afford lobster. The Vatican's fifteenth-century recipe book of the master cook to King Charles V includes a few mentions of lobster, such as directions for preparing _Gravé de d'escrevisses_ , which seems to have been for either the clawed or spiny species. This _gravé_ is a thick, spiced sauce made of lobster, which is then poured over fried chunks of lobster meat. Another mediaeval recipe book recommended that when preparing rissoles one could substitute lobster for meat on days when the Church required it to be a 'lean-day'.

Lobster was a small but present feature of the diet in England's Early Modern period. Robert May included over a dozen lobster recipes in his 1678 edition of _The Accomplisht Cook_. He wrote directions for stewing lobster in wine, mincing with eels, marinating, roasting on a spit, broiling and jellying lobsters, as well as how to 'boil Lobsters to eat cold the common way' and how to 'keep Lobsters a quarter of a year very good', by wrapping the cooked corpses in brine-soaked rags and burying them in sand down in the cellar. The poet Alexander Pope used lobster to evoke decadent times in his poem 'A Farewell to London in the Year 1715'. He wrote of he and his colleagues' rakish excesses in the city: 'Luxurious lobster-nights, farewell,/For sober, studious days.'

Hannah Glasse's popular _The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy_ (first London edition 1747), had half a dozen recipes for lobsters and lobster roe, including lobster in fish sauce and lobster pie. Glasse recommended that when at the market: 'Chuse them by their weight; the heaviest are best, if no water be in them [;] if new, the tail will pull smart, like a spring.' _The Compleat Housewife_ ( _c_. 1729) also gives a few lobster recipes, including one for pickling, one for 'potting' a dozen boiled lobsters in butter and spices so the meat will keep for a month or more and a recipe for roasting: 'Tie your lobsters to the spit alive, baste them with water and salt till they look very red.' This also from _The Compleat Housewife_ :

> _To butter Crabs or Lobsters_.
> 
> YOUR crabs and lobsters being boiled and cold, take all the meat out of the shells and body, break the claws, and take out all their meat, mince it small, and put it altogether, adding to it two or three spoonfuls of claret, a very little vinegar, a nutmeg grated; let it boil up till it is thorough hot; then put in some butter melted, with some anchovies and gravy, and thicken with the yolks of an egg or two; when it is very hot put it in the large shell, and stick it with toasts.

In the nineteenth century, with the introduction of canning and improved transportation methods, lobster became a more accessible dish. Live lobsters were still cooked and served, but recipes now regularly involved picked lobster meat and often recommended it served cold in lobster salads.

Charles Dickens wrote often about Victorian food, including lobster. In _David Copperfield_ (1850), for example, the honourable Peggotty family on the coast 'dealt in lobsters, crabs, and crawfish', and they bring David two 'prodigious' lobsters, among other shellfish, as a gift when visiting him at school. Later David is jealous of a suitor offering a picnic meal of lobster to his beloved Dora, and when Traddles tells of living well in London he speaks of simply picking up a lobster on the way home from the theatre. In an edition of Dickens's periodical _Household Words_ an article explains how to make a proper lobster salad for a supper-party. Lobster salad is presented as a normal dish, almost obligatory for a ball supper that is 'good, economical, and easily prepared'. The author suggests fresh-picked meat mixed with hard-boiled egg yolks to be piled high atop 'perfectly dry' lettuce, with a creamy dressing or mayonnaise sauce. In another issue of _Household Words_ , a writer gives this recipe, intended in part for the middle-class reader:

> POTATO CASE WITH LOBSTER
> 
> Steam and mash up a pound of potatoes very smooth and dry. Add to this the yolks of two eggs, work over the fire in a stew-pan until dry, then mould in the same manner as a pork-pie crust, brush it over with yolk of egg, and bake until nicely coloured. With a quarter of a pint of white sauce mix half a teaspoonful of essence of anchovy and one of lemon juice, stir into it half a tin of preserved lobster, and let it stand by the side of the fire to get hot, but do not let it boil. Fresh lobster can be used, of course, but is more expensive. When ready, pour the lobster with its sauce, which should be thick, into the case and serve.

Dickens's wife, Catherine, also wrote of lobsters in her _What Shall We Have for Dinner?_ (1851). She advocated lobster prepared in several different ways, even for the same party. She suggested lobster cutlets, fillets, lobster salad, lobster curry and diced claw meat to add to a seafood filling for puff-pastry.

Dozens of recipes and menus with lobster in all sorts of forms appeared in other Victorian cookbooks and in restaurants on both sides of the Atlantic. Authors such as Eliza Acton and Mrs D. A. Lincoln, in various editions, explained preparations for lobster patties, salads, sausages, lobsters in soups, chowders, bisques and lobsters sautéed in butter with a little flour, chilivinegar and nutmeg, then served in the shell. They recommended the use of the eggs, the 'coral', for a variety of sauces, and wrote about how to make devilled lobster, 'Indian lobster-cutlets' and lobster fricasseed. A menu for Keeler's European Hotel in inland Albany, New York, for example, had in March of 1897 an image of a lobster at the top of the menu, even though they offered twice as many oyster dishes. The entrees included lobsters 'Plain Boiled' and 'Extra Plain Boiled', lobsters broiled alive, lobster croquettes with peas, and 'Patties a la Keeler'.

  | 'Dressed Lobster' in Acton's _Modern Cookery_ (1868). Acton explains: 'Before a lobster is sent to table take off the large claws, hold each of them firmly with the edge upwards, and with a quick light blow from a cutlet bat or ought else convenient for the purpose, crack the shell without disfiguring the fish. Split the tail open with a very sharp knife and dish the lobster in the manner shown in the engraving, either with, or without a napkin under it'.

As overfishing and over-canning began depleting the stocks of lobster, the price went up accordingly. It became difficult for a family to buy lobster if living away from the coast, and thus its status rose as a luxury food. An author in 1905 wrote: 'With lobsters at 30 cents a pound they are quite beyond my reach; and all I can do is dream of the time when they sold for 5, and we had all the lobsters we could eat.'

Since then lobster has remained a food symbolic of the prosperous and served primarily on special occasions. This is reflected nicely in the 2005 film _Brooklyn Lobster_ in which a New York family struggles to keep its lobster pound and sea-food market from being bought out. Here lobsters are a direct metaphor for money. The film opens with the pound's loss of saltwater circulation, so all of the lobsters, ready for the Christmas rush, are in danger of dying. Keeping the lobsters alive throughout the film parallels the family's struggle to save the business. The owner, Frank Giorgio (Danny Aiello), identifies personally with the pugnacity of these animals but, more importantly, lobsters are his livelihood. One of his employees calls the boxes of lobsters 'crates of cash'. The wealthy WASP characters in the movie eat lobsters loudly, almost grotesquely, while wearing plastic bibs over formal clothes – ties, blue blazers, pearls – and speak rowdily about it as a special food. One rich, duplicitous character shouts multiple times: 'Bring me a big f—ing lobster!' The film shows several close-ups of lobsters, but the first one of a cooked bug, a bright red full-screen image of a lobster boiling in a pot, is held just after the family gets the news that their business has been saved. The Giorgio family rarely eats lobsters but in the end, when they do, it is at their Christmas and celebration dinner. Notably, this bluecollar family, their employees and their friends do not wear bibs at their civilized, joyous feast.

Sexual connotations have regularly been stirred in with the lobster's status as expensive, decadent fare. Each year the Maine Lobster Festival crowns a pretty young local woman as the Maine Sea Goddess. She sits centre stage in a throne with a large green claw over each shoulder. Allegedly Alexander the Great so craved lobsters that the members of his court needed this food, either whole or as a sauce, to 'allay his periodical paroxysms of passion'. In 1620 Dr Tobias Venner, in his _Via Recta ad Vitam Longam_ , believed lobster to be an aphrodisiac. He advised that it 'giveth much good and firme nourishment' but one should be careful because lobster 'maketh a great propensitie unto venereall embracements'. Venner's views might have just been due to the food's expense and rarity – as might be true today.

This association of lobster with lust and sexual activity seems to have carried on through the centuries. John Smith wrote in 'A Rhapsody upon a Lobster' (1713):

The Lusty Food helps Female Neighbours,

Promotes their Husband's, and their Labours;

And in return much Work supplies

For that Bright Midwife of the Skies.

Lobster with _Cavear_ in fit Places,

Gives won'drous Help in barren Cases;

It warms the chiller Veins, and proves

A kind Incentive to our Loves;

It is a Philter, and High Diet,

That lets no Lady sleep in Quiet.

A few years later poet John Gay composed 'To a Young Lady', in which the narrator sends a gift of an aphrodisiac (a lamprey) to a maid he is courting. An aunt explains to the young woman that the man is trying to seduce her. In explaining these types of foods, she says: 'If I eat lobster, 'tis so warming,/That every man I see looks charming'. The narrator ends:

In this, I own, your aunt is clear;

I sent you what I well might spare:

For when I see you, (without joking,)

Your eyes, lips, breasts, are so provoking;

They set my heart more cock-a-hoop,

Than could whole seas of cray-fish soup.

Chef Jasper White explained the lobster's allure this way: 'It is the briny-sweet taste of the sea, where all life began, that is so intensely satisfying and sensually stimulating.' Beyond the often feminine ascriptions to the ocean and _her_ creatures, there is also perhaps something sexual going on visually, subconsciously, with the bright red at the table, as a food, as a quencher of carnal appetite: think red heart, Valentine's Day, red silk sheets, women in red dresses, lips, nipples and so forth. Lord Byron, though surely no exemplar, wrote in a letter that 'a woman should never be seen eating or drinking, unless it be _lobster sallad & Champagne_, the only truly feminine & becoming viands'.

In the early decades of the twentieth century New York restaurant owners created luxurious establishments with elaborate interiors called 'lobster palaces'. Around Times Square and Broadway these palaces served champagne and lobster late at night, after the theatre. Lobster was especially expensive, and here wealthy society could mingle with showgirls and the theatre crowd, the rich and the famous. The palaces were sensual, highpublicity restaurants that winked at covert trysts and men's parties in private rooms. Historian Lewis Erenberg wrote: 'The lobster palaces, as they were called because of their gilded interiors and gay late-night lobster suppers, merchandised an opulent experience of material pleasure and hoped-for naughtiness.' Around this time an older wealthy man with a young attractive woman on his arm, whom we might call a 'sugar daddy' today, was known as 'a lobster'.

A lobster dinner paired with sex is common in contemporary popular culture, too. As film-critic and oceanographer Andrew Fisher has pointed out, the scene in _Flashdance_ (1983), where the young dancer (Jennifer Beals) salaciously sucks on lobster meat while she moves her foot under the table to stroke the crotch of her date, perhaps inspired a similar scene in the romantic comedy _Splash_ , released the following year. In _Splash_ the sexually uninhibited mermaid (Daryl Hannah) lustily eats her lobster right through the shell, crunching as Allen (Tom Hanks) tries to propose marriage to her at a fancy restaurant. As the formal guests in suits and sparkling gowns steal glances, she says: 'That's how we eat lobster where I come from.'

The erotic, sadistic pun here is that a 'lobster' at this time was a name for an older, wealthy man – a high roller – who wined and dined showgirls, often with a lobster dinner.

Daryl Hannah in _Splash_ (dir. Ron Howard, 1984) is a sexy mermaid who, unaware of cultural norms 'on land', crunches straight into the shell of a lobster at a fancy dinner. |

An ideal example is in a pulp novel by Shirley Jump titled _The Angel Craved Lobster_ (2005) in which a young woman named Meredith moves to Boston from a small farming town in Indiana. She wants to lose her virginity with a variety of new experiences, but she falls in love instead. By the end of the novel, the man, who won't indulge her lust because she is too special, proposes marriage to her over the lobster dinner that he'd been promising for most of the story. The novel includes seafood recipes throughout, narrated by different characters. As we reach the climax of the book (loss of virginity and engagement), Jump writes, slathered with double entendre:

Meredith's When-the-Mood-Is-Right Lobster Stew

3 tablespoons butter

1 pound lobster meat

1 cup heavy cream

3 cups milk

1/2 teaspoon salt

1/4 teaspoon white pepper

Paprika

> Pull out all the stops now with the most decadent dish you can create. This one is rich . . . in everything you've been denying yourself. Melt the butter and fry the lobster meat until it's warm and heated through. Add the cream and milk, gradually, stirring it carefully over low to medium-low heat. Don't rush it! The end result will be worth every second you put into it. Season with salt and pepper, then let this simmer gently for about 15 to 20 minutes. Sprinkle a little paprika on top. Since this dish is so indulgent, be careful who you serve it to. He might just come back for seconds. And thirds. And . . . _more_.

Lobster as a food is unique due to a combination of factors. It remains a meal for the wealthy or something special for someone of average means. Away from the ocean lobster might be considered as indulgent as caviar or filet mignon. Clawed lobster has been a regular dish at the White House – a reminder that it is one of the few dishes that North America can claim as superior to other parts of the world, and geographically privileged for its larger specimens. A few lobster recipes cooked at five-star restaurants are so famous that you probably recognize them by name, such as Lobster Newburg, Lobster Thermidor and Lobster Fra Diavolo. Even today in Rockland, Maine, in August, a take-out lobster roll costs four times more than a large fully stacked cheeseburger in a fast food restaurant (a fact infuriating and befuddling to most lobstermen getting very little from the wholesaler). The shell of a cooked lobster is colourful and adds serious pizzazz to any table. Lobster is caught wild and does better than nearly all other fisheries from most environmentalists' perspectives. It is a nutritious food, at least excluding the melted butter. The approximately 100 gm (3.5 oz) of meat you get from a 450 gm (1 lb) lobster has fewer than 100 calories, and it has less cholesterol and fat than the same amount of skinless chicken or turkey breast. Lobster meat also comes with a nice portion of omega-3 acids, which are commended these days as good for our hearts. Lobster has been called 'the _ultimate_ white meat'.

When you're presented with a whole bug, however, this food is cumbersome and messy. Lobster 'in the rough' is an event. Lobster is also one of the few animals in most modern homes that is purchased alive – with two eyes and with two claws unavoidably likened to human hands. The live lobster in the kitchen or cooked on the plate is a final vestige of what it is like to butcher or kill our own food. Other than crabs, Louisiana crawfish and a few small fish species, nearly all other animal foods are cooked and cleaned, headless and limbless, before most diners in developed countries ever see them in the market or on their plate. Lobster as a food is therefore fraught with contemporary ethical dilemmas.

The belief that boiling a lobster alive for best taste and safety goes back to the ancient Romans. In the fifteenth century, Platina wrote: 'This animal alone does not have good flesh unless it is cooked alive in boiling water.' This has carried into modern times, as exemplified by French author and chef Dr Edouard de Pomiane who remembered in the 1930s how plentiful and cheap the clawed ( _homard_ ) and spiny ( _langouste_ ) lobsters once were off the coast of Brittany. He ate them every day and prepared them differently each time. He believed that boiling the lobster alive was best – 'one must admit that no complicated method of preparation is half as good as fresh-caught lobster simply boiled in sea water, cooled and served with mayonnaise' – yet he took the time in his instructions to tell you to 'plunge the live lobster into fast-boiling water so that its sufferings shall be as brief as possible'. A dish like 'Homard à l'Américaine', which he thought too rich because it drowns out the taste of the lobster, requires the animal to be cut into pieces while still alive. Pomiane directed you to plunge a sharp knife in the lobster's head, which he believed kills it instantly.

Woody Allen in _Annie Hall_ (dir. Allen, 1977) shows how the inability to face cooking a lobster alive can stand for a lack of masculinity. |

Yet the boiling of the lobster alive has been a preoccupation of modern eaters, as evidenced by the joke gifts sold in Rockland or some of the floats and costumes at the festival's parade. Author David Foster Wallace gave a characteristically cerebral and cynical account of the Maine Lobster Festival in a 2004 issue of _Gourmet_. He comments on how a western beef festival would never include any giant slaughterhouse floor or anything the equivalent of the 'World's Largest Lobster Cooker', where you can watch your dinner steamed alive – perhaps, as Wallace put it, like some sort of 'Roman circus or medieval torture-fest'.

Films such as _Annie Hall_ (1977) and _Julie & Julia_ (2009) both feature scenes of frantic, comic attempts to get over the fear of putting living lobsters into a pot at home. These two movies include the killing of lobster as related to gender roles. In _Annie Hall_ the first scene of a young couple having fun together is at a beach house, trying to put the lobsters in the pot after they have escaped the bag and are crawling over the kitchen floor. Annie (Diane Keaton) is the first one who eventually handles the lobster, but Alvy (Woody Allen) actually drops it in the boiling water. Later in the film the scene is replicated with another girlfriend but here the woman mocks Alvy for not being able to boil it without a fuss: 'They're only lobsters. Look, you're a grown man, you know how to pick up a lobster.' The scene in _Julie & Julia_, based on a chapter titled 'They Shoot Lobsters, Don't They?' in Julie Powell's memoir of the same name, has Julie's husband (Chris Messina) come into the kitchen to rescue her while she whimpers, frightened, in the living room. The lobsters in their death throes had literally flung off the lid. The husband slams the lid back on, holding it there proudly. In contrast, during another scene in the film, Julia Child (Meryl Streep) first proves herself in France by unabashedly cleaving a live _homard_ while the male culinary students cower behind her. One telling difference between these two films is actually in the credits, because the latter ends with a mention of the American Humane Association. In turns out that although many lobsters were sacrificed to make the lobster dishes for other scenes in the movie, AHA members monitored the filming of the boiling alive scene in _Julie & Julia_. The lobsters weren't actually dropped into a killer pot. It was a cool mist that supplied the 'steam'.

The concern with the morality of boiling a lobster alive goes back to at least the nineteenth century in Western culture, as exemplified by Baron Bolland's parodic poem 'The Negro's Dying Blush' (1835) and the writings of the humanitarians at the turn of the twentieth century who debated as to whether or not the lobster feels a level of pain that we as supposedly sensitive, caring people should avoid. The dilemma can become a question more for philosophers than scientists, although several experts claim a kinder method of killing a lobster. Dozens of scientific experiments have been conducted since about 1915, if not earlier. The studies almost all involve killing a bunch of lobsters in different ways – often comparing boiling to variations of chopping, freezing, saltwater immersion and/or slow boiling from cold water – and then monitoring the doomed lobsters' responses in ever more complex methods. After killing some 54 lobsters in four different ways, marine biologist Elizabeth Murray of Oxford concluded in 1962: 'From the point of view of kindness to the lobster, it is hard to say which is the best method of killing, because it is impossible, and probably will always be impossible, to say whether the lobster is suffering pain or not. Therefore, to give the animal the benefit of the doubt, the quickest methods are probably the best.' Is the real question, to be honest with ourselves, not _how_ it is done, but more, _if_ we should kill the animal at all? Which plunges us briskly into much larger questions of ranking animals, vegetarianism and animal rights.

In Wallace's article, titled 'Consider the Lobster', he goes back and forth about the issue. He considers how cruelly other animals are treated for our food, the neuroscience involved with pain and the lobster's nervous system, the very definition of pain, the inconvenience of even having to consider that what he's doing is ethically wrong and trying to resolve for himself the ever-contradictory remarks by all sides. Each year representatives from the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) protest at the Maine Lobster Festival. He wrote that he heard a woman once got half-naked and painted herself like a lobster to call attention to the injustice. Wallace arrived here:

> Suffice to say that both the scientific and the philosophical arguments on either side of the animal-suffering issue are involved, abstruse, technical, often informed by self-interest or ideology, and in the end so totally inconclusive that as a practical matter, in the kitchen or the restaurant, it all still seems to come down to individual conscience, going with (no pun) your gut.

## 6 Lobster Tales

Among the rock ledges, eels and cunners forage greedily, while the lobster feels his way with nimble wariness through the perpetual twilight.

Rachel Carson, 1937

Once there was a Hawaiian boy named Pu-nia who lived on the Big Island alone with his mother. His father had been eaten by Kaiale-ale, the King of the Sharks, while diving for lobsters. Kai-aleale and ten other sharks voraciously guarded a special cave where the prized animals lived. Since his father's death, the boy often heard his mother pine for some lobster to go with their potatoes. So one morning Pu-nia decided _he_ would catch lobster for her.

Pu-nia stood at the edge of the sea. Pretending he did not know the sharks were awake and could hear him, he said: 'Here am I, Pu-nia, and I am going into the cave to get lobsters for myself and my mother. That great shark, Kai-ale-ale, is asleep now, and I can dive to the point over there, and then go into the cave; I will take two lobsters in my hands, and my mother and I will have something to eat with our sweet potatoes.' Pu-nia took a rock and threw it toward the point where he said he was planning to dive. All of the sharks frenzied around the splash, foaming and bubbling the sea, while Pu-nia dived in from another point, swimming down past the corals and the colours of the reef and down into the dark cave. With his bare hands the boy collected two heavy lobsters in the dim light. He knew how to seize the animals and hold them so the spines didn't make him bleed. Then he swam back to the surface and climbed onto the shore before the sharks realized they'd been tricked.

In Juliette May Fraser's 1924 illustration to a traditional Hawaiian story, the lobster is the prize for a heroic, death-defying young fisherman.

Now in the sun, Pu-nia admired his two lobsters – their glistening white stripes and spots and the bright orange at the base of their antennae. Pu-nia spoke directly to Kai-ale-ale. 'It was the one with the thin tail, that showed Pu-nia what to do.' While the boy brought the prize back to his mother, the King of the Sharks found the traitor with the thinnest tail and had him killed and eaten.

Pu-nia and his mother feasted. When they were hungry again, the boy returned and played the same trick. He tossed a rock in a different direction, swam down to the cave, grabbed two lobsters and was back ashore before the sharks realized what happened. This time the boy told Kai-ale-ale: 'It was the one with the big stomach that told Pu-nia what to do.' Kai-ale-ale killed and ate the shark with the largest stomach.

The boy continued to fool them, gathering lobsters whenever he and his mother were hungry. Eventually all of the sharks had been killed and only Kai-ale-ale remained.

The boy knew that the rock trick wouldn't work with the King of the Sharks alone, so he collected two poles of hardwood from the forest, and he filled a bag with sticks and charcoal. At the edge of the shore, the boy told Kai-ale-ale that if he chewed Pu-nia up, if his blood rose to the surface, his mother would be able to bring him back to life. The boy then gripped his wood and bag, took a great breath, and sliced into the sea toward the lobster cave. Kai-ale-ale, thinking himself the smarter, swallowed the boy whole so there would be no blood.

Now inside the belly of the shark, Pu-nia managed to prop up its mouth with the poles. He built a fire inside the shark's stomach. Kai-ale-ale swam frantically through the ocean. When they got closer to land, the boy told the shark that if he swam to the breaking surf, Pu-nia would be saved, but if the shark took him to a sandy beach, Pu-nia would die. The great shark, fooled once again, rushed madly to the sandy cove in a final attempt to kill Pu-nia. The shark beached itself. The boy rushed out of its mouth and shouted, 'Kai-ale-ale, Kai-ale-ale, the King of the Sharks, has come to visit us!' The islanders arrived with spears and knives and summarily killed their nemesis. So ends the traditional Hawaiian story 'The Boy Pu-nia and the King of the Sharks'.

Author and ethnographer Padraic Colum finishes his version of 'Pu-nia' this way:

> Every day after that, Pu-nia was able to go down into the cave and get lobsters for himself and his mother. And all the people rejoiced when they knew that the eleven sharks that guarded the cave had been got rid of by the boy Pu-nia.

The 'Pu-nia' story is a perfect example of lobsters in literature and the arts: our crustacean heroes in a vital, albeit supporting role. Alas, we lobsterologists in our littoral lobster libraries have no opus. Lobsterdom may boast no _Moby-Crawfish_ or 'Rime of the Ancient Lobsterman'. Benchley and Spielberg gave us no blockbuster movie _Claws_ , and Blake offered us no verse 'Lobstyr, Lobstyr, boiling bright'. There is yet no lobster Bambi, Flipper or Pooh Bear.

The 'Pu-nia' story, derived from the oral tradition, connects a series of surprisingly disparate works of literature written in English, and it highlights the three primary approaches, settings of a sort, to which writers and artists have taken us when describing these animals: depicting the lobster underneath the water, showing the lobster breaking the surface as the prize for a heroic fisherman, and using the lobster on land to serve as a variety of symbols. It's a literary taxonomy that has some slosh over the edges, but that's no different from the lobster's biological organization. It's how I organize my lobster library, anyhow.

A recent version as a children's book by Lee Wardlaw, _Punia and the King of the Sharks_ (1997), features lobsters prominently. In the opening paragraph the sharks say: 'We must keep these lobsters for ourselves', and the narrator describes the lobsters as 'fat' and 'sweet as coconut'. Wardlaw's illustrator, Felipe Dávalos, paints the lobsters within a bright coral reef ecosystem, using their striped antennae in nearly every image. Dávalos's lobsters have large, sensitive eyes, rendering them cute and inquisitive.

Jesse Wilcox Smith's 'Tom reached down the hole after him' illustrates a scene in Charles Kingsley's 1863 _The Water-Babies_ in which the water-baby crawls into an inkwell-style pot in an attempt to save an old lobster.

Only a few other authors and artists have worked with the lobster beneath the surface in any imaginative fashion. You may borrow from my lobster library, for example, a comical nineteenth-century yarn about 'sagacious' lobsters crawling a hundred miles, finding their way home after escaping from a wrecked lobster smack. An old Portuguese legend tells of a lobster retrieving a dropped holy cross for a Catholic priest, actually delivering it to him on an island after a storm: 'The Father, falling on his knees, took his crucifix, after which the lobster-fish returned to the sea.'

Charles Kingsley wrote a children's fantasy novel, _The Water-Babies_ (1863), in which he describes a 'distinguished' lobster living off the coast of England. When Tom, the water-baby (possessing powers similar to Pu-nia), first sees the lobster he thinks it 'odd'. The narrator says:

> All the ingenious men, and all the scientific men, and all the fanciful men, in the world, with all the old German bogy-painters into the bargain, could never invent, if all their wits were boiled into one, anything so curious, and so ridiculous, as a lobster.

Though the lobster and Tom can speak, Kingsley tried to be accurate with his ecological descriptions, teaching his young readers. He describes the lobster's quick backward movements into gaps between the rocks, the lobster's separate 'knobbed' and 'jagged' claw, and the feeding methods of the gooseneck barnacles living on its shell. Later, Tom finds the lobster caught in a pot. He gets pulled into the trap trying to help, but a blood-thirsty otter swims in, too. The lobster protects Tom with his claws, eventually killing the otter, allowing Tom to escape. But then, just as Tom again tries to free the lobster, a fisherman pulls up the pot. The lobster manages to free himself at the boat's rail by giving a 'tremendous snap', relinquishing his claw, and falling back into the sea. By helping another creature, Tom is now allowed to find other water-babies. His charity to the lobster pays off: a subtle lesson here to be kind to lobsters.

A few poets have worked with the lobster underwater, notably Anne Sexton and George Mackay Brown, who both wrote poems titled 'Lobster' as part of bestiary collections. Sexton's poem, first published in 1973, features a solitary lobster, probably _Homarus americanus_ since Sexton was from the Boston area and the animal in her poem is captured while the 'U.S.A. sleeps'. Sexton's lobster is under the surface and alive, 'A shoe with legs,/a stone dropped from heaven', who crawls on the bottom, doing 'mournful' work. The lobster is ignorant of the simple events, tragedies and crimes that occupy mankind ashore. Sexton pities her lobster, describing him as old a second time, to complete her poem this way:

He is the old hunting dog of the sea

who in the morning will rise from it

and be undrowned

and they will take his perfect green body

and paint it red.

George Mackay Brown wrote his 'Lobster' a decade later, focusing on the metaphor of the lobster's shell as his armour. Brown grew up around creel fishermen on the Orkney Islands, so the lobster in his mind's eye is _Homarus gammarus_. His lobster is solitary, proud and long-lived. Here age is a point of honour, befitting the time of its species on earth and the perception of ancient and more spiritually centred cultures of the East. Brown was in his mid-sixties when he wrote the poem. Here it is in full:

> LOBSTER

> What are you doing here
> 
> Samurai
> 
> In the west, in the sunset streams of the west?

> How you lord it over those peasants,
> 
> The whelks
> 
> The mussels and the shrimps and scallops.

> There you clank, in dark blue armour
> 
> Along the ocean floor,
> 
> With the shadows flowing over you,
> 
> Haddock, mackerel,
> 
> And the sun the shadow of a big yellow whale.

> Nothing stands in your way, swashbuckler.

> The orchards where you wander
> 
> Drop sufficient plunder,
> 
> Mercenary in the dark blue coat of mail.

> Be content, be content far out
> 
> With the tides' bounty,
> 
> Going from smithy to smithy, in your season
> 
> For an ampler riveting.

> Fold your big thumbs,
> 
> Under the trembling silver-blue scales of the moon.

For my money Brown's poem is the most beautiful piece of writing about the lobster in English, and if there's hope for a classic work of lobster literature I humbly put this one forward. The poem smoothly and simply mixes anthropomorphism – the lobster as lord, warrior and pirate – with ecological accuracy: how the lobster moults, its habitat, other creatures and its claws. I adore Brown's use of sun and moonlight underwater and the primary onomatopoeic word in the poem: _clank_. Historical war helmets and armour, such as those constructed with overlapping plates to cover the neck, were once called 'lobster-tailed'. Brown evokes in 'Lobster' the immortal sea, in tune with the moon's cycles and, after layering imagery of ancient battles, he leaves the reader with the lobster in a peaceful, meditative posture. Brown, like Sexton, seems to envy the lobster's indifference (like the sea) to the troubles of people, and he wishes to keep the animal safe. For Sexton, the cause is lost; for Brown, hope remains. Brown speaks in the second-person to the lobster, advising it to stay away from the trap, as if to tell the animal: be satisfied with what you have, my venerable friend.

---|---

In 'Pu-nia' the young hero becomes a legendary fisherman of lobsters through cleverness and by working alone in the face of paralysing danger. In the eyes of several writers and artists the lobsterman has similar traits to this Polynesian boy: he or she often works alone, expertly, fearless of the ocean's hazards. The lobsterman is regularly depicted as a different breed, a little better than the rest of us.

One of the earlier literary celebrations of the lobsterman is by Walt Whitman, who while extolling all manner of maritime trades with his usual exuberance writes in 'A Song of Joys' from _Leaves of Grass_ (1881):

I pull the wicker pots up slantingly, the dark green lobsters are desperate with their claws as I take them out, I insert wooden pegs in the joints of their pincers,

I go to all the places one after another, and then row back to the shore,

There in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters shall be boil'd till their color becomes scarlet.

Whitman was born on Long Island and spent many of his early years there, not far from John Whittaker's fishing grounds.

In the century that follows Whitman's _Leaves of Grass_ , a series of narratives about coastal life explain period details of lobster fishing and reveal our society's changing perception of the lobsterman. The majority of these were written by women, and include five must-haves for your bug bookshelf: Sarah Orne Jewett's _The Country of the Pointed Firs_ (1896), Leo Walmsley's _Three Fevers_ (1932) and _Phantom Lobster_ (1933), Louise Dickinson Rich's _The Peninsula_ (1958) and Linda Greenlaw's _The Lobster Chronicles_ (2002).

In her short stories Jewett describes lobster as a food and even briefly includes a lobster cannery, but in her most famous work, her autobiographical novella _Pointed Firs_ , lobstering, lobster pots and lobster smacks are subtle strands of a small maritime community beside the mouth of Penobscot Bay. Jewett depicts a town at the end of the nineteenth century after the Lobster Rush has blown through, a community in decline, with lobstering a part-time fishery. At the end of _Pointed Firs_ , as the narrator leaves the town on a ferry after her summer of visiting and writing, her final image of the coast includes an almost anachronistic, widowed old fisherman tending his pots. Although perhaps laced with pity, Jewett's lobsterman is an independent figure, living dangerously, deserving of respect.

Across the Atlantic on the Yorkshire coast, author Leo Walmsley wrote about the revitalization of the lobster industry in his 1930s autobiographical novel _Three Fevers_ and accompanying memoir _Phantom Lobster_ , in which lobsters represent the last chance 'for existence' for the small fishing community of Robin Hood's Bay, which he calls Bramblewick. At that time the animal's inshore habitat of rocky ground was beyond the reach of destructive trawlers. The driving plot of _Phantom Lobster_ is the author's invention of a folding iron trap that could be more easily transported and removed before heavy weather – to reduce the cost of lost and damaged traps, and in turn improve the livelihoods and safety of the men and their families. Walmsley's fishermen are proud, skilled, independent and laconic. They see lobsters in their traps as saviours and akin to riches. In _Phantom Lobster_ a fisherman named Marney says: 'Lobsters are our only hope for making up what we lose on cod.' In _Three Fevers_ 'the market demand for lobsters was insatiable', and when the fishermen see an unexpected early 'blue-back' caught on a hook, it is 'as though it was a bar of gold from a sunken galleon'. Marney exclaims at one point: 'I tell you, lobsters are the best paying things in creation!'

Herbert E. Butler's 1903 oil _Hauling in the Lobster Pot_ depicts lobstermen off Polperro, Cornwall, as rugged, hardworking men out in the cold salt air; they are successful, too, considering the good catch already on board.

Back in New England, following the same trend, Louise Dickinson Rich also wrote about a lobster fishery reemerging as a viable business. In _The Peninsula_ she portrays a small coastal fishing community in Corea, Maine. She describes her lobstermen even more effusively, reverentially. Unlike the men of Jewett's or Walmsley's towns, lobstering is now a sustainable year-round profession. Though the men use engines and motorized pot haulers, their work remains dangerous: 'The same ancient skills are necessary to lure the lobster to the trap . . . No labor law can be enacted that will dictate the turning of the tide, the path of a storm, or the crawling of the lobsters.' For Rich a lobsterman represents an American ideal, 'pioneer stock', a self-reliant man making a living outside, similar perhaps to cultural images of the cowboy with 'an air and bearing of individual dignity that is almost regal'. As to her lobsterman's perception of the animal, Rich wrote of an unloving pragmatism:

> [Lobsters] are his living – these weird, grotesque creatures with their cunningly contrived and jointed plates of armor, their great, awkward claws, and their evil eyes looking out from the narrow green helmets. He removes them from the traps gingerly, grasping them about their bodies to avoid the viciously snapping claws and tails, and applies the metal rule that determines their legality.

As the twentieth century wore on, more tourists, authors and artists visited the coast and, especially in the US, wrote more and more about these lobstermen, elevating the profession's image. Nonfiction books such as _About Lobsters_ (1962) and children's picture books such as _Lobsterman_ (1962) added to the mystique. Painters such as Herbert E. Butler ( _Hauling in the Lobster Pot_ , 1903), Rockwell Kent ( _Toilers of the Sea_ , 1907) and N. C. Wyeth ( _Deep Cove Lobster Man_ , _c_. 1938) had painted solitary lobstermen working in difficult, romantic seascapes.

The lobster industry was similarly elevated in film in the twentieth century. In _It Happened to Jane_ (1959), even a feisty New England lobster merchant, played by Doris Day, is celebrated. Rich's Corea was the subject of a documentary by French filmmaker Jean Oser, titled _Lobstertown_ (1947) and author E. B. White narrated another documentary titled _A Maine Lobsterman, or A Day in the Life of a Fisherman_ (1954); both films reinforce the respect for this job. White says that the lobsterman is his own 'breed of men' who are 'born and not made'. Occasionally he speaks philosophically about how the sea is the lobsterman's ruling force, but the work provides 'a sense of freedom and assurance of hardihood that males unconsciously seek and need'. White's patriotic admiration for this trade seemed to respond to a weariness with the world wars and a reaffirmation of individual liberties. He ends the film:

> [The lobsterboat] does not merely transport a man to his traps in the sea, it carries him in some degree to where all men want to go, toward the destination that gives the illusion of security and strength . . . [At the end of the day] the cove awaits him in tranquility. In lands where men are free, no sight is finer to the eye than a homecoming of an independent man, a trapper home from the sea.

E. B. White saw lobstering as a solely masculine endeavour, but as early as the 1920s Arthur Train wrote a fictional story about a young woman hauling pots who is 'stalwart, erect, fearless . . . she was strong and brave and resourceful'. And Louise Dickinson Rich described the first woman to hold a lobster licence in Maine, 'and that probably means in the world'.

As far as I have found, the first fisherman to pen a major first-person narrative of the lobster fishery was Linda Greenlaw, who had spent over fifteen years as a deep-sea swordfisherman and captain, then took up lobstering. Her twenty-first-century _The Lobster Chronicles_ does not wax poetic about blush-pink mornings on the water nor does she speak romantically of the immense skill of her fellow lobstermen, although she does say that they are independent and hard-working. She often says she hates lobstering, describing the gruelling, monotonous work.

At one point Greenlaw tells a story of the death of a fellow lobsterman, concluding: 'Death at sea is all a part of this life we have chosen, I sometimes think.' Lobstering can indeed be dangerous, especially when fishing alone, and because of the nature of most of lobster fisheries the work is often close to rocks and other navigational hazards. The greatest threat is from falling overboard in heavy weather or, in any conditions, getting your foot or arm caught in a line or trap that's whizzing over the side, tugging you down with it. Walmsley writes about a similar event in _Phantom Lobster_. A 1988 short story by John Hersey, 'The Captain', and a short-lived reality show _Lobstermen: Jeopardy at Sea_ (2006) then _Lobster Wars_ (2007), all set among the offshore lobstering fleet of New England, have amplified the dangers. In truth, however, as portrayed by Greenlaw, and as I can attest, most days lobstering, especially inshore, are more back-achingly monotonous than risky or hazardous.

In _The Lobster Chronicles_ Greenlaw gives biological details about the lobster with a sense of humour: 'As far as I can see, there is absolutely nothing attractive about a lobster, male or female, and I have often wondered how so many manage to reproduce.' Her perception of the animal aligns with other lobstermen as described by Jewett, Rich, White and Walmsley: the lobster for these fishermen is primarily a means to a livelihood. For several North American communities in the twenty-first century, lobstering is economically essential. Greenlaw reflects this: 'Other than the fact that we all live on this rock, our only common bond is lobster . . . Lobsters are tangible. Lobsters become the scapegoat, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that all threats to our ability to catch lobsters become scapegoats.'

Contemporary works of fiction have reinforced the idea of the lobsterman hero, but in stories such as 'The Captain', novels _Harbor Lights_ (2000) and _The Wooden Nickel_ (2002), and the movie _A Lobster Tale_ (2006), these fishermen are more nuanced and human, their emotions and weaknesses exposed, their characters flawed. In Tim Winton's _Dirt Music_ (2001), set on Australia's west coast, a highliner lobsterman finds 'the mother lode' in deep water. The man says: 'You asked if it was luck or brains. You know, right away, before we'd even finished pulling the first line I knew it was something else. It was too weird. Come noon, I was sure of it.' He interprets the big catch of 'crays' as a sign and acts roughly, ineffectually, to rectify his past sins, including those against a local lobster poacher and his family.

One notable recent novel is _Stern Men_ (2000) by Elizabeth Gilbert, in which the lobster industry dominates a fictional island community. Like Greenlaw, Gilbert does not romanticize her fishermen. She portrays them as fiercely competitive for territory and often backhanded and dishonest, although the men of the best lobstering family in the area are not only especially gifted fishermen but brave and Nordically handsome. In _Stern Men_ Gilbert slips back and forth between anthropomorphizing the lobster – giving the animal human traits – and theriomorphizing people – giving them lobster-like traits, a narrative strategy used in nonfiction by Trevor Corson in _The Secret Life of Lobsters_ (2004), in fiction by William Carpenter in _The Wooden Nickel_ , and in a film by Todd Field and Rob Festinger titled _In the Bedroom_ (2001). As _Stern Men's_ protagonist, island-born Ruth Thomas, transitions from adolescence to adulthood, the chapters' epigraphs feature quotations from lobster biology texts, such as Francis Herrick's, that match her own development. Once when Ruth visits her severely retarded brother she holds his hand and is reminded of a time when she was working aboard her father's boat, holding a newly moulted lobster:

> The limp lobster hung on her hand, offering no more resistance than a wet sock . . . It was nothing like a normal lobster, nothing like one of those snappy fierce little tanks. And yet she could feel its life in her hand, its blood whirring in her palm. Its flesh was a bluish jelly, like a raw scallop . . . She had flung it over the side of the boat and watched it sink, translucent. It didn't have a chance. It didn't have a chance in the world. Something probably ate it before it even touched the bottom.

Ruth thinks of lobsters more often, however, as ferocious survivors. She thinks that they'll be around for ever and could probably eat rocks if they had to. _'They don't give a shit_ , Ruth thought, admiringly.' At the start of the novel Gilbert introduces her lobstermen as fiercely territorial – they are not 'good neighbors' – because the animals they catch act as contentiously: 'Dairy farming makes men steady and reliable and temperate; deer hunting makes men quiet and fast and sensitive; lobster fishing makes men suspicious and wily and ruthless.'

While some writers and artists have set the lobster underwater and more have focused on the lobsterman, still others have placed this animal on land as food on a plate or as a metaphor for a wide variety of emotions and ideas. Jack London, the writer better known for his animal stories of dogs and wolves, used the lobster as a symbol when he retold his own rendition of 'Pu-nia' within a short story 'The Water Baby' (1916). He probably heard 'Pu-nia' during his travels in Hawaii, and he was also probably aware of Kingsley's popular fairy tale _The Water-Babies_. London's 'The Water Baby' is the last story he wrote and critically recognized as one of his best.

At the end of 'The Water Baby' an old fisherman who has memorized many of the traditional Hawaiian songs and stories tells the tale of 'Pu-nia'. In this version, the community appeals to the boy, the Water Baby, because the king is coming and spiny lobster is his favourite food. 'And there were no lobsters, and it is not good to anger a king in the belly of him.' Several men and women, old and young, have been eaten or maimed by the sharks, so they ask the child for help. The boy throws rocks to distract the sharks and returns with 'a fat lobster, a wahine lobster, full of eggs, for the king'. The Water Baby turns the sharks on each other by saying the one with the shortest tail is the traitor. He simply does this over and over again, each time grabbing a fat lobster for the king, each time claiming the traitor is the one with the shortest tail. Finally the largest shark eats the second largest, and thus has eaten the equivalent of 39 other sharks. There is no Jonah-like ride inside the shark in London's version. The old storyteller says: 'And didn't they find the last shark on the beach next morning dead and burst wide open with all he had eaten?' The Hawaiian tells the narrator this is a true story because he knows a relative of the Water Baby, he himself has dived for delicious lobsters over by the point, and he has seen 39 large lava rocks on the bottom.

In 'The Water Baby' London works overtly with the concept of the collective unconscious, the water as the place of birth, and the mystery and potential of dreams. His stories at the time were influenced by the writings of Carl Jung; he had been marking up a translation of _Psychology of the Unconscious_ (1916), including the chapter 'Symbolism of Mother and Rebirth'. In a Jungian interpretation of 'The Water Baby' literary scholar James McClintock sees the lobster as the 'treasure difficult of attainment'.

Where a Jungian might see a great deal in London's and Kingsley's connecting stories of water babies with the much-older tale of 'Pu-nia', a Freudian drools at the symbolic possibilities in this Hawaiian legend. A young boy's Oedipal fantasy is realized. After his father has been eaten by the dangerous foe, he emerges as the hero, providing delicious food for his mother, diving deep into the dark sea – a phallic manifest object in itself – and then provides red, sweet, salty food for his mother, equivalent in the child's mind to making love to her.

As discussed previously, lobster as a food is often used to evoke romance or lust. Authors and artists have extended this association well beyond the dining room. Salvador Dalí connected the lobster with sexuality, the unconscious and the surreal with his _Lobster Telephone_ (1936), and Jeff Koons sexu-alized the lobster further, often replicating a lobster-shaped swimming pool float in his paintings and sculptures. Consider his _Triple Elvis_ (2009), in which this lobster float, with antennae like Dalí's moustache, is painted across huge images of a nearly naked, buoyantly buxom Playboy model. Referring to his polychromed aluminum sculpture of the pool toy, _Lobster_ , which is hung suspended by a fat red chain, Koons said:

> I like the _Lobster_ a lot because it's a symbol, both masculine and feminine. The tail tends to be very feminine, almost like a feather that a stripper might use in a performance. And the arms, the cross is more masculine. And the way the sculpture is painted, as the original inflatable was, it almost looks like fire, as if the lobster was burnt at the stake.

No one has sought to connect human sexuality to lobsters as much as did French artist and author Guillaume Lecasble in his novella _Lobster_ (2003), which I'm sure would have made Dalí proud. Lecasble's protagonist, Lobster, has an exceptional life. He 'had kept its animal instinct but his mind had been taken over by human thoughts'. Lobster survives a boiling in a pot because just as he is thrown in, the ship he is aboard, the _Titanic_ , sinks. As the vessel goes down he falls in love with the woman who had eaten his father, named Angelina. She soon learns that it is only Lobster who can give her a proper orgasm. (She tries later with another lobster with excruciatingly painful results.) All I will give away here is that the penis of a Parisian tattoo artist named Alfred eventually turns into a lobster. (If this novella is your cup of bisque, you may be obligated to rent the 1970 film _Multiple Maniacs_ , in which a character named Divine is raped by a giant lobster.)

Authors and artists have used this animal for centuries to evoke the absurd and fantastic – and not always with an overt psychosexual charge. Anthropomorphized lobsters appear in a few nineteenth and twentieth-century fables, stories and poems, but most famously in _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ (1865). Lewis Carroll imagined 'The Lobster-Quadrille', a dance where lobsters are thrown as far as possible into the sea and then retrieved, and a poem ''Tis the voice of the lobster' which comes out of Alice's mouth unexpectedly when she thinks she is going to be reciting 'The Sluggard', a real poem by Isaac Watts. Alice recites:

William Heath, _The Prime Lobster_ , 1828, hand-coloured engraving. A lobster was a derisive or comic term for a British soldier (think 'redcoat', for example). This cartoon depicts the former military hero Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, as a 'lobster' wearing the gown of the Chancellor of the Exchequer; George IV had appointed Wellington Prime Minister in 1828, causing some concern at the close involvement of the military in politics. |

'Tis the voice of the Lobster: I heard him declare

'You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.'

As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose

Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.

When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,

And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark:

But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,

His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.

The lobster in literature has also been a tool to connote insanity. The author Théophile Gautier wrote about how his friend and colleague Gérard de Nerval walked a lobster through the streets of Paris:

> 'Why should a lobster be any more ridiculous than a dog?' [Nerval] used to ask quietly, 'or a cat, or a gazelle, or a lion, or any other animal that one chooses to take for a walk? I have a liking for lobsters. They are peaceful, serious creatures. They know the secrets of the sea, they don't bark, and they don't gnaw upon one's _monadic_ privacy like dogs do. And Goethe had an aversion to dogs, and he wasn't mad.'

  | John Tenniel's woodcut of 'Tis The Voice of the Lobster' for Lewis Carroll's _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ (1865).

---|---

Nerval seems to have named his pet lobster 'Thibault', and at least one critic has seen this not as act of madness but a real effort to make his contemporaries question our claimed mastery of animals. The poet Paul Muldoon references this pet in his poem 'Something Else' (1987) as a symbol of madness, referencing Nerval's suicide. In his novel _Pincher Martin_ (1956), William Golding uses lobsters to highlight growing insanity, with the hallucinations of an island castaway:

> He eyed the peculiar shapes that lay across the trousers indifferently for a while until at last it occurred to him how strange it was that lobsters should sit there. Then he was suddenly seized with a terrible loathing for lobsters and flung them away so that they cracked on the rock. The dull pain of the blow extended him into them again and they became his hands, lying discarded where he had tossed them.

Can I recommend just two more stories for your lobster library? One is by Samuel Beckett, the other by A. S. Byatt. File them under 'B' or on your shelf labelled 'Out of the Water Metaphors'. In Beckett's 1932 short story 'Dante and the Lobster' he used the animal as a Christ-like symbol, awaiting its death, and thus furthered ethical considerations about boiling these animals alive. The narrator, Belacqua, carries around a lobster from the fishmonger, unaware that it is still breathing. The animal is in a bag and is at one point pawed by a cat. On his way to visit his aunt, carrying the slowly dying lobster, the young man sees other things that make him think of euthanasia, pity, sacrifice and God's judgement. When he arrives at his aunt's house and goes down to her kitchen, 'into the bowels of the earth', she takes out the lobster, planning to cook it. Belacqua says: 'Christ! it's alive,' and Beckett describes the lobster as an 'exposed cruciform'. As the aunt goes to put it in the pot, Belacqua is suddenly compassionate for the first time in the story: 'But it's not dead . . . you can't boil it like that.' The aunt replies: 'Have sense, lobsters are always boiled alive. They must be.' Though the animal 'trembled', the aunt tells him that 'they feel nothing'. Beckett finishes the story:

> In the depths of the sea it had crept into the cruel pot. For hours, in the midst of its enemies, it had breathed secretly. It had survived the Frenchwoman's cat and his witless clutch. Now it was going alive into scalding water. It had to. Take into the air my quiet breath.
> 
> ...
> 
> Well, thought, Belacqua, it's a quick death, God help us all. It is not.

A. S. Byatt, who said Beckett's 'Dante and the Lobster' is 'one of the greatest short stories of all time', finished one of her own pieces, 'The Chinese Lobster' (1993), to emulate his, with similar imagery. A lobster and two smaller crabs are slowly dying out of the water, on display, inside a Chinese restaurant. After an academic and a painter have a difficult lunch meeting about a suicidal graduate student, the two look at the dying animals on their way out. The crustaceans are 'still alive, all, more slowly, hissing their difficult air, bubbling, moving feet, feelers, glazing eyes'. The academic, once suicidal herself, identifies with the dying animals, the 'pain of alien fish-flesh contracting inside an exo-skeleton'. Byatt writes as the story concludes:

> 'I find that _absolutely appalling_ , you know', says Perry Diss [the painter]. 'And at the same time, exactly at the same time, I don't give a damn? D'you know?' 'I know,' says Gerda Himmelblau. She does know. Cruelly, imperfectly, voluptuously, clearly.

Just as 'Pu-nia and the King of the Sharks' is still being performed by Hawaiian storytellers, has been retold and reworked in a story by Jack London and a modern children's book, so the descriptions, metaphors and characters created around the lobster have inspired the works of writers and artists. Mirroring societal views as well as helping to create them, our authors, filmmakers and painters have attached a wide variety of symbolism to lobsters, usually focusing on the animal's claws, its 'armour', its change of colour to a brilliant red after being cooked, and the fact that we regularly boil them alive – using these images to evoke unconscious desires, absurdity, pity or even madness. Some of our poets and musicians have been spiritually moved by the ability of lobster species to survive over the millennia under a dark, indifferent sea, while others, as evident in the B-52s's catchy pop song 'Rock Lobster' (1978), have had fun simply with the very sound, humour and versatility of the word. Like this: underwater like a mobster, lobster, lob to the surface, lobster and then, sadly, into the pot stir, lobster.

## 7 Feelers

The lobster has been variously praised and damned, copied and rejected, romanticized and ridiculed. It has served as fish bait, fertilizer, and gourmet food. It has appeared in literary short stories, on license plates, and on tee shirts. It has been envied and loved, steamed and boiled. But like all true cultural icons . . . never been ignored.

George H. Lewis, 1998

To consider our future relationship to the lobster, perhaps it's best that we embark on a Jules Verne zoom around the earth.

Let's start off tamely, beginning with the Florida Keys, and stop, gawk and laugh at 'Betsey', the giant spiny lobster sculpture beside the highway – one of several massive lobster totems that attract endless tourist cameras around the globe, from Shediac, New Brunswick, to Barcelona, Spain, to Kingston SE, South Australia.

Not far from Betsey, in a few areas within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, managers have had some success with reserves, at least in terms of rebuilding lobster populations. They have restricted or closed fishing entirely in these zones, yet still allowed lobstermen to set their traps outside the perimeters. Similarly regulated bodies of water are delineated off California and in the coastal waters of New Zealand, Belize, Brazil, Norway and the western Mediterranean. The Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve off the coast of southeast India is the first marine reserve in southeast Asia, now protecting six species of spiny lobsters and one slipper species. These reserves might help both animals and fishermen in the long run, but the lobstermen of the Florida Keys are currently struggling because of a drop in the price of lobster due to the recession, and they are waiting to see how the BP oil spill of 2010 will affect future lobster stocks.

Let's next power through the Panama Canal, up the Pacific coast of Baja, and stop at Puerto Nuevo, Mexico. This tiny town holds an annual Fiesta de Langosta, featuring over thirty small restaurants sizzling up California spiny lobster by slicing them lengthwise, frying them in a pan with lard and serving them with rice, beans and flour tortillas. Puerto Nuevo calls itself the 'Lobster Capital of Baja'.

Further north in the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, California, a 5 kg (11 lb) male spiny lobster sits passively between two rocks. A former big wave surfer named Tom Powers was free-diving off the Channel Islands:

> I squirmed under the ledge and wrestled the bug out. In the meantime it had knocked my mask askew, completely flooding it, and had gotten a hold of my thumb with its mandibles . . . it ended up taking the last couple inches off my Kevlar glove . . . I got back home and was on my way to the cleaning tables when I started to feel really bad about killing such a magnificent beast . . . I love to hunt and eat lobster, but giving this to the Aquarium was by far the most gratifying experience I've had in over ten years of hunting.

Eleven pounds isn't nearly the size of the supposedly man-eating North Sea clawed lobsters as described in the sixteenth century, or even as large as those hefty ones recorded by early Europeans arriving at North America – but Powers's spiny bug is still an exceptionally large individual, even by historic standards in California. The lobster lives in a tank that is small compared to what it is accustomed to, but this aquarium is a world leader in techniques for caring for marine animals and for advocating ocean conservation. When I visited, the aquarist in charge of this exhibit at the time, Kevin Lewand, sighed sympathetically. Yes, he told me, this animal probably would prefer a larger space, but if it lived in the huge kelp tank no one would ever see it. Remember, lobsters are mostly nocturnal. 'This lobster is now an ambassador for his species', he said. So the big lobster lives underneath a touch tank and is fed with meals delivered down on a skewer, a 'fish kebab'. Most people walk right past or don't notice as they play with the anemones or sea stars above. But every now and again someone kneels down and stares in awe at the lobster, or a volunteer points out the animal and describes its natural history and a bit about California marine reserves – highlighting the lobsters' role in the ecology of the kelp forest and how their populations impact the urchins and sea otters.

If there are broad themes to be taken from this lobster study, one is that giant individuals fascinate us. They evoke an earlier earth: less spoiled but more threatening. As we now travel across the North Pacific, recall the scene in _Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea_ (1869) where enormous crustaceans crawl along the ocean floor. Professor Aronnax describes an encounter:

> My blood curdled when I saw enormous antennae blocking my road, or some frightful claw closing with a noise in the shadow of some cavity. Millions of luminous spots shone brightly amid the shadows. They were the eyes of giant crustacea crouched in their lairs; giant lobsters setting themselves up like halberdiers, and moving their claws with the clicking sound of pincers.

A large lobster is a survivor among a group of animals who are survivors, whose ancestors foraged the sea for tens of millions of years before _Homo sapiens_ appeared. Francis Herrick wrote in his _Natural History of the American Lobster_ :

> Giants are met with in all the higher groups of animals. They interest us not only on account of their actual size, but also in showing to what degree individuals may surpass the mean average of the race. It may be a question whether lobsters weighing from 20 to 30 pounds [9–14 kg] or more are to be regarded as giants in the technical sense, or simply as sound and vigorous individuals on whose side fortune has always fought in the struggle for life. I am inclined to the latter view, and look upon the mammoth lobster simply as a favorite of nature, who is larger than his fellows because he is their senior; good luck never deserted him until he was stranded on the beach or became entangled in some fisherman's gear.

Utagawa Kuniyoshi (1798–1861), 'Phoenix and Lobster', from the _Birds and Animals Illustrated_ series, late 1830s, woodblock print.

One of the brasher volunteers at the aquarium declared that Powers's spiny lobster is 80 to 90 years old, but we can't be sure of the age of any large lobster. Because they so completely shed their shell, nothing remains that can be dated, nothing like the otoliths with growth rings found inside a fish's head. Biologists believe lobsters moult once every year or two, but the rate of shedding and the amount they expand seems to diminish as they age and is subject to environmental conditions. Scientists have created size estimates, predicted-growth curves, but nothing is certain since so few of these specimens have lived in captivity for decades. Promising new methods for ageing crustaceans use a pigment, lipofuscin, sampled from the cells of lobster nervous systems – but these are not yet reliable. Based on its size, it is safer to say Powers's spiny catch is 30 to 40 years old.

Returning to our lobster-centric, Verne-style circumnavigation, we continue along the surface of the North Pacific off Japan, where float the extraordinary transparent phyllosoma of spiny and slipper lobsters. In the deep black water, some 180 metres (600 feet) down, scuttle specimens of _Thaumastocheles japonicus_ , little lobsters with one claw exceptionally longer and toothier than the other. These bizarre lobsters are barely known to science – described only from a few rare specimens that appeared like pale space creatures aboard a fishing or research vessel. New species, new genera even, have turned up in recent years.

If there is a second broader theme to this lobster study, it is that the definition of a lobster continues to evolve and spur debate, in part because of advanced technologies, but also because the ocean is an enormous, inaccessible place: we keep finding new crustaceans. In 2010 lobster taxonomist Tin-Yam Chan of National Taiwan Ocean University published a brand new master list of lobsters, differing from Holthuis and others in a variety of ways, incorporating the most advanced phylogenetics and recent discoveries. He counted '248 valid species (with four valid subspecies) of marine lobsters in 6 families and 55 genera'.

At the diverse fish markets of China and Japan, well before dawn most days, several lobster species arrive both live and frozen from all over the world, often as by-catch from other fisheries. In the larger cities, such as Hong Kong, Beijing, Taipei and Tokyo, restaurants have been serving more 'Maine' lobster, while varieties of spiny and slipper lobsters have been prepared in Asian kitchens for centuries. The bright red or orange colour is particularly appreciated for special occasions, evoking celebration and wealth.

To supply the international demand for lobsters, aquaculture producers, fisheries managers and scientists in, for instance, Australia, India and Norway, have been developing all manner of aquaculture, mariculture and sea ranching methods to raise lobsters at various developmental stages. Some raise lobster larvae from eggs in the laboratory then release these into the wild. Others collect larvae and raise individuals in tanks. Artificial habitats are placed in the ocean to increase survivability of larvae while adult lobsters are moved from one part of the sea to another in hopes they will grow faster and healthier. Vietnamese aquaculturists, for example, collect spiny lobster postlarvae from the ocean, a portion in shipments from Bangladesh, and then grow them out to adults in tanks or cages, exporting more than 1,000 tonnes to markets throughout Asia. Scientists have been researching lobster aquaculture methods since before Francis Herrick's day – usually without enough success to make it commercially viable or quantifiably helpful to local fisheries. The twenty-first century should continue to see significant advances here, although most of the lobster aquaculture research, involving over ten different lobster species, is closely guarded since the profit potential is enormous.

In southeast Asia, in Indonesian waters, locals catch fingersized, magnificently coloured lobsters for the aquarium trade, known generally in the industry as purple or red lobsters ( _Enoplometopus sp._ ), and whose taxonomy is still debated. Novice aquarium enthusiasts halfway across the world like the idea of a pretty little lobster in their tank – yet often wake up to find their new pet has eaten a few of their prized tropical fish.

We'll next sail to Fremantle Harbour, Western Australia. Here the guests of Cicerello's, a popular restaurant here since the 1940s, relax outside, watch the vessels go in and out of the port and look across the harbour at a heroic bronze sculpture: a man lifting a lobster trap. The customers can watch their lobsters in the tank before the animals are prepared for dinner, which at Cicerello's is usually split, grilled and simply basted with garlic butter, then served with a sprinkling of parsley. Henry Liascos, the owner, told me this story:

> Once two idiots, drunk, came in and stole out of our aquarium the largest cray we had, in full view of our customers, who called me and pointed to the direction the culprits went, into the park and across the road. I gave chase and found one of the idiots trying to hide it by wedging it between his butt and the base of a tree. I pushed him offbalance, grabbed the cray, and ran back to the shop. As I arrived I was greeted by the diners with a cheer. One lady said: 'Yeah! One for the good guys!'

We're off across the Indian Ocean, pausing to observe the Blunt slipper lobster ( _Scyllarides squammosus_ ) off Madagascar, one of the largest, most cosmopolitan and tastiest of the slippers, found in waters as distant as Japan, Australia and Hawaii. In more distant waters nearly 500 miles south of Madagascar, South African scientists in 2006 discovered an entirely new species of lobster, _Palinurus barbarae_ , living on a submerged seamount. These remote giants weighed up to 4 kg (8.8 lb).

We now navigate north, through the Suez Canal, to look at a few of the Mediterranean lobsters, the animals which the Hebrews denied themselves because they perceived them as unclean, as scavengers, and the same species once enjoyed by the Greeks and Romans.

Across Europe, across Italy and Spain – two of the larger importers of American lobster – then we touch down in London to visit the office of the Marine Stewardship Council. MSC runs an 'ecolabel' programme to inform consumers about environmentally sustainable fisheries. They've given their certification to the spiny lobster industry off Western Australia (2000/2006), the first of _any_ fishery in the world, and that of Mexican Baja California (2004), a small collection of some 500 lobstermen organised in nine cooperatives. In 2010 the Canadian offshore lobster fishery earned certification. This fishery is run by one company, owning all of the licences, operating year-round under a seemingly sustainable total allowable catch. Together the lobstermen of Jersey and Normandy have begun the expensive MSC certification process.

Conservation biologists, such as Daniel Pauly at the University of British Columbia and Callum Roberts at the University of York, see the growth of invertebrate fisheries as alarming, regardless of how careful we are about the methods. They believe we are 'fishing down marine food webs', reducing diversity and increasing species' vulnerability to disease – as exemplified by the 'shell-rot' disease on the lobsters in John Whittaker's southern New England, or the _Haematodinium_ parasite, which has infected pockets of the Norway lobster, _Nephrops norvegicus_. Roberts writes:

> One widespread change has been the shift from finfish to invertebrate dominance. The switch from cod to crab, lobster, and prawns in Canada; the flip from groundfish to lobster and urchins in the Gulf of Maine; the rise of _Nephrops_ prawns in northern Europe as their fish predators diminish. This invertebrate ascendancy is welcomed by fishers, for their flesh is valuable, sometimes more so than the fish they replaced. But there is grave risk in our uncontrolled experiments with nature.

Cruising outbound along the Thames, where once sailing vessels with wells delivered live lobsters to Billingsgate Market, we travel north until we're off the coast of Fife. Here the _Nephrops_ fishery continues to be one of the remaining money-makers, while the European lobster is making a comeback according to Ian Murray, a retired skipper and wholesaler, who told me that 2009 was 'the best ever for lobsters, not just in the St Andrews area but right up and down the whole East Coast'.

Now across our last ocean, the Atlantic, and into the waters of the Gulf of Maine where you should mull over a recent study by researchers who used underwater cameras to reveal that American lobsters are actually more capable of climbing out of traps than previously thought. This suggests perhaps it is just as much timing that catches the bugs after all.

In truth, biologists and fishermen still do not have a complete understanding of the whys and wheres of adult lobster movement or larval settlement. There remains an extraordinary amount that we still do not know, even about American lobsters, arguably the most studied marine animal on earth. To mark the first edition of Herrick's seminal book, then titled _The American Lobster: A Study of Its Habits and Developments_ (1895), another entire text was devoted to the study of this animal, edited by Jan Factor, this time written by more than a dozen specialists and called simply _Biology of the Lobster 'Homarus americanus'_ (1995).

Behold the future of the global lobster industry at the Ocean Choice processing plant in Souris, Prince Edward Island, Canada. Ocean Choice purchases hundreds of thousands of pounds of _Homarus americanus_ from Canadian and American fishermen each year. Ocean Choice ships the lobsters, which they dub 'the king of seafood', around the world in various forms, organized through their offices in the US, the UK, Germany, Japan and China. They'll ship ready-for-retail whole lobsters in a bag that has been quick-frozen. They offer a dizzying variety of lobster meat – tails, claws, knuckles – that a store can sell frozen, cooked or canned. Ocean Choice also has the machinery to take live lobsters through a water-filled pressure chamber. This 'hyperbaric process' allows the meat to slip right out of the shell with little effort, to be sold as frozen, shell-free refrigerated parts, similar to how you would buy boned chicken breast at the supermarket.

  | An Ocean Choice Inter national wholesale brochure exemplifies the variety of lobster products offered by a 21st-century Canadian lobster processor using advanced hyperbaric and freezing technologies.

---|---

A fledgling processing company in Maine, which has also in vested in this hyperbaric machinery, sells frozen bags of 'Maine Lobster Spaghetti', full of the thin strips of leg meat that are difficult to extract if you're eating the bugs in the rough. Mean while, anticipating ever-increasing twenty-first-century regu lations intended to protect animal welfare and perhaps a growing public response to claims that crustaceans feel pain, an English company has manufactured 'Crustastun', a device that zaps the lobster with 'an instant current', killing it in seconds. The company offers an industrial conveyor belt model and a personal, scanner-sized device for restaurants: 'the single stunner'.

This growing public empathy for the lobster as a sentient animal evokes a third larger lesson from this lobster study: our cultural relationships with this animal as a food and as a symbol are extraordinarily varied and at times completely contradictory. We anthropomorphize the lobster, but it is one of the few animals we still kill in our homes. We claim it is an aphrodisiac, but we use the animal for absurdist comedy and costumes, then, around the next corner, association with the lobster is a metaphor for madness.

We'll end this world lobster tour in New York City, where the earliest commercial lobstermen of the US, many from Whittaker's Noank, Connecticut, once sold their catch.

One final story. After a long day of lobster study in Manhattan, I went into the bar at City Crab and Seafood for refreshment. Making conversation, and perhaps because I did not look urban enough, the bartender asked when I sat down: 'Been in the Big Apple long?'

'Just came in this morning', I said.

On the way from the library I had stopped to see a Red Lobster, one of their nearly 700 restaurants across North America. On a corner amidst the lights of Times Square, this Red Lobster is appropriately in the theatre district where the lobster palaces once flourished in the early 1900s. Just above their front door, the restaurant has a large Jeff Koonsian lobster, revolving and red-lit.

I wanted to sit down at City Crab and Seafood, though, to see the plaque just above their tank filled with live Dungeness crabs and American lobsters. It says:

Good Luck, George!

City Crab and Seafood Company

George the Lobster

Our beloved 20 lb 140-year-old unofficial mascot

has been returned to the sea.

January 9, 2009

General manager Mitchell Rosen explained to me that one afternoon they had a big lobster in the tank and two women came into the bar. They asked about it. The next day City Crab received a call from PETA. City Crab was happy to release the animal. The big bug would have been harder to sell and prepare, and it got the restaurant all sorts of positive press. Rosen said he received over 400 emails from all over the world. He conceded he has no idea if the lobster is 140 years old, but that's what _somebody_ said. This is not an isolated event. People have been releasing (and naming) large individual lobsters for decades, and celebrities such as Mary Tyler Moore, Ellen DeGeneres and Paul McCartney have for just as long advocated lobster rights. Not bad for a prickly underwater bug.

When my drink arrived, at last, I raised my glass to the plaque: Good luck, lobster. Be content, be content far out.

## Acknowledgements

Captain John Whittaker aboard _Whistler_ was a patient and knowledgeable boss and later equally so in helping with this project. The Maritime Studies Program of Williams College and Mystic Seaport provided full logistical support. The librarians at Mystic Seaport, Kemble House Basement, University of California Santa Cruz, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, NOAA Southeast Fisheries Science Center, Williams College and Connecticut College were abundantly helpful and brilliant. Kresge College at UCSC and The Moss Landing Marine Laboratories provided research space and opportunities. 'Lobster' is reprinted in full on p. 136 by kind permission of the executors of George Mackay Brown's estate.

Several individuals not mentioned within the text deserve special thanks: James Carlton, Vicki Sheng, Susan Wishon, Robert Prescott, Jen Gordon, Nathan Lipfert, the film crew of 'Catch It!', Jennifer Finn, Susan Beegel, Kari Lavalli, Douglas Pezzack, Susan Schnur, Sue Vickers Tordoff and Fred Lane. Stanley Cobb, Daniel Brayton and Rebecca Kessler generously offered their time as skilled outside readers. As editors Jonathan Burt, Martha Jay and Michael Leaman helped improve the text immensely. Harry Gilonis did the same for the images.

Thank you to my tolerant wife and smart colleague Lisa Gilbert as well as newborn Alice Day. The book is dedicated to my brother David.
