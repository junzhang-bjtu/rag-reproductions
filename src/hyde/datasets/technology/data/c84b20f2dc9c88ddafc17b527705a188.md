## Chapter 1. HTML5 Pocket Reference

HTML ( _HyperText Markup Language_ ) is the markup language used to turn text documents into web pages and applications. The fundamental purpose of HTML as a markup language is to provide a _semantic_ description (the meaning) of the content and establish a document _structure_ (a hierarchy of elements).

This pocket reference provides a concise yet thorough listing of the elements and attributes specified in the HTML5 Candidate Recommendation maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) dated December 17, 2012, the HTML 5.1 Editor's Draft dated June 15, 2013, and the "living" HTML specification maintained by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) as of June 15, 2013.

Elements and attributes from the HTML 4.01 Specification that were made obsolete in HTML5 have been omitted from this edition. The elements and attributes contained in this book may be used in HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0, or XHTML 1.1 documents, unless they are explicitly marked "Not in HTML 4.01," in which case they will cause the document to be invalid.

HTML5 documents can be written in XHTML syntax (formally known as the "XML Serialization of HTML5"), so whenever applicable, special considerations for XHTML will be noted. See Appendix B at the end of this reference for details on XHTML syntax requirements.

This book is organized into the following sections:

  * HTML5 Overview

  * HTML5 Global Attributes

  * Alphabetical List of Elements

  * Elements Organized by Function

  * Appendix A

  * Appendix B

## HTML5 Overview

HTML5 offers new features (elements, attributes, event handlers, and APIs) for easier web application development and more sophisticated form handling.

The HTML5 specification is based on HTML 4.01 Strict, but unlike previous HTML Recommendations, HTML5 does not use a Document Type Definition (DTD). Instead, it uses the Document Object Model (DOM, the "tree" formed by a document's structure) as its basis rather than a particular set of syntax rules. It also differs from previous recommendations in that it includes detailed instructions for how browsers should handle malformed and legacy markup.

### W3C and WHATWG

There are two organizations maintaining slightly different HTML specifications as of this writing.

HTML5 was originally written by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG). In 2003, members of Apple, Mozilla, and Opera formed the WHATWG to further the development of HTML in a way that was consistent with real-world authoring practices and browser behavior. Their initial documents, Web Applications 1.0 and Web Forms 1.0, were rolled together into HTML5, which is still in development under the guidance of WHATWG editor, Ian Hickson. They eventually dropped the version number and now maintain "living" (unnumbered) HTML specification at _whatwg.org_.

In 2006, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) formed its own HTML5 Working Group based on the work by the WHATWG. In 2009, it discontinued its work on XHTML 2.0 in order to focus on the development of HTML5. The W3C maintains a "snapshot" (numbered) version of HTML5 ( _www.w3.org/TR/html5/_), which is expected to reach Recommendation status in 2014. HTML5.1 is also in development and is scheduled to become a Recommendation in 2016. Nightly builds of the HTML5.1 Editor's Draft are available at _www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/_.

The differences between the W3C and HTML5 Candidate Recommendation and the WHATWG versions are fairly minor. The WHATWG and HTML5.1 spec change frequently, but the differences as of this writing include:

#### WHATWG only

`ping` attribute on `a` and `area` elements  
---  
`srcset` attribute on `img` element

#### WHATWG and W3C HTML5.1 only

`data` element  
---  
`menuitem` element  
`dialog` element  
`main` element  
`inert` global attribute  
`itemid`, `itemprop`, `itemref`, `itemscope`, and `itemtype` global attributes  
`onclose` and `onsort` global event handlers  
`download` attribute on `a` and `area` elements  
`sortable` attribute on `table` element  
`sorted` attribute on `th` element

#### W3C HTML5 only

`command` element (replaced by `menuitem`)  
---  
`media` attribute on `a` element  
`pubdate` attribute on `time` element

### New Semantic Elements in HTML5

HTML5 includes new semantic elements for marking up page content. Details for each of these elements are provided in the section Alphabetical List of Elements:

`article`| `figcaption`| `output`  
---|---|---  
`aside`| `figure`| `progress`  
`audio`| `footer`| `rp`  
`bdi`| `header`| `rt`  
`canvas`| `hgroup`*| `ruby`  
`command`*| `keygen`| `section`  
`data`**| `main`**| `source`  
`datalist`| `mark`| `time`  
`details`| `menuitem`**| `track`  
`dialog`**| `meter`| `video`  
`embed`| `nav`| `wbr`

* Removed from HTML5.1

** WHATWG and HTML5.1 only

#### New input types

HTML5 introduces the following new input control types (indicated as values for the `type` attribute for the `input` element): `color`, `date`, `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `email`, `month`, `number`, `range`, `search`, `tel`, `time`, `url`, and `week`.

#### Obsolete HTML 4.01 elements

The following HTML 4.01 elements were made obsolete in HTML5 because they were presentational, confusing, or poorly supported: `acronym`, `applet`, `basefont`, `big`, `center`, `dir`, `frame`, `frameset`, `font`, `isindex`, `noframes`, `strike`, and `tt`.

### HTML5 APIs

With a growing demand for interactive content on web pages, HTML5 introduces many APIs ( _Application Programming Interfaces_ ) for the creation of web applications. APIs standardize tasks that traditionally required proprietary plug-ins or custom programming. Some have markup components such as `audio`, `video`, and `canvas`; others only use JavaScript and/or server-side components.

The following APIs are part of the W3C HTML5 specification:

  *  **Media API**, for playback of video and audio files with multimedia synchronization and timed subtitles, used with the new `video` and `audio` elements ( _bit.ly/17EC8HT_ and _bit.ly/13xEOBr_)

  *  **TextTrack** , for adding timed subtitles and captions for `video` and `audio` elements ( _bit.ly/16ZQm6S_)

  *  **Session History API** , for exposing the browser history ( _bit.ly/12iDo0Q_)

  *  **Offline Web Applications API**, which allows web resources to be used while offline ( _bit.ly/108K1mp_)

  *  **Editing API** , including a new global `contenteditable` attribute ( _bit.ly/11Tw0Tv_)

  *  **Drag and Drop API** , including the new `draggable` attribute ( _bit.ly/18sdPhs_)

Other HTML5-related APIs have separate specifications, including:

  *  **Canvas API** for two-dimensional drawing in conjunction with the new `canvas` element ( _bit.ly/17ftf5F_)

  *  **Web Storage API** allows data to be stored in the browser's cache so an app can use it later ( _bit.ly/168vZjW_)

  *  **Geolocation API** lets users share longitude and latitude information for so they are accessible to scripts in web applications ( _bit.ly/168w5rQ_)

  *  **Web Workers API** that allows scripts to run in the background to improve performance ( _bit.ly/17ECwWI_)

  *  **Web Sockets API** that maintains an open connection between the client and the server so data can pass between them in real time. This may be useful for multi-player games, chat, and live data streams ( _bit.ly/13UfWUK_).

  *  **File API** gives access to files uploaded from a form input. It enables previews of the uploaded file to be shown and enables drag-and-drop uploading ( _bit.ly/11sTkro_).

This is only a handful of the dozens of APIs in development. The following resources provide thorough lists of available APIs and other web technologies in an easy-to-use manner:

  *  _The Web Platform: Browser Technologies_ , maintained by Mike Smith of the W3C ( _platform.html5.org_)

  *  _HTML5 Landscape Overview_ , by Erik Wilde ( _dret.typepad.com/dretblog/html5-api-overview.html_)

  *  _Web Platform Docs_ ( _docs.webplatform.org/wiki/apis_)

### HTML5 Document Structure

HTML5 has only one version and does not reference a DTD, but HTML5 documents still require a simplified DOCTYPE declaration to trigger standards mode rendering in browsers. The following is the minimum recommended structure of a basic HTML5 document:

     **<!DOCTYPE html>**
    <html>
      <head>
        <title> _Document Title_ </title>
      </head>
      <body>
          _Content of document . . ._
      </body>
    </html>

HTML5 documents written in XML syntax do not require a DOCTYPE but may include an XML declaration. They should also be served as the MIME type `application/xhtml+xml` or `application/xml`. The following is a simple HTML5 document written in the XML syntax:

     **<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>**
    <html **xmlns=** " **http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml** ">
      <head>
        <title> _Document Title_ </title>
      </head>
      <body>
          _Content of document . . ._
      </body>
    </html>

### HTML5 Browser Support

Most of the new HTML5 semantic elements and attributes are supported by contemporary desktop and mobile browsers (Chrome, Safari, Opera, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 9+). For browsers that do not support new elements and APIs, there is usually a JavaScript _polyfill_ (patch) that simulates support. For a thorough list of existing polyfills, see Modernizr's collection at _www.github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills_.

One example of a simple polyfill is the "HTML5 Shiv" script created by Remy Sharp. To make older browsers such as Internet Explorer 8 and earlier recognize new HTML5 elements (thus making them accessible to styles and scripts), you could write JavaScript to create each element in DOM one at a time.

For example, this command creates a `section` element:

    document.createElement("section");

The HTML5 Shiv script, created by Remy Sharp, creates all of the new elements for you at once. To use it, simply point to the Google-hosted script shown here:

    <!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
    html5-els.js"></script>
    <![endif]-->

The following resources are useful for tracking HTML5 real-world support and use:

### Validating HTML5 Documents

You can check to see if your HTML5 document is valid using the online validator at _validator.w3.org_ (HTML5 support is in beta as of this writing) or _html5.validator.nu_.

## HTML5 Global Attributes

A number of attributes are shared by all elements in HTML5 and are referred to collectively as the _Global Attributes_ :

`accesskey="` _`character`_`"`

Assigns an access key (shortcut key command) that activates or focuses the element. The value is a single character. Users may access the element by hitting Alt-< _key_ > (PC) or Ctrl-< _key_ > (Mac).

`class="` _`text string`_`"`

Assigns one or more classification names to the element.

`contenteditable="true|false"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates the user can edit the element. This attribute is already well supported in current browser versions.

`contextmenu="` _`id of menu element`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies a context menu that applies to the element. The context menu must be requested by the user, for example, by a right-click.

`dir="ltr|rtl|auto"`

Specifies the direction of the element. `ltr` indicates left to right; `rtl` indicates right to left; and `auto` indicates that direction should be determined programmatically.

`draggable="true|false"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates the element is draggable, meaning it can be moved by clicking and holding on it, and then moving it to a new position in the window.

`dropzone="copy|move|link|string:` _`text string type`_`|file:` _`file type`_ "

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates what happens when a data is dragged onto the element and what kind of data to accept. `copy` results in a copy of the dragged data; `move` moves the data to a new location; and `link` results in a link to the original data. Including `string:text/plain` allows it to accept any text string. The `file:` attribute indicates what type of file is accepted (e.g., `file:image/png`). Both the action and accepted data may be provided, for example, `dropzone="copy string:text/plain"`.

`hidden` (`hidden="hidden"` in XHTML)

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Prevents the element and its descendants from being rendered in the user agent (browser). Any scripts or form controls in hidden sections will still execute, but they will not be presented to the user.

`id="` _`text string`_`"`

Assigns a unique identifying name to the element.

`inert` (`inert="inert"` in XHTML)

 **WHATWG & HTML5.1 only**. Indicates that the element should be made inert, which means it cannot be selected, searched, or targeted by user interactions.

`itemid="` _`text`_`"`

 **WHATWG & HTML5.1 only**. Part of the microdata system for embedding machine-readable data, the `itemid` attribute indicates a globally recognized identifier (such as an ISBN for a book). It is used in conjunction with `itemtype` in the same element containing `itemscope`.

`itemprop="` _`text`_`"`

 **WHATWG & HTML5.1 only**. Part of the microdata system for embedding machine-readable data, the `itemprop` attribute provides the name of the property. The content of the element provides its value. The value may also be a URL provided by the `href` attribute in `a` elements or the `src` attribute in `img`.

`itemref="` _`space-separated list of IDs`_`"`

 **WHATWG & HTML5.1 only**. Part of the microdata system for embedding machine-readable data, the `itemref` attribute specifies a list of elements (by ID values) on the current page to be included in an _item_. The `itemref` attribute must be used in the same element as the `itemscope` attribute that established the item.

`itemscope`

 **WHATWG & HTML5.1 only**. Part of the microdata system for embedding machine-readable data, `itemscope` creates a new _item_ , a group of properties (name/value pairs).

`itemtype="` _`URL or reversed DNS label`_`"`

 **WHATWG & HTML5.1 only**. Part of the microdata system for embedding machine-readable data, the `itemtype` attribute indicates a standardized item type indicated by a URL (e.g., _http://vocab.example.net/book_ ) or a reversed DNS label (e.g., com.example.person). The `itemtype` attribute is used in the same element containing the `itemscope` attribute.

`lang`

Specifies the language for the element by its language code.

`xml:lang`

 **XHTML only**. Specifies language for elements in XHTML documents.

`spellcheck="true|false"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates the element is to have its spelling and grammar checked.

`style="` _`CSS styles`_`"`

Associates style information with an element.

`tabindex="` _`number`_`"`

Specifies the position of the current element in the tabbing order for the current document. The value must be between 0 and 32,767. It is used for tabbing through the links on a page (or fields in a form).

`title="` _`text string`_`"`

Provides a title or advisory information about the element.

`translate="yes|no"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates whether the element's text content and attribute values should be translated when the document is localized. `yes` is the default; `no` leaves the element content unchanged.

The following attributes are not included in the list of Global Attributes but are permitted in HTML5 documents:

`aria-*="` _`text string or number`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Allows any of the WAI-ARIA states and properties for improving accessibility to be applied to an element, for example, `aria-hidden="true"`. The value of the attribute varies with the property. See _www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties_ for information on supported of states and properties.

`data-*="` _`text string or numerical data`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Enables authors to create custom data-related attributes, for example, `data-length`, `data-duration`, `data-speed`, etc., so that nonvisible data can be embedded and used by a custom application or scripts.

`role="` _`standardized WAI-ARIA role`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Assigns one of the standardized WAI-ARIA roles to an element to make its purpose clearer to users with disabilities. The landmark roles (`application`, `banner`, `complementary`, `contentinfo`, `form`, `main`, `navigation`, and `search`) play an important role in navigation on assistive devices. See _www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#role_definitions_ for a complete list of allowable role values.

### HTML5 Event Handlers

Unless otherwise specified, the following event handler content attributes may be specified on any HTML element:

onabort| ondragleave| onload*| onratechange  
---|---|---|---  
onblur*| ondragover| onloadeddata| onreset  
oncancel| ondragstart| onloadedmetadata| onscroll  
oncanplay| ondrop| onloadstart| onseeked  
oncanplaythrough| ondurationchange| onmousedown| onseeking  
onchange| onemptied| onmousemove| onselect  
onclick| onended| onmouseout| onshow  
onclose**| onerror*| onmouseover| onsort**  
oncontextmenu| onfocus*| onmouseup| onstalled  
oncuechange| oninput| onmousewheel| onsubmit  
ondblclick| oninvalid| onpause| onsuspend  
ondrag| onkeydown| onplay| ontimeupdate  
ondragend| onkeypress| onplaying| onvolumechange  
ondragenter| onkeyup| onprogress| onwaiting

### Note

`onblur`, `onerror`, `onfocus`, and `onload` behave slightly differently when applied to the `body` element because the `body` element shares these event handlers with its parent window.

* Event handler for `Window` object when used with the `body` element.

** WHATWG and HTML5.1 only. Not in HTML5 Candidate Recommendation.

## Alphabetical List of Elements

This section contains a list of all elements and attributes in HTML and the living HTML document at WHATWG. Readers are advised to watch for these labels on elements and attributes:

 **Required**

Attributes marked as **Required** must be included in the element for the markup to be valid.

 **W3C HTML5 only**

Elements and attributes marked **W3C HTML5 only** appear only in the W3C HTML5 Candidate Recommendation and do not appear in the HTML5.1 Editor's Draft or WHATWG.

 **WHATWG only**

Elements and attributes marked **WHATWG only** appear only in the living HTML specification maintained by the WHATWG and are not part of the W3C Recommendation.

 **Not in HTML 4.01**

Elements and attributes marked **Not in HTML 4.01** are new in HTML5 and will cause documents using the HTML 4.01, XHTML1.0, and XHTML 1.1 DOCTYPEs to be invalid.

 **XHTML only**

Attributes marked **XHTML only** apply only to documents written in XHTML (XML) syntax.

## Name

a

## Synopsis

    <a> . . . </a>

##

Defines an _anchor_ that can be used as a hypertext link or a named fragment within the document. When the `href` attribute is set to a valid URI, the anchor is a hypertext link to a web page, page fragment, or another resource. The `id` attribute labels an anchor and allows it to serve as the destination point of a link. An `a` element may have both `href` and `id` attributes. The `href` attribute may be omitted to use an `a` element as a "placeholder link."

HTML5 permits flow content (block elements) within `a` elements. There must be no interactive content (`a`, `audio` with controls, `button`, `details`, `embed`, `iframe`, `img` with `usemap`, `input`, `keygen`, `label`, `object` with `usemap`, `select`, `textarea`, and `video` with controls) contained in an `a` element.

## Name

audio

## Synopsis

    <audio> . . . </audio>

##

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Embeds a sound file media in the web page without requiring a plug-in. The content of the `audio` element can be used by agents that don't support the element. The audio file may be provided with the `src` attribute. More commonly, because different browsers support different audio formats, a series of file format options are provided with `source` elements contained in the `audio` element. Other fallback content may be provided in the `audio` element for nonsupporting browsers.

There is still debate regarding the supported audio format for the `audio` element. No file format is supported by all browsers. As of this writing, browser support for available file formats is as follows:

 **IE 9+** (versions prior to 9 do not support the `audio` element): MP3, MP4, and WebM  
---  
 **Chrome 5+:** MP3, MP4, WAV, Ogg Vorbis, and WebM  
 **Firefox 3.5+:** WAV, Ogg Vorbis, and WebM (4+). MP3 and MP4 support will be added to Firefox but only when a third-party decoder is available.  
 **Safari 4+ and Mobile Safari 3+:** MP3, MP4, and WAV  
 **Android (2.0+):** MP3, WAV, Ogg Vorbis, and WebM (2.3.3+)

## Usage

Categories:

Start/end tags:

Required/Required

## Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

`autoplay` (or `autoplay="autoplay"` in XHTML)

Plays the media file automatically.

`controls` (or `controls="controls"` in XHTML)

Indicates that the user agent (browser) should display a set of playback controls for the media file.

`crossorigin="anonymous|use-credentials"`

Indicates if the user agent must check for credentials for a media file that is coming from a URL with a different origin than the source document. The default is `anonymous` (no credentials needed).

`loop` (or `loop="loop"` in XHTML)

Indicates that the media file should start playing again automatically once it reaches the end.

`mediagroup="` _`text`_`"`

Links multiple media elements together by assigning them the same `mediagroup` value.

`muted` (or `muted="muted"` in XHTML)

Disables (mutes) the audio output, even if it overrides user preferences.

`preload="none|metadata|auto"`

Hints to the browser whether the media file should begin to load automatically based on anticipated best user experience. `none` prevents the preload; `metadata` does not download the media file, but does fetch the resource metadata; `auto` leaves the decision to preload to the user agent.

`src="` _`URL`_`"`

Specifies the location of the media file.

## Examples

See also `source`.

     **< audio src="soundtrack.webm" autoplay controls>**
       Your browser does not support embedded audio.

## Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

`autofocus` (`autofocus="autofocus"` in XHTML)

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates the control should have focus (be highlighted and ready for user input) when the document loads.

`disabled` (`disabled="disabled"` in XHTML)

Disables the control for user input. It can be altered only via a script. Browsers may display disabled controls differently (grayed out, for example), which could be useful for dimming certain controls until required info is supplied.

`form="` _`id of the form owner`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Explicitly associates the input control with its associated form (its _form owner_ ). With this method, the input control does not need to be a child of the `form` element that applies to it.

`formaction="` _`URL`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies the application that will process the form. It is used only with a submit button (`input type=``"submit"`) and has the same function as the `action` attribute for the `form` element.

`formenctype="` _`content type`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies how the form values are encoded with the `post` method type. It is used only with a submit button (`input type="submit"`) and has the same function as the `enctype` attribute for the `form` element. The default is Internet Media Type `(application/x-www-form-urlencoded`). The value `multipart/form-data` should be used in combination with the `file` input type. The value `text/plain` sets the MIME type of the submitted data to be text/plain.

`formmethod="get|post"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies which HTTP method will be used to submit the form data. It is used only with a submit button (`input type="submit"`) and has the same function as the `method` attribute for the `form` element.

`formnovalidate="` _`URL`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates that the form is not to be validated during submission. It is used only with a submit button (`input type="submit"`) and has the same function as the `novalidate` attribute for the `form` element (new in HTML5).

`formtarget="` _`name`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies the target window for the form results. It is used only with a submit button (`input type=``"submit"`) and has the same function as the `target` attribute for the `form` element.

`menu="` _`text`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. If the button's `type` attribute is set to `menu`, this attribute is required to provide the ID of a `menu` element on the same page with its `type` set to `popup`.

`name="` _`text`_`"`

 **Required**. Assigns the control name for the element.

`type="submit|reset|button|menu"`

Identifies the behavior of the button: `submit` (submit button, the default type), `reset` (reset button), `button` (custom button controlled with JavaScript), or `menu` (shows a menu).

`value="` _`text`_`"`

Assigns the value to the button control. The behavior of the button is determined by the `type` attribute.

## Example

     **<button type="reset" name="reset">**<img src="thumbs-down.
    gif" alt="thumbs-down icon"> Try again. **</button>**

## Name

canvas

## Synopsis

    <canvas> . . . </canvas>

##

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Represents a two-dimensional area that can be used for rendering dynamic bitmap graphics, such as graphs, games, drawing programs, animations, and so on. The markup establishes a rectangular space on the page for the canvas. The image on the canvas is generated with scripting (usually JavaScript).

The `canvas` element is one of the better supported HTML5 features, with basic support in Firefox 2.0+, Safari 3.1+, Chrome 1.0+, Internet Explorer 9+, and Opera 9.0. The FlashCanvas JavaScript library (flashcanvas.net) can add canvas support to nonsupporting browsers using the Flash drawing API.

## Name

col

## Synopsis

`<col>` (XHTML: `<col/>` or `<col />`)

##

Establishes a column (or columns via the `span` attribute) within a table so that attribute properties may be applied to all the cells in the column(s). The `col` element does not group columns structurally (that is handled by the `colgroup` element) but rather is an empty element that allows attributes to be shared. The `col` element must appear after the `caption` element and before any row (`tr`) or row group (`thead`, `tbody`, `tfoot`) elements with the `table` element.

## Usage

Categories:

None

Permitted contexts:

As the child of a `colgroup` element that doesn't have a `span` attribute

Permitted content:

Empty

Start/end tags:

This is an empty (void) element, meaning it has only a start tag and may not have any contents. In HTML, the end tag is forbidden. In XHTML, the element must be closed with a trailing slash (`<col/>` or `<col />`).

## Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

`span="` _`number`_`"`

Specifies the number of columns "spanned" by the `col` element. The default value is 1. All columns indicated in the span are formatted according to the attribute settings in `col`.

## Example (HTML):

 _See also_ `colgroup` _and_ `table`.

    <table>
      **<** **col span=** " **2** " **width=** " **100** " **class=** " **name** " **>**
      **<col span=**" **1** " **width=** " **50** " **class=** " **date** " **>**
      <thead> . . .
      ( _markup continues_ )

## Name

colgroup

## Synopsis

    <colgroup> . . . </colgroup>

##

Defines a conceptual group of columns that form a structural division within a table. The `colgroup` element must appear after the `caption` element and before any row (`tr`) or row group (`thead`, `tbody`, `tfoot`) elements with the `table` element.

A table may include more than one column group. The number of columns in a group is specified either by the value of the `span` attribute or by a tally of column (`col`) elements within the group. Column groups may be useful in speeding table display (for example, the columns can be displayed incrementally without waiting for the entire contents of the table) and provide a system for display on nonvisual display agents such as speech- and Braille-based browsers.

## Usage

Categories:

None

Permitted contexts:

As a child of a `table` element, after any `caption` elements and before any `thead`, `tbody`, `tfoot`, and `tr` elements.

Permitted content:

If it has a `span` attribute, then it is empty. If the `span` attribute is absent, then it should contain one or more `col` elements.

Start/end tags:

The start tag is optional if it has `col` as its first child and it is not preceded by a `colgroup` start tag without an end tag. The end tag is optional if the `colgroup` is not immediately followed by a space character or comment. (XHTML: Required/Required.)

## Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

`span="` _`number`_`"`

## Name

command

## Synopsis

`<command>` (XHTML: `<command/>` or `<command />`)

##

 **HTML5 only**. Used within a `menu` element, a `command` is an interactive element that represents an immediate action that can be triggered by the user (usually via `onclick`).

## Notes

The `command` element has been replaced by the `menuitem` element in HTML5.1 and the WHATWG specification, and should not be used. See the `menu` and `menuitem` listings.

## Usage

Categories:

Metadata content, flow content, phrasing content

Permitted contexts:

Where metadata content is expected; where phrasing content is expected

Indicates the kind of command. The `command` keyword indicates a normal command with an associated action. `checkbox` indicates the command state can be toggled on or off. `radio` indicates the command represents the selection of one item from a list of items.

## Example

Note: `menuitem` has replaced `command` in HTML5.1 and the living WHATWG spec.

    <menu>
       **<command** onclick="cut()" label="Cut" **>**
       **<command** onclick="copy()" label="Copy" **>**

datalist

## Synopsis

    <datalist> . . . </datalist>

##

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Used with an `input` control set to the new `list` type, the `datalist` element creates a drop-down menu of pre-defined suggestions (via the `option` element), providing an "auto-complete" function as the user types in the field (called a _combobox_ ).

## Name

embed

## Synopsis

`<embed>` (XHTML: `<embed/>` or `<embed />`)

##

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Embeds an object into the web page. Embedded objects are most often multimedia files that use plug-in technology for playback (for example, Flash movies, QuickTime movies, and the like). In addition to the attributes listed below, certain media types and their respective plug-ins may have proprietary attributes for controlling the playback of the file.

## Notes

Although commonly supported by browsers, the `embed` element was not part of the HTML 4.01 or earlier specifications (in favor of the `object` element for embedded media); however, it has been added to the HTML5. Because it was supported but not documented, it has many browser- and media-specific attributes, and its syntax is not clear. Many developers use both `object` and `embed` for a single media object for backward compatibility, even though it does not conform to the standard.

## Usage

Categories:

Flow content, phrasing content, embedded content, interactive content, palpable content

Permitted contexts:

Where embedded content is expected

Permitted content:

Empty

Start/end tags:

In HTML5, `embed` is specified as an empty element with no closing tag. Modern browsers generally support `embed` with a closing tag as well.

## HTML5 Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

 **Note:** Some plug-ins require their own proprietary attributes for the `embed` element. Read the documentation for the media type you are trying to embed.

`height="` _`number`_`"`

Specifies the height of the object in number of pixels. Some media types require this attribute.

`src="` _`URL`_`"`

Provides the location of the resource to be placed on the page.

`type="` _`media (MIME) type`_`"`

Specifies the MIME type of the media in order to load the appropriate plug-in. The suffix of the file name given as the source may also be used to determine which plug-in to use.

`width="` _`number`_`"`

Specifies the width of the object in number of pixels. Some media types require this attribute.

## Example (HTML5)

     **<embed** src="movies/vacation.mov" width="240" height="196"
    type="video/quicktime" **>**

## Nonstandard example with end tag

     **<embed** src="movies/vacation.mov" width="240" height="196"
     pluginspage="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/" **>**
    <noembed><img src="vacation.gif"> You do not seem to have
    the plugin.</noembed>
    **</embed>**

## Name

## Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

`disabled` (`disabled="disabled"` in XHTML)

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Disables the controls contained in the `fieldset`. It can be altered only via a script. Browsers may display disabled controls differently (grayed out, for example), which could be useful for dimming certain controls until required info is supplied.

`form="` _`id of the form owner`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Explicitly associates the fieldset with its associated form (its _form owner_ ). With this method, the `fieldset` does not need to be a child of the `form` element that applies to it.

`name="` _`text`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Assigns a name to the `fieldset`.

## Example

    <form>
    **<fieldset** id="customer" **>**

## Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

`accept-charset="` _`charset list`_`"`

Specifies the list of character encodings for input data that must be accepted by the server to process the current form. The value is a space- and/or comma-delimited list of ISO character set names. The default value is `unknown`. This attribute is not widely supported.

`action="` _`URL`_`"`

 **Required**. Specifies the URL of the application that will process the form. The default is the current URL.

`autocomplete="on|off"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Allows the user agent (browser) to fill in a field automatically (`on`) or requires the user to enter the information every time (`off`).

`enctype="` _`content type`_`"`

Specifies how the values for the form controls are encoded when they are submitted to the server when the method is `post`. The default is the Internet Media Type (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` ). The value `multipart/form-data` should be used in combination with the `file` input element. The new `text/plain` value sets the MIME type to text/plain.

`method="GET|POST"`

Specifies which HTTP method will be used to submit the form data. With `get` (the default), the information is appended to and sent along with the URL itself.

`name="` _`text`_`"`

Assigns a name to the form.

`novalidate` (`novalidate="novalidate"` in XHTML)

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates that the form is not to be validated during submission.

`target="` _`name`_`"`

Specifies a target for the results of the form submission to be loaded so that results of a form can be displayed in another window or `iframe`. The special target values `_bottom`, `_top`, `_parent`, and `_self` may be used.

## Example

     **< form action="/mailinglist.php" method="POST">**
      <fieldset>

      </ol>
      </fieldset>
    **< /form>**

## Name

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6

## Synopsis

    <h _n_ > . . . </h _n_ >

##

Specifies a heading that briefly describes the section it introduces. There are six levels of headings, from `h1` (most important) to `h6` (least important). HTML syntax requires that headings appear in order (for example, an `h2` should not precede an `h1`) for proper document structure. Doing so not only improves accessibility, but aids in search engine optimization (information in higher heading levels is given more weight).

## Note

In HTML5, heading order can be repeated within sections of the same document, allowing greater flexibility with heading levels. This is to aid the outlining of documents and allows sections of a document to fall into the outline correctly no matter which document the section appears in. The HTML5 outline algorithm is not well supported as of this writing.

## Name

head

## Synopsis

    <head> . . . </head>

##

Contains information about the document, a collection of metadata. Every `head` element must include a `title` element that provides a description of the document. The `head` element may also include any of these elements in any order: `base`, `link`, `meta`, `noscript`, `script`, and `style`. The `head` element merely acts as a container of these elements and does not have any content of its own.

## Usage

Categories:

None

Permitted contexts:

As the first element in an `html` element

Permitted content:

Zero or more elements of metadata content (`base`, `command`, `link`, `meta`, `noscript`, `script`, `style`, `title`) with exactly one `title` element. If the document is an `iframe srcdoc`, the `title` element is not required.

## Name

hgroup

## Synopsis

    <hgroup> . . . </hgroup>

##

 **Not in HTML 4.01 or HTML5.1**. Used to group a stack of `h1`–`h6` headings so that subsequent heading levels are treated as subheads or taglines and do not contribute to the outline structure of the page.

## Note

The `hgroup` element has been flagged for removal from HTML5. It is included here merely to duplicate the state of the HTML5 spec as of this writing, but it is considered obsolete due to lack of implementation and should not be used.

## Name

img

## Synopsis

`<img>` (XHTML: `<img/>` or `<img />`)

##

Represents an image in the content flow. The `src` and `alt` attributes are required.

## Usage

Categories:

Flow content, phrasing content, embedded content, palpable content, interactive content if it has a `usemap` attribute

Permitted contexts:

Where embedded content is expected

Permitted content:

Empty

Start/end tags:

This is an empty (void) element, meaning it has only a start tag and may not have any contents. In HTML, the end tag is forbidden. In XHTML, the element must be closed with a trailing slash (`<img/>` or `<img />`).

## Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

`alt="` _`text`_`"`

 **Required**. Provides a string of alternative text that appears when the image is not or cannot be displayed.

`crossorigin="anonymous|use-credentials "`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. On a site that allows cross-origin access files, this attribute indicates if requests from other domains must present credentials to access the image.

`height="` _`number`_`"`

Specifies the height of the image in pixels. It is not required, but is recommended to speed up the rendering of the web page.

`ismap` (`ismap="ismap"` in XHTML)

Indicates that the graphic is used as the basis for a server-side _image map_ (an image containing multiple hypertext links).

`src="` _`URL`_`"`

 **Required**. Provides the location of the graphic file to be displayed.

`srcset="` _`image candidate string`_`"`

 **WHATWG only**. Allows authors to specify alternative images for different viewport sizes and higher pixel densities. The value is a comma-separated list of image locations with a descriptor that specifies the device requirements for its use. For example, `srcset=` **`"`**`image-HD.jpg 2x, image-phone.jpg 240w` **`"`** instructs user agents to use _image-HD.jpg_ if the display has double pixel density (such as the Apple Retina display) and to use _image-phone.png_ if the device width is up to 240 pixels.

`usemap="` _`URL`_`"`

Specifies the map containing coordinates and links for a _client-side image map_ (an image containing multiple hypertext links).

`width="` _`number`_`"`

Specifies the width of the image in pixels. It is not required but is recommended to speed up the rendering of the web page.

## Example

    <p>Your ideal pet: **<img src="**pig.gif **" alt="** A pig **">**</p>

## Name

input

## Synopsis

`<input>` (XHTML: `<input/>` or `<input />`)

##

The `input` element is used to create a variety of form input controls. The type of control is defined by the `type` attribute. Following is a complete list of attributes (with descriptions) that can be used with the `input` element. Not all attributes can be used with all control types. The attributes associated with each control type are listed below.

## Usage

Categories:

Flow content, phrasing content. If the `type` attribute is _not_ in the Hidden state, then interactive content, palpable content, as well as "listed, labelable, submittable, and resettable form-associated content." If the `type` attribute is in the Hidden state, then "listed, submittable, and resettable form-associated content."

Permitted contexts:

Where phrasing content is expected

Permitted content:

Empty

Start/end tags:

This is an empty (void) element, meaning it has only a start tag and may not have any contents. In HTML, the end tag is forbidden. In XHTML, the element must be closed with a trailing slash (`<input/>` or `<input />`).

## Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

`accept="` _`MIME type`_`"`

Specifies a comma-separated list of content types that a server processing the form will handle correctly. It can be used to filter out nonconforming files when prompting a user to select files to send to the server. Applies to the `file` input type only.

`alt="` _`text`_`"`

Specifies alternative text for an image used as a button. Applies to the `image` input type.

`autocomplete="on|off"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Allows the user agent (browser) to fill in a field automatically (`on`) or requires the user to enter the information every time (`off`). Omitting this attribute causes the control to inherit the `autocomplete` setting for the associated `form` element. Applies to input types `text`, `password`, `email`, `tel`, `search`, `url`, `number`, `range`, `date`, `time`, `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `month`, `week`, and `color`.

`autofocus` (`autofocus="autofocus"` in XHTML)

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates the control should have focus (be highlighted and ready for user input) when the document loads. Applies to all input types.

`checked` (`checked="checked"` in XHTML)

When this attribute is added to a radio button or checkbox input, the input will be checked when the page loads. Applies to the `checkbox` and `radio` input types.

`dirname="` _`text string`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Enables the submission of the directionality of the element (`ltr` or `rtl`) by providing the name of the field that contains the value. This could enable a form to have a user-selected direction setting for form entries. Applies to the `text` and `search` input types.

`disabled` (`disabled="disabled"` in XHTML)

Disables the control for user input. It can be altered only via a script. Browsers may display disabled controls differently (grayed out, for example), which could be useful for dimming certain controls until required information is supplied. Applies to all input types.

`form="` _`id of the form owner`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Explicitly associates the input control with its associated form (its _form owner_ ). With this method, the input control does not need to be a child of the applicable `form` element. Applies to all input types.

`formaction="` _`URL`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies the application that will process the form. It is used only with a submit button (`type=``"submit"` or `"image"`) and has the same function as the `action` attribute for the `form` element.

`formenctype="` _`content type`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies how the form values are encoded with the `post` method type. It is used only with a submit button (`type="submit"` or `"image"`) and has the same function as the `enctype` attribute for the `form` element. The default is Internet Media Type `(application/x-www-form-urlencoded`). The value `multipart/form-data` should be used in combination with the `file` input type. The `text/plain` value sets the MIME type to `text/plain`.

`formmethod="get|post"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies which HTTP method will be used to submit the form data. It is used only with a submit button (`type="submit"` or `"image"`) and has the same function as the `method` attribute for the `form` element.

`formnovalidate` (`formnovalidate="formnovalidate"` in XHTML)

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates that the form is not to be validated during submission. It is used only with a submit button (`type="submit"` or `"image"`) and has the same function as the `novalidate` attribute for the `form` element.

`formtarget="` _`name`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies the target window for the form results. It is used only with a submit button (`type="submit"` or `"image"`) and has the same function as the `target` attribute for the `form` element.

`height="` _`number of pixels`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies the height of the button image when the input type is set to `image`.

`inputmode="verbatim|latin|latin-name|latin-prose|``full-width-latin|kana|katakana|numeric|tel|email|url"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates what kind of input mechanism would be most helpful for users entering content into the form control. Applies to the `text` and `search` input types.

`list="` _`id of datalist`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates that the control has a list of predefined suggestions for the user, which are provided by a `datalist` element.

Applies to input types `text`, `email`, `tel`, `search`, `url`, `number`, `range`, `date`, `time`, `datetime-local`, `datetime`, `month`, `week`, and `color`.

`max="` _`number or string`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies the upper boundary of the accepted value range for the element. The `max` value must not be less than the `min` value. Applies to input types `number`, `range`, `date`, `time`, `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `month`, and `week`.

`maxlength="` _`number`_`"`

Specifies the maximum number of characters the user can enter for input elements set to `text`, `password`, `email`, `search`, `tel`, or `url`.

`min="` _`number or string`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies the lower boundary of the accepted value range for the element. The `min` value defines the base for `step` operations. Applies to input types `number`, `range`, `date`, `time`, `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `month`, and `week`.

`multiple` (`multiple="multiple"` in XHTML)

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates the user is allowed to specify more than one value. Applies to `file` and `email` input types.

`name="` _`text`_`"`

Assigns a name to the control; a script program uses this name to reference the control.

`pattern="` _`JavaScript regular expression`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies a regular expression against which the control's value is to be checked. This is useful for making sure user input matches the format of the expected value, for example, a telephone number or an email address. The `title` attribute can be used with `pattern` to provide a description of the expected pattern/format of the input. Applies to `text`, `password`, `email`, `tel`, `search`, and `url` input types.

`src="` _`URL`_`"`

When the input type is `image`, this attribute provides the location of the image to be used as a push button.

`step="any` _`|number`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates the granularity that is expected and required of the value by limiting the allowed value to permitted units. The value of this attribute is dependent on the `type` of the input control. It may be a number greater than zero or the keyword `any`, which allows any unit value. Applies to `number`, `range`, `date`, `time`, `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `month`, and `week`.

`type="button|checkbox|color|date|time|datetime|``datetime-local|email|file|hidden|image|month|number|``password|radio|range|reset|search|submit|tel|text|url|week"`

The content of this element may be rendered if the user agent doesn't support scripting, if scripting support is turned off, or if the browser doesn't recognize the scripting language. When `noscript` appears in the `head` of a document and scripting is disabled, it may only contain `link`, `style`, and `meta` elements.

## Notes

`noscript` is not to be used in the XML syntax of HTML5 because the element relies on an HTML parser.

## Usage

Categories:

Metadata content, flow content, phrasing content

Permitted contexts:

In a `head` element if there are no ancestor `noscript` elements. Where phrasing content is expected if there are no ancestor `noscript` elements.

Permitted content:

When scripting is disabled and the element is in a `head` element, it may contain in any order, zero or more `link` elements, `style` elements, and/or `meta` elements. When scripting is disabled and it is not in a `head` element, it is transparent (content model is derived from parent element) but it must not contain any `noscript` elements. Otherwise, it may have text content.

## Name

object

## Synopsis

    <object> . . . </object>

##

A generic element used for embedding an external resource (such as an image, applet, movie, or audio) on a web page. The attributes required for the `object` element vary with the type of content it is placing. The embedded content may be treated as an image, a nested browsing context, or may be processed by a plug-in. The `object` element may contain content that will be rendered if the object cannot be embedded. The `object` element may also contain a number of `param` elements that pass important information to the object when it displays or plays. Not all objects require additional parameters. The `object` and `param` elements work together to allow authors to specify three types of information:

  * The implementation of the object—that is, the executable code that runs in order to render the object.

  * The data to be rendered. The `data` attribute specifies the location of the resource, in most cases an external file, such as a movie or a PDF.

  * Additional settings required by the object at runtime. Some embedded media objects require additional settings that get called into play when the object plays or is rendered.

## Usage

Categories:

Flow content, phrasing content, embedded content, interactive (if it has a `usemap` attribute), palpable content, "listed, submittable, form-associated element"

Permitted contexts:

Where embedded content is expected

In HTML5, the `style` element may be used in the content of the document. In HTML 4.01, it must appear in the `head` of a document.

## Usage

Categories:

Metadata content, flow content (if the `scoped` attribute is present)

Permitted contexts:

Where metadata is expected or in a `noscript` element that is the child of a `head` element. If the `scoped` attribute is present, where flow content is expected, but before any other flow content other than interelement whitespace and not as the child of an element whose content model is transparent.

Permitted content:

Style rules, dependent on the value of the `type` attribute. HTML5 assumes the styling language to be in CSS syntax.

Start/end tags:

Required/Required

## Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

`media="all|aural|braille|handheld|print|projection|screen|tty|tv"`

Specifies the intended destination medium for the style information. It may be a single keyword or a comma-separated list. The default in the HTML 4.01 spec is `screen`. In HTML5, the default is `all`.

`scoped` (`scoped="scoped"` in XHTML)

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Applies the styles only to the local document tree (i.e., only the descendants of the parent of the `style` element) rather than the whole document.

`type="` _`content type`_`"` (`text/css`)

 **Required in HTML 4.01 only**. Specifies the stylesheet language. For Cascading Style Sheets (currently the only style type option), the value is `text/css`. In HTML5, the `type` attribute is optional if using CSS.

`xml:space="preserve"`

 **XHTML only**. Instructs XML processors to preserve the whitespace in the element.

## Example (HTML5 and CSS)

    <head>
      **< style>**
         h1 {color: #666;}
         p {line-height: 2;}
      **< /style>**
      <title>Scientific Presentation</title>
    </head>

## Example (HTML 4.01 and CSS)

table

## Synopsis

    <table> . . . </table>

##

Indicates a table used for displaying rows and columns of data or information. The minimum elements for defining a table are `table` for establishing the table itself, `tr` for declaring a table row, and `td` for creating table cells within the row. The complete table model is shown below.

## Usage

Categories:

Flow content, palpable content

Permitted contexts:

Where flow content is expected

Permitted content:

In this order: optional `caption` element, then zero or more `colgroup` elements, followed optionally by a `thead` element, followed optionally by a `tfoot` element, followed by either zero or more `tbody` elements or one or more `tr` elements, followed optionally by a `tfoot` element (there may only be one `tfoot` element total)

Start/end tags:

Required/Required

## Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

`border="` _`number of pixels`_`"`

 **W3C only**. Specifies the width (in pixels) of the border around the table and its cells. Setting its value to 0 (zero) turns the borders off completely. The default value is 1. Adding the word `border` without a value results in a 1-pixel border, although this is not valid in XHTML.

`sortable` (`sortable="sortable"` in XHTML)

 **WHATWG & HTML5.1 only**. When present, it indicates the table's contents may be sorted by column. It is used in conjunction with the `sorted` attribute on the `th` element, which can be set manually or by the user agent when the user clicks a column.

## Examples

A simple table with two rows (two `tr` elements) and three columns (three `td` elements in each `tr`):

     **<table>**
      <tr>
        <td>cell 1</td>
        <td>cell 2</td>
        <td>cell 3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>cell 4</td>
        <td>cell 5</td>
        <td>cell 6</td>
      </tr>
    **< /** **table>**

The proper element order in the full table model (for details, see the `caption`, `tbody`, `thead`, `tfoot`, `colgroup`, and `col` element entries):

     **<table>**
      **<caption>**Employee salaries and start dates **</caption>**
      **<colgroup** id="employeeinfo" **>**
        **<col** span="2" **>**
        **<col** span="1" **>**
      **</colgroup>**
    **< thead>**
      <tr>
        <th>Employee</th><th>Salary</th><th>Start date</th>
      </tr>
    **< /thead>**
    **< tfoot>**
      <tr>
        <td colspan="3">Compiled by Betty D. Boss</td>
      </tr>
    **< /tfoot>**
    **< tbody>**
      <tr>
        <td>Wilma</td><td>50,000</td><td>April 6</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>...more data cells...</tr>
      <tr>...more data cells...</tr>
    **< /tbody>**
    **< /table>**

## Name

tbody

## Synopsis

    <tbody> . . . </tbody>

##

Defines a row or group of rows as the "body" of the table. It must contain at least one row element (`tr`). "Row group" elements (`tbody`, `thead`, and `tfoot`) could speed table display and provide a mechanism for scrolling the body of a table independently of its head and foot, or repeat the head and foot when a long table is printed across several pages.

## Usage

Categories:

None

Permitted contexts:

As the child of a `table` element, after any `caption`, `colgroup`, and `thead` elements, but only if there are no `tr` elements that are children of the table element

Permitted content:

## Name

textarea

## Synopsis

    <textarea> . . . </textarea>

##

Defines a multiline text entry control. The content of the `textarea` element is displayed in the text entry field when the form initially displays and will be sent to the server. It is common for developers to put nothing in the `textarea` element and use the `placeholder` or `title` attributes to provide a hint of what to write instead.

Flow content, phrasing content, interactive content, palpable content, and "listed, labelable, submittable and resettable form-associated element"

Permitted contexts:

Where phrasing content is expected

Permitted content:

Text

Start/end tags:

Required/Required

## Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

`autocomplete="on|off"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Allows the user agent (browser) to fill in a field automatically (`on`) or requires the user to enter the information every time (`off`). Omitting this attribute causes the control to inherit the `autocomplete` setting for the associated `form` element.

`autofocus` (`autofocus="autofocus"` in XHTML)

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates the control should have focus (be highlighted and ready for user input) when the document loads.

`cols="` _`number`_`"`

Specifies the expected maximum number of characters per line. Visual browsers wrap the user's input so each line is less than the `cols` value. If `wrap` is set to `hard`, then the `cols` attribute is required.

`dirname="` _`name of input field`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies the name of an `input` field that has text direction (`ltr` or `rtl`) instructions for the `textarea`.

`disabled` (`disabled="disabled"` in XHTML)

Disables the control for user input. It can be altered only via a script. Browsers may display disabled controls differently (grayed out, for example), which could be useful for dimming certain controls until required info is supplied.

`form="` _`id of form owner`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Explicitly associates the `textarea` control with its associated form (its _form owner_ ). With this method, the `textarea` does not need to be a child of the `form` element that applies to it.

`inputmode="verbatim|latin|latin-name|latin-prose|``full-width-latin|kana|katakana|numeric|tel|email|url"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Indicates what kind of input mechanism would be most helpful for users entering content into the form control. Applies to the `text` and `search` input types.

`maxlength="` _`number`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Specifies the maximum number of characters the user can input for the `textarea` element.

`name="` _`text`_`"`

 **Required**. Specifies a name for the control. This name will be sent along with the control content to the form-processing application.

`placeholder="` _`text`_`"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Provides a short (one word or short phrase) hint or example to help the user enter the correct data. If a longer description is necessary, use the `title` attribute.

`readonly` (`readonly="readonly"` in XHTML)

Indicates that the form control may not be modified.

`required` (`required="required"` in XHTML)

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. When present, indicates the user must enter a value in the control before submitting the form.

`rows="` _`number`_`"`

Specifies the height of the text entry field in number of lines of text. If the user enters more lines than are visible, the text field scrolls down to accommodate the extra lines.

`wrap="hard|soft"`

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. When set to `hard`, hard returns (carriage return + line feed characters) are inserted at the end of lines as they appear in text entry field. When set to `hard`, there must also be a `cols` attribute specifying the length of the line. When set to `soft` (the default), line breaks in the text entry field are not preserved in the returned data.

## Examples

    <p><label for="loveband">Official Contest Entry</label></p>
    **<textarea** name="band" id="loveband" rows="4" cols="45" **>** Tell
    us why you love the band. **</textarea>**

    <p><label for="loveband">Official Contest Entry</label></p>

##

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Embeds a video file in the web page. The video resource can be provided with the `src` attribute or by one or more `source` elements inside the `video` element to provide several video format options. Other fallback content may be provided in the `video` element to display by agents that don't support the `video` element.

## Notes

There is still debate regarding the supported video formats for the `video` element. No file format is supported by all browsers. As of this writing, browser support for available file formats is as follows:

 **IE 9+** (versions prior to 9 do not support the `video` element): MP4/H.264 (MIME type needs to be set correctly on the server for video to play), and WebM (by installing components from The WebM project at _www.webmproject.org_).  
---  
 **Chrome 5+:** MP4 (H.264 + AAC), Ogg Theora/Vorbis, and WebM (6+)  
 **Firefox 3.5+:** Ogg Theora/Vorbis, and WebM (4+)  
 **Safari 4+ and Mobile Safari 3+:** MP4 (H.264 + AAC)  
 **Android (2.1+):** MP4 (H.264 + AAC), and WebM (2.3.3+)

## Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

`autoplay` (`autoplay="autoplay"` in XHTML)

Makes the media file start playing automatically.

`controls` (`controls="controls"` in XHTML)

Indicates that the user agent (browser) should display a set of playback controls for the media file, generally a play/pause button, a "seeker" that lets you move to a position within the video, and volume controls.

`crossorigin="anonymous|use-credentials"`

Indicates if the user agent must check for credentials for a media file that is coming from a URL with a different origin than the source document. The default is `anonymous` (no credentials needed).

`height="` _`number`_`"`

## Name

wbr

## Synopsis

`<wbr>` (XHTML: `<wbr/>` or `<wbr />`)

##

 **Not in HTML 4.01**. Represents a line break opportunity within a word, allowing the author to instruct at which point a long word should optimally break. The line will only break at the location of the `wbr` element if it needs to.

## Usage

Categories:

Flow content, phrasing content

Permitted contexts:

Where phrasing content is expected

Permitted content:

Empty

Start/end tags:

This is an empty (void) element, meaning it has only a start tag and may not have any contents. In HTML, the end tag is forbidden. In XHTML, the element must be closed with a trailing slash (`<wbr/>` or `<wbr />`).

## Attributes

 _HTML5 Global Attributes_

## Example

    <p>The biggest word you've ever heard & this is how it goes:
    <em>supercali **<wbr>**fragilistic **<wbr>**expialidocious</em>!</p>

## Appendix A. Character Entities

Characters not found in the normal alphanumeric character set, such as < and &, may be specified in HTML and XHTML documents using character references. This process is known as _escaping_ the character. Escaped characters are indicated by character references that begin with `&` and end with `;`. The character may be referred to by its Numeric Character Reference (NCR) or a predefined character entity name.

A _Numeric Character Reference_ refers to a character by its Unicode code point in either decimal or hexadecimal form. Hexadecimal values are indicated by an "x": `&#xhhhh;`. Decimal character references use the syntax `&#nnnn;` (no "x" character). For example, the em-dash (—) character has the Unicode code point U+02014, which can be identified as `&#x2014` (hexadecimal) or `&#8212;` (decimal) in an HTML document.

 _Character entities_ (or _Named Character References_ ) are abbreviated names for characters, such as `&lt;` for the less-than symbol. Character entities are predefined in markup languages such as HTML and XHTML as a convenience to authors because they may be easier to remember than Numeric Character References. HTML 4.01 defined 252 character entities. That number has grown to more than 2,000 in HTML5.

The remainder of this section lists only the most commonly used character references and entities. For additional character references, see the following resources:

## XML Named Entities

In XHTML and other XML languages, the quote, ampersand, apostrophe, less-than, and greater-than symbols must always be escaped in the content and metadata of the document.

## Appendix B. XHTML Syntax Overview

 _XHTML_ (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) is a reformulation of HTML according to the stricter syntax rules of XML (eXtensible Markup Language). HTML5 can be written using XHTML syntax (formally called the XML Serialization of HTML5). This section describes the ways in which XHTML syntax differs from HTML.

Because XHTML is an XML language, its syntax is stricter and differs from HTML in these key ways:

  * All element names and attributes must be lowercase. For example, `<a href="example.com">...</a>`.

  * All elements must be terminated—that is, they must include an end tag. For example, `<p>...</p>`.

  * Empty elements must be terminated as well. This is done by including a slash at the end of the tag. A space is commonly added before the slash for backward compatibility with older browsers—for example, `<hr />`, `<img />`, and `<meta />`.

  * All attribute values must be contained in quotation marks (either single or double). For example, `<td colspan="2">`.

  * All attribute values must be explicit and may not be minimized to one word, as is permitted in HTML—for example, `checked="checked"`.

  * Nesting restrictions are more strictly enforced. These restrictions are explicitly stated:

    * An `a` element cannot contain another `a` element.

    * The `pre` element cannot contain `img`, `object`, `applet`, `big`, `small`, `sub`, `sup`, `font`, or `basefont`.

    * The `form` element may not contain other `form` elements.

    * A `button` element cannot contain `a`, `form`, `input`, `select`, `textarea`, `label`, `button`, `iframe`, or `isindex`.

    * The `label` element cannot contain other `label` elements.

  * The special characters `<`, `>`, `&`, `'`, and `"` must always be represented by their character entities, including when they appear within attribute values. For example, `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&apos;`, and `&quot;` (respectively).

  * XHTML documents must use `id` instead of `name` for identifying document fragments and in `a`, `applet`, `form`, `frame`, `iframe`, `img`, and `map` elements.

  * XHTML documents should be served as XML applications, not as HTML text documents. More specifically, the server should be configured to serve XHTML documents with the Content-type header set to `application/xhtml+xml`. If it is not possible to configure the server, the content type may be specified in a `meta` element in the document's `head`, as shown in this example:

        <meta http-equiv="content-type"
      content=" **application/xhtml+xml** ; charset=UTF-8" />

Unfortunately, some popular browsers (Internet Explorer in particular) cannot parse XHTML documents as XML, causing pages to break. For more information on XHTML MIME types, see _www.w3.org/TR/xhtm-media-types/_.

## Index

### A note on the digital index

A link in an index entry is displayed as the section title in which that entry appears. Because some sections have multiple index markers, it is not unusual for an entry to have several links to the same section. Clicking on any link will take you directly to the place in the text in which the marker appears.
