# Context

_One Work_ is a unique series of books published by Afterall, based at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design in London. Each book presents a single work of art considered in detail by a single author. The focus of the series is on contemporary art and its aim is to provoke debate about significant moments in art's recent development.

Over the course of more than one hundred books, important works will be presented in a meticulous and generous manner by writers who believe passionately in the originality and significance of the works about which they have chosen to write. Each book contains a comprehensive and detailed formal description of the work, followed by a critical mapping of the aesthetic and cultural context in which it was made and has gone on to shape. The changing presentation and reception of the work throughout its existence is also discussed, and each writer stakes a claim on the influence 'their' work has on the making and understanding of other works of art.

The books insist that a single contemporary work of art (in all of its different manifestations), through a unique and radical aesthetic articulation or invention, can affect our understanding of art in general. More than that, these books suggest that a single work of art can literally transform, however modestly, the way we look at and understand the world. In this sense the _One Work_ series, while by no means exhaustive, will eventually become a veritable library of works of art that have made a difference.

Thanks to those friends from Cardiff in the early 1980s engaged in the debate on 'art and politics'; Martin Gaughan and David Mabb offered essential support and encouragement then and remain good friends now. Alistair Rider read the manuscript and suggested sensible changes. John X. Berger's input on this project has been invaluable as an interlocutor and reader. Thanks also to Julia Welbourne. Alex Potts and Susan Siegfried provided hospitality; Allan Sekula, Andrew Hemingway, Carol Duncan, Rosie Harman, Dominic Ratz and Evan Calder Williams all provided essential help. I am grateful to The Open University for enabling me to take study leave at a busy time, and for financial support. The Generali Foundation, Vienna kindly allowed me access to its collection of documents and videotapes. I think that on almost every occasion that I have seen _The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ , I have been in the company of Gail Day – her contribution has been too immense for words (or pictures). I tried not to use Martha Rosler as a source of information and ideas when working on this small book, while inundating her with requests for pictures and other essential things. I would like to thank her for gracefully accepting exclusion from her work; she has been both tolerant of my foibles and exceptionally generous. The editors would also like to thank the artist for her invaluable help with visual and other materials.

#### **An Encounter**

Some uncertainty surrounded the production and first exhibition of Martha Rosler's _The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ (1974—75, fig.3—), but from the contact sheets we know she took the photographs in two separate sessions during December 1974 and January 1975, and assembled the work the following year. She has no records of its first exhibition, but at some point between 1975 and 1977 it saw the light of day as a work for the gallery wall. It was subsequently published in full in her book _3 Works_ (1981) along with _The Restoration of High Culture in Chile_ (1977) and the important essay from 1981 'In, Around, and Afterthoughts (On Documentary Photography)'. It is worth noting that the essay is thus designated as a 'work'. I first came across Rosler's _The Bowery_ at art school in 1981, or perhaps 1982, when I read Allan Sekula's essay 'Dismantling Modernism, Reinventing Documentary (Notes on the Politics of Representation)', published in 1979 in the legendary book _Photography/Politics: One._ The essay appeared at a point when Conceptual art was opening onto a revivified political avant-gardism, at least in some advanced and troubled circles. It was a sort of manifesto for the San Diego group in which Sekula was a participant along with Rosler, Phil (now Phel) Steinmetz, Fred Lonidier and others. In the militant voice of the period, he advocated the reinvention of documentary in opposition to the tired protocols of formalism in photography and art. I studied the volume intently, paying inordinate attention to the argument until my copy became dog-eared and stained with coffee and poster inks. The work he discussed combined therepresentation of labour with a new politics of realism, and much of it has not received its due; certainly Fred Lonidier's _The Health and Safety Game_ (1976, fig.30) still looks strong today, but class became deeply unfashionable during the 'long 1980s'. Martha Rosler's _The Bowery_ occupied an important position in Sekula's account, and caught my imagination. But it was much more difficult to see how her elliptical work fit into the agenda for a new committed documentary. In fact, Sekula accounted for it by attributing to _The Bowery_ a ' _metacritical_ relation to the documentary genre'.

I began to gather copies of essays by Rosler and interviews with the artist on that shiny photocopy paper that smelt of moist chemicals. I also studied the version of _The Bowery_ that appeared in Rosler's _3 Works_ , published in The Nova Scotia Pamphlets series edited by Benjamin Buchloh. In this book version, individual text/photograph oppositions were aligned on spiral-bound facing pages. Most commentaries on _The Bowery_ reproduce a single image/text pair (that is, one element); alternatively, they opt for the overall array in the form of an installation shot. In both presentation modes it is difficult to get a sense of the work. The version in _3 Works_ makes it easier to look at the images and read the words, even if the printing makes everything look dark and inky. I think it was not until 1998 that I actually saw _The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ installed on a gallery wall, in Rosler's retrospective at Ikon Gallery in Birmingham; it proved to be an uncanny experience. I knew it intimately from the page — or thought I did — but it did not quite settle into place. For one thing, the experience differed greatly from the sequential page-turning of the version in _3 Works_. I also began to notice incongruities and odd details. In this context, I started to think again about _The Bowery_ , and I have since taken the opportunity to see it whenever I can. On each occasion I have tried to come up with a halfway adequate description for this strange work — attempted to add up its parts; to distil (a bad pun) the dirempt components into something approaching an interpretation. Fredric Jameson suggests there can be no video masterpieces in late capitalism, and I guess this goes for photo-text works too. I do not know if Jameson is right (Chris Marker? Harun Farocki?), or if _The Bowery_ is a 'masterpiece', but I am conscious that it still eludes my understanding and this short book is my attempt to write a response, however provisional, to an artwork that laid a path for others besides me. In fact, I still think _The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ lies in our future.

I am going to begin with a bald description, which will establish some necessary terms and points of reference for what follows. This description will have to be modified as we attend to the peculiarities and contradictions of the work, but it is an essential place to start. In its gallery version, _The Bowery_ consists of 21 black-and-white photographic images and 24 texts or groupings of words (the last is an end title) (fig.1 and ). The images depict both open and shuttered store windows, bank façades and debris in the Bowery area of New York City, infamous at the time as the haunt of alcoholics and the homeless, and which Rosler has noted held a 'magnetic' attraction for documentary photographers. They are predominantly frontal images of the buildings; that is, the film plane is parallel to the façade. The pictures follow the route of a walk downtown on the Bowery. Rosler has said that the work of Ed Ruscha had little impact on her vision, but _The Bowery_ could be seen as a grungy, dark retort to _Every Building on the Sunset Strip_ (1966). Whereas Ruscha offered a sunny Californian prospect with two parallel strips of building fronts, photographed in black and white, Rosler focused on a New York location displaying social decay. The texts group words associated with drunkenness into families or associative clusters, for example 'stewed/boiled/potted/corned/pickled/preserved/canned/fried to the hat' (fig.13). The texts appear to have been typed on paper or card then photographed and printed on silver-gelatin paper. The work is displayed in 24 thin black wood frames; for the most part, two sheets of photographic paper figure in each element (or frame). Images and text are juxtaposed against one another, mounted directly on a dark-card ground (the first three pairs are anomalous: each contains just a single text panel, leaving blank the space where we might expect an image to appear). The backing boards measure 30 by 60 centimetres (approximately 12 by 24 inches). Both the photographs and the text panels have a white framing edge and an internal black masking line. The elements are arrayed in an elongated grid formation of four horizontal and six vertical rows, although it has sometimes been shown in groupings of 6 by 4 or 5 by 5, with a single gap after the final panel. (The grid is usually displayed flat on a single wall, but in documenta 12 in 2007 it was placed across the right angle of two walls with sixteen elements on one side and eight on the other) (fig.27). The version as it appears in _3 Works_ sets text/image double-page spreads on either side of a spiral binding, and there are some variations in blank sheets and so forth. It uses the double-page spread as a structuring pattern, whereas the gallery version employs the grid. To correlate the framed parts in the gallery version with the corresponding image/text opposition in _3 Works_ , I will assign each element a sequential number.

The response that follows is organised in three rough sections, each typifying a kind of art writing. The first looks at some existing accounts of _The Bowery_ and attempts to establish a more adequate description — it sticks very closely to the work as a process of _ekphrasis_. The second examines some intellectual frames that shaped Rosler's work, principally photography and neo-Brechtian film, and provides a brief survey of works. The third part offers a more speculative reaction to the figurative patterns and poetic mode underpinning this peculiar artwork, and in the process it offers some reflections on Marxism, aesthetics and time.

### **Descriptions**

#### **Inadequate Descriptions**

The foreword to the book accompanying Rosler's 1998 retrospective at Ikon Gallery, referred to her as 'one of the most influential artists of her generation'. Fair enough. _The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ is certainly one of the most significant works of the 1970s and it continues to be displayed in major exhibitions. It also frequently figures prominently in the historiography of the period as one of the works that broke open the formalist consensus and contributed to the emergence of a new consciousness in the making and reception of art. Yet, it has received no sustained gaze. _The Bowery_ appears in survey books as an example of photography/text work; an exemplary critique of modernism and/or documentary; or an instance of the new allegorical sensibility. It usually functions in the histories of this period as a marker of the shift from one paradigm to another, warranting a couple of sentences, a paragraph at most — just enough words to make the point — before moving on to the next object and the next topic.

I am going to begin with some commentaries in order to establish several themes, but also to examine what critics have been able to make of such a strange work. In an influential essay from 1984 Craig Owens argued:

_Although her photographs are intentionally flat-footed, Rosler's refusal of mastery in this work is more than technical. On the one hand, she denies the caption/text its conventional function of supplying the image with something it lacks; instead, her juxtaposition of two representation systems, visual and verbal, is calculated (as the title suggests) to 'undermine' rather than 'underline' the truth value of each._

According to Owens, the artist 'refused' to picture those 'twice victimised: first by society, and then by the photographer who presumes the right to speak on their behalf'. Rosler is said to reject the tradition of victim photography in which 'the photographer inevitably functions as an agent of the system of power that silenced these people in the first place'. Thomas Crow noted that this work was a 'milestone' of Conceptual art:

The Bowery _juxtaposed a series of strictly depopulated photographs of derelict storefronts with a running list of American slang expressions for drunks and drunkenness, from familiar to arcane, from whimsical to despairingly bleak. The anti-expressive intensity in the combination of text and photograph defies both ordinary pathos and critical paraphrase._

Brandon Taylor writes that 'Rosler took different representations aimed at capturing the reality of drunks living on the streets of lower Manhattan and placed them next to, and made them critical of, each other.' Taylor argues that, like other stucturalist works, this project sought 'to shift the viewer's attention from the thing represented to the representational systems themselves'. He then cites Rosler on victimhood and photography and _The Bowery_ as an 'act of refusal'. Laura Cottingham tells us: 'This piece challenges the inadequacy of pictures and words, simply stated, to reveal social reality, especially the reality of the "other", specifically the reality of "Bowery bums".'

Each of these short descriptions adds to our understanding, but, even allowing for the brevity of the survey text, the very form of these explanations strikes me as a problem. In each instance _The Bowery_ is embedded in the accretion of a narrative, and these authors do not seem to be able to extract it from the flow, to give it life; it is as if its champions were not quite able to account for what it is that this work does. Rosler's interviews — particularly the one conducted by Benjamin Buchloh — provide more to go on, though there is the constant danger of allowing her articulate words to speak for the work, to read the work for us and deflect the activity of looking. It is difficult to resist the lure of phrases such as 'connoisseurship of the tawdry' or 'a safari of images'. Owens acknowledges this problem directly: 'At this point in my text, then, my voice must yield to the artist's...' He views this surrender as a positive challenge to 'the critic's substitution of his own discourse for the work of art', but I am not convinced that it is not ultimately another way of avoiding the artwork. I am going to draw on Rosler's interviews, particularly in the second part of this book, which outlines some parameters of her intellectual formation, but I hope to do so without being overly reliant on them, not least because the most significant artworks exceed their author, escaping their grasp. I am not sure I have negotiated the problem successfully, but I have tried to engage 'Rosler' as an ensemble of ideologies, traditions and experiences.

Allan Sekula's commentary is in a class of its own. The two paragraphs given over to _The Bowery_ in 'Dismantling Modernism, Reinventing Documentary' are undoubtedly the best account from the period, and, apart from Rosler's own commentaries, it is probably the most perceptive criticism available; no doubt, because he was party to Rosler's thinking and working process. Almost certainly he was the 'close collaborator' who Rosler recalls deemed her initial plan for _The Bowery_ to be 'stupid', a view retracted at its completion. 'The object of the work', Sekula suggests, is 'the "Bowery" as a socially mediated, ideological construction', while the work's title points to the 'flawed, distorted character' of representation. He understood that the sequence implied a walk downtown, 'from Houston toward Canal on the west side of the avenue'. Sekula evokes Walker Evans and suggests: 'The cool, dead-pan mannerism works against the often expressionist liberalism of the find-a-bum school of concerned photography.' He calls this approach 'anti-"humanist"', and it is worth noting the positioning of his quote marks, which seem to mark out this critique of humanist photography from a more general anti-humanist philosophy. This is not to say that he got everything right. For instance, he wrote that the images were produced 'with a normal lens from the edge of the street'. However, while she used a standard 50mm lens, we know from Rosler's photograph of her son, who accompanied her on one working shoot, that she must have been much closer in on the wide sidewalk of the Bowery.

Sekula pays much more attention than other commentators to Rosler's 'immense slang lexicon of alcoholism', which he argues suggests 'both the signifying richness of metaphor as well as its immense poverty'. According to him, the prominence of nautical and astronomical imagery implies the desire to escape from a painful reality. In an extraordinary passage, he writes:

_The photographs consistently pull us back to the street, to the terrain from which this pathetic flight is attempted. Rosler's found poetry begins with the most transcendental of metaphors, 'aglow', 'illuminated' and progresses ultimately, through numerous categories of symbolic escape mingled with blunt recognition, to the slang terms for empty bottles: 'dead soldiers' and 'dead marines'. The pool of language Rosler has tapped is largely the socio-linguistic 'property' of the working class and the poor. The language attempts to handle an irreconcilable tension between bliss and self-destruction in a society of closed options._

Later, she would reiterate this drift 'from light-hearted metaphorical riff to the commonly understood blunt death imagery'. Sekula argues this attention to language 'cuts against the pornography of the "direct" representation of misery': poetic text or metaphor interposes between the viewer and 'visual experience'. This is perceptive criticism, probably informed by conversations with the artist. It indicates that the work has a narrative form and that Benjamin Buchloh was probably right to call it 'allegorical'; perhaps Sekula's reference to an 'irreconcilable tension between bliss and self-destruction' indicates that what we are looking at is, in fact, an allegorical model for consciousness. This is a point to which I will return towards the end of this book.

In a very different essay, which explicitly pits _The Bowery_ against the boozy imagery of some recent British art — particularly that of Gillian Wearing, whose works in this vein include _Theresa and..._ (1998), _Prelude_ (2000), _Drunk_ (2000) and _Broad Street_ (2001) — David Hopkins argues that Rosler's project instigated a closure around the image of the victim, and the drunk in particular, which artists are still struggling to escape. Like Crow, Hopkins sees _The Bowery_ as a 'milestone'; however for him the track in question is overgrown and tangled, closing off the imagery of the 'marginalised alcoholic' as a figure of 'oblique social critique' employed by the modernist artist to represent his 'social apartness'. For Hopkins the 'tramp or bum was in danger of becoming a little too auratic', and therefore Rosler eradicated him (or her), 'leaving only the context, the detail'. He sees the strategy that she adopted as a kind of 'terminus': while posing a question for a subsequent generation, Rosler's project 'also closed down on representation in a way that equated with the social nullity of her alcoholic subjects'. Whereas Sekula viewed the closure as the result of social contradictions, Hopkins views it as the product of the artist's ethical programme. The criticism of liberal-humanist representation of victims, the refusal to speak for others, he says, 'festered' or 'congealed' during the 1980s into 'political correctness', making these subjects untouchable, and when they were approached by Jeff Wall in works such as _Milk_ (1984) it was through staged images using actors. During the 1990s, Hopkins argues, British artists re-engaged with the figure of the drunk in a way that was sometimes naïve (he refers to Wearing's 'amoral curiosity'), but that could also subvert established gender roles; and, no doubt, be more fun than the dour critical art of the 1970s. Hopkins works hard not to say that Rosler's work instigated a political moratorium on representation, but his account drifts in that direction — his reference to the 'dying embers of old-style Leftism' seems pretty unequivocal. (In fact, Rosler's project was explicitly New Left.) Hopkins is right to note _The Bowery_ 'is full to the gills with wit and allusion'; he picks up on some of Rosler's most telling comments and he fixes on inherent blockages in the 1970s ethical critique of representation, and on the strategies employed by younger artists to deal with representing the socially marginalised. Hopkins's critique, however, is overly primitivist, and the impasse that he claims subsequent generations of artists faced might alternatively be described as their political retreat. Confronted with the neoliberal offensive they, along with so many others, turned away from the pressing political questions confronted during the 1970s. (There is no need to be puritanical, but bohemian tom-foolery does not circumvent the political problem.)

These distinct responses all suggest that _The Bowery_ represents a critique of humanist or liberal documentary photography, though some of the commentators acknowledge Rosler's claim that she has never rejected the documentary mode, but only tried to imagine possibilities for its radical extension or reinvention. They all underline the critical relation or contradiction between words and images. For some critics this appears under the sign of 'inadequacy'; for others it shifts to the impossibility of representation. They stress blankness, a dead-pan attitude, refusal and a kind of figural turning away. Both Crow and Sekula emphasise the anti-expressive character of the work. In one way or another, these commentators link the critique of representation with attention to images of the working class or the poor. While Owens lays his emphasis on 'mastery', Sekula puts weight on the worldly condition; we might say that Hopkins dwells in the aporia between these two poles.

Rosler's reaction to what she called documentary 'pornography' was to retain the vernacular form of the documentary mode, but to refuse its usual topics and points of view. The Bowery area was not arbitrarily selected for this project; it has a long history in representation. Today it is a gentrified area of lofts and luxury apartments, bars, a Whole Foods store and the New Museum, but it retains some signs of its previous life (for example, there are still two shelters for the homeless there). Prior to 1807 there was a stretch called Bowery Lane; the current Bowery is a mile-long strip in lower Manhattan leading northward from Chatham Square to the intersection of East Fourth Street and Cooper Square; the extension across the Manhattan grid to Union Square, which was once a part of the Bowery, has been renamed Fourth Avenue. It was originally a Native-American track through what became Manhattan; when the Dutch settled on the island in the seventeenth century it became farmland (the name comes from the old Dutch word for a farm). For a period during the eighteenth century it was a fashionable street lined with mansions, but as the city expanded it was surrounded by slums and rapidly engulfed. It was the territory of the Nativist gang the 'Bowery Boys' and a site of anti-conscription riots. In the early nineteenth century the Bowery developed a centripetal pull for the very poor and the outcast, an attraction exacerbated by the widespread homelessness that followed the Civil War. Increasingly it accrued flop-houses (cheap lodging houses), brothels, tattoo parlours, cheap clothing outlets, missions, bars, beer gardens and slop joints (inexpensive eating places). The Bowery became established as the haunt of the unemployed, drunks, drifters, sailors on shore leave and hobos (rural hoe boys). Casual labourers and others just passing through also stayed there (New York was an important rail terminus). From the 1890s it was a centre of gay culture. Christian missionaries, the Catholic Worker movement, the International Workers of the World (the Wobblies) and the Communist Party of the USA all fished in this pond. It is estimated that at the 'high' point between the 1920s and 70s anywhere from 25,000 to 75,000 people slept nightly on the Bowery.

Cities have their own topography of imagery, and New York, like Paris, has typically been photographed as a series of distinctive neighbourhoods. For Rosler, the Bowery area figured as a cipher for this project of 'concerned photography'. She called it the 'archetypal skid row' and, as we have seen, suggested that it held a 'magnetic' attraction for photographers. The defining figure is Jacob Riis, a police reporter who began to investigate poverty in New York during the last quarter of the nineteenth century and used photographs to illustrate his lectures. Riis's book _How the Other Half Lives_ appeared in 1890. His model of reporting from the slums for the intelligence of the well-heeled is often seen as a paradigm for 'documentary' photography. Rosler suggested that work in this mode did not aim to transform the problems 'fundamental to the social system', but to preserve polite society from disequilibrium by calling attention to the 'dangerous classes' and awakening the self-interest of the privileged. In 1914 the pastor John Hopkins Denison published _Beside the Bowery_ , an account of the charitable work of Eliza Rockwell, which was illustrated with photographs in much the same mode. Walker Evans, Ben Shahn, Lisette Model, Weegee, Erica Stone, Robert Frank, Nan Goldin and a whole host of other documentary and street photographers have made pictures there. Rosler observes that she encountered Michael D. Zettler's photo-book _The Bowery_ after she had completed her version. Zettler's book — 'with its photographs and blocks of text, supposed quotations from the pictured bums and from observers' — was the 'perfect foil' for what she had attempted. There is much that could be said about Zettler's text and pictures, but let me just observe that his picture sequence is entirely framed by death and oblivion.

The Bowery has acted as a magnet for more than photographers. There have been social reports and journalism, and an entire genre of what Luc Sante characterised as sentimental and moralistic fiction set on the Lower East Side. This genre includes Edward W. Townsend's _Chimmie Fadden_ (1894) and _A Daughter of the Tenements_ (1895); more high-brow are Stephen Crane's first novel _Maggie: A Girl of the Streets_ (1893) and Theodore Dreiser's _Sister Carrie_ (1900). In a different genre, we could mention Morris Levitt's 1931 play _On the Bowery_ , which is set in a 'cheap lodging house' and culminates with the unemployed rallying to the communist struggle. It contains the immortal line: 'You know, Red guy, I think you're damned right.' Elmer Bendiner's _The Bowery Man_ is part history, part impression and part rumination on life. Raoul Walsh's film _The Bowery_ came out in 1933 and the B-movie series _The Bowery Boys_ appeared regularly between the mid-1940s and 50s, building on a popular film genre going back to the 1930s ( _East End Kids_ , _Dead End Kids_ , _East Side Kids_ and the _Little Tough Guys_ ). Other filmic offerings include the Bela Lugosi vehicle _The Bowery at Midnight_ (1942), directed by Wallace Fox; a Bugs Bunny short titled _Bowery Bugs_ (1949); and Lionel Rogosin's pioneering cinema verité work _On the Bowery_ (1956). Popular music ranges from 'The Bowery', a song from the Broadway musical _A Trip to Chinatown_ by Charles H. Hoyt and Percy Gaunt (1891), to the Ramones's 'Bad Brain' (1978), which includes the lines 'now I'm on the Bowery, I can't remember my name'. The legendary CBGB opened there in the 1970s. In search of the other America, Sigmar Polke made a series of photographs of the Bowery during his first trip to the USA in 1973. Many, many more, popular depictions could be cited, but this list should indicate that the Bowery is a place layered with representations of the working class, the poor and the destitute; it brings with it the allure of adventure and exoticism.

In Martha Rosler's _The Bowery_ the usual pitiable subjects of documentary are reduced to a few traces. Stripped down to its most basic protocols, documentary emerges as an empty signifier, rather than a site of plenitude. One way to conceive this would be to locate _The Bowery_ on the wrong side of the transition — powerfully articulated by Blake Stimson — from the photography of the 1950s, which he argues was concerned with political subjectivity and belonging in the world, to the work of the 1960s that he identifies with the isolated self-interestedness of the new consumer. As examples of this shift, Stimson contrasts Bernd and Hilla Becher's persistent aesthetic vision, comportment towards the world and systematic earnestness with the blasé vision of Andy Warhol, Ed Ruscha and Gerhard Richter. Despite some relation to the work of the Bechers, _The Bowery_ seems to sit on the second pole of this historic division. Of course, Stimson is reworking Fredric Jameson's influential thesis on 'the cultural logic of late capitalism', and _The Bowery_ might be viewed as the perfect example for this notion of 'postmodernism'. According to Jameson's periodisation, a decisive and irrevocable shift occurs in a world in which consciousness is colonised by the commodity form. What he calls 'postmodern culture' is characterised by a lack of affect, loss of historical consciousness and collapse of critical distance. The frontality of the photographs that make up _The Bowery_ seems designed to invoke 'flatness or depthlessness'; the photographic substitution appears to open onto simulacra; and then there is the dead-pan 'lack of affect', which is a continual concern for Rosler. Indeed, she often seems to affirm terms such as 'unauthored', 'deauthored', 'cool', 'detached', 'vernacular' and even 'non-partisan'. For the foremost theorist of postmodernism these are the key characteristics that indicate the gulf that separates Vincent van Gogh from Andy Warhol, and which distinguish modernism from postmodernism and monopoly capitalism from late capitalism. The very form of _The Bowery_ — its pictorial disassociations and repetitions, its decomposing lists — might be perceived as instances of the schizophrenic disintegration of signifying chains, while the pastiche of Evans's pictures from the Great Depression calls to mind Jameson's account of the eternal present in nostalgia films such as Lawrence Kasdan's _Body Heat_ (1981).

Rosler seems to confirm this reading:

_The photographs confront the shops squarely, and they supply familiar urban reports. They are not reality newly viewed. They are not reports from a frontier, messages from a voyage of discovery or self-discovery. There is nothing new attempted in a photographic style that was constructed in the thirties when the message itself was newly understood, differently embedded. I am quoting words and images both._

Juxtaposing this argument with a passage from Jameson's essay on video seems to underline the point:

_We are left with that pure and random play of signifiers that we call postmodernism, which no longer produces monumentalworks of the modernist type but ceaselessly reshuffles the fragments of pre-existent texts, the building blocks of older cultural and social production, in some new and heightened bricolage: metabooks which cannibalise other books, metatexts which collage bits of other texts — such is the logic of postmodernism in general, which finds one of its strongest and most original, authentic forms in the new art of experimental video._

This all seems very near the mark. _The Bowery_ and _Vital Statistics of a Citizen, Simply Obtained_ (performance 1973/video 1977, fig.34) appear inside quotation marks and seem to exemplify this turn against the new, leaving us with nothing except ironic repetition. I think it is fair to add that that there was a persistent tension, even an aporia, in the New Left vision between criticisms of individualism, on the one hand, and political voluntarism or 'commitment', on the other. This seems particularly marked in the de-subjectivation of art, which demands a rejection of bourgeois interiority and of preoccupation with the self and humanist agency, while simultaneously calling for an act of commitment — taking a stand — and revolutionary will aimed to transform the political conjuncture. In this sense, the interview Jane Weinstock conducted with Rosler for _October_ in 1981 is symptomatic. Weinstock finds her interviewee's references to the 'self', 'experience', 'reality' and 'alienation' incomprehensible in light of her own Lacanian purview. The dialogue that ensues effectively replays the encounter between the Jean-Paul Sartre of _Critique of Dialectical Reason_ (1960) and his structuralist critics, and more generally between Marxism and 'postmodernism'. This 'structure of feeling' is shared across much of the art, film, theory and politics of the period, and it requires much more detailed consideration than I am able to give it here. The important point is that blankness and de-subjectivation sit side by side in Rosler's work with more classically humanist themes of individual agency and experience.

This coupling of _The Bowery_ with Jameson's critical diagnosis of postmodernism is undoubtedly revealing and troubling, but ultimately I have introduced it as a possible interpretation in order that it might be discarded. As the mood associated with postmodernism drained away, Jameson increasingly stressed that he saw it as a 'cultural dominant' and that other forms and possibilities had always been available. Indeed, in _Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism_ (1991), he singles out Rosler along with Jean-Luc Godard, no less, as the representatives of 'political video art' who most insistently pose questions concerning 'the relative weight of the various generic systems themselves in our culture'. In any case, _The Bowery_ cannot easily be herded into the pen of Jameson's account. Rosler has expressed a notable double take on quotation, which she suggests may have 'mediation as its essence', but avoids an engagement with power and withdraws into what she marvellously describes as a 'paranoiac pout'. Rosler is highly critical of the appropriationist works that sometimes keep company with _The Bowery_ in museums and art-history books, because the repetition of oppressive media modes foreclosed 'new production', reinforcing a vision without social life or classes. For her, appropriationism ultimately affirmed the media culture it drew from, reiterating its occlusions and blockages. She does not name names, but Sherry Levine, Cindy Sherman and Richard Prince seem to be in her sights. This should serve as an important reminder that something else is going on in _The Bowery_. The critics seem to get some important things right about this work, but I think the existing responses are at best partial, just a beginning. _The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ strikes me as much more than a critique of humanist documentary, and any adequate account will need to reframe this critical perspective. _Pace_ Hopkins, I think it is a radically open work and despite the dead-pan mode it is not an affectless one; at least for the attentive viewer or reader _The Bowery_ does not block access to history.

#### **Another Inadequate Description**

Some questions seem immediately apposite: what is inadequate about the 'two inadequate descriptive systems'? To what do the 'systems' refer? Are they visual and verbal, pictures and words, image and text, or perhaps language and photography? Each opposition opens slightly different possibilities. In what sense, if any, are they systems? If they are systems, how systematic are they? With regard to which tasks are they inadequate? To state this slightly differently, how is the inadequacy made manifest in the array of pictures and words set out before the viewer? These are, of course, all negative questions, overdetermined by that powerful adjectival sign 'inadequate'. _The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ is, as Rosler has said, an 'act of refusal'. The 'labour of the negative' provides an important clue for thinking about this artwork.

It is not as easy as it might appear to separate out the photographs and the words that make up _The Bowery_ , but first the pictures. As we have seen, commentators regularly note the inexpressive frontality of the images, citing the work of Bernd and Hilla Becher and of Walker Evans as points of reference. Rosler has said that 'The photograph]s are really dead-pan in that the building fronts are mostly totally flat against the picture plane.' In the main, this is correct: the shop front is usually positioned directly parallel to the film plane. The majority of the images frame a store window, or a shuttered entrance. This central aperture is invariably flanked or framed by walls or sometimes a doorway and wall to either side; at the bottom a strip of the pavement is visible. The frontal nature of the pictures makes for an obvious connection to Evans's Great Depression-era photographs, but perhaps equally significant in this regard is Rosler's attention to vernacular signage. Her photographs tarry with words. The connection to Evans is palpable in the photograph in element seven ([fig.9), where handwritten signs advertise the services of a sign-maker ('for less money'). Below them are clap-board walls with peeling paint, torn posters and the remains of handwritten name tags. Even the framing here could be that of Evans (though Rosler worked with a 35mm camera, rather than a large-format plate camera). The invocation of Evans's photographs connects Rosler's _The Bowery_ to the imagery of the American Depression, but perhaps it also alerts us to the possibility of dense combinations or narrative chains of pictures in the tradition of Evans's book _American Photographs_ (1938). The next image presents posters pasted over layers of previous posters (fig.10). As Rosler's sequence unfolds, printed signs and artless handwritten advertisements begin to feature more and more. The image in element twenty figures as a compendium of these forms of writing and signage, and it acts as a point of convergence with Rosler's own word panels (fig.22). It declares itself a paragon. An old, embossed hardware sign presents household supplies in a vertical list: the sign for 'Paragon Paint' could be one of the artist's own texts. It reads: 'Custom Mixed: Polyurethane/Solvents/Stains/Brushes/Varnish/Shellac'. The word 'shellacked' figures in Rosler's list accompanying the photograph of the First National City Bank (fig.14). It is a condensed version of the entire work.

Partly influenced by the sequential presentation in _3 Works_ , I have been reading _The Bowery_ syntagmatically from left to right, along each successive line. I think this _is_ Rosler's arrangement, but the character of the word groupings suggests other associative possibilities for viewing and reading. It is entirely possible to establish paradigmatic or vertical associations or to allow the eye to flit across the work, settling on, or picking out particular elements, pictures and texts. In this sense, the arrangement on the wall is more complex than in _3 Works_ , because the columns of texts and pictures establish vertical associations at the macro-level that parallel the individual word groupings. In this form we can see that the structure of the first four columns from the left differs from that of the last two (fig.1 and ).

We know that the images are devoid of people, but sometimes a shadow or a blurred edge is visible at the left of the frame (I thought this might have been a trace of Rosler herself, but it turns out to be her son). Nevertheless, the signs of the Bowery's inhabitants mark each image. They appear in the form of contingent matter pushed to the edges of the image or tucked away in corners and dark doorways: empty alcohol bottles, discarded shoes, cigarette packets, trash. It seems that the selection criterion for the photographs is the presence of these low-key signs. The photographs in the sequence begin in their starkest, emptiest mode gradually filling up with the clutter of words and things as the pictures accrue (fig.6—) . The first image presents us with a closed shutter, a wall and a bottle; the second gives us a metal security door, with perhaps a little more architectural detail to the sides and more rubbish at the bottom. The third depicts a grilled window; the fourth a boarded-up doorway with torn posters and signage; the fifth more torn and layered posters. From the third photograph words begin to multiply. From the sixth picture the shop windows become more prominent and more transparent, offering a hint of their often decrepit wares.

The picture sequence seems to follow a drift to the grotesque or macabre, characterised by Sekula in his comment on the word panels as a tension between 'bliss' and 'self-destruction'. However, in one sense the series represents a counter-narrative to the one he detected; the photographs shift from closed to open, and they do so in a very peculiar manner. Some of the premises are clearly shut and boarded up. The hotel doorway pictured in element nineteen is rotting at the base and the window to the right is full of seemingly empty cartons (fig.21). The window in element seventeen is jam-packed with boxes, tins and crockery (fig.19). It is difficult to know if this business continues to trade or if what we see are residues from a failed economic venture. The doorway to the left is grilled and padlocked. The metal shutters so prominent in these pictures might suggest abandoned premises, but it is possible that Rosler was working before or after the stores closed, when there were no passers-by to interfere with her sight-lines. Throughout the sequence, stone and plaster work is cracked and paint flaked and peeling. The daily grime of the city seems to encrust the lower portion of the pictures, and the dark character of Rosler's prints only serves to heighten this sense of decrepitude and contamination. Economic activity appears in these premises in banks that are presented as blank façades or in wholesale traders with no care for neat display: the photograph in element nine shows what seems to be a purveyor of shoe heels and lasts (fig.11); the one in element ten, the premises of a dealer in silver and china (fig.12); in element eleven, a window with cash registers and adding machines (fig.13); in eighteen, a shop supplying the restaurant trade, perhaps (fig.20). Two images depict outlets retailing lamps (fig.17 and ). None of this involves the hyper-seductions of the late-capitalist commodity form. It is a place where things seem to have grown old before their time; these are artefacts associated with working-class consumers or perhaps an older mode of production. In these pictures the Bowery looks like a necropolis for old stuff.

The overall impression from the photographs is one of blockage, of barriers to sight or barricades against imaginative reach or to uch. Rosler's planar vision is employed to shut out the viewer. The boarded-up, shuttered and grilled premises all emphasise symbolic exclusion. Even the windows seem to offer hard surfaces, rather than transparent invitations. The image of a closed hotel, of course, is a desperate and damning image in an area of acute homelessness. The exoskeleton of the hardware shop works in the same register with its beautiful old sign for 'Plumbing Supplies, Electrical Supplies, Paints, Wallpaper... Bathroom Hardware...' (fig.22). Maybe the two shops selling lamps and 'RBY Construction' add to this impression of needless destitution (fig.8). Rosler has said that _The Bowery_ is a dead-pan look at the fiscal crisis of New York in the 1970s. The evidence for this claim to depict the political economy of an inhospitable modernity seems to be there in the pictures.

The signifiers of economic activity appear on the other side of the barriers and locked doors, and are inaccessible to the viewer; 'silver', cash machines and 'empire' all figure. The word 'charity' is pasted up on a wall, and the banks are figured as emphatic façades. Perhaps the most telling picture in this regard appears in element twenty two, which in the absence of a façade is something of an oddity or point of transition (fig.24). It looks like an ironic Lee Friedlander photograph, with a chain-link fence providing a barrier to the distribution trucks parked on the other side. The fence is impeccably planar _and_ transparent; we can see through it, but not enter. Over there, on the other side, are commodities for circulation; on this side — our side — only trash and empty bottles are immediately at hand. Rosler thematises this proximity to junk in the final two images. In the penultimate photograph, the chain-link fence — perhaps the same barrier as in the preceding picture — is located immediately behind a pile of bottles, cans and paper bags (fig.25). It seems to suggest that what is within our reach is commodity-fuelled oblivion. The prominent can of Colt 45 makes evident the connection to 'dead soldiers/dead marines'. The sense of damage is palpable in the final photograph, which dispenses with the fence and presents us with one discarded bottle of port and a broken bottle of brandy (fig.26). Rosler's photographic construction thus locates the viewer on this side of the shutters, barriers, fences and windows, on the side occupied by the Bowery bums. An imaginative space is offered for the viewer in which he or she might stand with them, occupying their shoes. This point of view is at variance with the predominant form of liberal-humanist documentary.

Now the words. Rosler's word groupings can be based on thematic association:

_There is a poetics of drunkenness here, a poetry-out-of-prison. Adjectives and nouns build into metaphoric systems — food imagery, nautical imagery, the imagery of industrial processes, of militarism, derisive comparisons with animal life, foreignisms, archaisms and references to still other universes of discourse — applied to a particular state of being, a subculture of sorts, and to the people in it._

The language groups are densely articulated and, as Molly Nesbit has rightly observed, in significant ways 'the Bowery project [...] is a poetry project'. Rosler was involved with editing the poetry magazine called _Pogamoggan_ (one issue was published in 1964) and has said that at one time she was close to the New York 'poetry avant-garde'. We know she read Gertrude Stein, Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, Marianne Moore, Wallace Stevens and William Carlos Williams, but she also notes her interest in concrete poetry, 'Black Mountain and [John] Cage and aleatory principles' and 'the more controlled language traditions'. Across a spectrum from Pound to Charles Olson, modernist poets from the United States were fascinated by found and vernacular language. This is at the limit of my competence, but for some this ran in the direction of the literary and transcendent, for others it entailed an insistence on the materialist or worldly character of language.

David Antin was an important figure in Rosler's intellectual formation, and his 'talk poems' clearly offered an example to her. Rosler had known David and Eleanor (Elly) Antin in New York, and their presence in San Diego was one reason that she moved there. In his talk works that began with 'Talking' (1972), Antin improvised in performance fragments of vernacular language, with reflections and responses to the audience, entwining ordinary language through poetic techniques of rhythm, repetition and metaphor. These talk poems were recorded and subsequently reworked for publication, producing complexly structured texts from ordinary language. What is striking in them is the role played by elements of found language from newspapers or conversations. The talk poems evidently provided a stimulus for Rosler's found word groupings, but Antin's stress on the bifurcation in modernist poetry was just as significant. He identified two trends: on the one hand, a productive avant-garde collage principle (the lineage out of Ezra Pound to Charles Olson and Black Mountain, but also Dada and Surrealism), and, on the other, a retrograde and provincial, highbrow literary ambition (the tradition from T.S. Eliot and W.H. Auden to Robert Lowell). Chance, the found word and the quotidian are set against allusion and epiphany. Antin was important in switching Rosler's attention from the idiom of Abstract Expressionism to Pop and the vernacular principle.

As a poetry project, _The Bowery_ focuses on everyday or 'found language'. As we have seen, the words in element eleven offer us connections through food processes those in twelve suggests surface treatments ('plastered/stuccoed/rosined/shellacked/vulcanized/inebriated/polluted'), while the tenth is based on nautical images that testify to the presence of sailors and seafarers in the Bowery ('soaked/sodden/steeped/soused/sloshed/saturated' and 'drenched/flying the ensign/over the bay/half-seas-over/decks awash/down with the fish') (fig.13,  and ). In this last instance, I have read these groups as two columns running from top to bottom, but there is no obligation to do so. The positioning of words on the sheet is important and offers different possibilities for association, connection and substitution.

Not all of the texts are grouped in families of this sort. The text sheet in element five reads: 'featured/fortified/piffed/pifflicated/spifflicated/obfuscated/pixilated/inebriated' (fig.7). (Again, this is not the only possible associative order for this sequence.) The connecting factor in the word groupings seems to be a paradigmatic poetic organisation based on phonemes, morphemes and mora. 'Featured' and 'fortified' share five letters; the phoneme 'if' in 'fortified' slides to 'piffed/pifflicated/spifflicated', and on the next line 'obfuscated' and 'pixilated' suggest alternative possibilities emerging from 'pifflicated'. Groupings of this kind seem to spin out from one or two words with associative relations or anchorage in the image. 'Fortified' connects, as does possibly 'obfuscated', to the protective metal door in the accompanying photograph. In element fourteen 'gassed' perhaps relates to the sign in the doorway reading 'Air 6/Air 4'; 'stiff', 'ossified' and 'paralyzed' all reverberate with the marble columns; 'falling down drunk' may be an inversion of this erect or upright imagery (fig.16). However, the other words on the sheet — 'whipped', 'blotto' and 'overcome' are probably generated from internal linguistic associations. The photograph in element twenty is an important point at which image and text seem to fuse, with the sign-lists paralleling and condensing the linguistic possibilities of Rosler's texts (fig.22).

As we have seen, critics have suggested that the images and text operate in distinct registers, undermining the standard relation of caption and photograph, which Roland Barthes called 'anchorage' and Walter Benjamin, following Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, saw as the key to photographic literacy. While the relations of image and text in _The Bowery_ are not as clear-cut as image and caption, neither are they completely disconnected or independent. Frequently, they imbue one another with significance: 'plastered/stuccoed/rosined...' sits alongside a bank façade (fig.14). Often the connection takes a humorous turn. In element six 'squiffy/snozzled/screwed/bleary-eyed/glassy-eyed/cross-eyed/cock-eyed' goes with an image of grills — a sliding corrugated gate, a metal floor grill and a protective window mesh through which we read 'RBY Construction'; it makes your eyes go peculiar (fig.8). The text panel 'comatose/unconscious/passed out/knocked out/laid out/out of the picture/out like a light' in element fifteen is located next to a picture of a shop window containing assorted lamp fittings (fig.17). The word 'comatose' is typed wonkily as if by an inebriated typist. The next text panel (element sixteen, fig.18) links 'blind drunk' with an image containing yet more lights and a sign for 'water fountains and oil-lamps'. As Rosler put it:

_The shops range from decrepitude to splendour, from the shabbiest of ancient restaurant supply houses or even mere storage spaces to astonishing crystal grottoes whose rapt cherubim_ [are] _entwined in incandescent fixtures and whose translucent swans in fountains of fibre-optic tubes_ [are] _relentlessly dripping oil blobs into dishes that radiate into the street._

Water fountains and kitschy sculptures of music-playing cherubs, when associated with the littered bottles, also suggest a utopian fountain of alcohol. It is the sort of image we might expect to find in those important wish-images of abundance: _The Land of Cokaygne_ , 'Oleanna' or 'Big Rock Candy Mountain'.

Element thirteen provides one of the most complex and resonant combinations of words and image (fig.15). A poster in what I presume is a bank window proclaims: 'Get a full 5% on your completed Christmas or Chanukah Club account and have an even merrier holiday next year'. Presumably the extra 5 per cent is to be spent on booze-fuelled merriment. The word 'Ponds' sprayed on the wall seems to connect to 'up to the gills' in Rosler's text (the effect of that extra 5 per cent). Ponds is also the brand name of a cold-cream cleanser, another option to give as a present, which might have attracted the attention of a feminist artist in 1974. Then there are the stand pipe and the bottle at the base of the image. The metal pipe can be seen as 'melted', possibly even 'overshot', but combined with the bottle another register of meaning comes to bear, one overlaid with the words 'slopped over' and 'limp'. Here the phallus flops from too much alcohol; an effect the English call 'brewer's droop'. Rosler's _The Bowery_ is a work compiled from dumb puns and savage ironies.

At this point something needs to be said about _The Bowery_ 's elongated grid in its gallery format. A lot of words have been expended on the grid in modern art and urbanism, so this needs to be swift. In an influential essay from 1978, Rosalind Krauss suggested the grid was an emblematic form of modernist art in its 'will to silence, its hostility to literature, to narrative, to discourse'. In its flatness, geometry and order, the grid proclaims the autonomy of art and, Krauss argues, it does so in the work of abstract painters like Piet Mondrian or Kazimir Malevich in a way that performs a relay between material and 'Being or Mind or Spirit. From their point of view, the grid is a staircase to the Universal.' The grid seems to proclaim a materialist substance, but slips imperceptibly towards its idealist other. In her essay, some artworks based on grids hold to the more materialist dimension, others drift away, but the underlying structure of the grid suggests a schizophrenic freezing of history, narrative and development (this might link to Hopkin's criticism and the argument that seems to link _The Bowery_ with Jameson's account of postmodernism). Krauss was writing about painting, but others have extended her claims to grids in other media. Perhaps picking up on Krauss's claim that the grid is capable of infinite extension and yet its internal elements bear an entirely arbitrary relation to one another, we might speculate that the grid suggests fetishistic equivalence, which Karl Marx found underpinning commodity exchange and the money-form. Twenty-five years after making _The Bowery_ , Rosler wrote that she adopted the grid from other works of art, from Cubism onwards. A direct prompt was very probably Eleanor Antin's important work _Carving: A Traditional Sculpture_ (1972), which arranged photographs of the artist losing weight (sculpting her body according to artistic norms of beauty) in an elongated grid. This should remind us that the systems in question do not simply derive from structuralism. She continued:

_A grid troubles the work's boundary, and boundedness in general. In another respect, it refers to principles of construction and types of craft that tie art to other forms of production. It invokes the industrial processes of mass production_ [ _..._ ] _decreasing the value of the individual object or 'utterance', avoiding the fetishisation of the unique or 'folkish' object._

This attack on some of the protocols or mythemes of High Modernism — beauty, expression, originality and handwork — carries a critical charge, but they too seem to parallel capitalist mass production. The grid seems here to be a machine for proliferation and exchange. It is now common in architectural and urban studies to say that the grid and real estate are intricately linked in US property values. In this sense, _The Bowery_ appears to be caught in the commodity's metaphysical web.

At first sight, the arrangement of _The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ looks systematic, like the work of the Bechers or the numerous grids that featured in Minimalism and Conceptual art. But it is not — or certainly, not overly so. (Rosler has written that the grid 'is not the remotest echo of a scientific or mathematical construct; if anything, the grid in art merely suggests "scientificity" and rigour'.) First of all, in the initial three elements there are empty spaces where the photographs should slot in. Why are the images missing? We will return to this telling question in the final part of this book. In the first sixteen pairings the text panel appears on the right; from element seventeen onwards this is reversed, with the text on the left and image on the right (fig.19). If this were a symmetrical arrangement, the change should pivot between elements twelve and thirteen, but its placement appears unmotivated further along the line. There are seven image/text pairs flipped in this manner. I speculated that they may represent a shift in the street sequence; perhaps even images from the other side of the road. But returning to Rosler's interviews I realised I had been inattentive, concentrating on the photographs. She has noted that this is the point at which the word groupings shift from adjectives to nouns:

_The text ends twice, comprising two series: first the adjectives, beginning with playful metaphor to describe the early, widely acceptable stages of intoxication and movingtoward the baldness of stupor and death. A second series begins, of nouns belonging firmly to the Bowery and not shared with the world outside._

Nevertheless, the pairing in the final element switches back again: photograph on the left, words on the right.

_Pace_ Rosler, while the planar or frontal mode provides the standard format for the images (seventeen in all), there are four pictures that depart from this mode. In two images the camera shifts to something of an oblique angle to the plane that characterises the others. These are the photographs in elements twelve (fig.14) and thirteen (fig.15), exactly at the midpoint of the work. They are both pictures of bank façades. It may be that at the time Rosler was not technically adept, or was insufficiently systematic in the presentation of her work; in any case this deviation introduces anomalies and incongruities into the regularity of the grid format. My guess is that had she stuck to working from her usual vantage point with a 50mm lens, it would have been impossible to capture the metonymic connections she wanted in the frame. In the picture in element twelve — the First National Bank image — the inclusion of the bank's nameplate and the two bottles would have produced a flat section of wall with none of the contingent or extraneous matter that appears in the other pictures. This would have generated a zoom-effect and broken the systematic regularity of the array. It is also possible that the characteristic profile that enables us to identify the spirit bottles would have been lost. Similarly, the next photograph, in pair thirteen, is oblique to the plane including both the discount sign and the standpipe and bottle. Whatever the reason, Rosler was prepared to break the regular format to include these anomalous images. In the final two images the camera tips downwards to depict the sidewalk and road or dirt patch, the first at something of an angle, the second some full forty-five degrees so that the ground becomes parallel to the film plane. We can say, amplifying Sekula's description, that if the first two text panels reach for the stars ('aglow', 'lit', 'illuminated', 'high', 'elevated'), the final two images plunge us into the gutter. This seems to suggest a materialist inversion of Oscar Wilde's aphorism: 'lying in the gutter, looking up at the stars'.

_The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ is, then, a botched or unsystematic system. It borrows a mode of presentation — the grid — that suggests metaphysical immobility, neutrality or objectivity, the interchangeability of commodities, the substitutability of desires... But there are grids and grids and grids, and serious thinking about art entails attention to singularity. _The Bowery_ may appear typical of much of the blank ascetic aesthetic of Conceptual art, or the non-committal irony, and absence of subjectivity or affect that characterised the art called 'postmodern'. However, this is not the knowing detachment of the dandy or the disillusion of intellectuals marked 'ex' or 'post'. Here, black humour and biting irony conjure an engaged, critical consciousness. Rosler constructed a critical engine from the seemingly neutral grid, which enables the attentive spectator to step back and reflect on the social relations of poverty and dislocation and on the means at our disposal for imagining these conditions and relations. The apparatus puts the spectator in the frame, but on this side of a line, standing with the downtrodden and defeated. It calls for identification. On the map of New York, the Bowery cuts an oblique diagonal through the grid of lower Manhattan. Rosler's _The Bowery_ does something similar with the viewer's expectations, thumbing his or her metaphoric nose as it proceeds.

### **Frames**

#### **Words and Pictures**

Rosler was one of a group of artists who, during the 1970s, rejected the desiccated formalism then prevalent for a newly charged political avant-gardism. This was a time of broad politicisation identified with the upheavals of the Vietnam War and anti-imperialist struggle, 1968 and its aftermath, the rise of the Women's Movement, black and queer liberation politics, and the configuration of the New Left. In Theodor Adorno's memorable phrase, any artist not intent on 'sleeping through the deluge that threatens them' could not help but be touched by this wave of unrest. Some artists responded to this flood as political agents without reconsidering their practice; others, like Rosler, began to rethink the critical recourses and forms for art. Comparable figures include Hans Haacke, Mary Kelly, those associated with the _The Fox_ , Victor Burgin, Jeff Wall and the other members of the San Diego group.

Rosler received her Bachelor of Arts from Brooklyn College of the City University of New York in 1965. She majored in literature, but also took painting classes. In 1968 she moved to San Diego, becoming a student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 1971, and receiving her MFA in 1974. By this time David Antin was teaching at UCSD and Eleanor Antin was there making important proto-feminist performances and postcard works. Rosler had been close to the Antins in New York, and remained so in San Diego. Of those who formed her immediate circle, Fred Lonidier and Phel Steinmetz were junior faculty at UCSD, and Sekula (who took art classes with John Baldessari) and others were students: the renowned film critic Manny Farber — who was then teaching at UCSD — called them the '[Marxist] cabal down there' in the darkroom. (Rosler was Farber's teaching assistant, which granted her a pretty rigorous education in film form.) UCSD now seems like one college in the University of California system, so it is worth recalling its position at the time. There are two points of note. First, San Diego was a centre of the US military-industrial complex — with the University receiving substantial Pentagon research funds and a prominent naval base and aerospace production facilities — and it was thus a key site of student anti-war activism (Rosler, Lonidier and Sekula all produced anti-war works). Second, UCSD was an intellectual powerhouse. While Rosler and her group were students and junior staff, Herbert Marcuse taught philosophy there and was at the height of his influence, and Fredric Jameson taught literature while working on _Marxism and Form_ (which appeared in 1971) and _The Prison House of Language_ (1972). Herb Schiller, a pioneering critic of the mass media, and Carlos Blanco, the Mexican-Spanish literary critic, were prominent radical professors. After the break-up of the Dziga Vertov Group, Jean-Pierre Gorin went to work at UCSD, though by this time he was on the now-familiar path from Maoist militant to Nietzschean visionary. Visiting faculty included Jean-Luc Godard, Roberto Rossellini, Stanley Aronowitz, Erwing Goffman, Jean-François Lyotard and Louis Marin. Rosler interacted with Jameson's students, attended lectures by Marcuse and engaged with those around him (Angela Davis was among them). Rosler, then, emerged as an artist at a highly charged crossing point of New Left politics and political modernism.

Feminism clearly needs to be added into this mix. The Women's Movement had a strong presence in California, and Rosler became actively involved. She is known as a feminist artist, and this is accurate enough. As she said to Jane Weinstock:

_Most of my work at that period was really made for women, although I know that men are interested as well._ [...] _I carethat they hear and understand me, but far less than I care that women hear and understand me._

There are, though, a couple of problems. _The Bowery_ is probably the major work by Rosler not to be focused on female subjectivity. She has said that 'bums' and 'prostitutes' constitute a pair of gendered stereotypes, so perhaps _The Bowery_ is a counterpart to her works that address the biopower exercised over women. Maybe her decision not to picture these male archetypes is a way of removing the male body; of discarding or setting aside masculinity so that something else might emerge. The other point that needs to be made here is that despite Rosler's open avowal of feminism, there are remarkably few references in her writing and interviews to women artists — she cites Eleanor Antin and Diane Rothenberg as important in shaping her ideological purview — and virtually none to feminist thinkers. At the same time, she was actively engaged with a 'socialist-feminist anti-war group' on the UCSD campus, participated in women's collective art projects and contributed montages to the feminist press.

In 1970 Judy Chicago set up the first women's art-education programme at California State University at Fresno and moved it, a year later, to California Institute of the Arts (CalArts), on the outskirts of Los Angeles, where the programme ran jointly under Chicago and Miriam Schapiro. Chicago left in 1973 and Schapiro continued for two more years. The exhibition space Womanhouse ran for a time as an annex of the CalArts programme, and the Womanspace gallery was operating in Los Angeles. Along with designer Sheila Levrant de Bretteville and art historian Arlene Raven, Chicago set up the independent Feminist Studio Network (FSN). Rosler was familiar with this scene, and in 1977 wrote an essay in _Artforum_ chiefly focused on the performance work going on at Womanhouse. Her tone was supportive, but unquestionably critical. She offered serious appraisals of work by Suzanne Lacy, Laurel Klick, Eileen Griffin and others that took as its subject violence, trauma and the female body. At the same time, she marked her distance from 'cultural feminism', which she saw as withdrawing from the public and political contestation of sexism to the creation of an enclave for mutual support; she rejected the 'hysterical expressionist tendency' that she found in much of this performance work, and probed the predominant concern with private experience and distance from activism. She also criticised the lack of engagement with class, economic realities and inequalities, and questioned the essentialist strand typical of this work. This is obviously a contested account, and polemics were flowing in all directions at the time. Rosler added important qualifications and nuances in her later essay 'The Figure of the Artist, The Figure of the Woman' (1983). Nevertheless, she reiterated the claims that feminism in California was particularly prone to 'goddess worship and mysticism, rather than economic analysis', and that both Chicago and Schapiro were 'unfriendly to socialist analysis and socialist feminism'.

But if Rosler was critical of 'cultural feminism', she also kept her distance from the emergent anti-essentialist feminism associated with French theory. The interview with Weinstock is evidently strained in relation to this theoretical trajectory. As Weinstock pushed Rosler over psychoanalysis, she responded by citing a critique of psychiatry and psychoanalysis, and stated 'I can live without Lacan'. Amusingly, Rosler replied to her interviewer 'I too reject bourgeois feminism', when Weinstock had implied no such thing. It is difficult to pin down the character of Rosler's feminism during the 1970s, but we can glimpse some defining concerns from the criticisms of both 'cultural feminism' and the feminism inspired by post-structuralism. Rosler was committed to a socialist-feminism in politics (rather than identity politics) that drew its theoretical orientation from works such as Henri Lefebvre. The biopolitical art she made during the 1970s was shaped by this outlook. It has been a pretty singular perspective in networks of art for 25 years, but it may now be gaining a new currency.

#### **Work**

During her long artistic career, Rosler has produced a diverse body of work. There have been stuffed sculptures, garage sales, postcard novels, photo-works, videos, super-8 films, installations, gardens and performances. The coherence for this output is not to be found in the medium or the subjects tackled, it is not even located in some over-arching set of political or social concerns — though there are some. She has said that she began by making sculpture, but came to recognise that she was not interested in the literal presence of things, but in 'an imaginary space where different tales collided'. This strikes me as the key point. It is this encounter or clash between distinct narratives that is the heart of Rosler's practice.

Rosler's early works include the photomontage series _House Beautiful (Bringing the War Home)_ (1967—72, fig.31), which she made for publications of the Women's Movement grass-roots publications, some of them with a feminist focus. (This work has also been referred to as _Bringing the War Back Home: House Beautiful_ , and with variations in the use of punctuation and brackets). They were also distributed as photocopies at demonstrations. A batch of projects were concerned with female subjectivation as dressage — constraining and training the body according to acceptable norms of femininity. These include two emblematic works, _Semiotics of the Kitchen_ (1975, fig.33) and _Vital Statistics of a Citizen, Simply Obtained_ , and the photomontages _Beauty Knows No Pain, or Body Beautiful_ (1966—72, fig.30), _Medical Surveillance_ (1967) and _Hothouse (Harem)_ (1972). In 1974 she began a suite of works collectively referred to by Annette Michelson as 'The Food Chain'. This group of works are all concerned with the biopolitical relations of women and food. Preparing and consuming food is depicted in these artworks as a key site of the regulation of socially acceptable versions of femininity, but also of class emulation and enculturation — here centred on the aspirant figure of the gourmet. In a study that caught Rosler's attention, Henri Lefebvre suggested 'everyday life weighs heaviest on women'. One aspect of this quotidian weight was the way that 'certain objects refuse to be restricted to the level of experience or of make-believe and become emotionally or imaginatively charged... while others attain a "superior" status and become overcharged'. His examples included: 'food (ordinary meals, good cooking, dinner parties and banquets), each level having its specific context of images and verbal commentaries'. Among Rosler's works dedicated to exploring this symbolic overcharging are the postcard novels _A budding gourmet_ (1974), _McTowers Maid_ (1975) and _Tijuana Maid_ (1975). In addition, this topic is tackled in videos such as, again, _A budding gourmet_ (1974), _The East Is Red, the West Is Bending_ (1977) and _Losing: A Conversation with the Parents_ (1977), which extend this field of concerns to anorexia. Rosler also produced installations dealing with similar themes, such as _A Gourmet Experience_ (1974). She wrote film scripts, and there were also related photo-text works such as _Know Your Servant Series, No. 1: North American Waitress, Coffee Shop Variety_ (1976). During the mid-1980s she would revisit these works with the video _Martha Rosler Reads Vogue_ (1982) and the video installation _Global Taste: A Meal in Three Courses_ (1985). In all of these works she focused on the ideological shaping of the female body and the internalisation of images and values that went with this process.

_Semiotics of the Kitchen_ — probably Rosler's best-known production and the funniest — provides a seemingly neutral alphabetical presentation of kitchen implements, which draws to the surface the frustrations and resentments of domestic labour. Here the woman depicted (Rosler herself) is transformed 'into a sign in a system of signs that represent a system of food production, in a system of harnessed subjectivity'. 'Harnessed' is a very suggestive adjective. As Rosler performs the final sequence — x, y, z — wielding a knife and fork, the ferocity is palpable; squeamish men would be advised to avert their gaze. _Semiotics of the Kitchen_ is like a constrained version of Hollis Frampton's film _Zorns Lemma_ (1970) that has turned vicious, nasty. Both _Zorns Lemma_ and _Semiotics of the Kitchen_ take the alphabet as their basic structuring device. The main section of Frampton's film consists of repeated 24-second sequences with a series of letters from New York street signage forming an alphabet; letters progressively are replaced by images ('X' is the first to disappear and is replaced by a fire, a tree substitutes for 'F' and so on). In this fashion, he builds a syncopated structure of letters and images with its own allusive logic. Rosler takes the alphabetical structure to order her presentation of kitchen implements. But the difference in mood between these two moving-image works turns, for me, on the external expansiveness of _Zorns Lemma_ — the final sequence involves a man, a woman and a dog walking through the snow. In contrast, Rosler seems trapped in her small kitchen. _Semiotics of the Kitchen_ could be described as a claustrophobic and manic reworking of structural-materialist film.

_Vital Statistics of a Citizen, Simply Obtained_ — with _The Bowery_ Rosler's most complexly structured work — picks up on the topic of control exerted over the female body, but the focus this time is on bureaucratic violence. A woman (Rosler, again) is stripped, measured, recorded and defined. In another section of the video the naked Rosler breaks eggs into a bowl. In the final part of the tape we hear a 'litany of crimes against women', taken from a Tribunal on Crimes Against Women, which is read over archival photographs from 1930s US government publications categorising and measuring the bodies of women and children. Often the subjects of these pictures are cropped and their eyes are over-printed with black blocks; hands and strange measuring implements are visible. _Vital Statistics_ is an angry and harrowing work that draws attention to the work of photography in the 'ignoble archives' and its role in subjectiv-ation and power, before Michel Foucault's writings began to have an impact on photographic theory. The context for these biopolitical reflections on the body is clearly the Women's Movement.

The figure of the woman has never really disappeared from Rosler's work. But from the mid-1970s her focus increasingly fell on the insidious everyday violence perpetrated by the US state, particularly in Latin America. Perhaps a better way of putting this is to say she explored the systemic violence perpetrated in Latin America and the seeming comfort and security of North American life. Works in this vein include the photo-text installation _The Restoration of High Culture in Chile_ and the videos _Domination and the Everyday_ (1978), _Secrets from the Street: No Disclosure_ (1980), _A Simple Case for Torture, or How to Sleep at Night_ (1983), _If It's Too Bad to Be True, It Could Be DISINFORMATION_ (video and installation with video, both 1985) and _Chile on the Road to NAFTA, Accompanied by the National Police Band_ (1997).

After _Vital Statistics_ Rosler's work is sometimes thought to have undergone a sort of downshift into formless propaganda. This reception, or at least perception, is overdetermined by the way that concerns with identity came to trump other forms of politics during the long 1980s. Rosler has observed that during this period the 'multiculturalism vogue' brought rewards unlike the previous 'vogue for "Marxism" or "political art"', and that she occupies both sides of the Marxism/'discourse of Others' debate. With the current turn to politics in contemporary art, such views are likely to dissipate, but in any case the argument about the overly-direct politics of these works misses something important — certainly in the videos, which continued to develop that 'imaginary space where different tales collided'. In these works, a focus on domination or social power and representation is combined with formal strategies of disjuncture and anti-subjectivism. Image and sound, or picture and word, continue to clash; daily violence is set against state violence. _Domination and the Everyday_ offers a good example. In this 32-minute video, family life, advertising and the photographic album are all counterposed to a radio interview with an art dealer and the naked life/'naked lie' of Chile. Channels of information smash into one another: there are found images and originated sequences, and recorded sound appropriated from radio and TV. At one point the microphone noise breaks up the soundtrack and there is a reflexive narrative produced on a text generator that crawls along the bottom of the screen. Advertising, abundance and domestic happiness are contrasted with the naked force of Augusto Pinochet — 'a Chilean gorilla' — stating in a TV broadcast 'you can be replaced'. It is a replay of the photomontage series _House Beautiful,_ where the comforts of the modern middle-class home smash up against the imperial violence dished out in Vietnam in the name of that domestic haven. In another register, _Domination and the Everyday_ is also close to _Vital Statistics_. A line from one of Rosler's essays written five years later, which describes bourgeois life as 'materially superabundant' but 'spiritually vacant', seems apposite. Throughout this period her narratives in words and pictures falter and fragment; they back-track and repeat, reiterate and reframe information. They are not at all straightforward.

_The Bowery_ sits somewhat to one side of the main lines of Rosler's work, though she returned to the theme of homelessness with the curatorial project 'If You Lived Here...' (1989), and the related Times Square billboard _Housing Is a Human Right_ (1989). It is also plausible to see the photographs of _In the Place of the Public: Airport Series_ (1981—98, fig.35) as something of an antipode for _The Bowery_ — a look at the glossy non-places of the late-capitalist economy. The last thing that can be said about _The Bowery_ is that it lacks a sense of place; it is in fact a chronotope. Certainly it sits parallel to her other works as an exploration of social systems of representation and power. _Secrets from the Street: No Disclosure_ is perhaps the most closely related work and merits more sustained consideration than I have scope for here. Shot from a moving car as if to emphasise the externality of the perspective, this video offers a look from the outside at the Mission District in San Francisco — an area where her neighbours on the block during the two years she lived there, starting in 1978, were 'Mexicans, Chinese, Puerto Ricans, Pilipinos, a Cuban Pentecostal Church, a black Baptist Church, Malaysians, Arabs and Central Americans — Salvadorians and Nicaraguans — as well as a few Anglos'. The voice-over suggests we cannot know a culture from the outside, it can only be known 'from below'. We see socialist newspaper sellers and political slogans — and hear Rosler's voice asking 'who writes the "CIA out of El Salvador"? And who put the CIA in El Salvador?' _Secrets from the Street_ meditates on the depiction of others, political tourism and art world voyeurism. These strands weave throughout her art.

#### **The Vernacular Mode**

_The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ is often seen as a work of (late) Conceptual art, and is grouped with other projects that conjoined photography and text: Robert Smithson's essay 'A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey' (1967), Ed Ruscha's photo-books (including _Twenty-Six Gasoline Stations_ (1963), _Various Small Fires and Milk_ (1964) and _Every Building on the Sunset Strip_ ) and Dan Graham's _Homes for America_ (1966—67); or, in a more overtly engaged mode, Hans Haacke's _Shapolsky et al. Manhattan Real Estate Holdings, a Real Time Social System as of May 1, 1971_ (1971), Victor Burgin's early book works (for example, _Work and Commentary_ (1973) and _Family_ (1977) and his photo-text series _UK76_ (1976)) and the exhibition 'Women and Work' (1975) by the Women and Work collective. This is probably an art-historical tidying-up of distinct practices. While there is certainly a convergence with the work of Haacke, Burgin and the Women and Work group, Rosler has suggested her interests were rooted in Pop rather than Conceptual art. It seems that it was the engagement with mass culture that attracted her to Pop art, which she understood — certainly in the case of Warhol — as a critical engagement with commodity culture. I want to restate this claim and suggest that Rosler's primary aesthetic commitment is to vernacular and everyday forms, in contrast to the transcendent strain in modernism. In her published comments we find references to Pop art and popular culture, but also Jewish humour ( _shtick_ ), documentary, folk music and the culture of the Popular Front (North American realism, despite its sentimentality). Under the impact of the political 'deluge' and the concomitant implosion of Greenbergian Modernism, Rosler found a new synthesis for her interests in North American-vernacular culture. As she put it,

_the incipient collapse of high modernism precipitated a search for new ways of knowing and representing, and new ways of reaching audiences. At that point everything was 'heterodox'..._

The point would seem to be that she mobilised vernacular forms in a deflationary assault on the elevated practices of art-making and art world talk, which she viewed as mired in individualism and expressionism, masculine assumptions, unquestioned universal values and studio routines. In contrast, vernacular practices pitted imagery against abstraction, and mixed forms against medium specificity, irony and detachment against subjective individualism and low modes against high-flown claims. Vernacular practices often interpellate the viewer: think of advertising, stand-up comedy or the direct address of the TV cookery programme. As we know, Rosler was explicitly interested in the latter, and ramped up its form of address in _Semiotics of the Kitchen_. The explosion of words in the art of the time was also significant in breaking the modernist insistence on an art of purely visual experience — this encompassed _inter alia_ advertisements, signs, cartoon speech bubbles and logos in Pop art; Richard Serra's _Verb List_ (1967—68); Carl Andre's concrete poems; and the logical propositions of linguistic Conceptual art. In the wake of these developments it became possible for Rosler to draw her interest in the poetry of everyday words into art-making.

Photography was one key practice of vernacular modernity that could be put into play against the aesthetics of transcendence, particularly documentary photography. With the recent explosion of photography in art galleries, it still seems startling to realise how little people knew of the medium's history, outside the circle of art-photography practitioners and cognoscenti. Rosler's generation was perhaps the first to begin to seriously engage with the history of photography: the San Diego group, partly due to its critical mass and partly because of some fortuitous connections, was able to develop a sophisticated understanding of the medium; Victor Burgin also mugged up; and a little later Jeff Wall would make it his business too. Rosler has said:

_we were interested in developing an aesthetics of photography that rejected formalist modernism while still believing in the power of the formal elements. At the same time, we would use photography at will, without valorising it. We wanted to be documentarians in a way that documentarians hadn't been._

This reinvention of documentary involved intervening in a conjuncture of four photographic practices.

Practice 1. Documentary developed as a tool of the liberal state and reform movements at the end of the nineteenth century, when photographs began to be utilised by private and state institutions to gather intelligence on the working class, the poor and colonial subjects for the attention of various experts. Rosler offers a precise periodisation for this documentary moment, arguing that it arose with the state liberalism of the Progressive Era and came to an end with the demise of the New Deal. Her precise time-scale is perhaps overly focused on the North American case, but it captures something significant in the wider pattern. From Jacob Riis through to 'humanist documentary', this process of investigation was built on a hierarchical vision; in each case the person with the camera had the social authority, or money, to arrange and pose others for scrutiny. These images were typically made in back streets and alleyways, quarters and slums, but circulated in metropolitan centres — in government departments, law courts or professional institutions of learning. Riis is the key figure here, but he is part of an entire genre — still current — that draws the working class into sight, challenging social managers and state functionaries to act by conjuring the threat of disease, social dislocation or revolution. In an excellent analogy, Rosler compared documentary of this type with horror movies: both, she said, put a 'face on fear'.

Practice 2. While studying literature and painting at Brooklyn College, Rosler was making photographs on the streets. This activity brought her into contact with the students of Walter Rosenblum — a stalwart of the Photo League — who were running the college darkroom and hence provided access to a largely submerged tradition of New Deal documentary and radical or populist street photography: 'gritty subjects, tough life out of doors'. As part of the New Deal, photographers associated with the Historical Section of the Farm Security dministration (FSA) concentrated on unemployment, poverty and harsh conditions, primarily in the depressed agricultural areas of the USA. They photographed share croppers, the dust bowl and human migration, and made studies of federally funded relief projects. Their photographs, which appeared in newspapers, magazines and books, helped define the collective image of the decade. Ansel Adams defined the FSA photographers as 'a bunch of sociologists with a camera'— no doubt, that was part of the attraction. While the important scholarship on the FSA lay in the future, studies were beginning to appear in the early 1970s. For the curious these works could lead back to James Agee and Walker Evans's book _Let Us Now Praise Famous Men_ (1941), and Evans's own _American Photographs._

It was Rosler's good fortune to have come into contact with Rosenblum's students, as there cannot have been many other artists at the time familiar with the work of the Photo League. The Workers' Film and Photo League in the United States was formed in the late 1920s as a Communist International organisation designed to supply the publications of the Left with photographs and propaganda materials. Although it went through many incarnations and shifted from an organisation centred on amateurs to one dominated by professionals, the League was initially focused on working-class self-representation. The League advocated realism in opposition to the arty pictorialism that dominated the camera clubs, or the European New Vision, with its tightly focused pictures of machines and glittering commodities; it also recommended proletarian photographers should turn their collective backs on 'bourgeois' genres such as nudes, middle-class portraits and still lives, and concentrate on work, political struggle and living conditions. Titles from the 1930 exhibition give the flavour: _Workers_ , _Exploitation_ and _Mobilization at Work_. Under Aaron Siskind in the later 1930s the League's Features Group produced themed documentary studies. The most ambitious of these was 'Harlem Document' (1932—40), run by Siskind with the African-American sociologist Michael Carter, but it is worth noting that another project was titled 'Dead End: The Bowery' (1937—38).

Practice 3. In the post-War period some photographers continued to make pictures in the populist mould, but as capitalism reshaped everyday life it proved increasingly difficult to sustain the Photo League's image of a pristine popular culture beyond the reach of the commodity-form. Attachment to social documentary practice began to look sentimental and nostalgic. In this transformed context, Robert Frank's book _The Americans_ (1958) presented a sour vision of the United States. Increasingly, the street tradition underwent a transmogrification, shedding the vestiges of social vision for more private concerns. The McCarthy era witch-hunt of the members of the Photo League undoubtedly accelerated this reorientation. This emphasis on the photo-grapher's sensibility was visible in the exhibition 'New Documents', organised by John Szarkowski at the Museum of Modern Art in 1967. The exhibition showcased Diane Arbus, Lee Friedlander and Garry Winogrand as successors to documentary heritage. According to Szarkowski, these photographers reshaped documentary: whereas the work of the 1930s and 40s had been allied to the politics of social reform, Szarkowski believed that contemporary photographers wished only to explore the characteristics of the medium, or express themselves. In this account, documentary turned inwards. If the work of Evans can be read as a form of dandyish detachment, the generation of the 'New Documents' shifted towards mannerism and _flânerie_. A significant feature of this work was the move from sequence or serial presentation to an aesthetic concerned with the qualities of the unique print displayed on the gallery wall.

Practice 4. ****Rosler's work has often been assimilated to late Conceptual art, sometimes called 'photo-conceptualism'. The traces of this practice are present in _The Bowery_ and its maker has acknowledged them. However, at a time when most commentators seem to believe photography in the 1960s and 70s _was_ photo-Conceptual art it seems necessary to insist on her distance from this practice. The San Diego group viewed Conceptual art 'as a version of Pop art', particularly in its photographic incarnations. They drew from photo-Conceptualism a criticism of prevailing systems of photographic representation in the interest of social reference. Nevertheless, they showed a parodic attitude to this work from the outset, most obviously in Fred Lonidier's _29 Arrests_ (1972) — 29 black-and-white photographs of protestors being arrested at the San Diego naval headquarters, in a format that reworks Ruscha's books. I have already suggested that _The Bowery_ can be taken as a retort to _Every Building on the Sunset Strip_.

_The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ has frequently been cited as a work against documentary — 'a massacre' of the genre, but Rosler has said she was committed to developing the

_germ of another documentary — a financially unloved but growing body of documentary works committed to exposureof specific abuses caused by people's jobs, by the financier's growing hegemony over the cities, by racism, sexism and class oppression; works about militancy, about self-organisation or works meant to support them. Perhaps a radical documentary can be brought into existence. But the common acceptance of the idea that documentary precedes, supplants, transcends or cures full, substantive social activism is an indicator that we do not yet have a real documentary._

A new form of critical documentary would have to begin by assessing the four practices that made up the existing conjuncture. For some prominent practitioners and theorists, this new look at documentary would soon tip over into late capitalist-scepticism, but that was not inevitable. _The Bowery_ and _Vital Statistics of a Citizen, Simply Obtained_ were as significant as any historical or critical work in this reassessment, but both are part of a project for another documentary and not a blanket rejection of the genre. I do not want to suggest that Rosler or her San Diego comrades got this right, but they grasped the parameters that would have to be reworked. Rosler engaged in an active work of negation on this conjuncture, and in the production of a novel combination of the fragments that remained.

In popular perception, documentary photography is understood as the direct or objective record of objects and events before the lens. However, it is better understood as an aesthetic mode predicated on the vernacular form of the document. Evans articulated this clearly when he said 'documentary' was what the police made, whereas he worked in the 'documentary style'. This style is characterised by four closely interlocked factors, all of which were attractive to Rosler: anti-subjectivism, vernacular form, engagement with demotic subjects and an attention turned toward the social world. In her terms, the North American documentary tradition is 'unauthored, collective, historical, vernacular and nuanced.' For her, these are all positive attributes. Her work shows liberal-humanist documentary to be irredeemably compromised, and her attitude to it is one of determinate negation. The aesthetic of the singular print and the subjectivism of the art-documentary crossover repelled her. In opposition to the New Documents aesthetic, Rosler looked back to the social commitment evident in the FSA and the Photo League, though putting it like this misses the intensity of her engagement. She did not simply adhere to the model provided by these earlier formations: she noted that the work of the League could, on the one hand, be maudlin in its sentimentality and, on the other, suffused with a macho heroism in which the brave photographer battled on behalf of society's victims. The work of the FSA was aimed not at the subjects depicted, but at powerful individuals or reform institutions. In the essay 'In, Around, and Afterthoughts', she recounts the stories of those disgruntled individuals who gave their likeness to iconic images by Dorothea Lange or Walker Evans, but who, unlike the photographers, received neither material benefit nor social recognition.

Rosler has always been careful to distinguish between practices that are often lumped together, offering instead a form of critical singularity. She was for Lewis Hine, but not Jacob Riis; she valued Robert Frank and Lee Friedlander, but has been highly critical of Diane Arbus and Garry Winogrand. Perceptively she claimed that the shift from metaphor to metonymy in the work of Frank provided the pivot for the transformation of documentary; she also wrote an important essay on the photography of Friedlander. She carefully weighed up the strengths and weaknesses of the photographers associated with the FSA, opting for a critical engagement with the detached dandyism of Evans, which she claimed 'could actually be bent to convey a political dimension'. It has become common to describe the images Evans made as 'cool' (his pictures are spare and planar and they heighten seemingly mundane details: peeling paint, simple wooden furniture and vernacular shop signs). He employed a low-plane vision focused on the ordinary and the overlooked. Such work — simultaneously the most formal and seemingly without form — provided Rosler with one important model for _The Bowery_.

It is evident that the grid structure for _The Bowery_ was drawn from Minimalism and Conceptual art, principally from the work of Eleanor Antin and Bernd and Hilla Becher. This model is clearly pitched against the single print in the art-documentary synthesis. But whereas the Bechers' grids work on the model of equivalence and substitutability, Rosler's framework provides for internal complexity. The sense of this intricacy is evident from a comparison she made between Ruscha's books and the books of Evans and Frank, which bears serious consideration. She wrote that such photo-narratives

_have structural elements in common: the structured image itself and the sequencing. Yet they are opposites. In_ [Ruscha's] Twenty-Six Gasoline Stations _the sequence is one plus one plus one, and it is a simple accretion that makes the point. In Evans and Frank, it is one plus two plus three plus four, so the actual sequence and the content make a difference. Yet they both depend on seriality, something that the photo world did not permit._

The photographs in _The Bowery_ are also clustered in syntagmatic arrays of 'one plus two plus three plus four'. (Dialecticians must learn to count to four.)

At this point it is possible to summarise Rosler's work on the photographic conjuncture. _The Bowery_ was cast against Practice 1 (liberal-humanist documentary) as a work of negation and refusal. While Rosler marks her distance from the subjective turn in street photography (Practice 3), _The Bowery_ shares the perception that a demotic street photography was no longer tenable. A socially-committed vernacular form was drawn from the FSA and the Photo League (Practice 2); while photo-Conceptualism (Practice 4) supplied the image/text combination that broke the modernist insistence on the 'purely visual'. The cool, pared-down vision (also vernacular) came from both Evans and Conceptual art. Rosler also took the grid structure from Conceptual art, but interwove it with the complex internal narrative structure that she learned from Frank and Evans. The labour on the conjuncture of photography resulted in a series of negations and fragmentary survivals that were conjoined in what we could call a novel encounter — a new configuration that clears a space and marks a beginning.

#### **Political Modernism**

The central resource for this work on the conjuncture was the emergence of what Sylvia Harvey termed 'political modernism'. (Strictly speaking, her term should be 'second-wave political modernism', with the initial phase having occurred during the 1920s and 30s.) I want to explore some aspects of this intellectual formation, and I aim to show that most considerations of this moment have conflated distinct practices — there are two paradigms at work, not one. Political modernism in the 1970s was closely identified with the work of the film-maker Jean-Luc Godard, but Bertolt Brecht's ideas from the second quarter of the twentieth century had impact on a number of artists, photographers and film-makers. These consciously produced work that combined attention to political subjects, particularly gender, with modernist formal techniques intended to disrupt the dominant conventions of the mass media. In this sense, the formation of political modernism to which Rosler belonged can also be described as 'neo-Brechtian'. Brecht's explicit comment on photography is now well known:

_A photograph of the Krupp works or AEG reveals almost nothing about these institutions. Reality as such has slipped into the domain of the functional. The reification of human relations, the factory, for example, no longer discloses those relations. So there is indeed 'something to construct', something 'artificial', 'invented'. Hence, there is in fact a need for art._

This observation condenses some of Brecht's concerns and it is clearly relevant to the decision to avoid the subject of the 'Bowery bum', but it was the wider Brechtian project, rather than the explicit photographic reference that was significant. During the 1970s a neo-Brechtian avant-garde pursued this idea of defiguring the imaginary coherence of text or image as an aesthetic-political practice. As Claire Johnston put it in 1973, 'Any revolutionary strategy must challenge the depiction of reality... so that a break between ideology and text is effected.' The neo-Brechtian practice of the time shared a series of techniques or procedures: revealing the apparatus and laying bare the device, criticising mimetic naturalism, breaking up diegesis, pictorial fragmentation, dislocating image and soundtracks, direct address to the beholder, breaking empathy or identification, dispersing point of view and displaying techniques by which the spectator was ideologically inter-pellated in the _dispositif_.

For many political modernists of the period, the work of Jean-Luc Godard, particularly the collaboration with Jean-Pierre Gorin under the name Dziga Vertov Group, figured as the reincarnation or instantiation of Brecht's project. Films such as _Vent d'Est_ (1969), _British Sounds_ (1969), _Pravda_ (1969) and _Vladimir et Rosa_ (1970) provided the example of a new didactic poetics that would be politically and formally radical. The combination in these works of Maoist sloganeering, non-naturalistic acting, interrogation of film form, disjunction of image and soundtrack and subjectivity conceptualised 'in terms of class' suggested a perspective for a reinvigorated cultural practice of the Left. As one slogan of the Dziga Vertov Group had it, 'the problem was not to make _political_ films but to make films _politically_ '; a closely related formulation from _British Sounds_ claimed 'photography is not the reflection of reality, but the reality of that reflection'. Godard's 'coquetting' with chiasmus often gets the better of him, but the point was to license work on the image as an urgent ideological task, and this body of work functioned as the lodestone for almost all of the theoretical elaborations of French and English political modernism in the late 1960s and 70s.

Political modernism in this incarnation entailed an alignment of the modernist critique of illusionism with the critique of ideology in a way that shifted concerns from 'the representation of politics' to 'the politics of representation'. The key debate was articulated in France around journals such as _Tel Quel_ , _Cahiers du cinéma_ , _Cinéthèque_ and _Critique,_ and translated in a host of English-language film magazines, with _Screen_ in pole position. There are three key elements in this configuration, and when taken together they add up to an order of practice for which Godard (and to a lesser extent the film-making partnership of Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet) stood as exemplars. First, political modernism presents a stark contrast between realism and modernism (and, subsequently, what some called postmodernism). Realism is deemed to be closed, spuriously coherent and profoundly ideological. It rests on hiding its own articulations; it presupposes what Roland Barthes called a normative 'natural attitude' to reality, generating a position of omnipotence for a beholder, who is, paradoxically, also characterised by passive consumption. It is homogenous and non-contradictory; it offers, by extension, narrative resolution, tying up the threads of the plot and leaving no emotional or ethical dilemmas unresolved. The modernist text, conceived as a form of 'theoretical practice', is deemed to counter this naïve empiricism by calling attention to its artifice, by moving from the bracketing of the referent to the construction of meaning in difference and by disturbing identification and the imaginary coherence of the narrative. It stresses contradiction and through this it is said to put a premium on the active consciousness of the spectator.

Secondly, political modernism rested on what _Tel Quel_ called the _théorie d'ensemble_ (or what Art & Language, less charitably, characterised as the _nouveau mélange_ and 'the French disease'), the specific conjuncture of Althusserian Marxism, Lacanian psychoanalysis and semiotics. In the 'ideology of the visible' a _dispositif_ was said to secure the subject in a position of imaginary dominance via the psychic mechanisms of identification and voyeurism. In contrast, the _théorie d'ensemble_ had as its political task a wholesale reconfiguration of a subject in process. Documentary photography and Hollywood narrative cinema were both criticised for trading on naturalistic attitudes and producing their effects and particular pleasures for detached or passive spectators. If the conjoining of documentary and Hollywood seems odd, we should remember that from the perspective of a political modernism that incorporates Louis Althusser's critique of empiricist epistemologies, the realist text was a formal process of enunciation and interpellation, rather than a style or thematic; in this account, there was minimal difference between (in book and film) _The Grapes of Wrath_ and _The Sound of Music, L'Assommoir_ and _Toad of ToadHall._ Dominant cinema worked by interpellation and suture. As Marcelin Pleynet put it, 'only when... the determinations of the apparatus (the camera) that structures reality by its inscription have been considered, only then could cinema objectively examine its relation to ideology...' Before a film is even produced, Pleynet argued, 'the technical construction of the camera already produces bourgeois ideology'. There is a whole debate about the origins of perspective and the subject at stake here, but we must leave that aside.

The third feature of this configuration involved an avant-gardist rejection and negation of popular and realist representations as forms that reproduced positions of subjection to the dominant ideology. The counter-model of political modernism — sometimes called 'counter-cinema' or critical practice — was an operation of radical _écriture_ (the readerly rather than writerly, following Barthes's formulation). The open, modernist text, it was claimed, focused attention on the supposed 'materiality of the signifier', and disrupted the imaginary relations of coherence, dispersing the point of fixity created by representation and untying the suture that bound the subject in place. Here the writings of both Barthes and Jacques Derrida were significant, but, with the Maoist rupture in _Tel Quel_ , Philippe Sollers and Jean-Louis Baudry gave the argument a distinctively political spin (not unlike the recoding of Russian Formalism at the hands of the LEF group), whereby the avant-garde text distanced or estranged the 'reader' from his or her place in the order of social reality. _Écriture_ — characterised against _parole_ — worked on dismantling narrative codes and disrupting the stability of meaning and identity, and thus brought into focus the work of ideology. In contrast to realism, the practice of _écriture_ was non-representational, undermining the readability or transparency of the text. Julia Kristeva's _The Revolution in Poetic Language_ (1974) is paradigmatic for this attitude, but it did not appear in English until 1984. In its stead, Baudry's essay 'Writing, Fiction, Ideology' (1974) can be treated as symptomatic in its advocacy of 'unreadability' as a project. An emphasis on text as text, he argued, placed a premium on reading and unravelled realism's transcendental fixity and identification, offering instead a space from which to reconfigure a self-conscious and active subject open to new political possibilities. Political modernism in the late 1960s and 70s was a radical formalism.

As we have seen, reflecting on what they had tried to do in San Diego, Rosler said: 'We wanted to be documentarians in a way documentarians hadn't been.' She continued:

_As viewers of Godard, we wanted to parasitise all forms — and foreground the apparatus. As readers of Brecht, we wanted to use obviously theatrical or dramatised sequences or performance elements together with more traditional documentary strategies, to use text, irony, absurdity, mixed media forms of all types..._

The work of Rosler and her San Diego comrades seems to share the political modernist 'problematic' in the strictest Althusserian sense of the term. If anything, their contribution appears a weak or incoherent version of this project — one that was unable to jettison empiricist and humanist illusions. Sekula's manifesto mentioned two documentaries, Barbara Kopple's _Harlan County, USA_ and Jim Klein, Julia Reichert and Miles Mogulescu's _Union Maids,_ both classic films of Left realism made in 1976. His own _Aerospace Folktales_ of 1973 developed the performative dimension of documentary, and Lonidier's _Health and Safety Game_ turns on the evidential mode. Rosler herself affirmed her commitment to a certain kind of documentary and retained a vocabulary rooted in Hegelian or humanist Marxism.

Rather than viewing the San Diego project as a flawed or inconsistent political modernism, it is more accurate to characterise it as a variant problematic or a 'singular conjuncture', where an object or concept is constituted in mutual patterns of determination. In _Vent d'Est,_ Godard and Gorin erased, one by one, the names of critical thinkers of importance to them, finally crossing-through 'Brecht'. They were right to do so, because their neo-Brechtianism was distant from Brecht in fundamental ways. Second-wave political modernism followed Althusser into a version of knowledge that was rationalist, conventionalist and anti-realist. This incarnation of political modernism was also opposed to popular narrative forms, which it claimed inscribed the subject in ideology. For the thinkers from _Tel Quel_ through _Screen_ , Brecht was _the_ thinker of the _Verfremdungseffekt_ (alienation effect or estrangement), understood as critical labour on the text/subject. His presence in these debates provided a kind of Leftist backfill for a 'politics of form'. This was a Brecht funnelled through Althusser and Jacques Lacan, with textualism waiting just over the horizon. Brecht as the champion of popular entertainment and realism or the advocate of learning through practice barely figured in the argument. In contrast, the San Diego circle remained committed to the popular and realist Brecht, the Brecht who wrote: 'Literary forms have to be checked against reality, not against aesthetics — even realist aesthetics.' Rosler and her collaborators did not subscribe to the _théorie d'ensemble_. Brecht and Godard were important points of reference for them, but so were Chris Marker, Latin American cinema and documentary photography. Roman Jakobson and Barthes — particularly the early Barthes — were significant, but they showed little or no interest in Althusserianism or psychoanalysis. This comes through forcefully in Jane Weinstock's interview with Rosler for _October_ , with its moments of sheer mutual incomprehension. Lefebvre, Georg Lukács, Marcuse and Sartre were in fact more prominent in the intellectual make-up of the San Diego group. If _The Bowery_ did not partake of Marcuse's aesthetic judgements, it remained in the intellectual orbit of his book _One Dimensional Man: Studies in the Ideology of Advanced Industrial Society_ (1964). Humanist categories drawn from Hegelian Marxism, such as experience, freedom, self-determination, repression, domination and alienation, were central to Rosler. _The Bowery_ is held in tension between humanism and anti-humanism, and is probably the better for the contradiction or irresolution. The San Diego group were interested in popular forms, with vernacular practices and documentary photography sitting alongside the work of Godard and Straub and Huillet. In addition, they focused on the cognitive and pedagogical dimensions of representation, rather than on the reconfiguration of the subject. As Rosler said, they wanted to be documentarians in a new way.

Second-wave political modernism entails an enormously rich theoretical legacy, which we now need to re-engage seriously, if critically. Crucial work was done by those aligned with it in recovering the lost radical aesthetics of the 1920s and 30s, and important theoretical developments were made in the politics of form and conceptions of ideology. What seems to be missing from the formation of the 1970s is Brecht's realism, his sense of crude thinking, popular pleasure and learning, not to mention his determination to locate himself in a conjuncture in order to 'refunction' prevailing forms. Centrally, the problem with the political modernist formation of the 1970s was an idealist perspective that imagined the subject as constituted in representation, and therefore believed it could be reconfigured through a disturbance in diegesis. There is nothing in Brecht — or for that matter in Althusser, Freud or Lacan — to sanction such a perspective, and the abandonment of the critique of political economy proved fatal for theory and (political as well as artistic) practice. In any case, the purist rejection of narrative, realism and documentary was always going to make political modernism a minority academic affair, and in a period of neoliberal ascendency this was all the more the case. If second-wave political modernism in its dominant strain held to a restrictive theoretical canon, it was also exclusive in its filmic points of reference and largely ignored other forms of Marxist and radical work, including Latin American cinema, neorealism, the New German Cinema, Third Cinema and even British sit-coms. For today's generation of radical artists, it is the three film-makers almost wholly absent from these debates that stand out: Alexander Kluge, Harun Farocki and, above all, Chris Marker. They belong to an alternative Brechtian lineage that privileges the cognitive dimension of representation, rather than work on the subject. Rosler knew this alternative line out of Brecht (via Farber). This made Rosler's political modernism contradictory and impure, but it enabled _The Bowery_ to construct a dialectical third.

### **Speculations**

Benjamin Buchloh: _So The Bowery is not a utopian piece but a work defined by double negation?_  
Martha Rosler: _That is correct. But it doesn't mean that I wasn't in some strong sense a utopian._

Jane Weinstock: _There is an implicit utopianism_ [in _Semiotics of the Kitchen_ ] _which I don't share._  
Martha Rosler: _Yes, it might involve an implicit utopianism._

#### **The Poetry of the Future (Three Blank Sheets)**

I would like to back-track a little and begin at the beginning by taking a look at those blank, black spaces in _The Bowery_ where there ought to be photographic images (fig.3—). Looking but not seeing. Not seeing because nothing is visible. Blind seeing. In the first three elements the photographs are absent, or, at least, imageless. The version in _3 Works_ is distinct, but related: a black-card insert appears alongside the first text panel, marking off _The Bowery_ from _The Restoration of High Culture in Chile_ , which precedes it. This sheet separates the two works, but the verso also supplies a blank substitute for the first image. In the next two image spaces the sheet is created from the blank verso of the previous page. The opening sequence thus runs: black sheet/text; white sheet/text; white sheet/text. Blind seeing and white light. Then the regular oppositions begin. The two white sheets are not entirely blank — they bear page numbers. Oddly, these imageless beginnings seem to have gone unnoticed. It is as if the critics have been unable to see the emptiness as significant or to make anything of the marked/unmarked opposition.

_Vital Statistics of a Citizen, Simply Obtained_ — another work concerned with photography and power — provides an important clue to this strange act of beginning. At the start of the video the narrator (Rosler) speaks about what is to come as 'opera in three acts'. The voice-over states 'this is a work about perception; there is no image on the screen just yet...' and continues in this blind state for almost two minutes. Rosler has described this opening section as a 'voice-only prologue', and this makes _Vital Statistics_ , like _The Bowery_ , begin with words and absent images. Black or blank leader (the opaque celluloid strip used to spool film into the projector) played a prominent role in the avant-garde film of the period, in which we repeatedly encounter commentary — speech or writing — over blackness (other hues were used too; white is becoming increasingly popular in more recent art). This device is prominent in works by Godard (and Gorin), Straub and Huillet, Farocki, Marker... Despite the technical oddity, it was also carried over into video. Indeed, the presence of black leader could be viewed as the privileged signifier of second wave political modernism. It is possible that this absence of images is meant to signal that _The Bowery_ is a work of poetry, by emphasising words at the outset, but it could also be seen as disassembled film produced before the artist could afford to hire a Bolex and pay for the film stock. There are 24 frames or elements, and viewed as a storyboard for an unmade film the final flipped image/text element makes some sense as an end title. It might be described as a sort of static film made from exploding _Let Us Now Praise Famous Men_ with its spare photographs by Evans of Depression-era poverty and Agee's combination of crafted prose and simple lists.

At its worst, the use of black leader was an avant-garde tick, a habitual way of filling empty time or spinning-out narrative without the need for costly images. When it was used productively — and the Dziga Vertov Group films are the _locus classicus_ — it draws attention to the disjuncture between word and image and gestures towards the difficulty or inadequacy of form-giving; it marks the problem of creating pictures that will convey significant knowledge about the totality of capitalist social relations. In these films, black leader forces separation and enacts an impasse. It calls on viewers to imagine an absent totality and asks us to consider what kind of images would be required to map contemporary capitalism, what would be needed to bring the defining social relations into the light of day. _Vladimir et Rosa_ is particularly revealing in this regard, because in this case the absence of images produces a self-reflexive joke. This film addresses the trial of the Chicago Eight for conspiracy following protests at the Democratic Convention in 1968, when the Black Panther leader Bobby Seale attempted to represent himself and disrupted proceedings. Judge Hoffman had Seale bound and gagged, and then removed from the courtroom to the cells, before sentencing him to four years for contempt of court. Here, a modernist problem of representation turns into symbolic figuration — black leader stands for, and pays homage to, Seale, the absent black leader. In this case the colour black is a metaphor for the law's inability to hear or see the protest of African-Americans. In a related vein, one critic — reflecting on Marker's _Sans Soleil_ (1982) — has suggested that this black colour represents politics in counterposition to the blue of beauty, and that both figure 'race'. Indeed they do, but not only race.

The refusal or negation enacted in the use of black leader takes us to the central iconoclastic gambit of _The Bowery_ : the figuring of representational systems as inadequate. 'I don't think any system of representation is adequate', Rosler claimed two decades later; afterwards, in the same interview, this opinion is qualified and the inadequacy of the title is said to have 'meant the inability to represent the actual underlying social structures of those spaces'. We should push a little further with regard to this claim of political modernism and return to my earlier question: what is inadequate about these descriptive systems? As I indicated, the standard account characterises the 'systems' as words and pictures or language and photographs. Some have been more specific. Sekula spoke of metaphor in the word groupings; Alex Alberro has noted Rosler's suspicion of metaphor and claimed 'the operative rhetorical device in Rosler's work is metonymy'. Annette Michelson has invoked the relation between metaphor and metonymy in Rosler's 'Food Chain' works. Rosler herself has said that the photographs that are part of _The Bowery_ constitute 'a radical metonymy'. Try again.

When Buchloh asked Rosler what the systems were inadequate to, she responded 'inadequate to experience'. The most resonant and probing consideration of this figurative patterning appears in Rosler's interview with Craig Owens. In this exchange, which took place in 1985, she suggests that _The Bowery_ is organised around an opposition — 'two poles' — between the literal and the metaphorical. Alternatively, they can be characterised as individual/general or concrete/abstract. This is a complex argument that shuttles between the literal as equivalent for experience and metaphor as the site of universal claims. Rosler tells us that she is 'suspicious of metaphor' as a well-understood aesthetic move that generalises 'from the ground of concrete reality'. Metaphor shifts from 'the realm of ordinary discourse into a more stratified and rarefied one'; it distils 'ordinary experience into a universal essence'. This seems a straightforward enough period insistence on the atrophy of experience and loss of reference in the 'bureaucratic society of controlled consumption'. But she goes on to say that both the literal and the metaphorical are 'blinds':

_Both my poles are, in a sense, false. The individual, concrete or literal level that appears is a false literal. The generalisation that flows from it is only an exemplary, hypothetical generalisation._

This claim entails a nuanced understanding of experience and representation. She could have picked up this idea from her postgraduate work in linguistics, the study of poetry or reading Henri Lefebvre, it does not matter which. The key is that both poles are rhetorically positioned; we have a false literal and a metaphorical act of generalisation. At the same time, Rosler keeps her distance from straightforward scepticism, noting that once the 'literal, flat straightforward ground' is prepared, she selects a few metaphors which then move away from this 'very particular situation towards the suggestion of a broader analysis, one not so apparent in daily life'. She shifts from the literal (experience) to generalisation: experience and abstraction are necessary complements in the production of knowledge, necessarily limited and equally figured in representation.

Struggle on. The term 'metonymy' does not appear in the interview with Owens, unless metaphor is used in the broad sense of referring to all tropes. The interview might be taken to locate the photographs at the 'literal' pole and the word clusters at the 'metaphorical' one, but this is not entirely clear. We know from Richard Shiff that photographs are best understood not as literal, but 'proper' — that is, figured images that occupy the literal position in the range of available representations, from which others depart. Strictly, Rosler's 'literal' is a 'proper' term. In any case, we have three terms and not two: literal, proper and figured (metaphor and metonymy). My suggestion is that the literal should not be allocated exclusively to either pictures or text, rather it is the ground from which both turn away — and, importantly, to which both seek to return. The textual element operates in the register of metaphor. We have seen that the sequence shifts from adjectives to nouns, but the grammatical difference makes no difference to the metaphorical status of the selected words. The photographs work through the metonymical register; closely associated objects — principally bottles, but also shoes, cigarette packets and a location — stand in for absent bodies. Typically, it is Rosler who has understood this best. In the photographs, linked chains of contiguity move from discarded things to people and back again. It is possible that images and words are, in the words of Henri Lefebvre, two wings of a 'contrasting diptych', in which the 'first panel conveys the _misery of everyday life_ ' while 'the second panel portrays the _power of everyday life_ '. I suspect Rosler was reading attentively.

The two inadequate systems are then not image and text, nor words and photographs, and certainly not 'documentary', but metaphor and metonymy. Inadequacy signifies the figurative departure from the ground of experience called 'literal'. The three opening blank sheets indicate this. The 'negation' performed by _The Bowery_ is a double 'refusal' of figuration, as it departs from empirical proximity. It should be remembered that _Vital Statistics_ is also a work about social abstraction in which Rosler quotes Sartre: 'Evil demands only the systematic substitution of the abstract for the concrete. To escape from the trap of figuration back to concrete experience' — this is Rosler's project. 'The problem is... to get back to zero', as Juliet Berto states in Godard's _Le Gai Savoir_ (1968). Despite Rosler's words to Buchloh, _The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ is a desperate attempt to clear a path — it is a degree zero artwork.

Rosler was not alone in this act of renunciation. At this time a number of artists sought a route through the thickets of representation. Susan Sontag's essay 'The Aesthetics of Silence' (1969) is a good example, but the point can perhaps best be made through a consideration of Don DeLillo's _Americana_ (1971), a 'guerrilla war' conducted behind enemy lines. DeLillo's novel is a search for 'colourless language' in opposition to mediatised consciousness. This is undoubtedly a Vietnam book, but one that pursues the immanent violence of US imperialism through the country's media representations: one character declares he is 'willing to die for our country, or for photographs of our country'. In DeLillo's book media-as-consciousness takes the form of 'slang', which must be purified by stripping down language to 'blandness'. There is an obvious connection to the lexicon of _The Bowery_ — 'a poetry out of prison'. For the character Bobby Brand, an ex-Vietnam War bomber pilot turned drug dealer and then novelist, blandness implies non-violence. David Bell, the central character, is making an 'anti-movie' — a work of avant-garde film (Jonas Mekas is cited) — with a 'single camera position' and a monologue by an 'expressionless actor'. His projected work takes a week to view and becomes darker and more silent as it progresses. The parallels with Rosler's works require little comment, though she has never gone for the endurance model and the sequence in _The Bowery_ runs the other way round.

The work of Roland Barthes was clearly important for the young Rosler: 'The Food Chain' works are attempts at a feminist mythography, _Semiotics of the Kitchen_ is a kind of botched or cod-structuralism (in my view, it is all the better for the shortfall), and _The Bowery_ speaks of 'systems'. However, it is the earliest Barthes of _Writing Degree Zero_ (1953) that seems most symptomatic. My point is not to suggest that Rosler knew this book, which appeared in English in 1968 — though she probably did (it is notable that Marcuse cited it on three occasions in _One-Dimensional Man,_ it is mentioned approvingly in Lefebvre's _Everday Life in the Modern World_ (1968) and Jameson discussed it in _The Prison-House of Language_ ). Even less am I suggesting that _The Bowery_ is a programmatic response to Barthes's argument. However, his account offers an exceptional and symptomatic reading of the modernist search for colourless or 'white writing', by which Barthes means a non-figurative language. Barthes's 'white writing' is, I think, the direct correlative of black leader. _Writing Degree Zero_ is widely recognised as a repost to Sartre's _What Is Literature?_ (1948). Barthes cast modernist _écriture_ against the 'commitment' of the generation of the Resistance. For him 'literature' was a form of writing beyond content that developed in the middle of the nineteenth century, when the bourgeoisie lost any claim to embody undivided or universal consciousness. With the ideological crisis of the middle class, the clarity of classical language was fractured. Under these circumstances, the generation that went from Gustave Flaubert to Stéphane Mallarmé set about destroying language and generated a form of 'writing degree zero'. This third-degree writing beyond language and style was a 'colourless writing', and its contemporary representatives included Albert Camus, Maurice Blanchot and Raymond Queneau. Before long Alain Robbe-Grillet would be cast as the key figure. According to Barthes, in writing the word was an 'alibi' for power; literature, in contrast, is unstable, and is literature only in so far as it is powerless. Evidently, this is an argument for the autonomy of literature, where 'political writing' and 'intellectual writing' appear as blind alleys.

If this Barthesian _écriture_ is formalist, it retains a political intent. Communists, he claimed, were the only people attempting to sustain writing, long after the bourgeoisie had given up the task. There is a great deal to be said concerning Barthes's fascinating discussion of the differences between the language and writing of the French Revolutionaries, Marx, Stalinists, Trotskyists (he was much influenced by a Trotskyist print worker) and the French Communist Party, but space forbids this detour. The alternative for Barthes was 'colourless writing'; this was not 'impassive' or 'innocent', but an attempt to go past literature into a utopian space beyond social division. This zero degree is therefore not a total absence (this is a common mistake), it is a significant stripping away. The zero degree is a relational category in which the relative absence of figuration suggests the presence of the literal (or proper). This seems very much to be what Rosler is saying about the literal and the metaphorical positions; both are false poles or positions in figuration. In a wonderful passage Barthes suggests that writing degree zero

_carries at the same time the alienation of History and the dream of History; as a Necessity, it testifies to the division of languages which is inseparable from the division of classes; as Freedom, it is the consciousness of this division and the very effect which seeks to surmount it. Feeling permanently guilty of its own solitude, it is none the less an imagination eagerly desiring a felicity of words, it hastens towards a dreamed-of language whose freshness, by a kind of ideal anticipation, might portray the perfection of some Adamic world where language would no longer be alienated._

Writing degree zero or colourless writing is a literature stripped bare, in order to instantiate 'the utopia of language' that would be beyond language.

It is apparent that I see _The Bowery_ as a zero-degree work, where the relational or relative absence of figuration anticipates an imminent utopian zone of experience in a world beyond alienation and social division. This is the place beyond representation as an alibi for power imagined by Barthes, beyond the mediatised violence and slang characterised by DeLillo. More generally stated, _The Bowery_ is a work of refusal or negation — a clearing away of ideology, in an attempt to reconcile experience and language. For Lefebvre, while it can never actually be reached, the 'zero point' involves 'a kind of intellectual and social asceticism' that 'defines everyday life' beneath a world of apparent affluence. It represents an urge to put subjects back in control of their world, or, to employ the New Left's Hegelianised terms that Weinstock found so troubling, to overcome alienation and repair the rift created by capitalism between 'self' and 'reality', to rediscover a place for 'experience' against the violence of 'abstraction'. In the wake of post-Althusserian philosophy, these concepts no longer seem quite so dust-laden; indeed, the passion for the real that emerges from Rosler's 'purging' of language seems both rigorous and vital. This is how the problem was put by Samuel Beckett in 1937:

_As we cannot eliminate language all at once, we should at least leave nothing undone that might contribute to its falling into disrepute. To bore one hole after another in it, until what lurks behind it — be it something or nothing — begins to seep through; I cannot imagine a higher goal for a writer today._

We might add, or for an artist. Rosler's colourless photography is an act of decomposition that bores through the fabric of representation in order to subtract the happy illusions of the twentieth century. There must be a suspicion, as Beckett sensed, that there is nothing really lurking there. On the whole, though, Rosler's _The Bowery_ displays a less nihilistic urge to grasp the new, it suggests a radical act of refoundation. Getting back to zero — perhaps to year zero — and beginning over again is a violent work of renunciation as a condition for recommencement. The important question is what seeps through. For Lefebvre the answer is everyday life; perhaps it is for Rosler too.

This may be a voluntarist act of negation, but it is one that seeks to face the future without illusion. It is not unreasonable to relate this perspective to those passages in Marx and Engels's _Communist Manifesto_ (1848) that proclaim and celebrate the end of old customs, established ways and everything that reeks of stasis or stagnation. Even nearer the mark are the opening ruminations from Marx's _The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte_ (1851—52) on the revolutions of the past — draped in the costumes and language of the Old Testament or Roman Republic — and the 'social revolution of the nineteenth century' — the coming revolution — that 'can only create its poetry from the future, not from the past. It cannot begin its own work until it has sloughed off all its superstitious regard for the past.' Colourless art draws its poetry from the future.

At this point I should face an objection head-on. It would be correct, I think, to state that if Rosler positions both systems as inadequate — if both metaphors and metonyms turn from experience — they do so in distinct fashions. In fact, the slang lexicon might be said to be 'colourful', rather than colourless. Where the photographs pare down towards zero, the words stack layer upon layer of meaning and reference. _The Bowery_ thus pulls in two directions at once, it is subtractive and additive. But both paths can be seen as attempts to escape ideology or figuration and regain the ground of common experience. Minimalism and exuberance, or emptiness and abundance, have been the twin lines of flight taken by artists from the unstable ground of capitalist modernity. T.J. Clark's account of the art of Jackson Pollock provides the best account of this paired escape trajectory from the heaped-up ruins of the twentieth century. Perhaps closer to hand, Agee and Evans's book _Let Us Now Praise Famous Men_ , a work Rosler read avidly, also pursues both options; on the one hand, Agee gives us super-saturated metaphorical passages, and, on the other, protracted lists. If zero-degree writing or colourless photography offer an exit from figuration, then proliferation and excess provide another way of outrunning representation by accruing connotations to the point that they become impossible to follow and hence meaningless. _The Bowery_ unites these twin imperatives of renunciation, working both poles at once. It strips down photography to something approaching white light, and builds up colourful writing. Asceticism is joined to panache or exuberance in a broken totality; this strange work takes both paths to a possible clearing beyond the ruins and trash of capitalist dereliction.

#### **A Poetic Mode**

If _The Bowery_ is a poetry project, it makes sense to ask in which poetic mode is it composed. One way to characterise the strategies adopted by Barthes (colourless writing), DeLillo (blandness), Marx (the poetry of the future) and, by extension, Rosler in _The Bowery_ , is to say they are variants of the sublime mode as testimony to the unrepresentability of the social. The sublime mode has a fashionable presence in art and theory, but I am unconvinced that it is the mode in question. The aesthetics of the sublime does not really capture the desire to bore a hole in figuration, or Marx's commitment to drawing poetry from the future. If language or representation — metaphor and metonym — are placed in question in _The Bowery_ it is not to turn away from cognition and the project of totalisation, but to reach beyond the presently saturated state of capitalist consciousness to new forms of social action and experience.

In conclusion to this study, and as an alternative to sublime vision that refuses totalisation, I offer what could be considered a scandalous proposition. _The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ is a work in the pastoral mode. After all, the Bowery itself was named for the track leading to the _bouwerij_ , the farm of Peter Stuyvesant, the last governor of the colony of New Amsterdam. The vision of a floral bower overhangs this work. In a wonderful comment, Rosler has suggested that, while the area was strewn with bottles and the occasional shoe, there were no flowers, 'despite its name still describing its country past'. Catherine de Zegher has acutely observed that

_along with social and political subject matter in her work, Rosler had filmed and photographed flowers in landscapesand cityscapes of different places — sometimes far away, whenever she was travelling, sometimes in her backyard._

Floral imagery spans Rosler's entire output, from the super-8 film _Flower Fields_ (1975, fig.32) to the photographic series _Passionate Signals_ (1995) and beyond. She has also made a series of gardens, including a section of _Unsettling the Fragments_ for Skulptur Projekte in Münster in 2007 and _Proposed Helsinki Garden at the Singapore Biennale_ (2011). _The Bowery_ is a further, displaced example. Posies and poesies have always been closely linked, and the image of a floral bower frames this odd compilation of photographs and words. Doubtless, many of the key topoi of the pastoral are absent from _The Bowery_ : the shepherds Bion, Daphnis, Lycidas, Tityrus and their like are missing; there are no sylvan glades, no muses, fauns or dyad nymphs; honey and milk are lacking, so are reed pipes. Nevertheless, there are vines, and Bacchus conducts his revels in these streets; there may even have been a cyclops or two. More seriously, conjoining the bower with the 'low' or 'simple' figure of the bum as archetype or representative figure, and combining quotidian forms and temporal suspension, puts us four-square in the pastoral mode.

In some ways this should come as no surprise. In an influential study, Leo Marx suggested that the North American experience was fundamentally marked by the idea of the pastoral landscape and its contradictions. _The Bowery_ belongs in a long North American tradition of 'middle landscape', which mixes urban and rural themes: Andrew Jackson and Thomas Jefferson, Mark Twain and Herman Melville all worked this legacy. In this tradition freedom is tied to the human presence in the landscape. _Let Us Now Praise Famous Men_ is also a work in the pastoral mode with its Depression-era 'shepherds', and Brecht (along with Jaroslav Hašek) is the key inheritor of the 'mock pastoral' tradition. The quotidian is at the heart of pastoral, with its negotiation of high and low positions, in a way that is close to Rosler's project. Once you begin to look, there are all manner of classical pastoral resonances in Rosler's found words: 'emperor', 'rosy', 'oiled', 'down with the fish', 'vulcanized' and so forth. But more than this, the text panels all recall forms of bliss and satiation — they convey something of the idleness in the garden that is a recurrent theme in the pastoral mode. In element sixteen the photograph contains both a sign for a water fountain (Rosler refers to 'crystal grottoes') and there are sculptures of classicised 'rapt cherubim' playing musical instruments (fig.18). As I noted previously, this calls to mind those utopian tales centred on a life of abundance and ease. As William Empson suggests in his great account of the pastoral mode, death is the only remedy for the restless, but alcohol is the next best thing.

The most telling sign of the pastoral mode appears in the final image (element twenty-four, fig.26). Among the trash — bottles, a broken glass or bottle, cigarette stubs, leaves and string — there is a little smashed figurine. The indeterminate white object between the bottles may be its detached base and perhaps the white blob to the left is part of the head. It is probably cast from some ceramic material, but it could be made from stucco or gesso. This fantasy rural figure is carrying a basket (most probably one half of a pannier) suspended from what looks like a milk-maid's yoke. The basket, however, is not a milk pail, but a wicker container of the sort used for transporting apples, vegetables or other agricultural produce. It is possible that this ornamental object represents a female pastoral figure (if so it would be a central presiding female presence in _The Bowery_ ), but as the head and lower leg are detached we can't be certain of its gender. In any case, the costume of skirts and under-leggings combined with basket and yoke make this an unmistakably rural image. If the object in the centre is indeed the separated base, we can conclude that it was probably found in situ, but there must be a suspicion that Rosler composed this damaged still life, importing or rearranging the little agrarian sculpture alongside the detritus of alcoholism. (Arthur Rothstein's creation of an iconic FSA photograph of the Depression era in 1936, by moving a steer's skull from a grassy patch to the cracked soil of the Dakota Badlands, springs to mind.) She may not have arranged it herself, but she certainly allocated it a prominent place in the frame and the sequence, and this suggests a high degree of reflexive awareness. But whether composed or found, a broken pastoral figure appears at the end of the work and casts its cracked shadow over the preceding images and texts. The references to the pastoral life are there in _The Bowery_ , intentional or not.

The pastoral mode is rooted in the poetry of classical antiquity, especially in _The Idylls_ by Theocritus, a poet born in Syracuse in the third century BCE, and Virgil's _The Eclogues_ , completed in 37 BCE. It is conventional to say that Theocritus wrote bucolic verse, a term he was the first to use (from Greek _boukolos_ or 'cowherd'), and that Virgil distilled or crystallised occasional themes in the work of his forerunners into a coherent poetic practice. Building on the elasticity of these classical authors, pastoral poetry (from Latin _pastor_ or 'feeder', 'shepherd') was a creation of Renaissance writers — Andrew Marvell, William Shakespeare, Philip Sidney and Edmund Spenser among them. While rural life and rustic settings are central to the pastoral, it should be apparent that pastoral poetry is actually urban poetry, which contrasts nature to artifice or even art. However, as Michael McKeon has noted, this is a dialectical structure, and the unitary poles are infiltrated by their opposites. Theocritus, along with the other Alexandrian poets, responded to what he perceived as the end of the heroic age with self-consciously short poems on everyday themes and ordinary people. Virgil adapted the theme of the shepherd singer from _The Idylls_ as a representative figure for the poet. At the core of this mode is the idea of loss and stillness or suspension. Some aspects of the pastoral mode have been more amenable to artists than others, principally stillness or calm; nevertheless, it has been a key theme in Western art from the _Fête champêtre_ ( _Pastoral Concert_ , c.1509) by Giorgione and Titian, via the paintings of Claude Lorrain, Nicolas Poussin and Antoine Watteau to the landscapes of George Stubbs and Samuel Palmer.

Critics have often confused the pastoral with nostalgia for a lost golden age or Arcadia, viewing the mode as escapist frippery concerned with fantasy rurals who, satiated by an abundance of good things, spend their time dozing in the golden light of the midday sun. These perpetually idle figures seem troubled by nothing more substantial than the humming of bees or the frolicking of lambs. Marxist critics of pastoral — Raymond Williams and John Barrell, for example — have rightly damned this polite refusal to see the brutal processes of agricultural surplus extraction and accumulation by dispossession, counter-posing to this carefully screened idyllicism the more critical vision of George Crabbe and George Morland. Williams and Barrell make a powerful case against pastoral poetry and art, and what is there really to say about toffs playing at goatherds or shepherdesses? But at its best the pastoral mode offers more, and as a way of thinking again about Rosler's _The Bowery_ , I want to begin to outline a pastoral vision in and for Marxism.

In _The Eclogues_ we encounter civil war, eviction from the land and disruptive commerce; there is also bestiality, cannibalism, infanticide, rape, rejection and suicide. There are also summer droughts and biting cold, winter floods and rain. This is what makes Poussin's two versions of _Et Arcadia Ego_ (1627 and 1637—38) the compelling examples of the mode in the visual arts. Following Empson's account, the key characteristic of this poetic mode is not the presence of shepherds or descriptions of country life, but the voicing of rich themes through the simple or down-to-earth representatives — 'putting the complex into the simple'. According to Empson, such figures have defining modal significance for poetry; if you select an important character 'the result is heroic, if you select an unimportant one it is pastoral'. _The Bowery_ certainly does not strike its viewers/readers as nostalgic. Rosler consciously rejected the assumptions underpinning the Photo League's fight on behalf of the oppressed. She made _The Bowery_ by turning away from the heroic mode and her negations are designed to keep this form of artistic valour at arm's length. Rosler proclaimed her found words 'a poetry-out-of-prison', and Sekula called these language groupings 'largely the socio-linguistic "property" of the working class and the poor'. In pastoral poetry ordinary figures embody complexity of experience. This is why Empson's book focuses on proletarian novels, John Gay's _The Beggar's Opera_ (1728) and Lewis Carroll's _Alice's Adventures in Wonderland_ (1865) _,_ alongside the discussions of Andrew Marvell, William Shakespeare and Edmund Spenser. In a rare attempt to extend Empson's insight to the visual arts, Thomas Crow argues that the pastoral in art can be extended into the twentieth century through those low modes that resisted the 'epiphanies' of High Modernism, principally Cubism and the Duchampian tradition (Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Allan Kaprow and Michael Asher). I would add _The Bowery_ to his perceptive list. In this Empsonian version of pastoral, the 'low' figure characterises the fullness of human experience and tests the consciousness of the philosopher-poet for universal applicability. The bar-room philosopher, loved by Samuel Beckett, is surely close to the heart of Rosler's _The Bowery_. Empson argued that proletarian art was a 'covert pastoral'. There is no doubt that he hung on to the idea of literature as an expression of universal human values, but there is a real point in his criticism of Socialist Realism. The problem with this proletarian pastoral was that it produced the absolute prematurely; it was in a hurry to heal the wounds created by capitalism and stepped over the theoretical difficulties, including the diremption of sign and social world. 'Proletarian pastoral' instantiated a fullness of experience and social integration in a way that was itself a profoundly ideological form of identity thinking. The typical solution to this problem was to perform metaphorical reunification through a representative proletarian joining the Communist movement; Morris Levitt's play _On the Bowery_ ends with a whole bunch of them rallying to the cause. Empson thought of proletarian pastoral as a moment of false immediacy.

If there is a Marxist critique of pastoral art and poetry, there are also fragments of a pastoral vision in the Marxist tradition to which Rosler's work contributes and which must help illuminate _The Bowery_. These small incidents of pastoral vision that draw attention to the complex temporality that underpins _The Bowery_ are perhaps its most powerful feature. William Morris's _News from Nowhere_ (1890) — is one of the obvious versions of this social dreaming, when it posits a future 'era of rest' beside the Thames. Morris refigures London after the revolution as a time of calm, plenty and 'ornamental' life: an age without classes, commodities and social division. In the process, history seems to have come to a halt in a permanent summer. Morris's utopia must be seen not as an escape from history, but as a perspective from which to view the opaque social relations of Victorian monopoly capitalism. The pastoral future is thus one way to outrun commodity-fetishism, which is only visible from the perspective of another place or time. The temporal complexity of its narrator William Guest, as the presence of the past in the future and of the future in the present, indicates the possibilities for pastoral criticism. The pastoral mode probably shapes all of Morris's work, provided we do not take this to mean a naïve idyll. The need to overcome the division between country and city could also be cited as a component of Marxist pastoralism. However, the key version comes from Marx and Engels's _The German Ideology_ (1845—46), which states that in capitalism a man

_is a hunter, a fisherman, a shepherd or a critical critic, and must remain so if he does not want to lose his means of livelihood; whereas in communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, shepherd or critic._

All the activities listed in this passage come from pastoral verse. In conjoining shepherds with criticism, Marx and Engels explicitly draw on classical pastoralism. Marx was an aesthetic thinker, and while the above is his most explicit statement of a pastoral problematic, the issues at stake run throughout his early writings, where the themes of separation, loss, alienation of consciousness and alienation of man from man and from nature figure prominently. Arguably, the pastoral mode is ever present in Marx's writings precisely because social division, separation and fetishism are endemic to capitalist social relations.

As a work in the Marxist tradition, _The Bowery_ is caught between a critical relation to the present and openness to the future. In so far as it can sustain distinctions between past, present and future, pastoral offers one aesthetic resource for this project. On its own, a satirical attitude is ever likely to bowdlerise all genres and reinforce the irony and world-weariness that characterise so much of late-capitalist culture, while elegy (Socialist Realism) shades towards idyll and false optimism. Keeping its distance from idyllic fantasy (the ceramic sculpture in the final image is a shattered pastoral figure), _The Bowery_ brings together the satirical and elegiac variants of pastoral. It savagely attacks the political economy of fiscal crisis that generated this dereliction and the humanist good intentions of photographers, while simultaneously facing towards a liveable future. Rosler knows this moment of the 'ideal' to be a figurative ploy and not an actually attainable state, but it provides an orientation to a regained experience or practice. I cannot say that this pairing of satire and elegy amounts to a dialectical _Aufhebung_ , but at least both forms are kept in play in a simultaneous vision, and their mutual contamination compromises the common lines of flight to idyllic stupefaction. _The Bowery_ substitutes an episodic suspension for the heroic treatment of actually existing commodity culture, which we find everywhere in capitalist realism. If this risks a certain immobility, its pastoral poetry suggests we are iced over in a time corrupted by war and commerce, between a once and future glory. In the process, our present — characterised by absence, loss and separation — is grasped as history, a moment, a point of potential transition or rupture to the future. Even as it freezes time, the pastoral problematises this temporal fixity. Virgil's fourth eclogue moves between tenses and slips backward and forward from a lost golden age to a new future. _The Bowery_ evidently works this Virgilian temporal slippage. In the moment of absence it opens towards the possibility of transformative politics. This double voice is characteristic of the pastoral, which combines loss and calm, melancholy and longing for change; discontented striving redeems it from immobility. Longing is a more accurate mood for this poetry than nostalgia, a longing for the future as much as for the past. The present in _The Bowery_ is becalmed, but 'restless' — agitated for a new life.

Marx and Engels were extremely critical of the Utopian Socialists of the nineteenth century, and tended to view utopianism as 'the construction of blueprints of a future society that are incapable of realisation'. In much of the Marxist tradition, these criticisms were, mistakenly I believe, thought to debar socialists from engaging the horizon of the future. Besides this, the charge of 'hopeless utopians' has been repeatedly thrown at the Left by the 'realist' partisans of human nature and the immutability of social relations. Rosler knows there are reasons to be wary of utopianism: she is simultaneously utopian and anti-utopian. _The Bowery_ is able to mobilise this double address through the pastoral mode. As a key example of Marxist pastoral, _The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ conjoins longing and fulfilment, abundance and scarcity, bliss and oblivion, society and solitude, pleasure and pain, freedom and constraint, rustic and urban, nature and artifice. It recalls the liberty of the herdsman, the democracy of the common and the release from labour into song, without retreating into 'rural idiocy'. It is at once realist and utopian: it reminds us of the deformations generated by capitalism, it points to death, pain and destroyed lives. But it also suggests an alternative future of new forms of experience and pleasure. I think this is one of the great achievements of _The Bowery_ : its ability to hold these moments apart, while also allowing attentive viewers to contemplate a plausible human future that remains subject to death, illness, contingent disasters and personal tragedy. The simultaneous pairing of the gutter and the heavens (literally depicting a smashed pastoral figure in the gutter) offers a dialectic image without sentimental resolution. The future will be no idyll, but beyond capitalism there is the possibility for maximising human powers and capacities and satisfying needs. A tragic-humanist conception of the future makes it all the more important for society to 'inscribe on its banners' the slogan 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!' The gender of this passage needs modifying, but the point is vital. In its temporal complexity and simultaneous address to existing disaster and future order of experience, _The Bowery_ outruns Empson's criticism of the proletarian pastoral.

The critics tell us that pastoral is a ventriloquism of the poet's consciousness. While _The Bowery_ cannot be a model of the development of the mind akin to Hegel's _The Phenomenology of Spirit_ (1807) or William Wordsworth's _The Prelude_ (1850), it offers a representation of consciousness as a doubled image for social experience and understanding. David Hopkins is thus incorrect; the drunk _is_ a figure of artistic consciousness in _The Bowery,_ much more complex and troubling than anything to be found in the work of the Young British Artists of the 1990s. But the standard accounts of pastoral entail a conservative icing over of the dialectic of the one and the many, locating consciousness in a particular self (the poet in the guise of a herdsman). Consciousness is here a crossroads for intersubjective dynamics of identification and disidentification, gesturing to a possible fullness of social experience and a regained unity between the sign and our shared world. In this, it can be said to be an allegory. It is a central proposition of this work that the Bowery bum is closer to real experience than anyone draped with luxury. _The Bowery_ calls on its viewers/readers to turn outward while reflecting on their place in a reimagined collective. Revolution can be written in the epic mode, or the comic, or the tragic, but through black leader and a double negation _The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems_ draws its (pastoral) poetry from the future: 'In this position there is a significant space, a vacuum, a leap into the theoretical void, an anticipation.'

One reason for this antipathy to Ruscha was his interest in Marcel Duchamp. Rosler and her comrades were interested in found meaning and the readymade, but the aristocratic dandyism associated with Duchamp was undoubtedly a turn-off. There are critical references to dandyism as a form of elite detachment throughout the work of Rosler.

For ease of comprehension, I have assigned a number to each text/image pairing, or element, in a consecutive sequence from top left to bottom right. This is not unproblematic and prejudices the viewer of _The Bowery_ to read as Westerners read a book, from left to right, continuing at the next line. Other associative patterns are possible; for instance, the work could be viewed as vertical columns, rather than horizontal rows. However, the advantage of the numbered sequence is that it is applicable to both the gallery and book versions of _The Bowery_. It was initially shown unframed, until one museum tried to nail it to the wall. (Email from the artist, 2 November 2010.) This version is in the collection of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. I cannot account for this oddity. The pairings of image and text reproduced sometimes depart from the standard version. The image/text juxtaposition on the back cover of _3 Works_ combines the photograph from element 12 with the text from element 11. This is strange, because this combination detaches the image of the bank façade from the word grouping for surfaces, with which it seems to belong. Sometimes, this alternate pairing is reproduced in survey books. The version with the variant ending appears in Peter Osborne, _Conceptual Art_ (London: Phaidon, 2002, p.154); and David Campany, _Art and Photography_ (London: Phaidon, 2007, p.114).

From the Greek _ek_ (out, ex-) and _phrazo_ (I explain), _ekphrasis_ is a rhetorical category for presenting or recalling images in words, so that they appear present to the listener. Homer's description of Achilles's shield in Book 18 of the _Iliad_ is often seen as the beginning of the _ekphrastic_ tradition.

The New Left has its origins in the response of a number of British and North American Communist intellectuals and activists to the Soviet invasion of Hungary. Disillusionment with Stalinism led to the emergence of a Left outside the orbit of official Communist parties and an interest in ideas not associated with their stultifying orthodoxy. Che Guevara, Ho Chi Minh, Frantz Fanon and Mao Tse-tung provided other points of orientation; activists in the US anti-war movement might have also looked to Noam Chomsky, Paul Goodman and Murray Bookchin. The writings of Studs Terkel and even Left Social-Democrats fed the mood. Fuelled by interest in the work of the early Marx, the New Left was influenced by a Marxism associated with Georg Lukács, the Frankfurt School, Jean-Paul Sartre and Henri Lefebvre, but increasingly other perspectives played their part (Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser, Galvano Della Volpe and many others). The journal _New Left Review_ , founded in 1960 and under the editorship of Perry Anderson from 1962, played an important role in translating into English work that was previously difficult to access. The student movement of the 1960s was heavily shaped by these influences, and small Trotskyist groups found an audience for anti-Stalinist Marxism in this milieu, as did forms of Maoism and Third Worldism. The New Left proved open to the emergence of the politics of feminism, black liberation and the Gay Liberation Front. It was also receptive to new forms of cultural practice. A whole host of journals shaped by this cultural mood — from _Antipode_ and _History Workshop_ to _Telos_ , _Radical Philosophy_ or _Radical History Review_ — sprang up, and reshaped academic disciplines. While it did not coalesce into anything coherent, the New Left strongly influenced the subsequent trajectory of the political and intellectual Left.

This, and not 'old-style Leftism', was Rosler's world.

Polke exposed his negatives on large sheets of paper, folded them and then immersed them in developer. The resulting images reveal chance encounters on the street overlaid with chemical smudges and the effects of air bubbles. It is an odd and interesting series, but it is very unlikely that Rosler knew of these pictures.

See Blake Stimson, _The Pivot of the World: Photography and Its Nation_ , Cambridge, MA and London: The MIT Press, 1994. Stimson makes a strong case suggesting that, while the work of the Bechers cannot be seen as 'collectivist', they keep their distance from 'the capitalist's dreamworld of individual interest' (p.165).

On occasion, Evans too used a 35mm camera, and seems to have done so particularly in New York.

B.H.D. Buchloh, 'A Conversation with Martha Rosler', _op. cit._ , p.42. In contrast, Rosler notes the standard photographic imagery of bums is not a work of political economy, but a metaphorical project predicated on the idea of the drunk as someone who deserves his fate. See M. Rosler, 'In, Around, and Afterthoughts', _op. cit._ , p.78. The implication is that _The Bowery_ is a work rooted in the critique of political economy.

_Ibid._ , p.79. In conversation with Martha Gever, Rosler also suggests that the words provide a humorous 'poetics' that undercut the dead-pan character of the images and she refers to the way 'people make poetry out of impoverishment'.

_Land of Cokaygne_ , 'Oleanna' and 'Big Rock Candy Mountain' are three key examples of the utopian imagination that celebrate abundance without labour, pre-roasted fowl descend from the sky, pigs offer a slice of ham and alcohol gushes from streams and fountains. The first is a medieval English poem, probably written as a satire on idleness; the second a Norwegian song that appeared in print in 1853; and the last a North American song from the late nineteenth century, though it is probably older in some elements. See A.L. Morton, _The English Utopia_ , London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1978; and Steve Edwards, 'The Colonisation of Utopia', in Jennifer Harris (ed.), _William Morris: 'ministering to the swinish luxury of the rich_ ', Manchester: Whitworth Art Gallery, 2004, pp.12—40. This image of utopian plenitude is also echoed in Rosler's montage _Hothouse (Harem)_ (1972), which is composed from hundreds of _Playboy_ nudes, but here the fantasy turns grotesque and monstrous. She explicitly engaged with 'Oleanna' in her contribution to Molly Nesbit, Hans Ulrich Obrist and Rirkrit Tiravanija's curatorial project 'Utopia Station', originally presented at the 50th Venice Biennale in 2003.

An obvious connection is with Eleanor Antin's video _Representational Painting_ (1971), which records the artist applying make-up and suggests a connection to ideological images of women in the history of art.

Unpacking the ideas and experiences that condense into any complex work of art requires a project of reading akin to dream analysis; I do not intend anything so ambitious here. This chapter simply examines some materials, ideologies and practices that fed into _The Bowery_.

_Ibid._ , p.32. Rosler insists Farber referred to 'that Marxist cabal down there', which diverges from the version cited by Buchloh. Email to the author, _op. cit_.

Manny Farber showed Cuban and Latin American cinema, and examined Hollywood films from the 1940s to the 60s. He also taught courses on 'Third World films' and 'Films in social context', and one on radical film form titled 'A hard look at the movies', which included films by Godard and Gorin, Reiner Werner Fassbinder, Michael Snow, Straub and Huillet and Alain Resnais. See Robert Polito, 'Introduction: Other Roads, Other Tracks', in Manny Farber, _Farber on Film: The Complete Film Writings of Manny Farber_ (ed. R. Polito), New York: The Library of America, 2009, pp.xxi—xxii. Farber connected Rosler, Sekula, Lonidier and Steinmetz to Godard in his essay ' _Badlands_ , _Mean Streets_ , and the _Wind and the Lion_ '  (though he spelled Rosler's name incorrectly) (pp.738—39). Rosler was his teaching assistant for some of these courses, including one in which Farber showed every film by Luis Buñuel. As an adjunct teacher, she taught 'Gangster film, a course I called "Power and Authority in Cinema", and one on "Women in Cinema"' (email to the author, _op. cit_.).

She has said this is a reference to Godard's _Vivre sa vie_ (1962) and the character of the prostitute, Nana. See M. Gever, 'An Interview with Martha Rosler', _op. cit._ , p.14. The connection is the opening monologue, in which Rosler states: 'What is outside and what is inside... like Nana's chicken, only here we deal with eggs.' According to Rosler, 'it refers to the scene in which Nana (Anna Karina) has a café conversation with philosopher Brice Parain and she becomes the actions and the voice of philosophy' (email to the author, _op. cit_.). In my view, it would take a very attentive and informed viewer to make the link.

'Women and Work' was an exhibition focused on the sexual division of labour in a South London factory. The members of the collective were Kay Hunt, Mary Kelly and Margaret Harrison.

B.H.D. Buchloh, 'A Conversation with Martha Rosler', _op. cit._ , p.31. Rosler sometimes casts this vernacular realism, 'the popular-culture Left', against the 'aristocratic-Trotskyism' of Greenberg (and Rosenberg). See _ibid._ , p.28; and M. Rosler, 'Lookers, Buyers, Dealers, and Makers: Thoughts on Audience', _Decoys and Disruptions: Selected Writings, 1975—2001_ , _op. cit._ , p.26. (I find these political-cultural polarities troubling and a little too neat.) Rosler was a good reader of Michael Fried, and has said that on reading 'Art and Objecthood' in the early 1970s she thought that he had grasped the stakes of the Minimalism debate, but had come down on the wrong side, for 'pure visuality' and 'therefore transcendence'. B.H.D. Buchloh, 'A Conversation with Martha Rosler', _op. cit._ , p.27. Also on Fried: 'It seems to me he was right, but on the wrong side of the question'. M. Rosler, 'Place, Position, Power, Politics', _op. cit._ , p.353. Elsewhere she claimed that she thought 'Theatricality, Bingo! That is it.'

_Ibid._ , p.73. See also John Tagg, _The Burden of Representation_ , London: Macmillan, 1988; and M. Stange, _Symbols of Ideal Life_ , _op. cit_. The focus on the hard life of a typical individual plays an important role in the liberal-documentary mode, shifting attention from social relations to local solutions. This synecdochic strategy allows the individual solution to stand as a form of symbolic resolution for wider patterns of exploitation and oppression. For this argument, see Stuart Hall, 'The Social Eye of Picture Post', _Working Papers in Cultural Studies_ , no.2, 1972, pp.71—120; and S. Edwards, 'Disastrous Documents', _Ten.8_ , no.15, 1984, pp.12—23. In the light of the late-capitalist cynicism seemingly licensed by the critique, we should note in passing that liberal-documentary is only one form of the practice of documentary.

Beaumont Newhall's _The History of Photography: From 1839 to the Present Day_ (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 1949), which began life as an exhibition at New York's Museum of Modern Art in 1937 and 1938, went through numerous editions and contained important information on 'documentary'.

In 1933 the WFPL became the Film and Photo League and as of 1937 simply the Photo League. With the turn to the Popular Front, the League lost its direct agitational character, but increased its influence over professional photographers. In the later 1930s the work of the Photo League became identified with committed documentary photographers including Morris Engel, Sid Grossman, Ruth Orkin, Aaron Siskind and later Walter Rosenblum. In 1947 the Photo League was added to the Attorney General's list of 'subversive' organisations and it limped along until its ultimate demise in 1951. For the history of the Photo League see Anne Tucker, 'The Photo League', _Special Supplement to Afterimage_ , April 1978, pp.1—5; A.

_Dispositif_ is usually translated as 'apparatus', but in the work of Baudry and other theorists of film, where the concept was developed, it refers not simply to the technical apparatus of camera or projector, but the extended system of cinema and the ideological impression of reality made on a viewing subject.

There is no suggestion that Rosler was familiar with this material first hand, but much of it was appearing in translation at the time. She has said that she got to know this work through _Screen_ and the publications of the University of Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies. Important contributions by Jean-Louis Comolli, Barthes, Baudry, Julia Kristeva and Christian Metz appeared in _Screen_ and the whole body of work was heavily discussed in the journal, as well as in _Afterimage_ and _Jump Cut_. Noël Burch's _Theory of Film Practice_ appeared in English in 1973 (trans. Helen R. Lane, London: Secker and Warburg) and Peter Wollen's _Signs and Meanings in the Cinema_ was published in 1969 and again with its important 'Conclusion' in 1972 (London: Secker and Warburg); his essay 'Godard and Counter Cinema: _Vent d'Est_ ' also dates from 1972 ( _Afterimage_ , no.4, pp.6—17). In 1974 _Screen_ published the first of two special issues devoted to the work and ideas of Brecht (vol.15, no.2, 1974).

'On Art and Artists: Martha Rosler Interviewed by Craig Owens', _op. cit._ , p.24. In her 'Afterword' to 3 Works, she wrote: 'The work's critique of photography was mated with a concomitant suspicion of language, which could not play the saint to photography's devil.' M. Rosler, 'Afterword: A History', _op. cit_., p.95.

'On Art and Artists: Martha Rosler Interviewed by Craig Owens', _op. cit._ , p.24. This is a classical or Aristotelian conception of rhetoric lodged at the level of the word, which sees metaphor as an embellishment on, or deviation from, plain speech, rather than the rhetoric of the sentence or discourse as outlined, for example, in Paul Ricoeur, _The Rule of Metaphor: Multi-Disciplinary Studies in the Creation of Meaning in Language_ (trans. Robert Czerny with Kathleen McLaughlin and John Costello, SJ), London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1986. Nevertheless, this seems appropriate because Rosler's found language poetry takes the word as its focus.

Clark suggests that Jackson Pollock struggled to 'annihilate likeness' and outrun metaphor in a modernist dream of escaping from representation. See T.J. Clark, 'The Unhappy Consciousness', _Farewell to an Idea: Episodes from a History of Modernism_ , New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1999, pp.299—370. Clark's argument on scumbling in Jacques-Louis David's _La Mort de Marat_ ( _The Death of Marat_ , 1793) works in a similar register. There is much to be said about negation, as can be found, for example, in G. Day, _Dialectical Passions_ , _op. cit._

K. Marx, _The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte_ (trans. Ben Fowkes) _Surveys from Exile: Political Writings, Vol.2 (ed. David Fernbach)_ , Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1973, p.149. This is a consistent perspective; Marx wrote in a letter to Arnold Ruge in September 1843 'we do not anticipate the world with our dogmas but instead attempt to discover the new world through the critique of the old'. K. Marx, _Early Writings_ (trans. Rodney Livingstone), Harmondsworth: Penguin, p.207.

T.J. Clark, 'The Unhappy Consciousness', _op. cit._ Here the terms are designated figures of dissonance and of totality.

See Edmund Burke, _A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful_ (1757), Oxford: Blackwell, 1987; and Immanuel Kant, 'Analytic of the Sublime', _The Critique of Judgement_ (1790, trans. James Creed Meredith), Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1952. These ideas were current in the circles of North American abstraction, as can be seen in Barnett Newman, 'The Sublime is Now' (1948), in Charles Harrison and Paul Wood (ed.), _Art in Theory 1900—2000:An Anthology of Changing Ideas_, Oxford: Blackwell, 2003, pp.580—82; see also Mark Rothko, 'The Romantics Were Prompted...', in _ibid._ , pp.571—73.

Jean-François Lyotard has been the foremost advocate of the sublime in recent times under the sign of the 'unrepresenatable' or 'unimaginable'. His work entails a tendentious reading of Kant, which posits the sublime as manifestation of ethics in the field of aesthetics. The aesthetic of the sublime for Lyotard is a scene of 'disaster', in turning the history of the twentieth century around the monstrous annihilation of the European Jews. In the light of his proclaimed end of the grand narratives, Lyotard severs any link between art and the politics of emancipation and instead substitutes for this the role of witness to this moment of unspeakable barbarism. See J.-F. Lyotard, _The Inhuman: Reflections on Time_ (1988, trans. Geoffrey Bennington and Rachel Bowlby), Cambridge: Polity Press, 1991; and _Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime_ (1993, trans. Elizabeth Rottenberg), Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1994. For important counter-arguments see Georges Didi-Huberman, _Images in Spite of All: Four Photographs from Auschwitz_ (2003, trans. Camilla Nielsen), Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 2008; and Jacques Rancière, _Aesthetics and its Discontents_ (2004, trans. Steven Corcoran), Cambridge: Polity Press, 2009, pp.88—105.

One Marxist variant has equated the sublime with money. See Terry Eagleton, _The Ideology of the Aesthetic_ , Oxford: Blackwell, 1990; and Peter de Bolla, _The Discourse of the Sublime: Readings in History, Aesthetics, and the Subject_ , Oxford: Blackwell, 1989. This also seems to be Godard's take, at least in _Ici et ailleurs_ (1974), where 'capitalism adds up to zeros' and 'our hopes have been reduced to zero.' Money and defeat.

Halperin, _Before Pastoral: Theocritus and the Ancient Tradition of Buclolic Poetry_ , New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1983.

Michael McKeon, 'The Pastoral Revolution', in Kevin Sharpe and Steven N. Zwicker (ed.), _Refiguring Revolutions: Aesthetics and Politics from the English Revolution to the Romantic Revolution_ , Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 1998, p.284.

In the famous Idyll 7 by Theocritus ( _The Idylls_ , _op. cit._ , p.84), the goatherd Lycidas declares: 'I hate the craftsman who dreams of building his house / As high as the mountain ridge of Oromedon there, / And I hate the artless gaggle of bardic ranters / Who match themselves against Homer with posturing cries.'

See Raymond Williams, _The Country and City_ , Frogmore, St Albans: Paladin, 1975; John Barrell and John Bull (ed.), _The Penguin Book of Pastoral Verse_ , Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974; and John Barrell, _The Dark Side of the Landscape: The Rural Poor in English Painting 1730—1840_ , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980; Louis Montrose offers a related analysis from a New Historicist perspective in 'Of Gentlemen and Shepherds: the Politics of Elizabethan Pastoral Form', _English Literary History_ , no.50, 1983, pp.415—59. I have found helpful Annabel Patterson, _Pastoral and Ideology: Virgil to Valéry_ , Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1987.

W. Empson, _Some Versions of Pastoral_ , _op. cit._ , p.49. There is a normative assumption in Empson, and much of the writing on pastoral, which suggests some lives are 'limited' and others 'full'. Empson does mention 'a tone of humility', but a less patronising formulation would have helped.

_Ibid._ , p.79. In an important book Paul Alpers tries to restrict the pastoral proper to literary works in which the shepherd figures as a representative for the poet, but he too cannot help drifting in the direction of Empson's formulation. See P. Alpers, _What Is Pastoral?_ , Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996. Here I follow Empson's expansive definition, but I have learned much from Alpers's fine study.

A. Sekula, 'Dismantling Modernism, Reinventing Documentary', _op. cit._ , p.175. Studs Terkel is surely in the mix here, but there is no reference to his presence in Rosler's printed comments.

T. Crow, 'The Simple Life: Pastoralism and the Persistence of Genre in Recent Art', _Modern Art in the Common Culture_ , _op. cit._ , pp.173—211.

For these arguments, see Matthew Beaumont, _Utopia Ltd. Ideologies of Social Dreaming in England 1870—1900_ , Chicago: Haymarket, 2009.

K. Marx and Frederick Engels, _The German Ideology_ (trans. Clemens Dutt and others), _Collected Works, Vol. 5_ , 1845—1847, London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1976, p.47. By the time he wrote _Capital_ , Marx had abandoned this version of the division of labour, but that is another story. The 'withering away' of the state, money, politics, ideology and the transparency of social relations under communism are all components of a pastoral vision.

K. Marx, 'Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts' (1844, trans. Gregor Benton), _Early Writings_ , Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1975, pp.279—400.

Satire and elegy are the two forms of sentimental poetry described by Friedrich Schiller in _On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry_ (1795—96, trans. Julius A. Elias), in H.B. Nesbet (ed.), _German Aesthetic and Literary Criticism: Winckelmann, Lessing, Hamann, Herder, Schiller, Goethe_ , Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985, pp.177—232. He employed these terms as a way of refusing the identification of the ideal with the actual, a process which offered only naïve idyllicism. This was a key argument for Marx.

Stathis Kouvelakis, writing on Heinrich Heine, is clear: 'a sense of loss [...] throws the disparity between the past and the present into sharp relief'. S. Kouvelakis, _Philosophy and Revolution: From Kant to Marx_ , London and New York: Verso, 2003, p.50. I have found the account of Heine in this excellent book helpful for thinking about _The Bowery_.

For a good description, see M. McKeon, 'The Pastoral Revolution', _op. cit._ , p.273. Erwin Panofsky's account of Virgil is also significant, because he recognises this form as a 'dissonance' generating a combination of 'sadness and tranquillity'. E. Panofsky, '" _Et in Arcadia Ego_ ": Poussin and the Elegiac Tradition', _Meaning in the Visual Arts_ , Garden City, NY: Anchor Books, 1955, p.300.

Interestingly, this is a temporal condition shared with 'the photographic paradox', which similarly reaches from the present to the past and future under the sign of melancholy. Critics from Barthes onwards have noted this sense of death, but not the reanimation the photograph brings to the future. There is a big debate here, but most commentators take Roland Barthes's _Camera Lucida_ as a defining text. See R. Barthes, _Camera Lucida: Reflections on Photography_ (1980, trans. Richard Howard), New York: Hill and Wang, 1981. For a necessary antidote see Peter Osborne, 'Sign and Image', _Philosophy in Cultural Theory_ , London: Routledge, 2000, pp.20—52.

See Ruth Levitas, _The Concept of Utopia_ , Hemel Hempstead: Philip Allan, 1990, p.35.

For a brilliant linkage of utopia and pain see Caroline Arscott, _William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones: Interlacings_ , New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2008. It is certainly odd that in the thousand-plus pages of _The Principle of Hope_ , Ernst Bloch has next to nothing to say about the pastoral — and ascribes 'Et in Arcadia Ego' to Theocritus — but he too finds death in Arcadia: 'The dance of death still takes place in the loveliest place on earth.' E. Bloch, _The Principle of Hope_ (1938—47, trans. Neville Plaice), Cambridge, MA and London: The MIT Press, 1995, p.1175.

K. Marx, _Critique of the Gotha Programme_ (1875), in K. Marx and F. Engels, _Selected Works in One Volume_ , London: Lawrence and Wishart, 1968, p.306. Terry Eagleton has been developing this tragic humanist vision of socialism. See T. Eagleton, _Sweet Violence: The Idea of the Tragic_ , Oxford: Blackwell, 2003; and _Why Marx Was Right_ , New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2011; see also T. Eagleton and Mathew Beaumont, _The Task of the Critic: Terry Eagleton in Dialogue_ , London and New York: Verso, 2009.
