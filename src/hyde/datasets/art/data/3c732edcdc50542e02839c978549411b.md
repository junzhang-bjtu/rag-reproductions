About the Authors
**introduction**

I wrote _Simon Leach's Pottery Handbook_ , along with my friend Bruce Dehnert, to share my thirty-plus years of pottery experience with those aspiring potters who are both excited about and daunted by the craft. Early on in my vocation, I was fortunate to apprentice with my father, David Leach, and then move on to set up studios in England, Spain, and presently in the U.S. If I can impart some of what I've learned over the years to those who are learning to throw pots, then I am happy to do so.

My role in the world of ceramics may seem to have been predestined, coming from a line of potters in England that started with my grandfather, Bernard Leach (1887–1979), who is known as the father of studio pottery. As a child on summer holidays from school, I was often driven by boredom and curiosity to wander into my father's pottery studio in order to watch the apprentices at the wheel. We always had a bit of fun on those days as the apprentices threw pea-sized clay balls at my bare legs while I laughed, jumped, and hid to avoid being hit—that is, until my father entered the studio and chased me away (I was quite a distraction for his workers).

But as I grew older, my favorite hobby was making model planes out of balsa wood—not pots out of clay—and by the time I completed my studies at boarding school, I had no thoughts really to follow in my father's footsteps. Instead I entered an engineering apprenticeship at a helicopter manufacturer. The four long years I worked there came to feel like a prison sentence—I was just a machine doing repetitive work in an atmosphere that I didn't like—but eventually an opportunity for escape came along. The company was downsizing and offered redundancy pay to employees who would volunteer to leave, so I took the offer, more than ready to start a new adventure.

Off I went traveling around Europe, from Greece to Spain, gathering stories from these colorful places and having inspirational conversations along the way. Eventually the money ran out, so I asked my father if I might work for him at his pottery in Lowerdown, in Devon, England. I was thinking I would work in the pottery for six months and then have enough saved to go on my next trip, but as it happened, I wound up apprenticing with my father for five years. During that time my father came to depend on me, and he was full of compliments as I gained skills in pottery. I came to feel a sense of accomplishment and felt quite at home in the studio, so it seemed natural for me to stay on working there.

During the early years of learning the pottery business at his side, I was given "exercises," meaning that I was often asked to make multiples of a specific form. It was through these exercises that I began to appreciate the benefits of repetitive throwing. Over time, I noticed that the walls of my "GP" (general purpose) bowls became more consistent, and the lips of teapot spouts were cut and attached just right so they poured well. Eventually, I got the hang of what was expected of me, and in September of 1984, my father asked if I would be interested in running the pottery. With his question, I felt a bit put on the spot. While my time there was invaluable and my dad was a very good teacher, he had firm ideas about how things should be done, and I thought I would never really have the freedom to see my own ideas come to fruition. I told him I thought it was time to start working for myself. With that decision, I was suddenly faced with the freedom of making whatever I wanted. I felt both excited and daunted, but this was my path to pottery . . . one that I finally came to embrace.

I set up my first proper pottery studio in the Devon village of Silverton, and it was my first taste of being on my own. My pots were not radically different than my father's, except that I embraced the process of raku firing. Overall, life was good. I was content enough to carry on there for the next four years, and along the way opportunities arose to exhibit my work. I had no complaints except for the English weather (around that time, I remember two really atrocious, damp summers in a row). Yearning for sunshine, and remembering my travels to Spain in the late '70s and early '80s, I thought this might be a place where I could settle with my family, so off we went. I lived in Spain for nineteen years before relocating to the United States in 2009.

Selling pots was only one of the ways I earned my bread and butter. I also began teaching workshops from my studio in Spain. One day I thought to film myself throwing on my Leach treadle wheel, and when a friend saw the video, he said to me, "Simon, why don't you put up a clip on YouTube?" In 2007, YouTube was fairly new technology, and I didn't have much in mind other than it being a novelty. I think the first clip I posted was of me throwing dinner plates. Soon enough, potters around the globe started posting comments. At the time, I was working in rural Spain with little or sometimes no interaction with other potters, so I thought this was just great. YouTube was a window to the world, and I found when I got in front of the camera, I had a lot to say and share about general pottery studio practices. So I continued making clips, and today there are more than 800 of them on YouTube.

From letters I have received in response to my videos, I have come to realize that many aspiring potters have a place to practice—a home studio, a potters' guild, or an arts center—but do not have teachers. It is my hope that this book will help guide aspiring potters at each step of the pot-making process, and that the book can also be a helpful supplement to classroom instruction.

Each lesson is taught with a combination of text and step-by-step photography. In the first chapter, I explain how to get started, from setting up a pottery studio to getting to know clay bodies and tools of the trade. In the second chapter I teach the basics of throwing a cylinder, then go on to show you how to make various cylindrical shapes, like tankards, bottles, and pitchers, as well as everyday dishes, like bowls, casseroles, and teapots. In the chapter on trimming, I teach you how to trim a foot ring, plus I cover the production potter's approach of "thumbing off." In the assembling chapter I cover the basics of putting a pot together, from pulling and attaching handles to adding spouts and lids. I filled the decorating chapter with information about how to finish off your pots, from stamping to brushing engobes to glazing basics. Finally, in the chapter on firing I cover everything you need to know to fire your pots, from telling temperatures to loading kilns. (For the adventurous types, I've even included instructions on how to build your own raku kiln or convert an old electric kiln into a gas one.) A comprehensive glossary of terms and a glaze troubleshooting index answer some of the questions that inevitably come up along the way, and the glaze and engobe recipe index will surely get you thinking creatively about decorating.

As you dive into this book, try to enjoy the sheer pleasure of working with your hands—an act that I believe gives balance to our lives, and is a good antidote to too much intellectualizing. That being said, aside from learning the techniques presented in this book, I hope that you will learn about my studio habits and how _you_ can put into practice the ideas I've presented here. Practice is the way to making good pots, and just as I did with the pots I made over and over in my father's studio when I was first learning, you simply need to _keep practicing!_ Soon enough, the walls of your pots will be consistent, the lips will be even, and you'll see that the creations emerging from your hands get better and better with time.

**getting started**

Setting Up the Studio

Clay Bodies

Handling Clay

setting up the studio

Whether you're a beginning potter or an old pro, ceramics can be as technical or nontechnical as you want it to be. Depending on your interests, you can either delve deeply into the art form or be happy skirting its perimeters. Likewise, the extent to which you equip your studio with tools of the trade or learn about new techniques and materials is up to you. This chapter presents basic information about setting up your studio, what tools and equipment are available to help you get going, and the clays you will come across along the way.

**TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT**

What tools and equipment are necessary for making a pot? That question reaches as far back in time as the craft itself. In truth, pottery can be made with only clay, hands, and a pit fire, but to make our lives a little easier, we humans have continued to develop tools and equipment that let us make ever more complex or useful forms (though I've always taken a straightforward approach, and use relatively few tools in the studio).

**CLAY MIXING AND PREPARATION**

A wedging table and scale are the only equipment needed to prepare clay for throwing. Your bench-height wedging table should be well built and sturdy, since you will be vigorously kneading and compressing the clay on it. Some good surface options are plaster, canvas, concrete, or wood, all of which absorb moisture and easily release clay.

A scale for weighing balls of clay must be durable since you'll be using it frequently and want it to last. Scales made for professional kitchens or labs are ideal, but inexpensive ones will also suffice. Make sure the scale you're interested in can measure in your preferred system (metric or imperial). A scale should be able to weigh amounts up to 25 pounds (11.3kg) and can be analog or digital.

**POTTER'S WHEELS**

The most important piece of equipment in your studio is the potter's wheel. While a kiln provides more than its fair share of mystery, the wheel brings forth what's possible. What happens with it is completely up to you and your skills. From an ergonomic standpoint, the type of wheel you use will require you to position your body in ways that are unique to that design. So, with an electric wheel you'll sit one way, and at a treadle wheel you'll use a completely different position. The only way to discover which wheel is most comfortable is to try several types. Your local ceramic supply store, or a school, will have wheels that you can try out. There are three popular types of wheels.

Electric wheel

**Electric Wheel**

The electric potter's wheel (shown in previous image) is the most commonly used design today. Powered by electric motors, with smooth acceleration, these modern wheels make throwing easier than their foot-operated cousins. Look for a wheel that has a minimum of one-half horsepower. Some brands offer a super-quiet wheel that employs magnetic technology instead of being belt-driven.

**Kick Wheel**

The kick wheel is the longest surviving version of the ancient "glide wheel." It features a heavy flywheel that, when kicked, delivers power and speed for a limited time. With some effort, these wheels can reach high speeds but slow down without continual kicking. While they're intended mostly for throwing and trimming, they're also terrific for decorating when glazing time comes. They don't use electricity and require minimal maintenance. Certain kick wheel designs include the option to switch between kick and electric power.

**Treadle Wheel**

While it may look similar to a kick wheel, the treadle wheel (shown at right) is a very different machine. The wheel head is driven by the rocking motion of a foot pressing on a swinging treadle beam, and the wheel travels at a slower pace than most other wheels do. Using the body's direct action as its source of power, the treadle wheel lets you create loose forms with gestural qualities that are unique to this process. The ingenious mechanism emits a gentle rhythmic sound as the wheel turns. The wheel shown at right is a version of one designed by my uncle, Dicon Nance.

**POTTERY STUDIO TOOLS**

With the exception of a good potter's wheel and kiln, most other tools are inexpensive, and all of them are sold on the Internet or at your local ceramic supplier. As with any art form, it's always a good idea to try lots of different tools to learn which are best for the way you work and think.

**Banding wheel.** A small pedestal turntable used to assemble a form, apply wax, or brush on a band of glaze. The best kind of banding wheel spins long and easily with little effort.

**Calipers.** Used for measuring the width of a pot's mouth, rim, gallery, lid, flange, and the like.

**Chamois leather.** This small leather scrap is used to make the lip of a just-thrown pot silky smooth.

**Fettling knife.** Used to cut handles, feet, and facets.

**Hand truck.** Helps move boxes of clay, the wheel, and glaze buckets—anything heavy. Find one that can be used both vertically and horizontally.

**Hole cutter.** The curved blade is used to perforate forms, like tea strainers and colanders.

**Kidney rib.** These curved tools are used for shaping, scraping, smoothing, and compressing forms.

**Neck tool.** Helps shape a narrow-necked bottle, or can be used to pull a cylinder that's too narrow for your hand.

**Needle tool.** Used primarily to cut or level an uneven lip during throwing, scoring for additions, testing the floor of a pot for thickness, and popping air bubbles in the wall of a pot.

**Plaster slab.** Absorbent material used to dry slaked clay and slip you intend to recycle. Instructions on how to make your own slab may be found on this page.

**Plastic bucket.** A ½-gallon (1.9L) container holds water for throwing.

**Pottery sponge.** Used to clean the wheel head after throwing a pot (and clean up generally).

**Rounder.** A handmade ceramic tool that helps put a misshapen leatherhard pot back into a round shape. See this page for directions on how to throw one out of clay.

**Sponge stick.** Mops up water and slip from the floor of a tall, narrow form. See this page for how to make your own.

**Spray bottle.** Used to keep pots and appendages from getting too dry. Store several of them, ready to use, in different areas of the studio.

**Throwing bat.** A round wooden, plastic, or plaster board onto which you can throw a pot. It is attached to the wheel head by means of bat pins or a pad of moist clay. The bat detaches easily so you can move the pot without touching or disfiguring it.

**Throwing stick.** Sometimes called a wood knife, it's used like a rib to compress or shape various parts of a pot. Also a great incising tool, and useful for cutting the bevel at the base of a form while it's still on the wheel.

**Trimming tools.** For shaping and trimming the foot on a pot. Most often used during the finishing stage of making a pot.

**Ware boards.** Wooden shelves for moving, drying, and storing pots. Usually custom-cut to specifically fit a given storage area.

**Wire tool.** Can be used to cut a clay block, to cut a pot from a wheel head or bat, and for decorating purposes. Instructions for how to make your own are on this page.

**Wood rib.** Used for compressing or shaping the floors, walls, and lips of pots.

**making a wire tool**

Indespensible to the potter, the simple wire tool can cut a block of fresh clay into manageable portions for wedging or kneading, slice underneath a pot to remove it from the wheel head or bat (see photo at right), or create decorative facets on the wall of a pot. Here's how to make a counter-weighted wire tool with one wooden toggle and one clay toggle. The heavier clay toggle sits inside the splash pan, while the wooden toggle hangs freely over the side—a design that came from my brother, Johnny. You'll need:

**Multi-tool with hand saw and wire cutter Ruler**

**Wooden dowel, ½-inch (13mm) diameter**

**Nylon fishing line**

**Pliers**

  Use the multi-tool's saw to cut the dowel into several 1¼-inch (3.2cm) lengths. Carve a shallow indent (deep enough to hold the nylon line securely) around the center of each wooden piece **(1)**. Fashion an equal number of toggles of comparable size from some clay, and indent those, too. Fire the clay toggles with your pots. Photo **2** shows the pair of toggles needed to make one wire tool.

**1** : Carve indent in dowel

**2** : Clay toggle and wooden toggle

  Using the nylon fishing line, tie a slipknot around the clay toggle's indentation. Use three or four loops to create the slipknot, tightening it well with the pliers. Allow 5 inches (13cm) for tying the line to the toggle at the other end, plus at least 12 inches (30.5cm) for the free length between the two toggles **(3)**.

**3** : Measure fishing line

  Tie a simple overhand knot in the wooden toggle's indent; start the tying 5 inches (13cm) from the nylon line's end. Finish tying the wood toggle with a three-or four-loop slipknot **(4)**. Tighten it with pliers.

**4** : Attach fishing line

  Trim the loose ends of line at the toggles **(5)**. Hang the clay toggle inside the splash pan **(6)**.

**5** : Trim excess

**6** : Hang clay toggle inside pan

making a sponge stick

While pottery sponges come in all shapes and sizes, the one I use most often is a sponge on a stick. The design allows for maneuvering through narrow mouths of pots and down to hidden floors, where it absorbs excess water and slip, saving your pots from countless cracks.

The commercial type is more expensive and some, frankly, are too wide to be of much use and may even be attached to their sticks with screws that will dig into your pots' floors and leave gouges. This design makes it easy to replace the sponge when it wears out, and the stick doubles as a measuring device. To make this stick sponge, you'll need:

**Ruler**

**Permanent marking pen**

**Chopstick or 1/16-inch (5mm) dowel**

**Multi-tool with file and scissors**

**Tight-weave cleaning sponge**

**Plastic ties**

  Using your ruler and pen, mark units of measure along the length of the stick **(1)**. Start your numbering at the thicker end.

**1** : Measure and mark stick

  File two or three grooves into the stick at the last measurement mark **(2)**. Using scissors, cut a rectangular piece, roughly 3 x 2 x 1½ inch (7.5 x 5.1 x 3.8cm) out of one end of the large kitchen sponge **(3)** rounding the corners at one end.

**2** : File grooves into stick

**3** : Sponge with rounded corners at one end

  At the end opposite the rounded corners, use a scissor point or knife to poke a narrow hole into the center of the sponge **(4)**.

**4** : Create hole in sponge

  Insert the narrow end of the stick into the sponge **(5, 6)**. Create a loop with the plastic tie that can fit over the sponge **(7)**. Fit the tie over the end of the sponge, as shown in photo **8** ; pull the plastic tie as tight as you can without breaking it to secure the sponge into the grooves. Use your scissors to cut off the excess tie at the closure **(9)**.

**5** : Insert stick in sponge

**6** : Sponge on marked stick

**7** : Plastic tie holds sponge

**8** : Tighten tie around sponge's base

**GLAZING AND FIRING EQUIPMENT**

Mixing your own glazes begins with keeping a good **notebook**. While this might seem like a too-ordinary accessory, a potter's notebook is a kind of bible.

A high-quality **gram scale** is a must in any glaze room: either the triple-beam balance type or a digital one. It should use both U.S. and metric units, be able to weigh quantities of at least 1000 grams, and read in tenths.

To stir your glazes (and recycle clay), a **hand drill with an auger bit** is a great combination. These two tools make the job easier and faster. A ½-inch (13mm) drill is best because that chuck size is more useful. Augers can be purchased at any hardware store. An ordinary **kitchen blender** always comes in handy for small mixing jobs.

To make sure your glazes are smooth and well mixed, you'll need a **sieve**. While many potters prefer to use two different sizes of sieves, say, 110- and 60-mesh, you can easily get by with just an 80-mesh sieve.

Dry glaze materials should always be stored in **plastic or metal containers**. Opened bags create dust, and that dust can be toxic. Small and large plastic buckets with tight-fitting lids work well.

For "blushing" small areas of pots with a glaze solution or a patina, a **handheld atomizer** is perfect. This type of sprayer is usually available at your ceramic supply dealer or art supply store.

**Heavy-duty kiln gloves** are necessary around any pottery studio where kilns are present. Always use a heavy glove when handling the many hot objects associated with firing. Leather welding gloves are easy to find at hardware stores and do a great job of protecting your hands. Specialized high-temperature gloves are also available through ceramic supply dealers.

Two different kinds of **safety glasses** are a must in the studio. Use a pair of **transparent glasses** when grinding pots, tools, or kiln furniture. **Glass-worker's glasses** should be worn if you want to look into the kiln. Repeated exposure of unprotected eyes to a kiln's infrared radiation can result in long-term damage. Wear your safety glasses!

Without a doubt a potter must have a **respirator**. It should fit correctly and be capable of filtering the smallest of particles and the hazardous fumes produced in a pottery studio. Protect yourself against the health risks posed by dry clay and glaze materials, and by kiln gases. Respirators are available at most ceramic supply dealers or online.

A **handheld grinder** , either the 4- or the 7-inch (10 or 18cm) size, is most useful. A masonry disk for an electric grinder will make it easier to clean kiln shelves. If your budget allows, it's also convenient to have a **bench grinder** , for sharpening tools.

Besides your gas or electric kiln, a small **test kiln** is a wonderful accessory in any pottery studio. It's inexpensive, easy to use, and ultimately useful for determining clay and glaze qualities before you commit to the time and expense of firing a large load in a larger kiln. Get one that fires to at least cone 8 and can plug into a 110-volt outlet.

Linseed oil protects wooden tools

**TAKING CARE OF TOOLS**

Some clay can be abrasive, causing wear and tear on your tools. Tools used for throwing and trimming are particularly vulnerable. If they are to last a while, they need to be looked after. As they become worn, their edges, and sometimes even shapes, are changed, making it more difficult to use them as intended.

Occasionally, you should give all of your wooden tools a liberal coat or two of linseed oil to protect them from corrosion. The bench grinder can restore bevels; take care not to burn the wood, as burning weakens fibrous material.

Metal throwing tools, like kidney ribs and needle tools, should always be removed from the water when you finish each day. You can put new edges on these tools with either a bench grinder or a sharpening stone. Be careful not to grind away too much material, and don't hold the tool in one position so long that you scorch the metal; this too weakens the tool.

**STUDIO LAYOUT**

Oftentimes the space in which you work has a great deal to do with the individual qualities of your creations, so setting up your studio will be one of the most important things you do before making any pots. Take the time to consider what the limitations of the space are and how to best utilize what you do have. This is important because in a studio, no matter how large or small, there are furnishings and equipment that are difficult to move once they're in place. In this section, I'll share some thoughts that might help you make decisions about your own space.

A pottery studio is best organized around the six basic activities that take place there: clay storage, clay preparation, production of wet work, pottery storage, glazing, and firing. There are other activities as well, such as the packing or exhibition of pots, but the primary concerns here have to do with making the pots.

As we all know, clay is heavy, and you don't want to move it around more often than necessary. Store clay near your wedging table, because that's the first place you'll use it when preparing to make pots. If your clay comes ready to use, make sure the clay storage area is nearby, or even under the wedging table, so you don't have to carry the clay far. If you're mixing your own clay, it's best to do that process outside the studio because it's unsafe to breathe the dust that's generated by this messy activity; then move it inside near your wedging table. The location of your studio sink will probably help you decide where to locate your potter's wheel and set up the glaze area. If you can, have the clay storage area, wedging table, wheel, and sink as near to each other as possible.

Equipment, like the potter's wheel, slab roller, bats, wedging table, and toolbox, should be located on the perimeter of your space. You shouldn't have to walk around anything that is infrequently used. If possible, utilize natural light by having your wheel or wedging table at a window.

Give a good deal of thought to where the shelves for wet, drying, and fired pots will be located. Ideally, you'll want shelves for wet work near the wheel, and those for trimmed work waiting to be bisque fired near the kiln. You'll need shelving where you do your glazing, too. The shelving units ought to be constructed so that the ware boards can be removed easily and carried. Mobile shelving carts with wheels are very useful in any pottery studio.

Work tables should be in the center of the space. As you work on your pots, assembling or decorating them, a centrally located table lets you view them from different perspectives. Tables need to have handy storage space underneath for glazes, clay, or tools. Some potters like several small tables or carts that can be easily moved; others like one or two large tables. If possible, have at least one wood table with a bare top.

Preparing, mixing, and storing glazes in an organized, methodical manner will make your studio time more efficient and enjoyable. If you don't have a glaze room, store the materials and buckets of glaze under tables or against the walls. Always do your best to keep the glaze areas—especially the floor—clean.

My pottery studio layout

Kilns should live outside a studio whenever possible. If your kiln has to be inside (a must for electric!), make sure it's properly vented. If you have a gas kiln, the tanks and regulators should be located outside the building. Shelving for green ware, bisque ware, cones, and kiln furniture are a must in this area of the studio. Kiln rooms are great places to store those pieces of equipment that aren't needed on a daily basis, like air compressors, grinders, or even a toolbox.

Here are a few additional details that might help you plan your space:

  There is always a need for a good place to dry your pots. Having shelving near heating appliances like woodstoves or furnaces is a smart idea.

  Good lighting throughout the studio is a huge help when throwing, assembling, and glazing. Daylight-balanced bulbs and even skylights can make a big difference.

  Dust from ceramic materials is a health hazard. Be sure to keep all surfaces clean. When it comes to flooring, concrete has a couple of advantages over wood or dirt. Concrete floors are easier to clean and are fire-safe. If you are lucky enough to have a floor drain, use a hose to clean. If not, a mop will do. If you do sweep your studio floor, be sure to mist with water first.

  A bulletin board or chalkboard helps you keep lists of the materials you need to order, important dates, and resource materials.

  Having a small display area is a great way to present your pots to the public. Most potters situate their displays in an adjoining room or outside the studio, on benches, tables, or even just the ground.

  Locating a studio near a roadside can provide greater access to the public. Consider making a sign to let them know that you're in business.

clay bodies

Whether you're interested in using commercial clays or want to go out and dig your own, it's the malleable qualities of clay that most likely first captured your imagination and made you want to give pottery a try. As a material, clay seems pretty straightforward. But the more we learn about clay, the vaster the possibilities for creativity become. In other words, the more you know, the easier it is to transform the material into what you want to make.

When potters talk about clay, they often are referring to a clay body, which is a mixture of geological clays and other mineral oxides. The six geological types of clays are common surface clays, ball and fire clays, stoneware, kaolin, and bentonite. Each kind of geological clay was formed by a different natural process, and while some can be found practically everywhere, others are rare. Clays provide the mass, plasticity, and oxides that make it possible for the soft, malleable material to turn into ceramic when fired to a high temperature.

Porcelain, stoneware, and earthenware clays

Every clay body also contains silica, which creates the glass structure in a fired ceramic piece. Silica doesn't melt easily, though, so other mineral oxides must be added. Flux, in the form of feldspar, or a catalyst, such as talc, both aid in lowering the temperature needed to turn clay into ceramic.

Finally, an aggregate like grog helps reduce shrinkage and can provide strength in either the drying or the firing stage. Grog is made of already-fired clays that were hammer-milled to various particle sizes, some fine enough not to irritate your skin when you're throwing.

Commercial clay (the type that comes in plastic bags) is a scientifically blended composite of naturally occurring materials. Manufacturers create bagged clay that is categorized as earthenware, stoneware, or porcelain (see left). The qualities of each type of clay depend on unique mineral and oxide combinations found in their formulation. The characteristics of these clay blends help you choose which one best suits your creative and practical purposes—as well as your budget and firing options. Let's look briefly at some of clay's basic qualities.

**Plasticity.** The workability of a clay or clay body, along with its ability to stand up after being formed, is called plasticity. This characteristic is brought about by the percentages of clays present in the clay body. The greater the percentage of non-clay materials in a body, the less plasticity it has.

**Porosity.** A fired clay, or ceramic, is judged in part by its porosity and durability. Less porous ceramic is stronger and more resistant to acids and bacteria. Earthenware is the most porous of the three types, stoneware less so, and porcelain has very little or no porosity. Mostly, I use a stoneware body for the throwing, decorating, and firing demonstrations in this book.

**Firing temperature.** Every clay body has a firing temperature range, commonly low-fire (earthenware), mid-range (stoneware and porcelain), or high-fire (stoneware and porcelain). Actually, the differences, in degrees, between the various ranges in temperature isn't much, but to see the full potential of the clay body, the potter must learn how to control the effects of the kiln. (For more about the art and science of firing, see chapter 6.)

**Fired color.** Because every clay and mineral comes from nature, the color of the fired ceramic is determined by its composition and to some extent the conditions under which it is fired. Color depends first on the percentages of oxides like iron, manganese, and titanium found in a clay body's composition. Second, depending on whether the clay is fired in oxidation or reduction greatly influences its fired color. While it is sometimes possible to predict a clay body's melting point and fired color based on its appearance when moist, it's always a good idea to test-fire any clay that you're unfamiliar with (see this page). Earthenware clays are either reddish brown or white and subsequently fire to a variety of oranges and whites. Stoneware bodies are commonly available in light grays to browns and fire to colors ranging from off-white to gray to buff and chocolate brown. Porcelain bodies are gray to white, and fire to colors within that range. However, it is possible to add coloring oxides or stains to porcelains to achieve dynamic coloration.

Each of the tiles above represents the same clay fired to different temperatures, resulting in an array of colors.

Potters typically settle on the clay body they want to work with by judging its fired color, temperature (based on available kilns), how it interacts with glazes, how durable the pot needs to be, and how easy it is to work with. By experimenting with a variety of clay bodies, you'll discover for yourself which one best suits your needs.

**FINDING THE DRY SHRINKAGE RATE**

No matter which type of clay body you're using, it will shrink, so you'll want to make your pots larger in order to compensate for the change in scale or shape. Potters typically want a clay body with a shrinkage rate of less than 13 percent. That might not sound like a lot until you consider that a bottle thrown to 10 inches (25.4cm) tall will lose almost 1½ inches (3.8cm) in height. When pots come out of a warm kiln, it's common for potters to not even recognize their own work because of this transformation!

Earthenware clay shrinks the least; depending on how refractory it is, the rate is from 4 to 12 percent. Stoneware shrinks 8 to 12 percent, and it's not unusual for porcelain clay to be reduced up to 20 percent. Half of this occurs when the clay dries, and the other half during firing. Adding an aggregate such as grog or silica sand helps lessen shrinkage. Grog has already been fired so it doesn't shrink much. It's available in several different particle sizes: fine, medium, and coarse. Keep in mind that the clay will feel different when you work with it and will look different after it's fired. Once the clay is fired, you will also be able to see changes in color, and possibly surface texture. If it is fired in an electric kiln, there's a good chance that it will be lighter in tone than if it's fired in a gas, oil, or wood kiln.

  To find the dry shrinkage rate, place a small amount of clay—perhaps 1 pound (0.5kg)—on a porous surface like canvas, plaster, or wood. If you plan to make more than one or two test tiles, start with more clay. Use a rolling pin or slab roller to make a slab that is 10 to 13mm thick **(1)**. Work with metric measurements, which will simplify your calculations.

**1** : Roll out clay

  Cut a narrow rectangle, say 3 to 4cm wide and 12cm long, out of the slab **(2)**. Incise a line across the short side of the tile with a needle tool. Hook the end of the tape measure at this mark, and make another incision at the other end, 10cm away **(3)**. Make the lines bold, so they're easy to see, and be accurate.

**2** : Cut test piece

**3** : Mark off in centimeters

  Draw a straight line between the two end lines. Inscribe each centimeter along that line. Let the tile dry and then measure the long line again. The difference between the moist and dry lengths is the drying shrinkage rate. If the dry clay measures 9cm, its dry shrinkage rate is 10 percent (10cm minus 9cm equals 1cm, or 10 percent).

Remember, clay also shrinks during firing. For further testing, see this page.

**DIGGING YOUR OWN CLAY**

Most potters begin their work by opening a plastic bag containing premixed clay, ready to go. Their clay is a homogenous mix of various clays and other materials blended to provide a dependable recipe. There are many advantages to doing things this way. These mass-produced clay bodies tend to be consistent and predictable, and more often than not, this is the way we get acquainted with or come to know clay.

Another route is to pick a nice day, grab a shovel and bucket, and dig your own clay. Finding a good source is a matter of understanding your local geology and topography. By contacting your country's geological agency (in the U.S., the Department of Natural Resources), you can locate nearby clay deposits.

Clay starts out as a feldspathic composite that has been worn down and made pliable by natural forces. River and stream banks offer the most reliable sources of the material. While clay often occurs at the surface near these two sources, there's a good chance you'll have to dig a short distance through a top layer to get at it. Because clay is composed of fine particles, and is dense and sticky, it can be difficult to dig, so try using a pointed spade instead of a square shovel. Dry clay can be hard as rock. For this sort of consistency, you might also need a pickax, so go out prepared for both possibilities.

The workability of a natural clay is important. To determine how a clay body will behave on a potter's wheel, or when curved like a handle, perform a simple field test. While field-testing is rudimentary and doesn't indicate everything about how a clay body might respond, it does help save time and effort.

Remember that there are few, if any, shortcuts. Your tests will reveal answers about only that specific bucket of clay you've dug, but they won't confirm anything about a different deposit just down the road, or even the stuff twenty feet away from the batch you're working with! When you dig your own clay, it's always a good idea to measure your enthusiasm with thorough and continuous testing, just in case nature throws you a curve ball. That said, here is how to perform a field test.

  Let's say a vein of clay was exposed during a flash flood. Before digging a bucketful, remove enough clay to wedge, or mix, in your hand **(1)**.

**1** : Work clay in your hands

  Roll a coil ¼ inch (6mm) thick, to test the clay's plasticity, and gently wrap it around your finger **(2)**. If the clay isn't moist enough to be formed into a coil, add some water. Check for large cracks in the coil. If the coil splits in half, it may not be workable enough. After doing the coil test, roll the clay into a small ball and push your thumb into it. If water forms on the clay surface around your thumb, it's probably "short," meaning that it would tend to slump on the wheel.

**2** : Field-test clay's plasticity

  If the clay passes the field test, take it back to your studio for processing **(3)**. Back at the studio, spread out the clay on concrete, plywood, or canvas, and let it dry thoroughly, to bone dry, like the pieces shown at left; this might take several days. (To test its dryness, crumble a large chunk of clay and check its interior for signs of moisture. If there is even the slightest moisture present, let it dry some more.) Crumble the bone-dry clay into a plastic bucket half-filled with water. Anytime the clay exceeds the water level, add more water, until the bucket is three-quarters full with the mixture.

**3** : Dig clay from ground

  Let the clay slake, or break down in the water. It may take several hours but it's important that the clay becomes totally saturated with water so it breaks down and settles. When the clay is fully slaked, use a drill with an auger attachment to mix the clay and water into a slurry **(4)**. If it's too thick, add more water.

**4** : After slaking, mix dug clay into slurry

  Pour a moderate amount of slurry into a second bucket with a 60- or 80-mesh sieve over it. Move the slurry through the sieve with a heavy-duty scrub brush **(5)**. Discard any larger particles that clog the sieve as you work the slurry through.

**5** : Push clay through sieve

  After sieving, pour the clay slurry onto a large, thick plaster slab or other porous surface **(6)**. As the water is absorbed, the slurry stiffens to a consistency you can work with. Be vigilant during this drying process so your new clay body doesn't dry too much.

**6** : Spread on plaster slab to dry

  When the clay has reached a pliable consistency, scrape it from the slab and wedge it into blocks, large coils, or balls. Store the clay in tightly sealed plastic bags or buckets. Congratulations, you're ready to perform a few tests on the clay in order to learn what some of its properties are, including its dry and fired shrinkage rate (see this page and this page).

Spiral-kneaded clay

**handling clay**

The physical starting point of making pots on a wheel is the clay. Whether you use a commercial mix or dig your own, clay requires preparation before you put your heart and hands to the challenge.

I prepare my clay using the spiral kneading technique. If I'm using reclaimed clay or if the clay is lumpy, I wedge it first. Wedging takes its name from the shape the clay acquires during the process. Because you cut through the block of clay many times and slam it down, one piece into the other, on the wedging table, it helps break down the hard lumpy pieces.

There are three objectives to wedging and kneading: to compress the clay particles, to blend the individual ingredients well, and to remove air pockets. Compression makes for a tighter clay body so your pots will dry and fire with less chance of developing cracks or air bubbles. Well-compressed clay also helps a pot to be thrown more uniformly. Fresh commercial clay has been "de-aired" by a machine called a vacuum pugmill, so it's unlikely to have air pockets. Therefore, care must be taken during wedging and kneading not to introduce them into the clay by folding the clay over onto itself, as if you were kneading dough. If air pockets aren't worked out of the clay, they can disrupt the throwing process itself. Pockets also become spaces for steam to gather during the firing process, which increases the possibility of a blowout. It's easy to determine if your kneading technique needs improvement by examining a cross-section of the clay. The color should be homogenous and there shouldn't be any air pockets.

Once you're at the wheel, you don't want to have to stop to wedge and knead more clay for your next pot, so prepare enough clay to make several pots in one sitting. Start with dry hands, and make sure your wedging table and scales are clean before you start. If bits of dry clay or other materials get into fresh clay, they can make throwing more difficult and cause uncertain results during the firing process. Your work surface is important, but potters vary in their preferences. I prefer a tabletop made of marine plywood that has been lightly sanded smooth. This type of plywood is durable and cleans easily, and its surface is slightly porous, which releases the clay as you work with it.

For both wedging and kneading, you'll need a sturdy table, a wire cutoff tool, 8 to 10 pounds (4 to 4.5kg) of clay, and a digital or analog scale.

**WEDGING**

  Lift the block of clay and pound it down onto the table, with moderate force, at an angle slightly toward your stomach **(1)**. This action should stretch and flatten the block. Repeat this process until the block has been flattened and stretched into a thick, rectangular slab then lift the side closest to you so there is space underneath it **(2)**.

**1** : Throw down block with force

**2** : Lift edge closest to you

  Holding the wire tool taut, position it under the block, at the mid-point. Draw the wire upward and through the clay, cutting the block in two equal halves **(3)**.

**3** : Cut from underneath with wire tool

  Lift the half of the block that is closest to you high in the air and pound it down onto the other half **(4)**. Use your hand to tidy the seam where the two halves meet **(5)**.

**4** : Slam halves together

**5** : Neaten edges

  Pick up the block by lifting its far edge away from you, to help release the clay from the table surface **(6)**. Repeat the cut-lift-throw-and-slap process so that you add yet another visible layer to the block **(7)**. Try to use enough force each time you add a layer so that you don't trap any air bubbles in the clay **(8)**. Continue wedging until you have repeated the entire process at least ten times.

**6** : Continue cut-lift-throw-slap process . . .

**7** : . . . at least ten times

**8** : Check for trapped air space

Properly kneaded clay won't have any air pockets when sliced in half.

**KNEADING**

While the process of wedging causes compression of the clay structure, kneading stretches and finely blends the clay mass, helping to release air and condition it for throwing. I prefer the spiral kneading technique (demonstrated on this page), as it mixes and de-airs the clay better. Kneading is a very physical technique and is a good way to warm up the muscles—especially on a cold day—and get ready to throw pots. On the other hand, kneading also causes strain in the wrists, arms, shoulders, and back. It is a good idea to always start with your body aligned properly, so the weight and strength of your upper body can best be utilized, and slowly work yourself into the process.

  As you can see in the next photos, I start the push with my torso upright, left leg forward **(1)** ; as I follow through on the movement, the leg bends and my body moves into the clay. Be sure to keep your left arm straight **(2)** , which is a good way to transfer the energy of your body weight to the clay.

**1** : Use force of entire body

**2** : Keep left arm straight

**SPIRAL KNEADING**

  A comfortable amount of clay to handle is about half of the amount that you just wedged. Place both hands, with your fingers gently curled, around the far end of the block **(1)**. Throughout the process, your left hand should remain in contact with the clay, to help lift it and stabilize its position in relation to your other hand. Leaving the end closest to you on the table, lift the block and rotate it slightly **(2)**.

**1** : Curl fingers around clay

**2** : Lift and rotate

  Apply moderate pressure down and away **(3)**. Don't push so hard that the clay smears or flattens. Repeat these last two moves, so that a rounded bottom starts to take form. Continue to knead the clay; as you do, lift and rotate the left side of the block slightly higher than the right, then push down and away with your right palm. A spiraling curl should begin to form **(4)**.

**3** : Use moderate downward-and-away pressure

**4** : Pull up, push away, rolling the back side

  Lift the block up to prepare for another "push," with the left hand cupped around the end of the spiral **(5)**. Keep in mind that while your hands will be in contact mostly at just one end of the clay mass (not, as with dough, all of it at once), rocking and lifting and pushing the clay smoothly against the work surface spirals the whole, bit by bit.

**5** : Left hand lifts more than right

  Use your right palm to push away. Don't push so hard that you create a deep indentation in the clay. At the conclusion of the push, the right hand should be positioned as shown in photo **6**. If the clay is being kneaded properly, it will spiral in on itself **(7)**. The underside of the block should be curved, as seen in photo **8**.

**6** : Right hand position after each push

**7** : Natural spiraling after 10 or more kneads

**8** : Side view of kneaded clay

  As kneading progresses, your left hand dominates as it lifts and rotates the clay. Photo **9** shows that the left hand ought to be higher than the right as you make each downward motion. The moist area of the left palm, in photo **10** , shows which part of your hand should be most in contact with the clay during the kneading process.

**9** : Best position for hands at start of downward push

**10** : Use this part of left palm

  After kneading for several minutes—taking care not to fold air into the clay by pushing too hard with your right hand—pat the narrow end into the mass **(11)**. Roll the spiraled form into a tight cone shape **(12)**. Repeat the full process described here for all clay that you intend to throw that day.

**11** : Bring narrow end in

**12** : Slap and roll into cone

**WEIGHING**

Now that your clay is wedged and kneaded, you're ready to weigh and ball up the cone of clay. When you start with clay balls that are consistently the same weight, you'll find it easier to practice throwing pots to the same size. Once you ball up the entire cone of wedged and kneaded clay, keep them close to the wheel. That way, you won't have to leave the wheel after each pot is made to clean your hands and prepare more clay, which helps achieve greater continuity and focus.

  Once you've kneaded the clay and formed it into a cone shape, decide what kinds of forms you would like to throw and how much each will weigh. For guidelines on how much clay to start with, see How Much Clay? at right.

  Remove some clay from the cone with your hand (not the wire tool) and weigh it **(1)**. If you come up short, add smaller amounts of clay to the scale until the correct weight is achieved **(2)**. Take care when adding these smaller pieces to the larger lump not to trap air or you will be handicapped when you start throwing.

**1** : Pull clay apart rather than cut it

**2** : Adjust to desired weight in small increments

  Stack the weighed and shaped balls of clay into a pyramid shape **(3)**. You might find it helpful to stack the balls inside a recycled plastic grocery bag and close it so air can't get in while you're working. Each time you remove a ball for throwing, make sure you re-cover the stack.

**Large bowl** | = | 3 pounds (1.4kg)

**Small plate** | = | 2 pounds (0.9kg)

**Large plate** | = | 3K pounds (1.6kg)

**COVERING WITH PLASTIC**

After you make a pot, you don't want to let it dry too fast. If that happens, it's difficult (if not impossible) to trim later. To protect your pots while you work, you can cover them with plastic so they dry slowly, giving you time to finish them up at your convenience. Also, by drying pots slowly, the rate at which they shrink is slowed down, so the possibility of cracking is minimized. Covering pots that you've just assembled, like teapots or mugs with handles, is also a good idea. This helps the appendages and bodies settle together more slowly, and crack less—or not at all.

The plastic you use is important. If you cover freshly thrown pots with stiff plastic, there's a good chance that it will mar or even deform the pots. Keep a good supply of thin, soft plastic, like the kind you can get from your local dry cleaner's or grocery store.

If you're planning to trim your pot fairly soon, it's a good idea to cover the piece lightly with plastic, which lets some air circulate. Simply place the pot on a wooden ware board. Carefully drape the plastic over the pot.

  Gently and lightly seal the plastic around the base of the pot. Be careful not to stretch the plastic too tightly against the clay, so it doesn't change the form of your pot **(1)**.

**1** : Seal plastic around base of pot

  If you're unable to trim the pot on the day you've made it, you might want to cover the pot in such a way that it will take a long time for it to dry out. To do this, place the plastic on the board first and then put the pot in the center of it. Bring the ends of the sheet together over the pot **(2)**. Now tuck in the loose bits around the pot **(3)**.

**2** : For longer storage, fully encase pot

**3** : Complete wrapping slows drying

**RECYCLING SCRAP CLAY**

The business of making pots generates scraps, but never waste. The extra bits of scrap clay can be reprocessed into usable material. Scrap clay is processed according to how much moisture it still contains. Wet scrap that comes from throwing, and the dry stuff—the practice pots that haven't been fired—can be slaked. Slaking is the process of breaking down clay in a bucket of water, resulting in a slip-like consistency.

Leather-dry bits from trimming should be set aside and left to dry thoroughly before they are slaked. It's always a good idea to spread out leather-dry pieces so they dry quickly. Don't pile these kinds of scraps on top of each other; that only lengthens the drying time. After they're dry, slake them in plenty of water and ½ cup (118ml) vinegar. Allow enough time, say, half a day, for the material to break down.

As long as the clay can slake down into a thick and relatively smooth slip, there's no reason you should have to have an expensive clay mixer, or pugmill, to do the mixing. All you really need are plastic buckets, a drill with an auger, and a plaster slab or other absorbent surface.

  Break the pots into shards **(1)**. Crumble them into a 5-gallon (19L) bucket filled halfway with warm water **(2)**. Don't drop large amounts of scrap into the water all at once or the clay will get gummy and not break down in the water thoroughly.

**1** : Break up dried clay by hand

**2** : Slowly add clay to bucket

  Add scraps until "islands" form **(3)**. When this happens, add more water. Let the clay slake, completely undisturbed, for at least three to four hours. (Stirring also causes gumming.) Pour off any excess water from the bucket and stir the mixture with the auger until it's mostly smooth **(4)**.

**3** : Add shards until "islands" form

**4** : Fully slaked clay

  Spread handfuls of slop onto an absorbent surface, like a plaster slab **(5)**. (To make a plaster slab, see the next section.) Build up a layer 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5cm) thick. Cover the plaster slab with the clay and let it dry to the best consistency for kneading or reworking **(6)**. How long the drying takes varies greatly, depending on local humidity conditions or how damp your plaster slab might have been to begin with. Store the wedged and kneaded clay in airtight plastic bags.

**5** : Spread onto absorbent surface

**6** : Check progress of drying

**MAKING A PLASTER SLAB**

A dry plaster slab is highly absorbent and strong. Here's how to make one that can be used for all sorts of purposes, such as drying throwing slip and clay scraps, processing locally dug clay, making thin clay slabs, or drying the bases of your pots quickly.

When mixing plaster for a studio slab, you'll want a strong mix, but not so dense that it's slow to absorb water. The more plaster you put into a volume of water, the more durable the final result will be.

Some words of warning: If cured plaster somehow gets into your clay, it will cause a blowout during or even after firing it. Also don't flush plaster residue down your drain. Ever. Use an old bucket to wash your hands and tools in fresh water, then throw it out, well diluted, someplace safe.

To make your plaster slab, you'll need:

  4 cottle boards and spring or C-clamps, for the mold

  Level, non-absorbent work surface (glass, laminate, or a plastic covering larger than the mold's dimensions)

  Pliable clay (will be discarded later)

  Mold release (spray oil or an oil-soap solution)

  Metal screen cut to a size just smaller than the finished slab

  Tin snips or wire cutters

  Respirator

  Yogurt cup or similar volume container

  USG pottery plaster #1

  Purpose-made rubber or flexible plastic bucket, for mixing plaster and water

  Plastic water bucket, for cleaning hands and tools

  Soft rubber spatula

  Rubber mallet

  Surform rasp

  One end of a cottle board has an angle piece. The opposite end doesn't. Form a square by clamping an angle end of one cottle to the plain end of another **(1)**.

**1** : Clamp cottle boards together

  Put the cottle mold on a level, nonabsorbent surface (the one in the photo is glass).

  Roll enough clay coils to seal the perimeter of the cottle mold to the glass **(2)**. Spray or brush mold release all over the inside surfaces of the mold. Hold the screen material over the cottle mold, to get the correct size. Use the snips to cut the screen ½ inch (1.3cm) smaller than the interior area of the mold **(3)**. Set the screen aside.

**2** : Seal form to glass with clay coils

**3** : Cut steel mesh slightly smaller than mold

  Wearing your respirator, use a small cup to sift the plaster over a half-bucket of cold water, so the plaster sets slowly. Sprinkle it evenly over the entire surface of the water **(4)** , until it forms a 1-inch-high (2.5cm) mound on top of the water **(5)**. Let the plaster slake for 3 minutes.

**4** : Sift plaster powder over water's surface

**5** : Allow powder to mound

  Use one hand to gently break up the large chunks of plaster **(6)**. Don't do it vigorously, or you'll create too many air bubbles. Air bubbles weaken plaster.

**6** : Gently break up powder chunks

  Submerge your hand in the plaster to mix it **(7)** , or use a small mixer at low speed. Be careful about generating air bubbles. After mixing for 2 minutes, the plaster should look smooth, as in photo **8**.

**7** : Stir with hand

**8** : Check mixture's consistency

  Immediately wash your hands in the fresh-water bucket. Do not wash your hands or any of the tools in a sink! Pour one-half of the plaster into the mold **(9)**. Do it smoothly, and try not to splash.

**9** : Carefully pour half of mixture into mold

  Gently lay the kink-free wire screen on top of the plaster **(10)**. Ensure that the screen is level. The screen will strengthen the slab but it must not touch the mold's walls **(11)**.

**10** : Inset mesh on plaster surface

**11** : Keep mesh away from cottle boards

  Pour the rest of the plaster into the mold **(12)**. Using a rubber spatula, scrape the last bits of plaster out of the rubber bucket. When you're done, immediately submerge the spatula and bucket inside the larger freshwater bucket to soak. Level the surface of the plaster by vibrating it with your fingertips **(13)**. Gently tap each wall with the rubber mallet; this, too, vibrates the plaster and puts a final, smooth finish on the surface. Let the mold set up for 15 minutes: don't disturb it.

**12** : Evenly pour remaining plaster

**13** : Level surface with fingertips

  After waiting the allotted time, release the slab: remove the coils and clamps carefully, at an angle **(14)**. Bevel all the edges with the Surform tool **(15)**. Clean all the loose bits of plaster off the slab with a damp sponge, and prop it up so air can circulate all around it. Drying may take 24 hours or more. Use a fan to help speed the process. A plaster slab is ready to use when it feels dry to the touch.

**14** : Pull cottle boards off set slab at an angle

**15** : Bevel slab's edges with tool

  Thoroughly clean all of the tools and surfaces you used, so plaster won't find its way into your throwing clay. Throw away the coils of clay that were used for the cottles. If you have dry plaster left over, roll up the original bag tightly before sealing it inside a plastic bag and taping that tightly. When exposed to the air, dry plaster powder absorbs moisture, shortening its shelf life.

The Basic Cylinder

Cylinder Variations

Dishes

**the basic cylinder**

Making cylinders is so simple, so humble, and so important to know how to do. We'll start with learning the basic steps and techniques for throwing a cylinder. Here is where you will begin to acquire the skills you need to have before moving on to more challenging forms. Once you get the hang of making a well-made cylinder, a world of pottery shapes—including teapots, bottles, pitchers, and plates—will be literally at your fingertips. Not only is the cylinder the gateway to all of these other shapes, but it also teaches you about clay distribution—how to bring up the clay, and how to raise it in a controlled way. It's about training your eyes to see a straight line, and training your hands to throw a straight-sided pot.

**SET UP THE WORKSPACE**

When throwing, the height and location of your stool or chair as it relates to the potter's wheel makes a difference. Your seat should be level with (or just a bit higher than) the wheel head, which lets you use both the wheel and your body for bracing. Additionally, sitting a bit higher than the wheel head provides leverage and puts your arm and shoulder strength to use. Consider putting a pad on the stool, for comfort.

You might think you need more tools than you actually do. When first learning how to throw, tools can create a distance between you and the clay and impede your connection with the material and its qualities. Consider your hands and the potter's wheel as your primary tools. Together, they can create endless varieties of form, surface, and volume. In addition to your hands and the wheel, there are just five basic tools you'll need to start with (see above and right). You will also want to have a ½-gallon (1.9L) plastic bucket and a hand towel.

**five basic tools**

  **Wire tool, with 13 inches (33cm) of wire between the toggles**

  **Chamois leather, 4 x ¾-inch (10 x 2cm) piece**

  **Needle tool with a fine needle**

  **Throwing stick with a 45-degree angle point**

  **Sponge on a stick**

Fill the bucket at least three-quarters full with warm water and position it on the shelf area located at the wheel. The warm water helps your hands and fingers relax. Keep your throwing stick and sponge in the water—this makes for easy retrieval and prevents clay residue on the tools from drying out and flaking off into your wedged clay or the pots themselves.

Similarly, the clay you've prepared should be nearby and kept covered with plastic at all times. The wire tool can dangle from the splash pan, while the chamois leather hangs over the edge of the water bucket. I also find it helpful to have some kind of a gauge (like the sponge stick on this page) and a mirror (see this page).

**THROW A CYLINDER**

Before you start throwing, make sure that the clay is well kneaded and your wheel is set to turn counterclockwise. Once your wheel and workspace are organized, you're ready to throw the simplest of forms: the cylinder. Sit down and drape a towel over your lap.

**CENTER**

Perhaps one of the things that people find hardest when they start throwing cylinders is centering a lump of clay on the wheel. Learning to center clay is as important as a bricklayer making a good foundation for a building. If you don't center the clay well on the wheel, you aren't going to have a healthy pot. Simple as that!

  Lightly dampen the center of the wheel head and throw the lump of clay at the moist spot with vim and vigor. With the wheel turning slowly, pat the clay down and in toward the center, making sure it's firmly attached to the wheel head.

  Get your hands and the clay wet, and set the wheel spinning at moderate speed. Bracing both of your arms, either on your legs or the edge of the splash pan, cup your right hand around the ball of clay **(1)**. Brace your right hand by putting your left hand over your right wrist and pulling slightly in, toward your body, as you press down. Smooth any undulations in the clay.

**1** : Cup centered ball of clay

**CONE UP**

Coning is a technique that helps center the clay and makes it easier to move its mass into the vertical axis of the spinning wheel head.

  Apply pressure directly to the base of the clay by cupping it firmly with the palms of your hands **(2)**. Now, with your hands positioned directly opposite each other, keep the heel of your right hand against the clay as your left hand cups your right, squeezing inward **(3)**. As you apply pressure, allow the cone shape to rise upward through the gap between your hands. Brace your left elbow but keep your right arm free which keeps the upper part of the cone centered **(4)**. The left hand applies the pressure.

**2** : Apply pressure with both hands

**3** : Inward pressure creates rising cone

**4** : Apply pressure with left hand; center with right

  Once the cone is at its full height—for a 1-pound (0.5kg) ball, that will be about 4 inches (10cm)—and its tip is spinning so it's well centered in the wheel's axis, wet your hands and the clay again. Cup your right hand around the cone with your thumb on top. Place your left hand on your right hand, just behind the thumb **(5)**. Slowly apply downward pressure with your right thumb, and inward pressure with your palm. Keep your right hand rigid so the clay won't spin off center.

**5** : Apply pressure with base of right thumb

  As the clay is evenly pressed down, your right thumb creates a flat summit on what is now a more cylindrically shaped mass **(6)**. The two most important details here are that the clay stays centered and that it does not spread out. Ensure this by maintaining inward pressure at the wheel head with your right hand **(7)**.

**6** : Compress clay into disk

**7** : Maintain inward pressure

  To complete this centering step, reposition your left hand, cupping it around your right. Apply light, inward pressure with both hands **(8)**. This encourages the clay to spin more quietly and nearer to center than it did at the beginning of the process. If you're not sure that the clay is on center, hold a chopstick, your finger, or other fixed point next to the spinning mass. You will soon see if it's on center or not: the distance between the fixed point and th e clay should remain constant.

**8** : Apply light and inward pressure with both hands

**DEFINE THE BASE**

Now that you have centered the clay, take time to define the base. First, brace your right elbow on your knee, and steady your right hand with your left. Use the tip of your right thumb **(1)** to slowly press the clay into the place where the clay meets the wheel head **(2)**.

**1** : Define base with right thumb

**2** : Compress base thoroughly

**OPEN THE CLAY**

A small cylinder like the one I demonstrate in the photos only needs 1 pound (0.5kg) of clay. How deeply you open the clay depends on the type of pot you want to make.

  Your primary tools for opening (sometimes called "breaking in") are your right thumb and the middle fingers of your left hand. You'll keep them pressed together throughout this initial phase of opening.

  With the wheel spinning, apply downward pressure with your thumb and fingers **(1)**. Slowly guide them straight down the axis of the clay, toward the bottom. At this point, the shape of the opening should be like a V and not a borehole; I find a V shape keeps the clay on center later when I open out the floor. You may want to pause along the way to add a little water (see the Watering Your Pot sidebar at left).

**1** : Break open disk

**watering your pot**

During the opening stage of the throwing process, make sure that your hands and the clay are wet enough. If at any point you realize the clay is becoming tacky or is dragging on your fingers, pause to wet it with your sponge. Water provides the lubrication necessary to keep the clay centered and will prevent the pot's walls from twisting or tearing. At the same time, however, you should use a minimum amount of water so the clay doesn't become saturated, which will weaken the pot and can cause cracks in the floor while it's drying or being fired.

When you apply water to the pot, hold your middle finger on the inside of the pot's lip and your index finger on the outside **(1)**. Using your sponge, squeeze just a little bit of water between your fingers and let it run down the inside and outside of the pot.

**1** : Add water to hand, not clay

  Apply downward pressure until the floor is ¼ inch (6mm) thick. An easy way to measure the floor's depth is to use a needle tool. With the wheel stationary, simply pierce the clay floor until the tip touches the wheel head. Slide your index finger down the tool until you can feel it touch the floor. Hold your fingernail there on the needle, withdraw the tool, and check the depth (see photo 5 on this page).

**OPEN THE FLOOR**

  Keep the same wheel speed as for the opening process. Using moderate pressure with the first two or three fingertips of your left hand, create the floor by gradually spreading the clay outward toward 3 o'clock while applying gentle downward pressure **(1)**.

**1** : Push down and out

  Your right hand allows the clay to move outward but at the same time stabilizes it, keeping the clay on center **(2)**. To ensure that the entire floor will be of a consistent thickness, try to avoid sudden up or down movements. The floor of the cylinder should be flat, and uniform in thickness, and for this piece the base width should be 4½ inches (11cm).

**2** : Stabilize widening form with right hand

**COLLAR AND PULL THE WALL**

To create the wall, you'll be drawing the cylinder upward using collaring and pulling techniques. Your wheel should be turning at moderate speed, and your hands and the cylinder kept wet at all times.

  To collar, cradle the fingers of your right hand and the last three fingers of the left around the form. Your left thumb braces into your right palm. Apply moderate pressure inward as you slowly move both hands upward **(1)**. Keep your wrists low during this early phase. Brace your forearms on the edge of the splash pan to prevent the cylinder from moving off center.

**1** : Bring clay up with inward pressure

  As the wheel turns, move your hands up and inward slowly, allowing the pot to make many revolutions while your hands rise. Don't do it too quickly, or the pot may go off center. When you've finished collaring, the cylinder should be conical **(2)**.

**2** : Collar to create a conical shape

  Now you'll make several pulls. Always work on the right side of the cylinder (if the pot on the wheel were a clock, you sit at six o'clock, with both hands applying pressure on the mouth at four o'clock), using the middle fingers of both hands. Your left hand should be on the inside of the cylinder and your right hand on the outside. At the base of the conical shape, make a groove using the middle finger of your right hand **(3)**. The depth of the floor inside the pot establishes that your right fingers make the pull at a level that's lower than your left ones. You will keep them like that all the way up the wall, to just below the lip.

**3** : Use middle finger to establish groove in base

  As you pull slowly upward with both hands, exert more inward pressure with the outside hand than with your interior hand, slanting the wall inward as it rises. Your left thumb is outside the pot, bracing your right hand. You're pulling correctly if the groove you just made precedes your right (outside) hand as it moves upward **(4)**.

**4** : Pull groove up

  As you complete the first pull, the fingers of both hands come closer together. Lessen the pressure, pausing at the lip to let the wheel make numerous revolutions, and release slowly **(5)**.

**5** : Release pressure slowly

  Compress the lip after each pull. One way is to use the webbing between the index and middle fingers of your left hand. With the wheel spinning, straddle the right side of the cylinder's lip, with your left index finger on the outside. Gradually apply gentle pressure **(6)**. Do this until the lip is smooth and rounded.

**6** : Compress lip

  Wet your hands and the cylinder. Recreate the groove in the base with your right middle finger while at the same time, the three fingers of your left hand are inside, just above the level of your right middle finger. Your left index finger and thumb, on the outside, brace your right hand just above your right middle finger **(7)**. Make a second pull, to raise the form. Keep your fingertips higher on the inside of the pot than those on the outside as you come up the wall with both hands. Exert steady pressure the entire way. Apply a bit more inward pressure with the exterior fingers than with the interior ones. Doing so maintains the bulge and narrows the shape **(8)**.

**7** : Start second pull

**8** : Apply pressure with right hand

  As this second pull rises to just under the lip, hold your fingers there momentarily before releasing them. Don't let your fingers cross over the lip **(9)**.

**9** : Hold fingers just under lip momentarily

**troubleshoot your first pull**

If your pot is wider at the mouth than at its base, it's because you applied more outward pressure with your left (interior) fingers than with your right (exterior) ones. If so, you will want to "collar" the pot again, using one of the two ways described here.

One approach is to cup both hands around the bottom of the spinning pot and slowly bring them upward until they reach the lip; apply gentle pressure as you go.

A second option, shown in photo **3** , on this page, is to use six points of contact: your thumbs and the index and middle fingers of both hands. Contacting the pot's base all around, constrict the form. Exerting light pressure, move both hands up the form. Pause at the lip before releasing your contact with the clay.

**REMOVE THE WATER**

It's important to remove excess water from the inside of a pot once you have finished throwing it. Water left in the bottom saturates the clay floor so it dries more slowly than the walls, and that causes cracking.

  Squeeze out the water from the sponge stick. Hold the tool in either hand, and brace the elbow of that arm on your thigh. (You may want to brace your tool hand with your free hand.) With the wheel turning, gently insert the sponge into the pot, going all the way to the center of the floor **(1)**. Gradually move the sponge across the floor, from the center to the wall. You may need to wring out the sponge and repeat the process several times. Look inside the pot to be sure you've removed all of the water.

**1** : Guide tool carefully into pot

**BEVEL THE BASE**

After collaring and pulling your cylinder, bevel its base with your throwing stick. Beveling provides an undercut for the cutoff wire to slide under. It's a good habit to get into, as it makes thumbing off pots easier (see Thumbing Off, this page).

  Using your right hand, hold the throwing stick as you would a pencil, with its sharp point down and the angled edge facing up, as shown in photo **1**. Keep the tool at a low angle, and brace its top edge with the middle finger of your left hand. While the wheel turns at a moderately high speed, brace your right wrist on the splash pan. Cut in with the beveled end of the throwing stick to create a bevel in the pot.

**1** : Bevel base with throwing stick

**RIB THE EXTERIOR WALL**

Ribbing serves several purposes. It defines the profile of the form, removes the muddy clay slurry, or slip, from the outside wall of the pot, and makes it easier to lift the pot off the wheel head. The ideal style of rib for the cylinder shape is the straight-edged throwing stick.

  First, wet the tool, so it doesn't drag on the clay. Grasp the tool at its middle with your right hand. With the fingers of your left hand bracing the right hand near its thumb, hold the tool edge vertically—but also at an angle—against the spinning cylinder **(1)**. The angled end of the throwing stick should be pointing up. Use just the edge of the tool to gently scrape slip from the cylinder's surface. Pull the tool away slowly and then clean it off in the water bucket.

**1** : Control tool's point of contact

  Returning the tool to the side of the cylinder, put your left hand's fingers inside the pot **(2)**. Starting from the cylinder floor, use your fingertips to gently push the interior wall as you angle the tool against the pot's wall. Keep your inside fingers poised opposite the tool's edge as they both gradually ascend the cylinder wall **(3)**. Raise the tool only when your inside fingers have come nearly level with the top of the tool. Be careful not to push outward too much, or you'll deform the cylinder. When the ribbing is done, remove your hand and the tool—slowly!

**2** : Support interior wall with left hand

**3** : Keep fingers and tool steady

**FINISH THE LIP**

Using the chamois leather lends a clean, rounded lip to your cylinder. If you intend to glaze the vessel, you'll find that the glaze fits a rounded lip differently than it does a sharp or a squared one. In light of this, if you intend to drink from the pot, a smooth finish is best.

  Hold a clean, slippery-wet chamois leather so that it's perpendicular to the lip of your pot, at about four o'clock **(1)**. With the wheel spinning at moderate speed, slowly lower the chamois leather onto the lip.

**1** : Bring chamois to lip

  Fold the chamois leather over the lip and hold it there, just along the top outer edge, with your left thumb. The fingers of your left hand should be just inside the mouth but not touching it. Keep the fingers of your right hand just below the elevation of the lip **(2)**. Hold the leather and your fingers in this position until the lip is smooth and rounded. Remove the chamois slowly. Clean it and return it to the edge of the water bucket.

**2** : Use chamois for smoothing

**cutting an uneven lip**

An uneven lip can happen sometimes. Here are the most common reasons why:

• If the clay went off center at any time during the throwing process

• If your fingers dragged because the pot wasn't kept wet enough

• If you used inconsistent pressure during a pull

To repair the damage, get the wheel turning at a moderate speed and hold the needle tool in your right hand. Let your left index and middle fingers glide smoothly inside the lip of the pot. Using your left thumb to brace across to your right hand, inscribe a fine line on the exterior surface, just below the lip. Gradually let the needle cut into the wall as the pot makes many rotations **(1)**.

**1** : Cut into wall with needle

When the tip of the needle touches your left index finger, hold the needle steady and level. Let the pot rotate at least once or twice before gently but quickly lifting the loose clay ring free of the pot **(2)**. Use the chamois to smooth the lip.

**2** : Be prepared to lift quickly

**removing air bubbles**

Occasionally you'll find an air bubble in the wall of your pot. With the wheel stopped, use your needle tool to puncture or slice it **(1)**. Squeeze the air bubble out of the wall with the index finger and thumb of your left hand, starting at one edge of the puncture (not the center). Slide your fingers toward the hole, pinching gently as you go. Smooth over the puncture **(2)**.

**1** : Puncture bubble with needle tool

**2** : Squeeze bubble out and smooth

**REMOVE THE POT**

Finally, the cylinder is finished. It's ready to be cut from the wheel head and moved to a place where it can dry slowly. You might choose to add an appendage or perhaps alter its form at a later time; if so, the pot should be kept damp until it's firmed up enough. For tips on how to control the drying rate with plastic, see this page.

  Before cutting under the pot, clean off the slip from the wheel head. Do this with a sponge, while the wheel is turning. Make sure most of the slip is removed. (If slip is drawn under the pot while you cut it off the wheel head, the pot is harder to release.)

  Have the wheel head revolving slowly. Grasp the central section of the wire cutoff tool with your index fingers and thumbs, as shown in photo **1**. Keep the central portion of the wire taut as you stretch it tightly against the wheel head. Press down on the wire with your thumbs. Smoothly push the wire away from you, under the cylinder, keeping it as taut as possible so it doesn't cut up through the floor of your pot **(2)**.

**1** : Keep wire's center section taut

**2** : Move wire away from you

  Dry off your hands on a towel **(3)**. Cup your dry hands lightly but firmly around the cylinder, taking care not to squeeze it out of shape. First, lift the base of the pot opposite you, then lift it toward you, allowing air to get in under the pot to help it release **(4)**. Place the pot on a board, where it can be covered with thin plastic. If the pot was misshapen by the move, restore its form by giving the pot a gentle tap and joggle at its base.

**3** : Only lift pots with dry hands

**4** : Lift far edge of pot first

  If you plan to continue working, don't moisten the wheel head! The thin pad of clay left from the previous piece is perfect for gripping the next ball of clay **(5)**.

**5** : Center next ball onto thin clay pad

**cross-section of a cylinder**

Cutting down through the center of a pot gives a cross-sectioned view of its wall and interior. Being able to actually see how the clay is distributed from the floor to the lip can help you recognize what you're doing right, as well as what you need to correct and keep practicing. Cutting pots helps you learn how to pull more evenly and shows clearly the thickness of the floor.

To create your own cross-sections, use a wire tool to cut through a cylinder at any of the stages shown in the photos here, and compare your work to mine.

  Throw the lump of clay at the center of the wheel head. Wet your hands and the clay and center the lump, bracing on the wheel tray for support. Use both hands to create a cone shape **(1)**.

**1** : Coning up

  Use the heel (or thumb) of your left hand to center down, pushing the clay down into itself. Support the spinning clay lump on the right side **(2)**.

**2** : Centering down

  Define the base with the thumb of the right hand to bevel the clay at the wheel head **(3)**.

**3** : Beveling base

  Open the form with your thumb and the supporting fingers of your left hand **(4)**.

**4** : Opening clay

  Measure the base thickness with your needle tool. It should be ¼ inch (6mm) deep **(5)**.

**5** : Checking floor's depth

  Open out the base, to form the floor. Apply some even downward pressure as you spread the floor. At this stage, the overall base width should be 1 inch (2.5cm) greater than the desired width of the finished cylinder **(6)**.

**6** : Create an even floor

  Collar the wall of the pot, so the overall shape becomes more conical **(7)**.

**7** : Collaring

  Push in at the base with the fingers of your right hand, to create a groove there that you'll use as a lifting point **(8)**.

**8** : Establishing groove in base

  Position your inside fingers at a level just above the outside ones. Your thumbs should meet **(9)**.

**9** : First pull with braced thumbs

  Lift the clay, carrying the bulging collar steadily upward. Your thumbs should still be firmly braced, to steady both hands **(10)**.

**10** : Second pull

  Compress the lip between the finger and thumb of your left hand and index finger of the right hand **(11)**.

**11** : Compressing lip

  Use the chamois leather to smooth the lip. Don't use downward pressure; be gentle **(12)**.

**12** : Smoothing lip

From left to right: coned up, centered down, compressed base, intial opening, opened floor, collared, first pull, second pull

**CONCAVE CYLINDER**

You should be able to competently throw a basic cylinder before you attempt to make a shapely vase or a bellied cider jug. A concave cylinder is a pot with a wide rim and a narrow waist. Before you start to throw, give some thought to what you want the pot's proportions to be (for example, how wide you want the rim to be in relation to the base and where the narrowest part of its waist will be positioned).

  Cone and center the clay. Using your right thumb and bracing with your left hand, define the base's width and tidy it up before you open it. Open the clay lump and create a floor depth of ¼ inch (6mm).

  Spread the floor of the clay lump so that it becomes 1 inch (2.5cm) wider than its original width. Collar the lip of the pot, so its rim is narrower than its base.

  Make two pulls, so that the wall and floor have the same thickness. Make the form concave by applying greater pressure with the outside fingers and less outward pressure from the left hand.

  Halfway up the third pull, gradually switch the source of your pressure **(1)**. This change in pressure, plus holding the fingers of your right hand (outside the pot) at a level below your left ones (inside the pot), ensures a concave shape **(2)**.

**1** : Use inward pressure to halfway point

**2** : Begin forming concave shape

  By now you've established the basic foundation of a cylinder. The next step is to narrow the waist more assertively. With the wheel turning moderately slow, position your hands as near to the base as possible, making light contact with the six fingers as shown in photo **3**. Exert increasing pressure with your fingers as you slowly bring them up **(4)**.

**3** : Fingers used for six-point collaring

**4** : Six-point collaring technique in action

  When you reach the halfway point, gradually lessen your pressure **(5)**. Keep your eye on the pot's profile and use your fingers to adjust the proportions of the form. When you are satisfied with the rim, let the wheel make several revolutions before slowly releasing your fingers from the clay **(6)**. Finish and remove the pot as shown in the basic cylinder instructions on this page.

**5** : Use light pressure after halfway point

**6** : Adjust form as desired before releasing

**throwing with a mirror**

In the same way you might use your rearview mirror to back into a parking space, a mirror can be a great tool for a potter. If it's positioned correctly on the splash pan's edge, a mirror can give you immediate information about the form from a whole new angle while you're bending over it.

  Position and secure a clean mirror to the edge of your wheel's splash pan with ½ pound (0.23kg) of clay, rolled into a thick coil that is nearly the width of the mirror.

  Position the mirror at 11 o'clock from your seat **(1)**. Wad the coil over the edge, packing it tight. Embed the base of the mirror into the clay. Lean it back until you have a good view of an open form on your wheel head, and even underneath it when you bend over **(2)**. Lean the mirror back a bit, so you can see the profile of the pot even when you're sitting upright.

**1** : Position mirror at 11 o'clock

**2** : Mirror reflects underside of far wall

**CONVEX CYLINDER**

When I make a bellied cylinder, I use a slower wheel speed throughout much of the process. It helps me control the outward force and thus more easily maintain the overall curve that I want. I'm also careful not to use too much water, which can saturate and weaken the clay.

  Center the clay as you would for a cylinder. To open the clay lump and make a flat floor, follow the initial steps shown for a making a cylinder: "break in" and push down to the base, making the floor ¼ inch (6mm) thick, then widen it to 4½ inches (11cm).

  Make your pulls and collar the form just as you would for any cylinder. At the end of the second pull, the mouth of the cylinder should be narrower than its base.

  During your third pull, you'll make the pot develop a slightly convex shape. Form a triangular shape with your hands, thumbs bracing each other. While your right middle finger does the pulling on the exterior, all four fingers of your left hand should be positioned inside, with your middle finger doing the pulling. Be sure to brace your right arm on the splash pan while you pull **(1)**.

**1** : Brace right arm on splash pan during pull

  Maintain your hands' triangular position throughout this pull, but change the amount and direction of pressure as the pull develops. From the base up to the midway point, apply increasing pressure with your left middle finger **(2)**.

**2** : Apply outward pressure from base to midpoint

  Then, from the midway point up to the lip, your right middle finger should apply increasing pressure inward. Now the convex form has the start of a shoulder **(3)**.

**3** : Shift to inward pressure at midpoint

  Collar only the top half of the form **(4)**. At this point you may want to compress the lip, too.

**4** : Collar and, optionally, compress

  Make another pull to expand the form and create greater volume. Start at the base and move upward to the midway point. Keep your fingers in the same position and let them work together to gradually stretch the wall **(5)**. A cross-section view shows the relationship between both hands **(6)**.

**5** : Increase volume in fourth pull

**6** : Cross-section of fourth pull

  In the final stages, make the form symmetrical **(7)**. Keep your head low so you can keep an eye on the overall shape of the pot. A mirror can be helpful at this stage (see this page for more about how to set one up).

**7** : Start narrowing at midpoint

  Clean the surface of the pot and finish the form with the throwing stick, adjusting the angle at which you hold it so that it follows the form's outer surface **(8)**. Don't press so hard that it becomes misshapen.

**8** : Remove slip with throwing stick

  Clean the slip from the tool, then use its sharp point to bevel the base of the pot (see this page, Bevel the Base). Use your wire tool to cut the pot from the wheel.

A freshly thrown tankard

**cylinder variations**

Now that you know how to make a basic cylinder, a world of cylindrical pottery shapes are opened up to you. To fully appreciate the versatility of the cylinder, let's do an experiment. Go to your cupboard, or peruse a home-wares catalog, and look at the variety of pots before you. If you were to strip away all of the handles, lids, and spouts, you'll find the cylinder in nearly all of them. In this section, I'll walk you through how to make some of the most common cylindrical vessels: tankards, tea bowls, pitchers, and bottles.

Adding a pouring lip to a pitcher;

**TANKARD**

A tankard is a generously sized drinking vessel with a strap handle and a rim that's shaped for the lips. In the heart of South Somerset, England, at The Wyndham Arms in Kingsbury Episcopi, near where my brother John Leach's Muchelney Pottery is located, local pubgoers find their personal tankards hanging from hooks when they arrive. Upon entering the pub the barkeep might be heard to say, "The usual, Bill?"

Before throwing your first tankard, consider its form. The traditional tankard has a base that's wider than the mouth, which serves two purposes. The first is sturdiness. A wider base provides greater stability and therefore fewer spills. The second is durability. When being stowed away in a cupboard, a broad base makes it more difficult to chip or crack the rim. As it's shelved, the base of the tankard, not its lip, gets bumped first.

The traditional tankard has a collar just below its rim. This collar, like the broad base, also serves two purposes: one aesthetic and the other utilitarian. The protruding line of the collar suggests a bold horizontal location onto which the handle can be attached. This forms the basis of a visual logic. The second, and more functional, purpose is that the curve created by the collar provides a comfortable resting place for your lower lip while drinking.

  After centering 1 pound (0.5kg) of clay, opening, establishing a flat floor, and making a first pull, you'll make a second pull, creating a conical shape as you lift. The result will be a cylinder with a mouth that's much narrower than the base. Compress and level the lip **(1)**.

**1** : Compress lip after first pull

  In the third pull, use your left middle finger to push outward from the floor, to create a bulge. With the middle finger of your right hand just below the bulge, follow your left fingers as you raise both hands upward. Apply more inward pressure with your right middle finger so the form is maintained **(2)**.

**2** : Pull with pressure from outside fingers

  Continue pulling to a point just below the lip, which will be the start of the tankard's collar **(3)**. Apply pressure between the lip and the horizontal line with your right index finger, as if you are pointing. Use your left middle finger to push the lip outward and over your right finger, to create a curved collar. Use your left thumb to brace your right hand **(4)**.

**3** : Start of collar

**4** : Initial shaping of lip

  Make one last pull, using the middle fingers of both hands; support them by forming a triangular brace with both thumbs. Push outward more with your left finger, at the lower section of the pot, in order to create a generous shape. At this point, most of your left hand ought to be inside the pot **(5)**.

**5** : Apply pressure from inside

  As you pull upward, gradually apply more pressure inward, to accentuate the curved form. Complete the pull once you've reached the protruding collar line. Pause there, and release your hands from the clay slowly **(6)**.

**6** : Release at base of collar

  Holding the throwing stick in your right hand like a pencil, point down, brace your hand with your left index finger **(7)**. With the wheel turning at a moderate speed, gradually undercut the base of the pot where it meets the bat. Clean the clay off the tip of the stick.

**7** : Bevel base with throwing stick

  Adjust the position of the throwing stick so its end is upright; hold it angled away from you a little. Brace with your left index and middle fingers. Slowly and gently remove the slip from the surface of the pot as it turns **(8)**. Make any further modest adjustments to the form's profile by using the throwing stick against the side of the pot.

**8** : Clean slip from wall

  With the wheel still turning, carefully remove water from the floor of the pot **(9)**.

**9** : Remove water with sponge stick

  Apply the final shape to the collar. Lightly compress the lip.

  Hold the chamois leather between the fingers of both hands. Gently drape it over the lip, taking care to smooth and compress the clay **(10)**.

**10** : Compress lip

  Clean any slip off the bat. With the wheel slowly rotating and starting on the side nearest you, hold your wire cutoff tool with both hands, pull it taut against the bat, and cut under the pot **(11)**.

**11** : Cut pot off bat

  Dry your hands on your towel and then cup them, lightly, around the tankard. Lift the pot from one side first, picking it up at an angle. If you misshape the pot when lifting, reshape it by gently joggling it in at the base, not the lip. Leave the small pad of clay on the bat for the next pot. Don't moisten it; it'll be sticky enough as is **(12)**.

**12** : Lift gently at an angle

A demonstration of how to add a tankard handle may be found in chapter 4, this page.

**TEA BOWL**

There's something about the rhythmic, contemplative nature of making tea bowls, or _yunomi_ , that I find satisfying. This type of tea bowl has an individuality about it, and both the form itself and my treadle wheel allow me to achieve a kind of freedom of expression. How is that loose, individual quality achieved? One of the things I do is to slow my wheel. A fast-spinning wheel makes it difficult to impart a lot of feeling into the work. That is one of the reasons I like working on a treadle wheel. I can better feel the clay flow through my fingers, allowing me to have more control over the speed, and to breathe character into the pot. When I let the pot grow out of the wheel head, nature calls it upward to the sky.

Because the tea bowl is modest in shape and size, it becomes the ideal canvas for learning how to rib the shape and the surface. I'll walk you through that process here. When picking the clay to make your tea bowl, note that stoneware insulates against hot tea better than porcelain does.

  After you've centered ¾ pound (0.34kg) of clay, form a low disk shape with the edge of your left hand. Brace your left hand over your right **(1)**.

**1** : Compress cone into clay disk

  Open the clay with your right thumb and left index finger **(2)**. If you want your tea bowl to have a generous foot, don't open it too deeply. Leave ½ inch (13mm) of clay in the floor to allow for trimming later. Compress the floor.

**2** : Open disk

  Use the middle fingers of your left hand and the lower part of your right palm to both introduce a continuous curved shape from the floor to the wall and make the first pull. Brace your left index finger on your right hand **(3)**. (Before this and subsequent pulls, don't forget to wet the interior and exterior of the form by sponging water onto your knuckles, with the index and middle fingers straddling the wall.)

**3** : Start first pull

  Create the form's underbelly as you begin the second pull. Use the middle finger of your right hand, positioned parallel to the wheel head, to apply direct pressure to the exterior of the form. Back this up with your left middle finger inside the wall **(4)**. Bring your hands up slowly.

**4** : Second pull

  During the third pull, your left middle finger (on the inside), thumb bracing the right hand, and right middle finger on the outside all work together to shape and pull. Note the triangular relationship between the hands **(5)**. Remove water from the floor with your sponge stick before starting the next phase.

**5** : Third pull

  Beginning at the bottom of the tea bowl, use the forward edge of your throwing stick to remove slip and smooth, or clarify, the surface and shape **(6)**.

**6** : Clarify surface with flat side of throwing stick

  Continue bringing the tool up the wall. Be sure to use your left middle finger inside the tea bowl as a support against the pressure of the tool. Try slowing the wheel and moving the tool casually, or somewhat quickly, up the wall. This creates spiraling, relaxed planes that illustrate the movement of the wheel **(7)**.

**7** : Leave spiraling lines if desired

  Use the cutting edge of the throwing stick to articulate the wall of the underbelly, down to the base of the pot. Brace your right hand with both the splash pan and your left index finger **(8)**. Carefully smooth and compress the lip with your chamois; a few rotations should do. Remove the tea bowl by cutting under its base with your wire tool.

**8** : Define base with point of throwing stick

**PITCHER**

Stable and sturdy, a pitcher is such a useful thing to make. There are many uses for one, large or small, from pouring water or cream to smothering pancakes with maple syrup. It can also double up as a vase for flowers. This pitcher is essentially a variation on the basic cylinder.

In these steps, I'll walk you through how to make a small, simple version of this familiar form.

  Secure 3 pounds (1.4kg) of clay to the wheel head. Center it with the "cone up, center down" technique, and open the floor. Create a cylinder with two pulls, using the techniques shown on this page.

  For the third pull, first get the bulge in the wall again. By now, the cylinder may be too tall for you to brace your hands together, so begin with your right hand firmly braced against the splash pan. Your left arm should be in a more vertical position, with the elbow aligned as directly over the center of the pot as possible **(1)**. After completing the third pull, collar the form again.

**1** : Third pull in progress

  Splay the thin lip outward by slowly folding it over your right index finger, just below the lip, as if pointing. Use your left middle finger on the inside of the lip to slowly stretch it outward over the right index finger, so that the clay rolls downward **(2)**.

**2** : Splay lip

  Using the tip of your right index finger, curl the lip down until it touches the exterior wall. Your left thumb should brace the right finger, as shown in photo **3**.

**3** : Curl splayed lip down against wall

  Bend your right index finger, knuckle down and tip upward, so that your fingernail neatly seals the lip to the exterior wall **(4)**.

**4** : Seal lip against wall with fingernail

  To do the final collaring, use the six-point technique. Encircle the form with the thumbs, middle knuckles, and index fingers of both hands **(5)**. Take care to bring your hands up slowly so that you maintain the form's shape and center. Pause near the lip before slowly releasing contact with the clay.

**5** : Use six-point collar technique

  Remove any water in the pot, clean the bat, and trim the base of the pot, as shown on this page.

  Stop the wheel. To make the spout, you'll work at the three o'clock position on the pot. Span your left thumb and index finger across 3 inches (8cm) of lip, as shown in photo **6**. Make sure your right finger is wet.

**6** : Fashion spout at lip

  Gently and consistently, slide your right index finger back and forth along the lip to stretch it outward. A good-pouring lip is created with many back and forth movements done quickly yet delicately. Your left fingers hold the lip steady and protect the overall shape of the pot's mouth from the outward movements of your right index finger.

  The finished pouring lip, shown in photo **7** , should be thinner and sharper than the rest of the pot's lip. A thin, sharp lip is the key to a good-pouring pitcher.

**7** : View of pitcher with rolled rim

  Before you remove the pitcher from the bat, cut a piece of newsprint paper 8 x 8 inches (20 x 20cm) square. Lay it over the mouth of the pot. Use the tip of your right index finger to gently press the paper along the top edge of the lip **(8)**. This helps maintain the shape of the pot after cutting it off the wheel and moving it to a ware board.

**8** : Lightly press paper to moist rim

  When you remove the pitcher from the bat, be sure to lift the farthest edge first, tipping it toward you, then lift the entire pot up. Place the pitcher on a ware board and remove the paper. Let the pot firm up a bit, then cover it with plastic so it can dry slowly to the leather-hard state. Then you'll be ready to thumb off the pot (this page) and attach a handle to it (this page).

**BOTTLE**

Whether it's a bottle with a long, graceful neck or a bellied jug, a bottle's form should show an understanding of its purpose. There are infinite possibilities for potters to invent their own interpretations. Before you make your bottle, ask yourself some questions. What will it contain? What function will it perform? A bottle that serves as a vase for long-stemmed roses will most likely have a different shape and scale than one meant to pour vinaigrette on your salad. Answers to these questions tell you how big it should be, what kind of surface it should have, and whether or not you'll want to add appendages.

  For a small bottle, center 1 pound (0.5kg) of clay on the wheel. Open the centered ball until the floor is ¼ inch (6mm) thick.

  Create a cylinder, using the techniques shown on this page. At the end of the second pull, the mouth should be narrower than the base **(1)**.

**1** : Mouth is narrower than base after second pull

  Collar the form so that it gradually narrows toward the lip as your hands rise **(2)**. Once you've made a narrow neck, removing water can be challenging, but remember, the floor will crack if water is left standing in it while it dries, so use your sponge to remove the water from the floor now rather than later.

**2** : Use six-point technique to collar neck

  To collar the neck of a bottle, position your fingers as shown in photo **3**. Make contact with both index fingers and thumbs, keeping your other fingers out of the way.

**3** : Start halfway up

  Begin the collaring process two-thirds of the way up the form. With the wheel turning slowly, gradually collar inward and upward, until you've formed a neck **(4)**.

**4** : Keep steady pressure while collaring neck

  Now, starting at the shoulder you've established, narrow the neck as much as your eye tells you is appropriate. Gradually release your pressure on the neck to establish the flared mouth **(5)**.

**5** : Adjust hands but maintain points of contact

  To create a straight collar and a wider mouth above the neck, push inward with your right middle finger while your left middle finger pushes gently outward, above it. Pull upward to create a vertical neck **(6)**.

**6** : Establish collar near top of neck

  Define the neck with your right index finger while supporting the upper wall with your left index finger and thumb, as shown in photo **7**.

**7** : Define neck with index finger

  Cut the lip of the bottle with the needle tool; the wheel should be spinning moderately fast **(8)**. Support the rim with your left index finger and thumb as you do.

**8** : Cut lip with needle tool

  Compress the lip with your right index finger. Brace your right hand and the pot with your left index finger **(9)**. At this point, you might be finished with the form and can proceed with cleaning and cutting the bottle from the wheel.

**9** : Compress cut lip

  One way to vary the relationship of the neck to the mouth is to flare the bottle's rim. Use your left index finger to slowly stretch the lip out over your right index finger as it supports the neck **(10)**. Let the wheel make numerous revolutions as you work the clay.

**10** : Flaring option for bottle's lip

  Compress and clean the lip with your right index finger. Your left thumb supports and pushes the lip downward to create the radical curve seen here **(11)**.

**11** : Support lip while compressing it

  Hold the throwing stick, point down, in your right hand; brace your right hand with your left. With the wheel spinning moderately fast, use the edge of the tool to remove clay from the lower wall near the base **(12)**. Clean the clay from the tool.

**12** : Remove slurry with stick's angled edge

**dishes**

While cylindrical vessels like bottles and pitchers have a flat floor and vertical sides, many other pots are made low and wide. Bowl shapes, for instance, tend to be open with a continuous curved wall, while plates have a flat bottom with a shallow curve. The dishes that fall into this category range from everyday tableware to special occassion pots, and they play a key role in how we prepare, serve, and eat our foods. In the lessons that follow, you'll learn the skills that set them apart and how to keep in mind the function, as well as the beauty, of the dish.

**SMALL BOWL WITH FOOT**

Once you've tried your hand at a potter's wheel, you are pretty much assured of being able to throw a bowl shape out of your ball of clay. Between the malleable clay, a little centrifugal force, and rudimentary practice, a pint-sized bowl (no matter how misshapen) will result almost naturally. These may not be utilitarian bowls for everyday use, but they will surely be one-of-a-kind and may have a special use (or perhaps no other purpose other than for visual enjoyment).

There are different ways to throw and shape a small bowl: using your fingertips to form the shape, or using a flexible rib instead. Use whichever method suits you. It's best to start small, and put your fingertips to use. To give a curved bowl a footed, or pedestal, bottom, you'll want to make its base and lower wall thicker than you would for a cylinder. These thicker areas are called support clay; they support the bowl's wall as it flares open. Later, you'll trim the leather-hard support clay to further shape your bowl.

  Cup your right hand around a 1-pound (0.5kg) ball of clay, with your thumb on top. Cup your left hand around your right. Use the coning up, centering down technique to center the clay.

  To open, cup your right hand around the thick, round doorknob-like shape. Using your right thumb and left index finger pressed tightly together, push them slowly down in the center. At the same time, maintain some pressure at the base with your right small finger and the side of your hand **(1)**.

**1** : Break into centered clay

  Open upward and outward to shape the interior by using your right thumb and the last three fingers of your left hand. The left index finger braces your right hand. This technique allows a curved bottom to take shape. Always complete this maneuver slowly, while the wheel makes many revolutions **(2)**.

**2** : Open clay into a curved floor

  Once you've reached the lip, pause then release your fingers gradually **(3)**.

**3** : First pull

  On the second and third pulls, your finger positions should change. Use the two middle fingertips of both hands, with the right fingertip below the level of the left fingertip. The left middle finger starts in the center of the bowl. Brace your right thumb on your left **(4)**. Moderate the pace and pressure of your pull with the wheel speed.

**4** : Change how you brace hands during second pull

  Halfway up, add a little more pressure toward the wall with your right fingertips, so that the form curves inward. Pause at the lip, letting the wheel spin numerous revolutions, then slowly release your hands from the pot **(5)**.

**5** : Use enough pressure to bring wall in a bit

  To create a more curved shape, collar the form, as shown in photo **6**.

**6** : Collar after second pull

  To remove throwing rings from the exterior wall, use the throwing stick. Hold the tool in your right hand and place your left fingertips inside the bowl, as if to make a pull. Near the bottom of the bowl, angle the stick away from you. Starting where the floor meets the wall, apply pressure against the stick with your left middle fingertip. Slowly bring your left fingers up as you tip the throwing stick to follow the outside curve **(7)**.

**7** : Rib a curved wall by degrees . . .

  Once you've reached the halfway point, angle the throwing stick toward you as you press out with your left finger, opposite the tool **(8)**. Use the sponge on a stick to carefully remove excess water from the floor of the bowl. Brace your tool hand with your left hand **(9)**. Compress the lip of the bowl with the chamois.

**8** : . . . adjusting angle of throwing stick as you go

**9** : Remove water at end of third pull

  Clean the wheel head with your sponge. As the wheel slowly spins, hold the cutoff wire taut and snugly against the wheel head, cutting under the pot and away from you **(10)**.

**10** : Cut off bat with wire tool

  To remove the pot, hold the index and middle fingers of both hands around the base, and lift the edge furthest from you first **(11)**.

**11** : Lift with upturned hands and outspread fingers

**GENERAL PURPOSE BOWL**

In this demonstration I introduce you to my versatile general purpose (GP) bowl. As an apprentice at my father David Leach's pottery, at Lowerdown, in Devon, England, the GP bowl was one of the first shapes I learned to throw. Made to a gauge—that is, made consistently to the same size—this U-shaped bowl with rolled rim and flat-footed bottom is a good way to develop your skills.

GP bowls are very saleable little items; you can make them in all sizes—big, small, doubled, or tripled side by side (see the Triple Bowl, this page), and even with a pouring lip (to learn how to pull a lip, see this page).

For demonstration purposes, I used 4 pounds (1.8kg) of clay here, but your typical 6½-inch-wide (16.5cm) GP bowl is usually thrown with 1 pound (0.5kg). Each of the bowls thrown for the Triple Bowl was made with about 1 pound (0.5kg) of clay. If you're new to pottery, start smaller.

Before you sit down at the wheel, try to visualize the final form, and maybe even sketch it, too. What will the bowl be used for, and how will that function influence its shape? Even if you're just beginning to make pots, it's always a good idea to ask yourself these sorts of questions; they will help you understand the form better and can also help guide your approach once the wheel is turning.

  You will want to use a bat when throwing any large, open form. Center the clay with the "cone up, center down" technique. To open, use your right thumb and the middle and ring fingers of your left hand. Open slowly, pressing down toward the center bottom. Angle your fingers outward, so the opening is crater-like, rather than a vertical hole **(1)**. That shape allows easier access during the following steps.

**1** : Open so interior wall is curved

  For the first pull, start with the four fingers of your left hand and right thumb inside the clay, in the center of the floor. Only the middle and ring fingers of your right hand are in contact with the outside wall. You want the floor of the pot to be curved, so don't press down with your left fingers as you bring them across the floor to meet your right hand **(2)**. When your left hand reaches the wall and is opposite your right hand, gradually raise both hands. Brace your left fingers with your right thumb **(3)**. Make the pull. When you reach the lip, pause for a second, and then slowly release your hands from the pot.

**2** : Maintain curved interior wall during first pull

**3** : First pull

  Make the second pull in the same way as the first **(4)**. As you reach the upper portion of the wall, gradually apply more pressure inward with your right fingers, to keep the mouth of the pot from spreading out too far **(5)**.

**4** : Second pull

**5** : Control degree of spread at mouth in second pull

  At the start of the third pull, create a groove at the outer base of the pot with your right fingers. Your left thumb reaches down to support your right fingers **(6)**. Continue pulling up, applying subtle pressure to the clay between your left and right middle fingers. Your right thumb braces across to the base of your left thumb **(7)**.

**6** : Establish groove to start third pull

**7** : Brace throughout the pull

  Collar the mouth of the pot so the wall doesn't spread out too far. Use both hands cupped around the rim, thumbs pointing up **(8)**. Always release your hands from the pot slowly.

**8** : Collaring controls spread of mouth

  At the start of the fourth pull, reestablish the groove in the base. With this pull remember that, as before, you are not to thin the floor, only the wall above it **(9)**.

**9** : Fourth pull refines overall profile

  Pause just before reaching the lip, so as to leave it a bit generous. Release your hands slowly **(10)**. Squeeze water out of the sponge between the index and middle fingers of your left hand; let the water run off the fingers **(11)**. Compress the lip. Don't ever use so much water that a puddle forms in the floor.

**10** : Leave a thicker lip

**11** : Add water as you compress lip

  For the final pull, make the groove at the base again. Press the tips of both thumbs together to steady the fingertips of both hands as you make the pull. Pull the clay up, steadily and gently **(12)**. Make sure your right arm is braced because your left arm is vertical and has no support. Photo **13** shows the wall's thickness and how the hands interact with the clay and with each other. As you reach the lip, pause and slowly release **(14)**.

**12** : Fifth pull, steady as you go

**13** : Wall shouldn't be too thick

**14** : Compressing lip at end of fifth pull

  Now you'll make a strong, rolled lip. Point your right index finger just below the outer lip of the spinning bowl. Place your left middle finger on the inside, just opposite the right index finger. Brace your hands with your left thumb **(15)**. With the pot turning moderately fast, use your left index finger to gradually pull the lip out and over your right index finger **(16)**. Fold the lip over until it makes contact with the outside wall. You may want to bring your left index finger into play **(17)**.

**15** : Start the rolled lip

**16** : Pull lip out over index finger

**17** : Roll lip over index finger

  After the lip is in contact with the entire wall, use your right index fingertip to seal the lip to the bowl **(18)**.

**18** : Seal lip with fingernail

  Holding your throwing stick like a pencil, position it with the sharp point down at the base. Slowly trim the base of the bowl where it meets the bat **(19)**. Now you'll use one edge of the stick's side to shape the pot and remove the throwing rings. Place the tool's long edge gently against the bowl's outer wall and, holding it in one place, start the inside pressure with your left middle finger, where you know it will be low relative to the tool's edge. Don't press the tool against your fingers; press your fingers against the steady tool. Come up the wall gradually with your left hand (keeping the tool steadily in the same place the whole time); the left middle finger is always positioned opposite the tool's edge. Keep your right hand steadied on the splash pan and your left thumb braced on your right hand, as shown in photo **20**.

**19** : Bevel and tidy base

**20** : Angle tool away from you as you rib

  After you have removed the throwing rings and given the bowl a consistent shape, hold the tool's 45-degree end with its sharp point down, as shown **(21)**. Finish tidying the rings and shape by slowly ribbing up to just below the lip, using your left fingers in the same way as before.

**21** : Finish ribbing just under lip

  Using your sponge, remove water from the interior. Smooth the lip with a chamois. Cut the pot from the bat, then remove both bat and pot from the wheel head, gently lifting the bat from one side first.

**larger bowls**

Throwing a large bowl is a different experience than throwing a smaller one. Since there's more clay, your muscles are used more vigorously in the process. Strength may be helpful but throwing large forms is more dependent on good technique than on brawn. From the start of centering to the final cutting-off, be sure you brace your arms so that they, in turn, can provide rigid support for the hands. Use the splash pan on your wheel, your legs, and your hip area for solid bracing. A finished large form might be easily warped if you were to pick it up in your hands after cutting it from the wheel head. Use a bat so when you've cut the completed pot from the bat, you can pick up the bat instead of the pot, and move it off the wheel that way.

**DINNER PLATE**

Let's have a go at making some plates. I like to make mine slightly bowl-shaped on the inside, rather than flat, because I like to dip a bit of bread and soak up the juice of whatever it is I am eating.

  Throw a 3½-pound (1.6kg) mound of clay into the center of the wheel head. Wet your hands and the clay. With the wheel turning moderately fast, cone up and center down the clay. Create a large, thick disk by pressing down on the centered clay with your left palm **(1)**. Your right hand keeps the clay centered.

**1** : Center down

  Slowly spread the disk, and then open it **(2)** to a depth of ¾ inch (1.9cm). Slowly and evenly spread the floor outward, in a slightly curved shape, up into the wall **(3, 4)**.

**2** : Open up

**3** : Establish floor

**4** : Make curve where rim will start

  Once you've reached the lip, let your left hand travel back to the center, applying light downward pressure so as to compress the floor. Repeat the opening process several times, until the plate has reached the desired width **(5)**.

**5** : Opening floor takes several passes

  Before forming the rim, wet the wall and your fingers with the sponge. Now, gently refine the curve of the wall using your left middle finger. Use your right thumb to brace the position of your left hand **(6)**.

**6** : Refine wall's curve

  Use your right thumb to create the rim, supporting it underneath with your index finger. Emphasize the area where the wall meets the rim by pointing your left middle finger into that breakpoint **(7)**. Be sure to brace your right arm on your leg or the splash pan—or both.

**7** : Develop rim

  Gradually turn the rim down, flattening and widening it with pressure from your right thumb and index finger. Maintain the curve and the breakpoint with your left fingers **(8)**.

**8** : Turn rim with braced hands

  To refine the curved interior and give it its final shape, use a resin rib **(9)**.

**9** : Use a rib to refine interior of final form

  Support the plate's rim with your open left hand. Work the curved side of the rib from the center to the left edge, using light pressure as you go **(10)**. When you reach the breakpoint between the wall and the rim, gradually lighten the rib's pressure **(11)**. Clean the rib and repeat the refining process if necessary. Use the flat edge of the rib to flatten the rim still more if you like.

**10** : Use curved edge of rib and work from center out

**11** : Smooth curve to edge

  When finished, use a chamois leather to smooth the lip **(12)**. Create a bevel at the base of the plate with your throwing stick **(13)**. You may dry the plate on the bat until it's ready to trim, but cut underneath it first so it won't crack. Hold the wire taut to make the cut, as shown in photo **14**. Lift the bat from one side first **(15)**.

**12** : Smooth rim with chamois

**13** : Bevel the base

**14** : Cut plate from bat . . .

**15** : . . . but leave on bat until plate firms up

**throwing a bat pad**

Most wheel heads have a pair of bat pins that you can fix a bat onto. If you have a wheel head that doesn't use pins, then you can throw a pad of clay, or bat pad, onto it instead. This pad of moist clay will hold a bat firmly on the wheel head.

  For a 12-inch (30.5cm) bat pad, use 2 pounds (1kg) of kneaded clay. Center the clay, just as you would to make a pot. To open, cup your right hand around the clay and maintain downward and inward pressure throughout the process. Open the clay until the floor is ½ inch (1.3cm) thick. Keeping your arms braced on your thighs, spread the clay evenly across the wheel head **(1)**.

**1** : Spread clay across wheel head

  Once the clay disk is the right diameter, compress the outer edge with your right thumb, bracing it with your left fingers, as shown in photo **2**. This compression creates a slightly raised edge, which will create suction and holding power.

**2** : Compress clay's edge

  Clean the excess clay off the wheel head. While the wheel is turning, use your trimming tool to carve two evenly spaced grooves into the clay disk **(3)**.

**3** : Carve grooves with trimming tool

  Carve an X into the disk with a spatula knife, which will make it easier to remove the bat later **(4)**. Set a bat onto the pad, and hold it down with your left hand. With the wheel turning slowly, hold your finger at one point very close to the bat's edge, to gauge how well the bat is centered. Push the side of the bat to adjust its position, if needed **(5)**.

**4** : Carve an X with spatula

**5** : Center bat on clay pad

  Stop the wheel and press down on the bat, securing it to the wheel head. Recheck that the bat is both level and centered relative to the wheel head's axis **(6)**.

**6** : With wheel turning, check level

  Once the bat is centered and level, stop the wheel again. Secure the bat to the wheel head with a couple of quick hits to the center with your palm.

  When it's time to remove a pot (on its bat) from the wheel, place the front edge of the spatula under the right edge of the bat and pry the tool until the bat pops free **(7)**.

**7** : Use spatula to break tension

**CASSEROLE**

Supper is ready! Out comes the casserole, two pot holders at its lugs, as it is placed in the center of the table. The upper wall of this robust form is thrown with a ledge-like gallery and then finished with a flared rim. A simple, curved lid can be thrown to sit in the pot's gallery (see this page).

  Cone up and center down 3 to 4 pounds (1.4 to 1.8kg) of clay. Open the clay until the floor is ¼ inch (6mm) thick and the width is 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13cm). At that point it's time to reverse the direction of your left hand, compressing the floor as you go back toward the center **(1)**. Remember to add water as needed.

**1** : Bring hands back to center to compress floor

  After compressing the floor, make a first pull with the middle and ring fingers of both hands **(2)**. Start your second pull by first creating a shallow groove at the base of the pot with your right middle finger **(3)**. Pull upward, slowly, using your left middle fingers on the inside and your right middle fingers on the outside as you begin to give a slight belly to the pot.

**2** : First pull

**3** : Develop belly in third pull

  As you complete each pull, make sure you pause before slowly releasing your hands from the clay. Leave a good amount of clay at the lip so that when you widen the mouth later, there is plenty of clay to provide for a gallery **(4)**.

**4** : Leave a heavier rim

  Collar in **(5)**. During the final pull, further shape the wall as you go **(6)**. Curve the lip, with your left middle finger, out and over your right middle finger **(7)**.

**5** : Collar form

**6** : Final pull

**7** : Curve lip with middle finger during final pull

  With your left thumb pressed against your left index finger, create the gallery. Support the underside of the lip with your right middle finger **(8)**.

**8** : Create gallery where lid will sit

  Compress the lip once more. The right index finger is angled against the left index finger and thumb, which are clasped lightly around the lip. Release slowly once the lip is smooth and round **(9)**.

**9** : Compress lip for last time

  Shape and bevel the base of the casserole with your throwing stick held like a pencil, point down. Support the rounded wall from the inside **(10)**.

**10** : Bevel base with throwing stick

  Remove excess water from the inside, then fold a chamois leather over the lip for a final compression and finish **(11)**. Measure the width of the gallery mouth with calipers before moving your pot off the wheel to a ware board **(12)**. With the wheel spinning slowly, cut underneath the pot, holding the wire taut. (See this page for a demonstration of throwing a lid for the casserole.)

**11** : Finish lip with chamois

**12** : Measure width of gallery with calipers

**TEAPOT WITH FLANGE**

In England, my country of origin, tea is drunk every day in large quantities. To me, a teapot symbolizes togetherness, comfort, relaxation, conversation, and recuperation. In our house, Mum always poured the tea and kept the pot under a cozy, and there was always extra hot water for topping up.

So, what is a good teapot? In my mind, a good teapot achieves both an aesthetic and a functional balance—where all the parts are in harmony with each other, and the pot functions in a practical way.

  Cone up and center down 2½ to 3 pounds (1.1 to 1.4kg) of clay **(1)**. Open the disk with the middle finger of your left hand pressed firmly against your right thumb, and continue pressing down until the floor is ¼ inch (6mm) thick. With the wheel turning moderately fast, open the clay slowly and consistently. Exert slightly more pressure outward with your left fingers than with the right hand. Support the expanding disk with your cupped right hand while you even up the floor.

**1** : Center cone down into a disk

  Once the base is 5 inches (13cm) across, raise the wall up and inward. Compress the floor by using your left middle finger to apply light pressure from the wall to the center **(2)**.

**2** : End of first pull

  Before each subsequent pull, remember to create a groove at the base. Your right middle finger starts in the groove, and your left middle finger is positioned inside, slightly higher than the right. Stabilize your hands as your left spans the lip, as shown in photo **3**.

**3** : Start of second pull

  Apply a bit more pressure from the inside, with your left middle finger, with the wheel turning at moderate speed **(4)**. From overhead, you can see the left thumb is now braced on the knuckle of the right index finger **(5)**.

**4** : Midpoint of second pull

**5** : Left thumb is braced on right index knuckle

  Now, collar the form: cup both hands around the pot near the lip. A curved shoulder begins to take shape **(6)**.

**6** : Collar lip during second pull

  During subsequent pulls, keep your left fingers slightly higher than your right finger. This allows the clay to flow upward through your fingertips **(7)**. After the second or third pull, it's time to expand the pot's interior volume and to refine its shape. Form a triangle with the middle fingers and thumbs of both hands. Position your head low so as to keep an eye on the shape as it develops **(8)**. You might find it helpful to use a mirror (see sidebar, this page).

**7** : Work with clay's natural plasticity

**8** : At midpoint, shift direction of pressure

  As your hands reach the shoulder area, gradually apply a bit more inward pressure with your right fingers. Just below the lip, bring the last bit of wall upward with your left middle finger, thus forming a small flange **(9)**. Use your sponge stick to remove all water from the floor.

**9** : Shape rim into a flange

  To complete the pot's shoulder and narrow its mouth, collar in. Hold your thumbs and middle and index fingers in the six-point position **(10)**.

**10** : Narrow mouth of flange

  Compress the lip with the tip of your right index finger. Support the inside of the lip with your left middle finger **(11)**.

**11** : Compress lip

  To create a more distinctive finishing line at the lip, turn your right index finger so you can lightly impress the clay with your fingernail. Steady the right finger with the left thumb, and support the underside with your left middle finger **(12)**.

**12** : Define flange

  Now it's time to refine the form and narrow its base. Use the angled end of your throwing stick, bracing your arm and both hands as shown in photo **13**. Flip the tool over to bevel the base **(14)**.

**13** : Refine base with angled edge of throwing stick

**14** : Clean area where base meets bat

  Flip the tool around. With its pointed end facing up, use the long side to further refine the surface. With your middle finger inside, gently push the wall against the tool's edge **(15)**. Bring your inside finger up the wall, keeping the tool in one place. Follow the pot's curving wall with the tool **(16)**.

**15** : Refine wall with side of throwing stick

**16** : Use light pressure to smooth shoulder

  With the wheel turning slowly, and the cutoff wire held tautly between both hands and firmly against the wheel head, cut underneath the form while pushing away from you.

  Use your calipers, crossed as shown in photo **17** , to measure the width of the collar at its widest point. Cup your hands around the pot and lift one side before the other to release it from the wheel head **(18)**. Turn to this page for a demonstration on throwing the teapot's cap lid, and see this page for the spout.

**18** : Hold pot under shoulder

**making and using a rounder**

A rounder helps correct a misshapen leather-hard pot if its profile was unintentionally altered when removing it from the wheel or during trimming. The device is typically a wheel-thrown cylinder that is wider at its base than at the mouth (so it can fit into pots of various diameters). You bisque fire it so it won't stick to fresh clay. You may want to throw several different sizes, as the rounder shouldn't be significantly larger or smaller than the pot itself.

  To make one, simply throw a concave cylinder like the one shown in photo **1**. Make the wall slightly thicker than you would for a pot, so it will be more durable. Trim a groove in the base after it's dried a bit, so it will be easier to hold.

**1** : Hollow, cylindrical rounder

  Using a rounder is easy. Gently insert it into the mouth of a warped pot **(2)**. Once contact is made with the pot's lip, hand-turn the rounder in one direction a few times.

**2** : Using the rounder

**TEAPOT SPOUT**

For a spout to pour smoothly, its form must be guided by its function. The potter needs an understanding of how liquid moves from the pot, through its spout, and out. First, the spout must be located at an elevation that will be higher than the level of the liquid inside. Second, the spout's mouth must be smaller than its base (the area that will be attached to the pot). Finally, the pouring edge should be sharp rather than rounded, so it won't dribble.

  Throw the spout taller than seems necessary; you can always cut it shorter later, if need be. Center 7 to 8 ounces (198 to 227g) of clay, with the right hand braced by the left one **(1)**.

**1** : Center small ball of clay for spout

  Open the spout with your left index finger, bracing it with your right thumb. Hold your right index and middle fingers together, to control the outer shape of the clay. Open the clay all the way to the bat or wheel head **(2)**. When the base is 3½ to 4 inches (9 to 10cm) wide, start the pull. With your left index finger inside the spout, apply a bit more pressure inward and upward with your right middle finger **(3)**.

**2** : Open centered disk with just one finger

**3** : First pull of spout

  Every time you reach the lip at the end of a pull, pause before releasing your contact with the clay. Then compress and refine the lip with your right middle or index finger, supporting it with your left thumb and index finger **(4)**.

**4** : Compress spout's lip

  Collar the spout, using the six-point technique (both thumbs, plus the middle and index fingers) as shown in photo **5**. After collaring, keep your left index finger sufficiently wet **(6)**.

**5** : Collar spout's first pull

**6** : Add water before subsequent pulls

  For the next pull, use your right index finger, on the outside, to feel the wall as it thins **(7)**. Finally, pull with the little finger inside, so you can narrow the spout at its tip **(8)**.

**7** : Second pull of spout

**8** : Final pull

  When the spout is the right size and roughly the intended shape, use a wood rib to refine it and to clean off the slurry. Hold the tool in your right hand, point down and at an angle, as shown in photo **9**.

**9** : Refine concave wall with rib

  When you're done, use the throwing stick to clean and bevel the base **(10)**. With the wheel spinning slowly, cut the spout with the wire tool **(11)**. Dry your hands. Tilt the spout to one side before you lift it off the wheel head **(12)**.

**10** : Refine base with throwing stick

**11** : Cut spout from bat

**12** : Use one hand to lift spout from bat

**LIDS**

One style of lid may be thrown as a shallow bowl then trimmed so it can rest in the recessed lip, or gallery, of a pot. Another style is also thrown as a shallow bowl with a broad rim, but also has a perpendicular wall, or flange, that will fit inside the mouth of the pot. This kind of lid's rim extends out over the shoulder of the pot. A cap-style lid, thrown like a short and shallow cylinder, simply fits over the flange lip of its pot. In this section I'll demonstrate all three styles.

**SIMPLE LID FOR A CASSEROLE**

The gallery lid is easy to shape and its curve completes the overall profile of the casserole on this page. For the best fit, make a lid as soon as possible after throwing the pot so both pieces dry at the same time.

Use your calipers to take the measurement of the widest point of the casserole's gallery. If the lid turns out to be a bit too wide, it's easy to trim. There isn't much you can do with a lid that's too small.

  Start with 1 pound (0.5kg) of clay, which includes some for support in the base. Cone up and center down the clay just as you would for a bowl.

  Open the clay until the floor is ½ inch (1.3cm) thick. Compress the lip **(1)**.

**1** : Compress lip after establishing thick floor

  Make the second pull starting from the center, using your left middle fingers. Don't press down too hard in the center as you begin your move outward **(2)**.

**2** : Note bowl-shaped interior during second pull

  As your fingers move outward toward four o'clock, gradually raise the wall **(3)**. After this pull, use your calipers to gauge the width of the lid. Start each pull with your left fingers in the center and index finger bracing your right hand, which is pulling up and out from underneath **(4)**.

**3** : Thinned wall after second pull

**4** : Third pull

  For your last pulls, try bracing your right thumb against your left index as all four fingers make their way out from the center **(5)**.

**5** : Adjust bracing as lid becomes more flattened

  The lip of the lid should be exactly the width of the distance between the two caliper points. If you have correctly measured your pot's gallery (see photo 12, this page), the lid will fit nicely **(6)**.

**6** : Compare lid's width with casserole's width

  Use your throwing stick to trim and bevel under the lid's base. Hold the tool's angled edge facing up, so as not to accidentally alter the shape **(7)**.

**7** : Bevel base with throwing stick held level

  With the wheel spinning slowly, holding the cutoff wire tautly, cut under the lid.

  Lift the lid from one side, to release it from the wheel head. Slide your hands away from each other, to the sides of the form **(8)**.

**8** : Lift lid with fingertips

  Gently lay the lid down on a ware board along with its pot. Release both hands at the same time so as not to inadvertently alter the shape **(9)**. Dry both the lid and its pot until leather-hard before you do any trimming. For more about how to trim this lid, see this page.

**9** : Place on ware board carefully

**FLANGED LID FOR A CASSEROLE**

To accommodate a flanged lid, a pot simply needs an open mouth that doesn't curve outward too much. The flange is a small raised wall you throw near the rim at the lid. In order to accomplish this task, you'll be bringing more clay than usual to that area.

Start with a little more clay (perhaps 20 percent more) for a flanged lid than for the gallery-style one shown on this page. Always try to make a lid at around the same time as the body. Before you start, measure the _interior_ width of the pot's mouth with the calipers.

  Cone up and center down the clay as you normally would, then compress it into a thick disk shape. Open the clay with your left middle fingers, steadied on your right hand, which is cupped around the disk. As you open out and slightly upward, creating a shallow bowl, your right hand keeps the disk from spreading too far, or unevenly **(1)**. Note how thick the rim is.

**1** : Leave thick rim in opened clay disk

  Check the inner diameter of the opened form **(2)**. If the calipers are wider than the rim's interior, you'll want to make another pull. When the lid is wide enough, use the pad of your right index finger to compress and angle the rim **(3)**. This will thicken it a bit.

**2** : Measure lid's inner diameter

**3** : Thicken rim by compressing it

  You'll use the tip of your right index finger to create the flange. Hold your fingertip at the outermost part of the rim, and slowly establish a small wall by pushing your finger to the angled rim **(4)**. Use your left middle finger and thumb to support the interior wall of the flange.

**4** : Create flange with fingertip

  Make the flange stronger by compressing the lip with your right index finger **(5)**. Take a measurement, from the flange rim's outermost edges, with the calipers; the base of the flange must be wider than its rim. Take measurements only at the flange rim, where it will meet the mouth of the pot **(6)**.

**5** : Compress flange with index finger

**6** : Measure flange's outer diameter

  Use your throwing stick to bevel and tidy up the base of the lid **(7)**. Smooth and round the flange lip using your chamois leather **(8)**. With your wheel spinning slowly, cut the lid off the wheel with the wire tool.

**7** : Bevel base with throwing stick held levelly

**8** : Smooth both lip and flange with chamois

  Dry your hands so you can remove the lid from the wheel head. With the fingers of both hands positioned at the base of the lid, lift one side first. Slide and spread your fingers around the base as you lift **(9)**. Move the lid to a ware board, along with its pot. Dry both of them slowly before attempting to do any trimming. For more about how to trim a flanged lid, see this page.

**9** : Lift far edge and slip fingers under base

**CAP LID FOR A TEAPOT**

The short, flange-like lip of my teapot holds a cap-style lid nicely. Throw the lid immediately after the pot, so the shallow, dish-like form will fit its mate properly. Use calipers to ensure that the lid's inner diameter matches the pot's outer one, and take the same approach when you trim them.

  Center a small, ½-pound (0.23kg) ball of clay and form it into a disk that approximates the width of the intended lid **(1)**. Use your calipers to find the measurement. Because the cap lid is thrown upside down, open the clay as you would a typical small cylinder: left middle finger on the inside, pressing out against your right index finger **(2)**.

**1** : Compress ball into disk shape

**2** : After creating floor, pull short wall

  As you form the short wall, occasionally check its interior width with your calipers. The lid must fit over the pot's rim **(3)**.

**3** : Measure inner diameter of lid

  Use the angled edge of your throwing stick to refine the exterior of the lid **(4)**. Bevel underneath the base **(5)**. Use a chamois leather to round and finish the lip, and then remove water from the floor of the lid with the sponge stick.

**4** : Refine wall with angled edge of throwing stick

**5** : Bevel base to start dome shape of cap lid

  Cut the lid off the wheel head and use both hands, close together, to lift one side off the bat first. Then you can lift it up and move it to a nearby board **(6)**.

**6** : Keep hands close together while lifting lid off bat

**CHAPTER 3**

**trimming**

I use a right angle trim tool

**trimming pots**

When you're first learning to throw, you may find it challenging to create a full-bellied, narrow-footed form with ideal wall thickness and clay evenly distributed throughout the wall; your first pots are likely to be rather bottom-heavy and in need of a trimming. Other pots that usually need trimming are bowls and other full-bellied forms, which are usually thrown with thicker walls so they won't slump on the wheel, or later, as they dry. Once the walls have firmed up, you can carve away their heaviness and bring forth a lighter, more balanced form. Similarly, some forms like narrow-footed bowls, teapots, vases, and lids can't be fully realized on the wheel; they all need to be thrown, then trimmed.

The best time to trim is when the pot has dried to the leather-hard stage. At this stage of dryness, you can handle the pot without deforming it. It's firm enough to alter, cut, or add appendages; cool to the touch; and visibly damp. You'll know if the clay you're trimming is too soft if it clumps on the edge of the trim tool; it's too hard when the tool chatters against the clay.

Variety of trimming tools;

Use thumb to finish the simplest pots

**THUMBING OFF**

The thumbing off method is a quick and simple way to finish off the base, or foot, of a leather-hard flat-bottomed pot—one that was thrown more or less exactly as you intend it to stay. If the pot's walls are of a consistent thickness from the base up to its lip, and if the floor and walls are the correct thickness, so that no surplus clay needs to be removed with a tool, then this is a good method to use. The only tools needed are a moist sponge and your fingers.

Place your leather-hard pot upside down in the center of a clean wheel head, on a ware board, or other flat surface. Holding the pot firmly with your left hand, use your right thumb to smooth and round the edge of the base. Try to do this all the way across one-half of the bottom's circumference (see left). Switch the action to your other hand and do the same for the other half.

**WHEEL TRIMMING SETUP**

No matter how your pot's going to be trimmed, you must first center it on the wheel head and secure it there. Centering ensures that the pot's wall can be trimmed to a consistent thickness. (If the pot is off center you'll remove more clay from one side of it than the other, and its foot ring will be off center, too.)

I'll show two ways to center your pots, and two options for how to secure them. If you are a beginner, you'll want to secure the pot to the wheel head with wads of clay. Then, as you gain in skill and confidence, you can try the tap-centering method (see this page).

  After a pot is upside down on the wheel, you'll need to rely on your memory of its interior shape and its thickness to guide your trimming process. You should study the shape of the pot before you start to trim it! So, first, before you attach it to the wheel head (or bat), give it a cursory feel by running your fingers along the wall and floor of the pot. Getting a sense of its thickness will help you avoid cutting too deeply as you trim.

  Moisten the rim of the pot with a sponge **(1)**. With the wheel stopped, place the pot upside down as near to the center of the bat as you can. Use the wheel rings as a guide if you're working directly on the wheel head.

**1** : Moisten rim with sponge

  Start the wheel slowly turning and hold a needle tool about a third of the way down from the foot. The tip should be 2 inches (5cm) from the spinning pot **(2)**.

**2** : Sneak up on turning pot with needle tool

  Slowly move the needle tip closer to the pot—just enough to touch the pot _only_ on the side where it's most off center. Hold the tool there for at least three revolutions of the wheel, until you have a clear scratch mark in that one place on the pot's wall **(3)**.

**3** : Allow off-center pot to touch needle tool

  Stop the wheel and turn the wheel head around until the scratch is nearest you. Gently push the pot in toward the center of the wheel. Start the wheel and check to see that the pot is centered. Repeat as necessary until you've succeeded in centering the upside-down pot. The scratch mark will be removed when the pot is trimmed.

  Stick the pot to the wheel head by pressing firmly down on it. Be sure to press straight down. If you're just starting out, you'll probably want to use wadding to fix the pot more firmly to the wheel than just by its moistened rim. With your wheel stopped, curve three clay wads to fit the curvature of the pot's rim. Holding the pot firmly to the wheel head with your left hand, position the wads evenly around the rim. Compress each wad so it sticks to the wheel head or bat **(4)**. Be aware that some pots, like lids, can't be trimmed with wadding in the way, so start practicing sticking pots without it.

**4** : Secure pot with clay wads after centering

**tap-centering**

Tap-centering is the fastest, most efficient way to center your pot on the wheel, but it takes a bit more experience than the needle method. Put the pot on the wheel head or bat. Get the wheel going to a slow speed. Focus your efforts on centering the part of the pot that is approximately one-third of the way down from the pot's foot, rather than its rim.

  Take a moment to watch the pot as it turns, judging where it's most off center. Attune to the rhythm of that off-center bias. Your left index finger should be applying light downward pressure in the center of the base of the pot, and your right hand should be near the side of the pot **(1)**.

**1** : Steady uncentered pot with one finger

  Quickly and lightly tap the pot toward center as the off-center point comes around. Lighten your taps as the pot becomes more centered, until it's finally spinning quiet and true **(2)**. Press on the pot now **(3)** , so it will stick better to the wheel head. No wadding is needed.

**2** : Move pot to center with incremental taps

**3** : Press pot to stick moistened rim to bat

**TRIMMING POTS ON THE WHEEL**

The idea of cutting into your successfully thrown pot might seem daunting, but you can gain confidence by using the proper body posture, correct hand positions, and one good, sharp trimming tool. Avoid the temptation to load up on lots of different trimming tools: use one tool until you know it well. I use a simple but effective right-angle trim tool. It can be used anywhere on the form—even the hard-to-get-to areas, like where an underbelly meets the corner of a pedestal-type foot ring.

The most common problem beginners have when learning to trim is that they cut too deep—right through the bottoms of their pots. You might trim a little, take the pot off the wheel, feel for thickness, and then re-center the pot to continue the trimming.

  To trim the bottom of a pot, moisten the bat or wheel head and center your pot. Once you are sure the pot is centered, exert even, downward pressure on it to secure the pot in place **(1)**.

**1** : Tap-center and secure pot

  Use your sharp trimming tool to take excess clay from the wall at the base of the pot **(2)**. Your left fingers remain in contact with the center of the foot, but should not exert enough pressure to slow the wheel, keeping the pot in place on the wheel head. Your left thumb braces your right hand, holding the tool close to its cutting edge.

**2** : Start trimming at base

  Gradually bring the tool down along the wall **(3)**. When you're satisfied with the wall's thickness and overall profile, make a subtle bevel where the foot meets the wall **(4)**. Resting on a table, the pot's shadow lends a sense of lift. Thumb off the bevel's edge with your right index finger. Your left finger will keep the right finger in one place if you brace the two as shown in photo **5**.

**3** : Move down wall

**4** : Bevel foot

**5** : Thumb off

**cross-section**

Beginners tend to make pots that are on the heavy side, but that's quite normal. As you practice, the idea is to evenly distribute the clay throughout the pot, so it won't have any weak areas. For example, you don't want a pot with a hefty bottom and a thin, flimsy wall. You want the clay distribution to be such that the pot is strong and balanced.

A good way to learn more about the pot's structural elements (like wall thickness, curvature, or depth of the foot) is to occasionally cut a trimmed pot vertically. It teaches you about the history of your efforts. Did you pull the wall consistently? Was the foot trimmed so that the wall is an even thickness all around? Does the pot's interior curve more or less mirror the exterior one? A cross-sectioned pot helps you identify areas for further skill development.

In the photo below, the untrimmed leather-hard pot on the left reveals the raw story of floor and wall thickness, base width, and lip curve. A similarly shaped bowl on the right has been trimmed. Its curved interior is reflected by the profile of the exterior wall—especially at the base, where the form sweeps through the narrowed foot.

Untrimmed bowl (left); trimmed bowl with full foot ring (right)

**FOOT RINGS**

While throwing your pot, you may have left extra clay in the base and floor to be trimmed away when the pot became leather-hard. Now you're ready to give the form a graceful shape and some lift by adding a foot ring. I'll demonstrate two styles for creating a foot ring on a tea bowl, so you can see the effect each one can have on the final form.

No matter what type of pot you're trimming, the basic parts of a foot ring are the same. What differs from pot to pot are the proportions of the foot ring's height, width, and diameter, relative to the pot's overall size. When you're ready to get down to trimming your pots, you'll want to think about proportion, think about the diameter of the foot in relation to the overall diameter, and think about the depth of the foot in relation to the total depth.

**FULL FOOT RING**

A full foot ring is established when you trim a pedestal at the base of the pot. (Remember, your pot is sitting upside down on the wheel, with its base facing up.) To establish the width of the foot ring, you'll trim a recess into the base itself and bevel the ring's sharp outer edge. The center of the base is then trimmed into a dome- like shape, and finally the inner edge of the foot ring is also beveled.

In most cases, your objective is to trim your pot's exterior profile so that it mirrors the interior one. As you can see in the cutaway photo at left, the curve that was cut into the base of the foot ring is simply a continuation of the wall's overall curvature.

  Your seat at the wheel is at 6 o'clock, and you'll be trimming the pot at 4 o'clock. Start the wheel spinning at a moderate speed. Press your left index finger firmly down in the center of the revolving pot.

  Hold the tool in your right hand, being sure to grip it as shown and leaving enough room at the top of the handle so you can press your left thumb there. If you're not using wads of clay, keep your left index finger firmly pressed against the center of the pot's base. Using moderate pressure at the corner area of the tool, carve into the exterior wall, just below its flat base **(1)**.

**1** : Start initial trimming at base

  Gradually bring the tool down to the underside of the belly, shaving away clay as you go. Make sure you brace your tool hand at all times. Don't cut too deeply.

  Flip the head of the tool around. Try to make the foot ring ¼ to ⅜ inch (6 to 10mm) tall. Use one point of it to establish a shallow groove for the height of the pedestal **(2)**. Deepen the groove by following this first mark.

**2** : Establish pedestal's height with tool's point

  Bevel the outermost edge of the foot ring, holding the tool as shown in photo **3**.

**3** : Bevel base of pedestal

  To establish the width of the foot ring, flip the tool over (so its point aims at your left index finger). Carve a wide, V-shaped groove inside the foot ring **(4)**.

**4** : Cut inner foot ring with tool's point

  Flip the tool back over and cut from the center out, toward the inner side of the foot ring. As you trim, aim to continue the curve of the outside wall all the way through the foot ring, so as to reflect the interior shape of the tea bowl. Hold the tool's edge at the angle shown in photo **5**. Bevel the inside edge of the foot ring.

**5** : Dome base's center

  To remove the pot, first stop the wheel. Remove the wads (if you are using them) and dislodge the pot by tapping on its side **(6)**. (If you're trimming a group of same-sized pots, remove only one or two of the wads, slip the next piece into place on the wheel, then reapply the wadding.)

**6** : Unseat pot from wheel head with tap

Trimming a full foot ring

**INNER FOOT RING**

  To trim an inner foot ring into the base of a tea bowl, first pare away the clay from the foot by moving the tool down by the side of the pot **(1)**. Next, follow the instructions for cutting the _inside_ of a full foot ring of a tea bowl on this page.

**1** : Refine lower part of tea bowl

  The two tea bowls in photo **2** were thrown to the same size, but the one on the right was trimmed with a full foot ring and the one on the left with an inner foot ring. Seeing the finished results side by side demonstrates what a difference trimming can make.

**2** : Inner foot ring (left); full foot ring (right)

**stamping pots**

If you want to make your personal mark, or seal, on the pot, this is a good time to do it. Support the interior floor, just on the other side of where the seal will be, with a middle finger. Press the seal gently into the clay. Rock it slightly, so it impresses the clay cleanly **(1)**. For more about making and using seals, see this page in the Decorating and Glazing chapter.

**1** : Press bisque-fired seal into bottom of pot

**LIDS**

Although you measured your lid when you first threw it, occasionally it won't fit the intended pot exactly. In that case, you will need to trim for fit as well as for shape. Once the lid is trimmed, you can attach a strap handle or a knob of some kind; in fact, you'll create a relationship between the handle and the lid. No matter what kind of handle you choose, always try to find what is easy on the eye, but also what is practical.

A single style of pot lid can be very versatile. My simplest lid is thrown upside down, like a plate. The rim sits down in the gallery of a pot like a casserole dish. A simple lid like this needs little in the way of trimming, and is soon ready for you to add a knob or a handle.

A variation on this basic lid form is to throw it with enough extra clay for a flange. This short wall keeps the lid securely in the pot. Naturally, a flanged lid is trimmed a bit differently than a simple one, but it, too, can take either a knob or a strap handle, according to your plan.

The cap lid for my teapot is thrown like a short, shallow cylinder. It fits over the pot's flanged rim and can be trimmed in one of two ways. Trimming all three lid types will be demonstrated here.

**SIMPLE LID FOR A CASSEROLE**

  Set the untrimmed lid into the casserole's mouth, to see how it fits **(1)**. If the lid's diameter is too large, lightly sponge the base and center it on the wheel head. Press down on the lid to secure it there. Use your trim tool to very lightly skim off the excess **(2)**.

**1** : Check initial fit of untrimmed lid in pot

**2** : Reduce diameter if need be

  Once the lid fits, you're ready to trim its top side. First, lightly moisten its edge and the wheel head. Place the lid face down on the wheel and center it (use the tap-centering technique described in the sidebar on this page). Set the wheel to moderate speed and use your index fingers to depress the center of the lid **(3)**. This shallow depression creates more space, so that a hand and perhaps a pot holder will be able to fit around a strap handle. (If you prefer a knob, you don't need to make the depression.)

**3** : Gently depress center of lid

  With the trim tool, shape the lid so that it has a dome-like profile that complements the pot's curve. Work your way up the side from the lip, to the place where the profile flattens off **(4)**. If you want to add a knob to this lid, stop here and go to this page.

**4** : Give lid a dome profile

  Holding a round-edged metal rib in both hands, firmly press down into the center of the flattened area; shave away the clay to achieve a slightly concave dip in the lid **(5)**.

**5** : Trim center with rib

  Neatly tidy up the place where the dome's curve meets the concave dip. With the trim tool and your finger, as shown in photo **6**.

**6** : Refine break point with trimming tool

**FLANGED LID FOR A CASSEROLE**

The excess clay that supported the flanged lid while it was being thrown, and as it dried, is trimmed in the same way as for a gallery-style lid. Since you'll be applying pressure to the flange, make sure it's stiff enough to withstand it. Moisten the flange lip, center the lid, and secure it to the wheel with a little pressure **(1)**.

**1** : Moisten flange with sponge

  Start trimming at the base and move down the wall toward the lip **(2)**. As your tool travel's down, shift the position of your left hand. Don't apply too much pressure. The lid should glide under your left hand. Now the lid is ready for any style of handle or knob.

**2** : Do a simple trim

**FLANGED TEAPOT AND CAP LID**

Before you can trim the base of any pot that has a flanged lip, you must first dress its flange. Often the edge, or face, of a flange will have a bit of unevenness, but the pot's base can't be trimmed as it stands upside down on its flange unless it's perfectly level. I tap-center and hold the pot to the wheel head with moisture (this page), but you can always use the extra insurance of wadding, if you prefer.

  Bracing arms and hands, hold the tool horizontally to the flange's face **(1)**. A thin flange is easily damaged, so remove the clay by small degrees with a sharp tool. In this demonstration I used two tools with different head angles, but one or the other alone will do.

**1** : Dress face of flange with trimming tool

  Turn the teapot over and ready it for trimming just as you would any other pot. Trim a bit of clay off the wall near the base, to refine the shape, narrow the foot, and lighten the weight a bit more **(2)**. I like to give my teapots a shallow full foot ring; for a more thorough explanation of how that's done, see this page.

**2** : Invert pot and trim outer base

  Like the teapot, the lip of the lid must be leveled before it can be turned over and trimmed. Trimming ensures that the cap lid has a good fit and that it won't rattle loosely on the teapot's flange. (I sometimes use this opportunity to reduce the lid's depth, too.) There are two ways to secure the lid in preparation for trimming. For the first, center and secure the teapot to the wheel, right side up, then place the lid, upside down, onto the pot's mouth. Center it. As you steady the lid with your left index finger, bevel the inner edge of the lid, so when it sits on the teapot its edge will match the slope of the teapot's shoulder **(3)**. The second method is to trim the lid while it's directly on the wheel head, as you would any other pot **(4)**.

**3** : One way to position lid for trimming

**4** : . . . Or stick cap lid to bat to trim

  When you're satisfied with the lid's fit, turn it upside down and secure it to the wheel head by moistening the rim. Be sure to press down on the center of the lid so it will stick to the wheel head. Use the trim tool to curve the outer wall slightly **(5)**. Lightly trim a slightly domed shape onto the top of the lid **(6)**.

**5** : Lightly curve lid's wall

**6** : Trim slight dome shape into top of lid

**adding a knob**

You can add a knob onto any type of trimmed lid while it's still on the wheel. A word of caution: when attaching a knob onto a flanged lid, make sure the lid is leather-hard. You'll be applying a moderate amount of pressure to the flange and don't want the lid to collapse.

  To make a knob, pinch off a small amount of soft, fresh clay **(1)** ; add or subtract clay as needed. Compare the size of the knob to the lid **(2)**. Roll the clay into a smooth ball.

**1** : Pinch off clay for knob

**2** : Estimate knob's proportion to lid

  With the wheel turning slowly, use the tip of your trimming tool to score a small area in the center of the lid **(3)**. Stop the wheel and apply a small amount of water to the scored area **(4)**. Just a few drops should do!

**3** : Score center of lid

**4** : Moisten scored section

  Position the clay for the knob onto the scored area. Use your fingertip to blend its base into the lid **(5)**. Be consistent all the way around. Get your fingers wet, start the wheel, and compress the clay down onto the lid with the tips of your first two fingers **(6)**. Support the side of the knob with your left thumb and middle finger.

**5** : Attach clay

**6** : Moisten and compress knob

  Once the clay is firmly attached, center and shape it. Do the shaping with your right index or little finger. Support that pressure with your index and thumb **(7)**.

**7** : Center and shape knob

  Compress the knob and shape the side with a downward-curving angle **(8)**.

**8** : Compress and refine side

  Finish the knob with your trimming tool **(9)**. Make it clean and crisp.

Handles

Assembling Complex Forms

Pulling a handle

**handles**

Assembling is the art of combining individually made parts to make up a whole, the sum of which is greater than its parts. Pulling and attaching handles take a bit of knack, so keep practicing. When a handle is made and attached properly, it looks very natural, like it might have grown right out of the pot, and it will be strong enough to easily lift the weight of the filled pot.

Here I'll show you how to make a basic pulled handle and the various assembly methods I like to use for a tankard, a pitcher, and the handles (both a strap and a lug-type) for the casserole and its lid. You can change the appearance of a handle a great deal just by giving it a little tweak, a little lift here, a little push there. Look at the part as you're attaching it to your pot and think about proportion and size. (You don't want to have a handle that looks or feels awkward or cumbersome.)

Once you've trimmed your pots and made the necessary appendages, you're ready to start assembling.

Attaching a handle;

**PULLING HANDLES**

The basic process for creating a pulled handle is shown here. I like to attach handles to a whole ware board of leather-hard pots in a single session, so for the sake of efficiency, I pull a long handle that can be cut down into several individual handles.

  Knead 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 0.9kg) of clay and roll it into a spike shape. Grasp it just below the top and slap the top of it with your other hand, to splay it like the head of a railroad spike **(1)**. Hold the clay by its head and dip it into a bucket of water—but not so deep that your fingers get wet. If they do, you won't be able to keep a grip on the clay. Wet your free hand.

**1** : Splayed end of clay "spike"

  Gradually stretch the wet clay by gently but quickly and smoothly pulling down along and right off the end of the tail **(2)**. Don't stop at the end or a lump will develop there. Aim to create a long, tapering handle. Pull the clay several times. Your hand should glide smoothly and quickly. Never squeeze the clay too tightly, or it might get too thin or even tear.

**2** : Pull to narrow and lengthen clay

  Rotate the pulled clay, make two or three more pulls, then rotate it back to its original position in your hand. Do this throughout the handle-pulling process, until it's 18 inches (46cm) long.

  Once the clay starts to take on the shape of a handle, hold your fingers in a more oval-like shape, as shown in photo **3**.

**3** : Reposition fingers to create oval

  Continue pulling lightly and quickly **(4)**. If you were to cut a cross-section of the pulled clay now, it would be an oval rather than round.

**4** : Extend clay into oval profile

  Wrap your right fingers around the back of the handle and, using your right thumb, run it down the entire length of the clay, to make a groove on the left side **(5)**.

**5** : Use thumb to make first groove

  Do the same on the right side. It will take several passes to get these two grooves right. Your goal is to create a handle with a spine **(6)**.

**6** : Create second groove

  Gently drape a 6- to 8-inch (15 to 20cm) length of the tail over your right hand **(7)**. Lay that section down on a nearby tabletop or board **(8)**. Where the clay meets the edge of the board, put your right thumb on top of the handle and your index finger directly below it **(9)**.

**7** : Drape pulled clay over hand

**8** : Lay section on table

**9** : Prepare to cut handle

  Holding your right thumb perpendicular to the pulled clay, use the side of your thumb to cut the handle; make the cut as vertical as possible **(10)**. After you've pulled all the handles you need, let them stiffen, uncovered, for 40 minutes or so (depending on the humidity level in the studio) before attaching them to any pots.

**10** : Thumb-cut handle at table's edge

**TANKARD HANDLE**

To attach your pulled handle to a tankard, start by gathering together a bucket of water, a small sponge, a banding wheel, and a clean ware board. Decide how you want the handle to be positioned and where you will attach it to your pot.

  Dip your thumb in the water; let a bit of water run down your thumbnail as you score the mug just under the rim **(1)**. The water will create just the right amount of slip needed to attach the handle. Put the mug on the banding wheel.

**1** : Score top attachment point

  To release the handle from the ware board, don't pick it up by its tail; instead, release it by using your thumb to push the thicker end of the handle away from you. Holding it as shown, use your thumb's knuckle to splay and widen the end of the handle **(2)**.

**2** : Splay end of handle with knuckle

  With your left hand supporting the lip of the mug on the inside, attach the thicker end of the handle to the scored area on the mug with gentle but firm pressure **(3)**.

**3** : Push handle straight onto attachment point

  Use the tip of your right thumb to blend the top side of the splayed end of the handle into the mug's wall **(4)** ; use your right index finger on the underside to do the same.

**4** : Blend handle's topside to attach

  Once you've blended and smoothed the attachment, hold the mug horizontally so that the handle hangs from the mug. Dip the handle and your free hand in the water bucket **(5)**. Be sure to support the handle as you do this maneuver.

**5** : Dip handle in water bucket

  Make two or three light pulls to freshen up and soften the handle a little **(6)**. If you want the handle to have a spine down its length, use the tip of your right thumb to reinstate it **(7)**.

**6** : Refresh handle with light pulls

**7** : Reestablish handle's spine

  Now, supporting the end of the handle, let it curve down gently, while at the same time turning the mug into a vertical position. Use your right thumb and index finger to gently stick the tail of the handle into position on the mug **(8)**. Don't push hard until you're certain about its placement. Looking at the handle straight on, make sure it's aligned with the mug **(9)**.

**8** : Lightly stick end of handle

**9** : Check handle's vertical alignment

  Tidy up the upper attachment before dealing with the tail **(10)**. When you're satisfied with the location of the handle's lower attatchment, use the right side of your right thumb to blend the right half of the handle into the mug. Start at the center of the handle and blend out, to the right **(11)**. Don't be hesitant.

**10** : Smooth underside of attachment

**11** : Thumb off right side of handle's end

  Turn the mug upside down, and use the same technique for the left half **(12)**. Flick off the tail with your right thumb, in one quick move **(13)**.

**12** : Flip mug to thumb off other side

**13** : Tear off handle's tail in one motion

  Blend and finish the tail, using only your fingers. Don't use a sponge or tool; they will spoil the clean, crisp finish on the naked clay **(14)**.

**14** : Finish only with your thumb

**PITCHER HANDLE**

Pulling, placing, and attaching a pitcher handle is similar to making one for a tankard. This demonstration shows how the handle's thickness, length, and placement differ from those used on smaller forms.

  After you've thumbed off the base of the pitcher, determine where on its lip the handle will be attached; naturally, it should be directly opposite the pouring lip **(1)**. Have a bucket of warm water ready.

**1** : Visually determine connection point

  Attach a pulled handle to the rim, using the techniques shown on this page, but attaching it at the rim rather than below it.

  Smooth the underside of the joint with your right index finger. Support the handle with your left hand **(2)**.

**2** : Use side of finger to blend underside

  Smooth the top side of the joint with your right thumb. Your right index finger supports the handle from underneath **(3)**.

**3** : Smooth top side of attachment point

  Smooth and secure the left side of the handle. Your left hand should continue to support the tail of the handle **(4)**.

**4** : Smooth left side too

  Hold the pitcher gently in your left hand. Support the handle with your right hand as you prepare to dip the handle into the water **(5)**. Dip the handle, then refresh the spine.

**5** : Support handle while moving pitcher

  Just when you've determined the handle's shape, and where the lower point of attachment will be, shift the base into position as shown in photo **6** , so you can make sure the handle is aligned to the axis of the pouring lip. Use your right index finger and thumb to lightly press the tail to the base of the pitcher.

**6** : Check overall alignment before proceeding

  Use a gentle curving motion of your index finger to refine the shape and smooth underneath the top of the handle where it attaches to the pot **(7)**.

**7** : Smooth attachment's underside

  Support the wall with your left hand inside the pot, then finish the attachment process.

  Finally, smooth the upper joint **(8)**. Refine the handle shape carefully. Check the shape of the handle, and whether it feels good in the hand **(9)**.

**8** : Use light touch for any last blends

**9** : Refine curve and check feel

**LIDDED CASSEROLE HANDLES**

To get a casserole lid ready for a pulled, strap-style handle, I make a slight depression in its center and then trim that area with a rib. The whole form will have a low, neat profile but there will still be enough space under the handle for your hand. Instead of a strap handle, I sometimes throw a knob onto a simple lid before removing it from the wheel head (see this page).

Lug handles, fashioned from coils of clay, are attached to the pot rather than a lid. The entire length of the lug is joined to the pot, instead of at two end points with an opening between them, like a strap-style handle. All three types of appendages will be shown in this section.

  To make sure you have enough to make all of the strap-style handles this pot needs, prepare 2 pounds (0.9kg) of clay. The initial pulling phase is essentially the same as for the other handles shown in this chapter. See this page if you'd like a more thorough review of the basic process.

  Fashion the clay into a spike shape, then hold it with a dry hand while you pull lightly and quickly with a wet one **(1)**.

**1** : Pull enough clay for multiple handles

  After pulling a handle to the desired length, position it over the lid to size up its width, length, and thickness before chopping it off **(2)**.

**2** : Estimate strap length

  Lay the length of strap you have estimated you will need, plus a bit extra for margin of error, on the table **(3)**.

**3** : Allow extra length for strap

  Use your thumb to slice off handles. Cut each handle a little longer than needed, and cut a few extra handles, just in case **(4)**. Let them dry up a bit.

**4** : Cut off pulled handle with thumb

  Start with the lid handle. Supporting the area of the curve with your left fingers, position it as if you were going to attach it, so you can check it for length **(5)**. Cut off any excess, if necessary, with your thumb.

**5** : Check length and determine attachment point

  Hold the handle with your left hand. Apply a few drops of water to the two attachment points and score them with your right index fingernail to create a little slip **(6)**.

**6** : Score moistened attachment points

  Position the handle onto the scored areas; continue to support it with your left fingers. Using the thumb of your right hand, crisply smear one-half of one end of the handle into the surface of the lid **(7)**.

**7** : Smear half of one handle with thumb

  Turn the pot one-quarter turn and smear the other half of that same end **(8)**. Indent the end, between the two smears, with your right index finger **(9)**.

**8** : Smear other half of handle

**9** : Indent the end with index finger

  Lift the pot and assess the curve of the handle before you attach the other end **(10)**.

**10** : Assess first attachment's position

  Supporting the handle with your left fingers, repeat the attachment process with the other end of the handle. Note the extra clay **(11)**.

**11** : Repeat to attach other end of handle

**considering proportion**

The challenge with attaching handles to this casserole (or any pot) is getting the proportions right: you want the proper ratio of handle length, curve, and alignment. As you attach the lugs, continually assess your pot from many different angles. Work with the casserole positioned on a banding wheel so that you can rotate it as you make adjustments. Also, don't hesitate to lift the piece up and look at it from eye level. Make sure your lug handles are attached well and are strong because, once the pot is fired, you don't want an accident on the way to the table!

  Now you're ready to attach the lugs to the sides of the casserole. With a fettling knife, cut a handle into two 3-inch (7.5cm) pieces **(12)**.

**12** : Cut two lug handles same length

  Using your sponge, lightly moisten the area on the pot where you intend to put the first lug handle **(13)**. Dip your finger in water and lightly score the area, as shown in photo **14**. Bend the lug into a slight curve. Moisten the side of it to be attached, then put it on the scored area **(15)**.

**13** : Moisten attachment area for lugs

**14** : Score attachment points

**15** : Apply lug handle to scored area

  Bracing the pot from the side opposite the lug with your left hand, use your right thumb and index finger to work the lug into the pot **(16)**.

**16** : Gently work the lug handle into the pot

  Wet your fingers and glide them back and forth from one end of the handle to the other. Apply light pressure, blending the lug into the sidewall of the pot as you go **(17)**.

**17** : Blend lug handle joint into sidewall

  Round or bevel the front lip of the lug with your right index finger **(18)**. Finish blending the lug into the pot from underneath **(19)**.

**18** : Smooth and bevel front edge

**19** : Blend under lug handle

  Blend the right side of the lug into the pot using the edge of your thumb **(20)**. Now finish the job by blending the left end of the lug; cradle the pot with your left hand **(21)**.

**20** : Thumb off right side of lug handle

**21** : Thumb off left side

  To locate the other lug, position the casserole with the first handle directly opposite you. I use my right index finger to help find the correct alignment **(22)**. Attach the second lug in the same way as you did the first.

**22** : Double-check alignment of lug handles

  The strap handle and lugs are properly balanced on the casserole **(23)**.

**23** : Make sure lug handles are blended and tidy

Teapot, spout, and lid

**assembling complex forms**

Now you have everything you need to bring all your clay-working skills together on more complex pieces. In this next section, I'll show you how to join spouts and lugs to the teapot and also how to assemble a trio of GP bowls into a neat and versatile serving piece.

Creating pouring holes for teapot;

**ASSEMBLING A TEAPOT**

A teapot is made of many parts, separately thrown and then assembled. It should feel well balanced in your hand, pour well, and be pleasing to the eye. It can be challenging to make a teapot that is both beautiful and that functions well (i.e., it not only doesn't dribble but pours beautifully, the lid stays put while you pour, and the handle feels right and looks good). While there is no formula that can precisely dictate how this sort of harmony is found, there are some simple things you can do that will help you achieve these goals.

The quality of the individual parts you create make all the difference. A spout that is too large in relation to the body will make the teapot's overall proportions look questionable. Before you sit down to make your teapot, you might want to look at lots of examples. Then, do a lot of making. Throw many bodies, spouts, lids, and handles, then mix and match these parts to find the best relationships.

**clay moves**

Understanding how clay behaves is essential to teapot assembly. When I was young, I remember watching my father assemble a teapot in the studio at Lowerdown. He was slicing the tip of the spout at an angle that didn't look right to me, but when the teapot emerged from the warm kiln the spout had somehow righted itself into the correct position for pouring. I quickly learned that a clay spout not only shrinks during firing, but it also _twists_. You will come to notice these types of behaviors in the forms you make, and I'm sure you'll integrate those findings into your work.

  Put the lidded pot on a banding wheel. Holding the spout in your left hand, use a long fettling knife to trim away the excess clay from the spout's wider end **(1)**.

**1** : Trim excess clay from base

  Hold the spout at eye level. You will cut the spout at an angle so it will fit the pot's shoulder. Hold your fettling knife at the intended cutting angle **(2)**. Use the knife to draw a line across the base of the spout.

**2** : Draw intended cut line

  Cut through the spout there. Don't cut away too much clay on your first try. Instead, sneak up on the final cut by taking away a bit at a time; I cut from the inside, as shown in photo **(3)**.

**3** : Trim gradually

  Occasionally hold the spout against the pot and assess its shape, scale, and relative proportion **(4)**.

**4** : Check placement and proportion

  Once you're satisfied, bevel the entire inner edge of the base of the spout **(5)**.

**5** : Bevel base of spout

  Dip the freshly cut edge, quickly, into water **(6)**.

**6** : Briefly dip spout in water

  Place the spout in its appropriate place on the pot; rock it back and forth in order to mark its position **(7)**. Be careful not to place the spout too low on the body or the tea will flow out of the spout before the teapot can be filled.

**7** : Mark position by rocking spout on body

  The mark left on the pot will make it easy for you to know where to cut the holes and then score for the final attachment **(8)**.

**8** : Mark must be clearly visible

  Bracing the pot with one hand, cut approximately ten holes inside the borders of the wet outline with a fettling knife or a hole cutter. Make sure you cut enough holes that, taken as a sum, are equal to or greater than the interior area of the spout's _exit_ hole **(9)**.

**9** : Cut holes for strainer

  After scoring the wet outline, lightly moisten the area with a sponge **(10)**.

**10** : Moisten scored placement area

  On the edge of the banding wheel, mix a bit of attaching slip. Use the same clay as your pot—just add a little water and mix it with your fettling knife **(11)**.

**11** : Mix slip for attaching spout

  Apply a generous amount of slip onto the scored area. Before the slip dries, attach the spout by pressing it firmly to the body **(12)**.

**12** : Use a generous application of slip

  Using your thumb, press around the edge of the spout where it joins to the body, making sure it's tightly sealed. Learn to use just enough pressure to do the job without leaving unwanted dents **(13)**.

**13** : Press down on spout's base

  Smooth the joint with your index finger, blending it as you go **(14)**.

**14** : Smooth and blend joint

  Finish the smoothing with a moist sponge **(15)**.

**15** : Light finish with sponge

  Poke or cut a small ⅛-inch (3mm) hole in the lid. Air entering the hole lets liquid flow out of the pot more smoothly **(16)**.

**16** : Cut vent hole in cap lid

  Use a very thin spatula blade (not a fettling knife) to cut the spout a couple of degrees lower on the left side (see sidebar, this page). After it's fired, the opening and angle will be in the right position **(17)**.

**17** : Trim angle of spout

  Tidy up the end of the spout. With the back of your hole-cutting tool or a similar round tool, smooth the bore of the spout right out to the pouring edge. Try to achieve a pouring edge that is both sharp and smooth **(18)**.

**18** : Smooth spout's interior edge

  Roll a coil at least 8 inches (20cm) long and ¼ inch (6mm) thick. Cut two loop handles from it, each 3 inches (7.5cm) long **(19)**.

**19** : Cut loop handles

  Score two small areas, one on each side of the spout. Make sure these joint areas aren't so close to the rim or lid that later on the handle won't fit. Apply a small amount of slip to each scored area **(20)**.

**20** : Score attachment points and apply slip

  Shape the loop handles into a curve over your index finger. Bend the two ends out **(21)**. Press them down firmly onto the slipped areas.

**21** : Set handle ends in place

  Align the scored points for the back loop with the front loop. Again, be careful not to position the lug too close to the lid. Apply slip and attach the second loop in the same way you did the first one.

  To finish the loop handles, moisten your index finger; support the inside of the pot with your other hand **(22)** as you gently press the ends of each loop handle to the teapot body **(23)**.

**22** : Moisten finger before pressing

**23** : Press loop ends against body

  Use a lightly moistened paintbrush to tidy up the areas where the loop handles are attached **(24)**.

**24** : Smooth with moistened paintbrush

**ASSEMBLING A TRIPLE BOWL**

The triple bowl is essentially three GP bowls connected at their rims and sides (to see how to throw a GP bowl, review this page). Handles or lugs can be added to these nibble bowls, or try variations on making it a two-bowl serving dish, or four.

  To get started, have a large-enough clean ware board or round bat near the wheel so you can assemble the bowls on it and safely move it once you're done. Throw the first bowl, then measure its diameter and height. Jot down these measurements or use a gauge; you'll throw the other bowls to the same size **(1)**.

**1** : Measure bowl's height and diameter

  Cut the first bowl off the wheel and place it in the center of the board or bat. Apply a little water to the bat where the second bowl will sit. Throw the second bowl, cut it off the wheel, and slide it next to the first bowl.

  Throw a third bowl and nestle it into the other side of the first bowl **(2)**.

**2** : Nestle final bowl to others

  Press them together between your thumb and index fingers, sliding your hands to the left and to the right. This kind of wet-on-wet technique only needs a bit of gentle pressure to make a really good join **(3)**.

**3** : Join bowls

  Now, press the pairs of walls together, below the lips. **(4)**. Cast your eye over the finished form and make any adjustments to the shape that you think are necessary. Let the assemblage dry until almost leather-hard. Thumb off the bases of the joined pots (for a review, see this page). Handle the assemblage with care, so as not to stress the joins.

**4** : Press walls of bowls together

  If you would like to add loop handles, use your thumbnail to score and slip the rims of the two end pots where you want to put the handles **(5)**.

**5** : Score each bowl end for handle placement

  Roll a coil long enough for two loop handles. Use your fettling knife to cut a pair of handles to the same length **(6)**.

**6** : Cut a pair of handles the same length

  Bend a handle over your middle finger. Curve the ends so they're horizontal **(7)**.

**7** : Create handle by bending over finger

  Attach one handle to each end of the trio. Blend each handle end into the lip and wall **(8, 9)**.

**8** : Blend both sides of handle ends into lip

**9** : Blend handle ends into lip and wall

Decorative Techniques

Glazes

Bisque-fired, faceted teapot

**decorative techniques**

Potters have been at it a very long time and since the beginning have used decoration to help tell stories on vessels. All sorts of materials and techniques can be used to decorate pots—so many, in fact, that the array of choices might be overwhelming. Pots can be decorated at different times in their development from freshly thrown or leather-hard to bisque fired, and this chapter introduces some of the most common techniques for decorating or glazing at any stage.

From making impressions in soft clay to brush ing engobes onto leather-hard pots, to dipping bisque-fired pots in glaze, there is surely a technique shown in this chapter that will appeal to you.

**IMPRESSING TECHNIQUES**

The practice of stamping or impressing patterns and imagery into the surfaces of pots seems to have started 12,000 to 15,000 years ago. You only have to stamp one of your own pots for the first time in order to understand something about our ancient impulse to leave a mark . . . and then another.

Impressions are usually made between the time when a pot is soft and pliable or when it has stiffened up a bit. The drier a pot becomes, the less willing the clay is to take an impression. Here are a few simple tools and methods for stamping freshly thrown pots that are still attached to the wheel head or bat.

**PADDLING**

Paddling leaves an impression in a freshly thrown pot. The wooden paddle has a three-dimensional design carved into it, which, when whacked into the surface of a pot, transfers the design from the paddle to the pot.

The paddle can be used in several different ways, but the timing of the process is important. It's easier to leave a deep impression in the soft clay of a freshly thrown pot than it is in a leather-hard or stiff one. On the other hand, a wet pot sometimes sticks to the paddle. To achieve the desired depth and crispness, practice the technique outlined here on a bellied form.

  Leave your just-thrown pot on the bat and use your throwing stick to remove the slip **(1)**. Less slip on the surface leaves it less sticky and better able to hold the design.

**1** : Remove slip

  Soak the paddle in water for a couple of minutes first, to keep the wet clay of the freshly thrown pot from adhering to the paddle's carved design **(2)**.

**2** : Soak paddles

  Put your hand inside the pot, directly behind the area where you intend to paddle. Press your fingers tightly together, touching the wall. Aim a quick, short stroke directly at the supported area of the wall, pulling the paddle straight off the clay without letting it turn or twist in your hand **(3)**.

**3** : Press or strike pot with paddle

  With the wheel turning moderately fast, reshape the lip in the same way you might finish throwing it. Brace your hands—don't let the misshapen form push your hands around.

**STAMPING**

Any type of materials imaginable—from corncobs to meat tenderizers—can become "stamps" (see this page to learn how to make your own). The stamps in this lesson are impressed into a fresh pot on the wheel, releasing easily and leaving behind a mark or motif.

  Don't cut under the pot. Soak the tool in water for a few minutes. Photo **1** shows a meat tenderizer being used to create a pattern on a cylinder. Place one hand inside the pot to support the area where you'll be stamping.

**1** : Support from inside pot

  Holding the stamp firmly, either press it into the wall **(2)** or apply the pattern by giving the pot a quick whack with the tool. Try different approaches, because each tool sticks to soft clay in a different way.

**2** : Press or whack tool into wall

  The cylinder in photo **3** was stamped on four sides; squaring the lip accentuates the design. Even a corncob makes an interesting pattern. The cob was soaked for a few minutes **(4)**. In photo **5** , the cob is used to create a diagonal pattern all around the form.

**3** : Integrate lip's shape with design

**4** : Briefly soak tools before using

**5** : Found objects make good stamps

  Making impressions, as you'll discover, puts the thrown form out of round. After the decorative work is done, start the wheel again and use your fingertips to re-round the lip **(6)**. Brace your hands against each other in order to counter the force of the undulations. Another way to do this is to use a rounder (see this page). Use your throwing stick to bevel the base and then remove the pot using your cutoff wire.

It's easy to make your own stamps out of clay. Here I teach you how to make a simple stamp as well as a wheel stamp, which can be rolled to make a continuous line of impressions.

  Roll a small wad of clay between your hands and pinch it lightly. Flatten the clay by rolling it against your wheel head, or any flat surface. Use a tool of your choice to impress a pattern in the stamp.

  Try a needle tool to make a diamond pattern **(1)**. Another approach is to use a pointed wood tool to first incise a line in a rectangular-shaped seal. Poke a pattern of small holes into the center **(2)**.

**1** : Impress clay wad with side of tool

**2** : Incise simple lines and patterns

  A quick way to make a continuous line of impressions is with a wheel stamp. Pinch a ball of clay into a circular disk shape with your thumb and index finger, leaving enough clay in the center, on both sides, to shape an axle out of it **(3)**. When it's leather-hard, incise or carve the edge of the wheel shape with some sort of tool. Let the clay dry and then bisque fire it so it will be durable and can be used over and over again. To use the stamp, hold it as shown in photo **4**.

**3** : Shape a wheel and axle from clay

**4** : Hold wheel by its spindle

**adding your seal**

Before your pot dries, you may want to add your "signature"—your name, initial, or maker's mark—to its bottom. The seal can be a storebought stamp made from a porous material like plaster or wood, or one that you've made yourself out of clay (see sidebar at left).

  To print a seal on the bottom of a leather-hard pot, first moisten a small area of the foot. Either stamp directly into the pot (see below) or roll a tiny ball of clay and position it on the moistened area **(1)**.

**1** : Press clay to leather hard pot

  Press the ball into the surface, creating a thin pad. Make an impression in the small pad by rocking the seal back and forth. Remove your seal quickly so the image is tidy and clear **(2)**.

**2** : Stamp clay with seal

**CUTTING TECHNIQUES**

Another way to decorate a pot is to cut into the surface. This can be done by faceting or carving into the pot at various stages of drying, from freshly thrown to leather-dry.

**FACETING**

Faceting is the art of cutting planes into the surface of a pot. If you cut facets into a freshly thrown one, the facets may be crisp but the just-cut planes are still soft and supple. You might try wetting only the interior of the pot and, without touching its exterior, push outward, so the form expands and gives a more natural, flowing quality to each facet. If instead you choose to wait for the pot to stiffen to the leather-hard stage, the facets you cut are more likely to be sharp, smooth, and precise. Try experimenting with pots at different stages of dryness.

You can facet with almost anything that has an edge sharp enough to slice through clay. Some potters like to use wire tools, braided steel or nylon, or perhaps a cheese slicer, on leather-hard clay. Another option is a kinked guitar string, which I quite like. In this demonstration, I faceted the pot right after it was made on the wheel. A curly wire made one set of facets whereas a straight wire was used on the neighboring planes. The contrast between the surfaces created a dynamic aesthetic.

The broader the facets you intend to cut, the thicker the wall needs to be. I started with a freshly thrown, thick-walled pot and ribbed the exterior wall to remove the slip, for a clean surface. The base of the pot has been beveled but not yet cut from the wheel.

  Use a kinked or curly wire. Hold it taut, with your hands spaced a little wider than that of the facet you intend to cut. Bracing both wrists on the wheel and with the wire held taut, start each facet with the wire positioned on top of the lip **(1)**. As you cut, stay aware of the wall's thickness and curve. Try to follow that curve all the way.

**1** : Cut facets with curly wire

  Finish all of the fluted cuts first, spacing them evenly around the circumference of the pot. Consider how the two styles of facets might meet each other before you cut the first straight facet **(2)**. Hold the wire tightly.

**2** : Cut straight facets

  The mouth of the pot may get a bit misshapen. To reshape it, use only your left hand on the lip's interior **(3)**. Have the wheel turning moderately fast and be careful not to touch the fresh facets on the outside. Cut the pot off the wheel head only when you're done. (This is a good project for using a bat, so that you don't mar the design by moving the pot to a ware board.)

**3** : Reshape pot from the inside

**FLUTING**

Fluting is a type of surface decoration made by carving away clay using a sharp tool. Timing the fluting to the wetness of your pot is a matter of preference and experience. When the clay is soft, loop tools are best for getting deep, rounded flutes. With a drier pot, fluting becomes more of a carving exercise with angular or shallow flutes. Here, I use a broken-off hacksaw blade, which I sharpened on a grindstone. One end is rounded and the other squared off.

  On a leather-hard teapot, start the fluting to one side of the spout. Using the rounded end of the blade, direct the carving stroke away from you and toward the base of the pot. Each flute is positioned relative to the previous one, allowing minor differences in line quality so that the pattern has a hand-drawn aesthetic **(1)**.

**1** : Carve vertical lines toward base

  Center the lid on the wheel and set it moving. Using the sharp end of the tool, carve a small circle at the lid's center **(2)**.

**2** : Find center of lid

  Hold the lid in your hands. Hold the blade sideways so you can start each flute as a thin line. Carve outward from the center circle. As you curve the line, expand its width by gradually turning the blade **(3)**. Put the lid on the pot and allow them to slowly dry together.

**3** : Carve curved lines into lid

  Here, I've used the round end of a hacksaw blade to carve a brick pattern, each row alternating the last, on a pot that is a bit drier than leather-hard **(4)**. Support the pot from the inside and rest it on your lap.

**4** : Horizontal brick pattern

  Use the same hacksaw blade to work the brick pattern vertically on a taller, more slender pot **(5)**. The broken end of the hacksaw blade can be used to make sharp, lively breaks in the soft brick pattern **(6)**.

**5** : Vertical brick pattern

**6** : Make sharp, lively breaks in the pattern

**INCISING**

Directly carving a design or motif into the surface of a pot is called incising. I think the best results are achieved on leather-hard clay when the motif can stand out sharp and clear. Compared to the flutes cut into the planes of a pot (see Fluting, this page), the marks made in the drier clay have sharper edges. Be sure to brush off the burrs from your "drawing" before you fire the pot. Each tool leaves its unique mark, so experiment with different tools. After incising, the pot can be bisque fired and then either finished with a translucent glaze, to let the design show through, or left unglazed and stony-looking.

  To incise a leather-hard pot, I like to use a lemon zester, which creates groups of parallel lines. Draw the tool toward you **(1)**. Incise a vertical row of triangular flecks between each row of lines with the sharp tip of a hacksaw blade or other sharp trimming tool **(2)**.

**1** : Use a lemon zester to create parallel lines

**2** : Incise triangular flecks between line groups

**INLAY**

Inlay technique is the process of incising, or cutting into, leather-hard clay with a tool, and then filling the void with a contrasting slip, or perhaps an engobe (see this page). The excess is then scraped off with a sharp rib, revealing a clean-edged motif. Plan to apply inlay when the clay is the right degree of semi-stiffness: too soon, and the design won't be crisp; too dry, and the inlay material can flake off or fall out of the incision later. Thin incisions tend to work best. The incisions on the stoneware bottle in this demonstration were filled with my own porcelain-based formulation.

Use any kind of tool that will make the sort of pattern you envision. Standard pottery tools, dental tools, woodworking tools—anything strong enough to carve into stiff clay will work. Each tool leaves a mark of its unique character in the lines and shapes you make with it. After the incised and inlaid pot is fully dry, bisque fire it. You might want to then cover the pot with a translucent glaze, so the motif can be seen through the glassy surface. Or fire the pot to a high temperature without any glaze at all. This gives a dry, geological look to the pot. Opaque glazes would hide or obscure the incising, but you can always experiment.

  Prepare the area for inlay by trimming its surface, so that it's smooth and even **(1)**. (The small bottle shown here is supported by an open chuck—a bisque-fired piece that levelly holds a lid or pot centered, upside down, above the potter's wheel or banding wheel.) With the wheel turning, polish the area you intend to incise with a fettling knife or spoon held at a low angle to the surface **(2)**. Make sure one hand supports the pot as the wheel turns. To polish hard-to-reach places, like a small neck, use the back of your thumbnail instead **(3)**. Polished clay glistens.

**1** : Trim surface

**2** : Burnish area to be incised

**3** : Burnish neck with thumbnail

  Place a small plastic disk over the mouth of the pot, so you'll have a place where your left index finger can apply downward pressure and keep the pot securely seated in the chuck. Brace your left thumb on your right hand. With the wheel turning moderately fast, gradually carve a line 1/16 inch (1.6mm) deep with a needle tool **(4)**. That should be deep enough for the engobe.

**4** : Carve a line with needle tool

  With the wheel turning slowly (or even stopped), lightly moisten the incised areas with a small sponge **(5)**. Be careful not to smear or disturb the incising.

**5** : Moisten incisions

  Using engobe mixed to the consistency of paste, stop the wheel and apply it to the incisions with your fingers **(6)**. Make sure you press the material into the voids, filling it completely. Let it dry for 5 minutes. The area will look messy, but don't worry. With your wheel turning moderately fast, use the straight edge of a steel kidney rib to scrape off the excess engobe **(7)**. Remove it gradually, so you don't go too far and remove the whole pattern. Be careful you don't leave any engobe on the surface, because it's sure to show after the firing.

**6** : Apply engobe to incisions

**7** : Scrape off excess engobe

  Polish the areas you scraped **(8)**. Finally, soften the surface with your fingers and palm **(9)**. Be gentle, so as not to disturb the incised pattern.

**8** : Burnish scraped areas

**9** : Soften surface with fingers

Un-fired pots decorated with engobes

**ENGOBES**

In its simplest form, engobe is little more than a creamy slip, like the slurry you remove from a thrown pot before you take it off the wheel (which is why many potters refer to engobe as "slip"). The difference between the two is mainly the amount of non-plastic (not for throwing) materials in the mixture. In the right proportions, a fluxing (melting) agent and other ingredients make the engobe more vitreous. (The more vitreous an engobe is, the more it resembles a glaze.) Engobe can be used to decorate a pot from the time it's freshly thrown and still on the wheel to when it's almost dry.

Engobe can be an attractive alternative to glaze. Because it is made of mostly clay, it has a high melting point (like the pot it covers), and that makes it possible to paint fine lines that won't blur when fired. You can use a commercial product (it's available in lots of colors), or mix a batch of your own base recipe and add colorants of your own choosing (see this page).

Non-plastic clays are often part of an engobe recipe, and the ratio of all the ingredients in its formulation must be balanced, and also suitable for the shrinkage rate of the clay you used to make your pot. To the whitish base recipe you might add a colorant: an oxide, a stain, or a carbonate. The more flux an engobe recipe has, the more intense its coloring agents become; the colors in low-melt (that is, more slip-like) engobes tend to be more muted.

Whether commercially made or "from scratch," engobes are formulated for the three major firing temperatures:

cone 04 (1945°F / 1063°C)

cone 6 (2232°F / 1222°C)

cone 10 (2345°F / 1285°C)

Keep in mind that any kind of coating you put on a clay pot, be it engobe, vitreous slip, or glaze, must match, or fit, the firing temperature and shrinkage rate of the pot's clay. If the two shrink at significantly different rates during the drying or firing stages, the applied material might flake off.

**BRUSHED ENGOBE**

This simple technique is done with a thick engobe and a rough brush, resulting in a creamy, swirling surface treatment. For this demonstration, I applied a thick white engobe in four different ways over a freshly thrown pot, though you can also apply it to leather-hard pots.

  A trimmed tea bowl is tap-centered using a rounder tool (see this page). The left index finger applies light, downward pressure—enough to keep it centered but not enough to cause drag on the wheel when it spins **(1)**.

**1** : Tap-center pot with rounder tool

  Using a hakeme brush (made from a corn broom), dip the end in engobe and paint it onto the pot as the wheel turns moderately fast **(2)**. Use up-and-down motions to create a dynamic pattern **(3)**.

**2** : Paint engobe onto pot as wheel turns

**3** : Paint with up-and-down motions

  Another option to explore is applying a plant-like motif with the same brush **(4)**.

**4** : Apply a plant-like motif

  Use an altered housepainter's brush, such as the one described below, to apply a thick layer of engobe to the pot, raising and lowering the brush quickly as the wheel rotates **(5)**. Over this pattern of layered lines and grooves, apply a puddle of engobe with cupped fingers. Turn the wheel slowly, to create a layer of broader gestures **(6)**. Try using your fingertips to draw through a layer of engobe **(7)**.

**5** : Apply thick layer of engobe

**6** : Apply puddle of engobe with fingers

**7** : Draw through engobe with fingertips

  When finished, use your throwing stick to bevel the base of the form **(8)**. This helps tidy up the bottom edge and get it ready to trim later, when it's leather-hard. Cut the pot from the wheel and remove it to a ware board, for drying. Later, the bisque-fired pot will be coated with a translucent glaze and fired to a high temperature.

**8** : Bevel base of pot with throwing stick

**altering a paintbrush for engobe**

Here's a way to alter an ordinary paintbrush so that it leaves behind expressive traces of its movement through engobe. What's exciting is that you can change the paintbrush every time you decorate a pot, so that each one has a unique design. Eventually there won't be any bristles left, so keep on the lookout for used brushes.

  Start with an ordinary housepainter's brush with nylon or natural bristles. Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut one end of the brush at an angle **(1)**. Cut only the top half of the bristle pack.

**1** : Cut brush at an angle

  Move down the brush head. Penetrate into it with the tip of the scissors, gather the bristles at an angle, and cut again **(2)**.

**2** : Trim away tip of brush

  Turn the brush so it faces you. Halfway into the brush, gather the bristles and cut them to an angle opposite the one you just made **(3)**. After chopping and changing the top half of the bristle pack, turn it over and repeat the process on the other side.

**3** : Cut at an opposite angle

**SGRAFFITO**

In Italian, _sgraffito_ means "scratch." In pottery, you scratch through one or more layers of material, exposing what's underneath. One of the more appealing aspects of sgraffito is the immediacy with which you can achieve imagery.

This versatile technique can be used at almost any time in the ceramic process. Let's say you've just thrown a pot, and while it's still on the wheel you paint it with white engobe. Drawing with a throwing stick through the still-wet engobe, you expose the moist clay body underneath.

I think it's best to let the engobe dry a bit to get a clean, defined line. Choose a translucent glaze to allow the design to show through after the pot is fired.

  After trimming the pot, use a thick, soft hake brush to apply an opaque coat of white engobe or porcelain slip on your pot **(1)**. For full opacity, you may want to allow the first coat to dry somewhat and then apply a second coat.

**1** : Apply engobe

  Use the teeth of a hacksaw blade to cut through the engobe and create a curving, serrated pattern from base to neck **(2)**. Use the sharp point of the blade to carve more deeply, across the serrations, to create a sense of depth **(3)**.

**2** : Create pattern from base to neck

**3** : Carve deeply with sharp, pointed blade

  Leaves are carved along the stems with the round end of the blade **(4)**. Just one tool can be used to achieve a variety of line qualities.

**4** : Carve leaves with a round blade

  Finally, the sharp end of the blade is used again to incise flecks that accent the overall pattern **(5)**. The bottle is left to dry and will be bisque fired later **(6)**.

**6** : Leave pot to dry, then bisque fire

**practicing brushwork**

Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned potter, you'll want to make some practice strokes before applying a brush to a bisque-fired pot.

Like paint, engobes vary in texture depending on their viscosity. And every brush is capable of unique expression because of the type, density, and length of its fibers. Whether you're planning to work with natural or synthetic fibers, experiment until you find brushes that suit your style.

  Starting at the top of a large piece of absorbent paper, like newsprint or bristol, make simple brush marks, applying different pressures as you go **(1)**. Use a thin brush to make loose gestures **(2)**. Note how the hand holds the brush differently this time.

**1** : Apply different pressure

**2** : Experiment with a thin brush

  A long, thin nylon brush is perfect for fine lines. The hand leads the brush for this stroke **(3)**. A wide brush, called a hake, can hold a lot of engobe and is perfect for filling in large spaces **(4)**.

**3** : Practice long, fine lines

**4** : Practice with a hake brush

  On a new sheet of paper, practice various patterns. Try to use the bristles in different ways, from the tip to the base **(5)**.

**5** : Experiment with various patterns

  An absorbant mullite kiln shelf, coated with kiln wash, is a great surface for practicing brushwork **(6)**. It's easy to clean the shelf when you're finished.

**6** : Paint onto a kiln shelf for practice

**COLOR ENGOBE MOTIF**

Colors stand out on a lighter background more than they might on a darker one. This sort of contrast between color and canvas can be achieved either by making the pot with white clay, or by applying a white engobe on a darker pot and then painting on top of it with a colored engobe.

I'll demonstrate two techniques for applying engobe: dipping and brushing. Both are done when the trimmed pot is still leather-hard. If you plan to cover lots of pots with a white engobe and then decorate them with colorful motifs, make up a 5-gallon (19L) bucketful of engobe (recipe is on this page) and dip-glaze them. Dipping is a simple way to get a smooth, consistent coating for your brushwork.

  Hold the leather-hard pot upside down by its foot ring **(1)**. Submerge the pot for 2 or 3 seconds, to allow the engobe time to be absorbed **(2)**. Pull the pot out in one smooth motion—don't splash. Any unevenness in the coating will be visible, even after firing it. When the mouth of the pot clears the liquid, hold the pot upside down long enough to let the engobe dry a bit. If there's a drip on the lip, rotate the pot back and forth.

**1** : Hold pot by its foot ring

**2** : Submerge pot

  When the engobe has dried a bit, it's safe to hold the pot upright **(3)**. Allow the engobe time to firm up. Center the pot on the wheel or, as here, on a banding wheel. (The left hand turns the wheel while the right does the decorating. Spin the wheel at a moderately fast speed.)

**3** : Hold pot upright when engobe firms up

  Brush on fine banding lines at the rim **(4)** and along the bottom edge of the engobe **(5)**. This engobe was colored with red iron oxide. Using different parts of the brush, paint variations on the same floral motif around the bottle **(6)**.

**4** : Brush banding line on rim

**5** : Apply fine lines at bottom edge

**6** : Paint motif

**colorants**

A colorant is a dry ingredient that you add to a mixed base formula. Being inorganic in origin, a colorant is the "spice" in a recipe: with some you use a lot, and others only a little; it depends. The amount of colorant that will go into a base mixture is expressed as a percentage of the recipe's total volume. For example, to 100 grams of the base recipe, you might add, say, 3 percent (i.e., 3 grams) of chrome oxide, which is a colorant used to obtain a chrome green. (The same rule applies to any glaze recipe that you mix yourself.)

The manufactured material that can be used to give color to an engobe, in amounts from 5 to 18 percent, is called a stain. Stains are fired combinations of various oxides, silica, and fluxes, and are consistent and reliable, though some aren't suitable for temperatures higher than cone 6, or for a reduction atmosphere. Stains containing cadmium, selenium, vanadium, and praseodymium usually produce dynamic variations on yellow, orange, and red. If you are firing to high temperatures, or in a reduction atmosphere, ask your supplier if the stain you plan to use is appropriate. Find out more about colorants on this page.

Mixing pigments on glazed tiles

**glazes**

Glaze is essentially a combination of materials that, when heated enough, fuses with the clay pot surface, melts, and then cools to a hard—though not necessarily shiny—finish. The process of glazing is possibly the most complex element in the art of pottery. After all, it's in the glaze and subsequent firing where the greatest number of mineral oxides interact, creating endless variations in the finished results.

Mastering the technique of glazing requires a bit of practice. There are commercial, premixed glazes that you can use with sure results. But at some point, you might wonder what is actually in a glaze. What causes the depth of a particular color? Can I create my own custom glaze? Creating your own glaze is a satisfying pursuit that combines geology, mathematics, chemistry, and creativity. It's also a fun way to expand your decorative repertoire. You can follow a glaze formula to create your own, which isn't that different than working with a recipe in the kitchen (see this page for recipes).

Glazes are comprised of mineral oxides that are quarried and mined, just like clay. Glaze recipes require three essential types of oxides: fluxes, stabilizers, and glass formers. Common fluxes are sodium, potassium, and calcium; these lower the melting points of materials like silica and alumina. A glaze needs a stabilizer like alumina or boric oxide to regulate the melting glaze's flow and viscosity; either of these gives body to the glaze. (Boric oxide is also a glass former and strong flux.) Silica is the main glass former in both glass and glaze.

Most glazes also contain either ball clay or kaolin, which suspends the liquid glaze in the bucket, helps a glaze bond to the pot, provides silica and alumina for the glass and body structure of the glaze, and adds to the glaze's durability. Having clay in a glaze formula makes the surface harder, less dusty, and easier to paint an additional colorant on the dry glaze surface before firing it.

Glazes come in an endless variety of finishes but the main types are glossy, satin, and matte. A glossy glaze on the interior of a functional pot is sometimes called a "liner," and it makes dishwashing easier. Satin glazes are soft to the touch, though some scratch easily. Matte glazes have a dry look; most don't run when melted, so they're ideal for painting patterns or images. You can combine multiple glazes on one pot. For example, apply a glaze that melts aggressively over a less melty matte one to create beautiful color blends and fields.

A glaze is sometimes described by how much light can pass through it. The three most common light-refracting characteristics are transparent, translucent, and opaque. A transparent glaze is clear and glossy; it has enough flux to thoroughly melt all the other materials but no opacifiers or other coloring oxides in its formula. Translucent glazes vary from clear to somewhat opaque (due to the presence of colorants or opacifiers). The more opaque glazes can have a satin or matte finish.

A glaze coating can be decorative in itself, or a vehicle for some sort of decoration. Either way, glaze always interacts with the clay underneath it. Their relationship is called the clay body-glaze interface. For instance, if you paint a motif on a pot using an engobe and then cover the pot with a glaze, there will surely be an interaction when the piece is fired. Sometimes it's a subtle one, allowing the lines to remain crisp. Other times, if the engobe is vitreous enough, and the glaze melts enough, the coloring oxides in the engobe are drawn up into the glaze. Highly fluxed engobes bleed into the glaze. On-glaze colorants are also a great way to add marks, images, or motifs to the top of a layer of glaze; the result is usually soft-edged lines.

Glaze colors are dependent upon, and influenced by, the temperatures to which the pottery is fired. A very low firing temperature (cone 018) is used to fire delicate gold and silver luster enamels. An excellent range of cherry reds, lemon-yellows, burnt-oranges and turquoise blues are possible with cone 04. Mid- and high-fire temperatures (cones 6 to 10) don't offer as much range, due to coloring oxides and high heat, but there is an unequaled depth of color.

Techniques for applying glazes to your ware, and the equipment and tools used, can be simple: pouring, dipping, brushing, spraying, and dabbing, to name more than a few. The important thing is to get the right amount of glaze on your pot for the effect that you would like. This takes experience and trial and error. Glazes can be fussy, so make sure that you keep good notes, and keep practicing!

**leach glazes**

Using high-temperature clay bodies and glazes has been a Leach family tradition dating back to the early twentieth century when my grandfather, Bernard, began making pots. However, our family has also produced earthenware pottery and I have done raku at times. My grandfather was introduced to raku when he was living in Japan and he was immediately drawn to the excitement of the process. Both my brother Johnny and I continue to use a limited palette that emphasizes a straightforward play between clay body and glaze, melding firing atmosphere, clay body, and glaze together in order to create pots that have a simple beauty, yet are very functional.

**MIXING GLAZE**

You can choose whether to use premixed commercial glaze or explore mixing your own glaze from scratch. In this section I'll show you how to get started with glaze mixing. You'll need some space for the job—though not much—and the following equipment:

  **Fine-particle respirator**

  **Scale (digital or tri-beam balance type)**

  **Clean 5-gallon (19L) buckets***

  **Clean scoops and large spoons**

  **Supply of hot water**

  **Hand drill with augur attachment**

  **80- or 100-mesh sieve***

  **Large liquid measuring cup**

  **Scrub brush or spatula**

* A two-piece sieve bucket has a fitted sieve inset; alternatively, you can hold or rest some other style of sieve over the empty bucket.

The 5-gallon (19L) plastic bucket is a standard container for glaze mixing. It can hold about 8,000 grams of dry glaze materials—plus the necessary amount of water needed for slaking (see next paragraph)—and there will still be enough room left for dipping pots into it without the contents overflowing.

You start with a formula or "recipe," which lists each ingredient as a percentage of the total (i.e., 100 percent, before any colorants are added). From the percentage, you can calculate the weight needed to make a batch of glaze. It takes about 8,000 grams of dry ingredients, plus 800 millilitres of hot water for every 1,000 grams of dry material, to fill a 5-gallon (19L) bucket.

Let's look at a glaze recipe my father, David Leach, formulated; he named it Yi Ching Celadon. On the left side of the table is his recipe, given in percentages; on the right, a factor of 40 is used to convert each percentage into the actual weight needed to fill about half the bucket. (For a full bucket of glaze, you would use a factor of 80 instead.)

YI CHING CELADON

*Red iron oxide .5% multiply .5% by 40: 20 grams *The small amount of colorant used in a glaze won't significantly affect the chemical balance of the major ingredients, so it's never part of the base recipe.

Don't mix dry glaze ingredients together, as that releases a lot of dust into the studio. (You can protect yourself with a fine-particle respirator, but the particles would end up in a lot of other places you don't want them.) Use the "wet method" shown here, instead. You will slake the dry materials with enough water so they achieve maximum absorption.

Whenever you mix a clay body, glaze, or engobe, _always_ start by putting on a respirator. You don't want dust in your lungs. Use scoops whenever you can, and always use water or a vacuum to clean up the mess when you're finished. Never sweep dust.

  Set the digital scale to 0, or balance a triple-beam scale; tare the weight of the empty container. After you weigh each ingredient, sprinkle it over the entire surface of the water using a scoop **(1)**. Even though you're following a fairly simple recipe, write down how much of each ingredient you just added. You never know when you might get distracted.

**1** : Sprinkle dry ingredients over water

  If the recipe calls for bentonite (an agent used to aid in suspension), mix it with hot water in a blender first, so it won't clump **(2)**. When all the ingredients have been weighed and added, use a hand drill with an auger attachment to thoroughly mix the glaze. The glaze should be thick and smooth. No lumps **(3)**.

**2** : Blend bentonite recipes with hot water

**3** : Mixed glazes should be thick and smooth

  Set the sieve in the mouth of a clean bucket. Using a measuring cup, pour only enough glaze into the sieve to fill one-third of it **(4)**. Use a household scrub brush or spatula to gently stir the glaze through the sieve **(5)**. Another way to sieve is to center the bucket and sieve on your potter's wheel. At slow speed, pour the glaze into the sieve while one hand holds the brush still against the mesh **(6)**.

**4** : Sieve glaze into clean bucket

**5** : Stir glaze through sieve

**6** : Alternatively, sieve glaze on potter's wheel

  Clean your bucket into the sieve, so you're sure to get all the materials, and then put a cup of water in the original glaze bucket, swish it around, and pour it through the sieve, too. Wash the mixing bucket and sieve the glaze again. Apply the glaze to a small piece of bisque ware or a test tile. Most glazes should coat the ware with a layer 1/16 inch (1.6mm) thick. If the glaze is too thick, add hot water to thin it. In permanent marker, write the name of the glaze and its firing temperature (i.e., the cone number) on masking tape. Put the label at least on the bucket, not just the lid alone.

Now that the glaze is mixed, you're ready to apply it to your pots. Here, I'll demonstrate basic techniques for applying glaze. There are many more recipes to explore in the appendix on this page. Experiment and keep good notes on what you did along the way. When your pots emerge from the kiln, you'd be surprised at how easily you forgot what glaze you used, and how you did it.

**PARTIAL GLAZE DIP**

Sometimes you will only want to glaze part of a pot, leaving the rest with a natural finish. In this demonstration I'll show you how to coat the interior of a tankard and add partial coatings to the handle and lip. Note that if you plan to partially glaze the lower part of a pot, you need to wax the foot ring before applying glaze (see this page).

  Stir the glaze before you use it, and stir often while you work **(1)**. Some of the ingredients are heavier than others and they settle to the bottom quickly.

**1** : Stir glaze

  Use a measuring cup to pour enough glaze into the pot to fill it three-quarters full **(2)**. (Always coat the interior first with this technique.) Set down the measuring cup right away, so that hand is free to help control the outpour.

**2** : Fill pot three-quarters full

  Slowly pour the glaze out of the mug, turning it as you do **(3)**. Time the outpouring so it can cover the entire interior without creating overlapping layers **(4)**.

**3** : Start pouring out glaze at handle and twist

**4** : Be sure to cover entire interior

  As soon as you've finished pouring the glaze out, dip the handle to the desired level. Hold the mug there, to the count of 3, and remove it slowly.

  To glaze just the rim, dip the mug to the desired depth. Hold it there to a count of 3 or 4, so the glaze can be absorbed by the bisque ware **(5)**. Remove the mug slowly and levelly. Hold the mug upside down until the glaze dries enough that it won't drip down the exterior. Rotate the mug to help the drip smooth out (drips may show after the firing) **(6)**. Place the mug on the ware board to dry.

**5** : Dip pot into glaze just past rim

**6** : Rotate mug to smooth out drips

**WAXING AND GLAZING**

During a firing, superheated glaze becomes tacky and sticky, then melts and becomes permanently fused to whatever it's in contact with. Wax resist protects areas of a pot from being coated with glaze, so that the piece won't fuse itself to the kiln shelf it sits on during the firing. Waxing can also be used decoratively to create lively motifs and patterns. Some typical areas to wax would be a foot, a base, or a rim. You can put wax just under the lip of a teapot spout and that tiny break in the glaze there keeps the spout from dribbling.

One last note: be sure to immediately wipe off any drops of glaze clinging to waxed areas. Just putting wax resist on a pot isn't enough to keep the glaze off that area. Remove glaze droplets from the wax coating with a damp sponge.

**WAXING A FOOT RING**

The bottle in this demonstration has a small foot ring and a narrow neck, so it is being held in an open chuck. An equally effective option is to invert your pot into any sort of cylinder of an appropriate size, with a wide-enough mouth.

  Brush wax onto the foot ring **(1)**. Carefully heat the wax with a blow dryer only until it becomes glossy **(2)**.

**1** : Brush wax on foot ring

**2** : Blow dry wax until it's glossy

  Set the pot aside until the wax cools and stiffens; this can take minutes, or even hours, depending on your studio conditions and the quality of the wax. A good trick is to let the wax dry for several minutes and then put the pot in a refrigerator. You might then softly rub your finger over it, to tighten the surface of the wax. (Be careful not to smear it.) Now you're ready to glaze.

**DIP-GLAZING A BOTTLE**

  Use a measuring cup to pour enough glaze to fill the bottle one-quarter full **(1)**. Vigorously and quickly swish the glaze around **(2)**. As you pour it out, turn the bottle in your hands, so the glaze can have a chance to coat the inside of the mouth entirely **(3)**.

**1** : Pour glaze into bottle

**2** : Swish glaze to coat interior

**3** : Pour out glaze

  Immediately submerge the inverted pot in the glaze by pushing down on the foot ring **(4)**. Try not to touch unwaxed areas (unless you want your fingerprints to show). Carefully but quickly push the pot under the surface of the glaze, past your fingertips **(5)**. Hold the pot steady. Don't let it roll to one side.

**4** : Submerge pot by pushing on foot ring

**5** : Hold down a few seconds

  Reach into the bucket with your free hand and put one fingertip on the lip of the bottle **(6)**. Steadily and smoothly lift the pot out of the glaze. Hold the pot upside down until the glaze dries enough that it won't drip or run **(7)**. When the pot is dry enough to handle, use a small sponge to clean up the foot ring **(8, 9)** and touch up areas with finger marks.

**6** : Remove with both hands

**7** : Hold upside down until dry

**8** : Clean foot ring with sponge

**9** : Waxed foot ring is glaze-free

**GLAZING A LIDDED CASSEROLE**

To make sure that a lid and its pot will still fit well after firing, they must travel the rigors of the kiln together. The pot should be fired with its lid in place, and where the two are in contact they must be glaze-free. In this demonstration, the gallery seating of a casserole and the lid's rim are waxed. I used a natural bristle brush and water-based wax resist.

  Tap-center the casserole and lid on a banding wheel (or your potter's wheel, if you prefer). Where the lid meets the casserole's gallery, draw a pencil line **(1)**.

**1** : Draw pencil line

  Remove the lid, making sure the casserole stays on center **(2)**. Have the wax and brush stand on the side of your dominant hand, so you're less likely to drip wax on your pot by crossing over the top of it with a loaded brush. (Wax is nearly impossible to scrape off; if you accidentally drip, you'll have to refire the unglazed pot to 600°F / 316°C to remove it.) Fill the brush with wax and then use the edge of the wax container to drain a little off the brush. With the wheel turning moderately fast, carefully apply the wax _underneath_ the pencil line **(3)** , where the lid will be touching the pot. If you're going to glaze the exterior of the pot, wax the foot, too.

**2** : Remove lid

**3** : Apply wax to inside of pencil line

  Place the lid, upside down, in a centered open chuck **(4)**. Center and level the lid. Apply wax to the areas of the lid that will be in contact with the pot: the underside, edge, and a bit of the top **(5)**. Wax an area large enough so that if the glaze moves as it melts, the two won't fuse together.

**4** : Place lid in open chuck

**5** : Apply wax to edge of lid's rim

  Stir the glaze before using it. With one hand, tip the pot _at an angle_ over the mouth of the bucket. Use a measuring cup to pour the glaze smoothly into the casserole **(6)**. Swirl the glaze slowly around the interior. Be sure to angle the pot so the glaze can meet the wax line on the gallery **(7)**. Quickly pour the excess glaze out of one side of the pot **(8)**. Clean off stray glaze with a small moist sponge **(9)**. Set the pot aside to dry.

**6** : Pour glaze in pot

**7** : Swirl glaze

**8** : Pour out glaze

**9** : Clean glaze off of waxed rim with sponge

  To glaze the lid, hold it upside down over the bucket and fill it about half full **(10)**. Carefully swirl glaze all around the entire lid interior, right up to the wax line **(11)**.

**10** : Fill lid half full with glaze

**11** : Swirl glaze up to wax line

  Pour the glaze out one side of the lid **(12)**. Immediately wipe the edge of the lid clean with a moist sponge. When the glaze is dry enough not to drip, set the lid into the casserole. It's ready to fire.

**12** : Pour glaze out of lid and then clean

**WOOD ASH PATINA**

Have you ever looked at a pot that seems to be unglazed, and yet it has a most organic-looking patina? If its hues are golden, off-green, or a rich brown, chances are it's wood ash that did it. Believe it or not, that's a glaze. A tree's roots draw mineral oxides out of the ground and into their wood and bark. Firewood is used as fuel in a wood-fired kiln, the light and fluffy ash drifts through the chamber, alighting on and sticking to the pots. If the temperature gets hot enough, the ash melts.

No matter where you live, in deep forest or concrete jungle, it's possible for you to achieve a similar effect on your pots. Whether you use an electric or a gas kiln, you can make a decorative ash glaze. To make the ash, you'll need any kind of wood kindling, a garbage can lid, some paper to help get the fire started, and a metal bowl to contain the ashes.

  To make the fire catch more quickly, split the wood into three different sizes: thin, medium, and thick. Wad several pieces of paper and place them in the center of the garbage can lid. Light the paper and quickly put the thinnest wood first onto the pile. Add the medium-sized wood next, crossing the pieces as shown in photo **1**.

**1** : Start fire on trash can lid

  Add the large wood last. Let the fire burn to ash. Scoop the ashes into a metal container **(2)**. Wearing a respirator, scoop small amounts of ash into a 40- to 60-mesh sieve, to process it **(3)**. Push the ash through the sieve with a plastic card or household brush **(4)**. Bounce the sieve above the bucket occasionally to release the ash from the mesh **(5)**. Sieved ash should be very fine **(6)**. Keep it dry in a covered, marked container. For ash patina recipes, see this page.

**3** : Sieve ash into a container

**6** : Sieved ash should be fine

**SPRAY APPLICATION**

While wood ash patina can be applied to green ware, it's advisable to first bisque your pot. The material is so fragile, it is easy to accidentally brush off. Spray it on right before you load the pot into the kiln for the final glaze firing. All you need is an atomizer, which can be purchased from a ceramic supply dealer or art supply store. Re-fire the pot to a very high temperature (cone 8 and above) so the ash can melt enough to become a glaze. Always test an effect on a tile before committing your pots to the flame.

  Glaze the interior of your pot first **(1)** , then apply the exterior glaze. Place your pots on a ware board and spray the ash on with the atomizer **(2)**. Apply it patchily, to get a more natural effect. Don't spray it on too thickly because it can become crusty and rough. If you spray it near the foot of the pot, make sure you clean it well. Remember, wood ash turns into glaze. Always clean your atomizer as soon as you've finished using it.

**ON-GLAZE COLORANTS**

On-glaze colorants are mixtures of coloring oxides, flux, and sometimes a bit of clay to help flow and adhesion. These ceramic "paints" are usually mixed to a slightly more watery consistency than glaze because they are applied right on top of an unfired layer of glaze. The fired effect of on-glaze colorants usually looks more ethereal than that of an engobe or underglaze. (The engobe or underglaze is applied underneath a clear glaze, resulting in sharper detail. An on-glaze colorant melts outward into the layer of glaze, and is blurrier.)

On-glaze colorants can be used on any kind of glaze and in any type of firing. A typical recipe for an iron-red on-glaze colorant might be:

---

Red iron oxide | 75

Ball clay | 25

Total | 100

In this recipe, the iron is the colorant, but you can substitute some other coloring oxide if you like (see this page). For lighter tones, adjust the formula by reducing the percentage of the coloring oxide (here, 75 percent of the total weight) and then increasing the percentages of clay and perhaps adding a flux, like potash feldspar. Mix these ingredients with water to a yogurt-like thickness.

  The pot you intend to paint should be bisque fired and freshly glazed. Pour a small amount of concentrated on-glaze colorant onto a ceramic tile or other non porous surface. Add drops of water until you're satisfied with the consistency **(1)**. In most cases, you don't want the pigment to be too watery or it may run down the pot.

**1** : Add drops of water to colorant concentrate

  Try a test swipe on the tile to make sure you've got it right **(2)**. (See Practicing Brushwork on this page.) To paint rings around the rim and neck, first put the pot on a banding wheel or in a chuck on the potter's wheel. With the wheel spinning fast, start with a fine line at the rim; add a bit more pressure if you want the line to be wider.

**2** : Practice brushing the design

  For a motif like the one shown here, make the widest stroke in the motif first. Paint lightly and quickly. Use only the tip of the brush for the end of the short stroke **(3)**. Three or four dots of wax are added at the feather tips of each stroke.

**3** : Paint design lightly and quickly

**troubleshooting on-glaze colorants**

If the brush with the colorant keeps sticking to the glaze it might be because your glaze is "dusty" (low in clay content and therefore lacking in surface hardness), so take care when you pick up glazed pots not to smudge or mar the surface. To correct the problem, you can add a gum solution to the on-glaze colorant, in the same way you would for an acrylic or oil paint. Gum is available from most ceramic supply stores. Add enough hot water to the powdered gum to make it syrupy and thick; stir until it's thoroughly dissolved. Add 1 tablespoon (15ml) of gum solution for every 100 milliliters of on-glaze colorant. Gum burns out at a low temperature and leaves no trace.

**WAX RESIST DECORATION**

Wax resist decoration is very similar to _pysanka_ (Ukrainian egg decorating) and _batik_ (a method for dyeing textiles). Wherever you apply the wax, the glaze can't stick. A waxed area on a bisque surface resists the glaze you dip the pot into. After firing, the area you waxed is left as unglazed ceramic.

Wax resist can be used at almost any stage in the production of a ceramic piece. It is possible to build up layers of glaze or on-glaze colorants by applying wax resist at different stages. You can even use wax resist on leather-hard or dry clay to develop imagery with engobes or slips.

  To use wax resist and two glazes to create amotif, glaze your pot with a base glaze but don't fire it. Photo **1** shows a pot being dipped into a shiny, ironsaturated glaze. Thoroughly clean the foot of the pot **(2)**. Handle it carefully, so you don't chip the glaze off its lip. If it happens, though, repair the spot by dabbing a few drops of glaze there **(3)**.

**1** : Glaze pot

**2** : Clean foot of pot

**3** : Repair chipped glaze

  Pour a small amount of cold wax into a shallow container. Add just enough water to make it slightly runny **(4)**. Paint your motif onto the pot in wax **(5)**. Let the wax dry and stiffen. Dip the pot again in a second glaze, only far enough to cover the motif **(6)**. Quickly pull the pot from the glaze. Keep it upside down until the second glaze dries a bit.

**4** : Add water to wax

**5** : Paint motif onto pot

**6** : Dip pot in glaze again

  You might want to use a small moist sponge to clean the waxed areas, although the small dots of glaze can be quite beautiful when they melt into the glaze. Clean your wax brush in _hot_ water as soon as you're finished, and discard the remainder of the wax; it's contaminated with glaze and shouldn't be reused.

Red hot raku pots

**kilns and firing**

There are few experiences that equal the excitement potters feel when unloading glazed pots from a kiln. Nothing beats that first moment of holding your own pot and studying the qualities it has acquired in the tremendous heat of the kiln. The many changes that take place during a firing can appear mysterious and magical and at times it can seem like there's almost too much to be known. There's always something to be learned about this fascinating process, and learning from your mistakes can help you be more creative and successful.

Electric kiln;

Gas kiln;

**KILNS**

Kilns are the furnaces that potters use to fire their pots by means of applying controlled, high heat. A kiln is classified first by the fuel it uses. "Atmospheric" kilns are fired with gas (below, right), oil, or wood. In atmospheric designs, the potter adjusts dampers in order to promote various atmospheres in the chamber where the pots are being fired. Increasing the amount of air creates an "oxidation" atmosphere and reducing it creates a "reduction" atmosphere. With attention to timing, reduction produces unique (i.e., no two alike) effects on clays and glazes.

Electric kilns (below, left) generally provide an oxidation atmosphere, but the effects of the firing are more predictable. The oxidation atmosphere in an electric kiln is a result of there not being an open flame to consume oxygen molecules. The colors of fired ceramic bodies are usually lighter in oxidation than they would be after a reduction firing, and the achievable color range of glazes is greater in oxidation.

A raku kiln (shown at right) is a quick-firing, normally gas-fueled design, often made out of steel mesh and ceramic fiber blanket. The raku process involves unloading glowing red-hot pots with tongs one by one and placing them in individual containers called "reducing bins" with wood shavings or similar combustible organic matter.

With the notable exception of pit-firing, wood-fired kilns are the very oldest type of kiln and, depending on cultural traditions, can come in radically different designs.

No matter which type of kiln you use, care must be taken with its setup and usage to safeguard yourself, your studio, and the environment. Heated clays and glazes produce gases, and some of these may be toxic. Check local ordinances on emissions and related matters, and follow the kiln manufacturer's guidelines. Gas kilns need secure and of course leak-free connections on the burners and lines to their fuel tanks; electric kilns require absolutely sound wiring. All kilns must be set on concrete or other heat-resistant pads and require proper venting, as well as your watchfulness every time they're fired.

**TELLING TEMPERATURE**

A good firing is one in which the form, clay, and glaze are perfectly melded. There are an infinite number of variables that come into play during the melting of glaze materials and the vitrification of the clay itself, and you'll want as much information as possible so that this part of the ceramic process doesn't turn into a big disappointment.

The kiln's heating rate and final temperature require careful control no matter which type of kiln, clay, or glaze you use, and you'll learn a lot after you open the kiln and look inside. You can determine that the kiln has reached the right temperature in three different ways: by color, pyrometer, and cones. As a kiln gets hotter, its materials and atmosphere undergo changes in color. Judging by color takes a lot of experience; it's best to use cones or a pyrometer. Some kilns are outfitted with an electronic controller that does the analyzing and adjusting for you **(1)**. Another common approach, suitable for any kind of kiln, is using one or more pyrometric cones, which are made of refractory materials and record the heat-work that is taking place during the firing (that is, how your control of the kiln is progressing). A supplementary device, often used in conjunction with cones, is the pyrometer **(2)**.

**1** : Digital controller with pyrometer

Use a pyrometer to gauge the kiln's internal temperature—you can't open the kiln while it's firing! The pyrometer only gauges specific heat levels (though some have an oxygen probe, to assess the atmosphere), but not how the ceramic material is reacting; for that, there is the pyrometric cone. This small, pyramid-shaped device is placed in the kiln before the firing and measures the heating rate in degrees. Cones are numbered in steps, from 022 (very low temperature) up to 14 (the highest practical temperature for firing handmade ceramic pots). Earthenware clays are usually fired between cone 09 (1688°F / 920°C) and cone 02 (2016°F / 1102°C). Stoneware may be fired in the range of cones 04 to 10 (1945°F / 1063°C to 2345°F / 1285°C). Most porcelain clays are fired to temperatures between cones 6 (2232°F / 1222°C) and 10 (2345°F / 1285°C). See the pyrometric cone chart on this page.

**2** : Analog pyrometer with thermocouple

**finding the fired shrinkage rate**

Back in chapter 1, you learned how to work clay into tiles to find out its dry shrinkage rate. Now you're ready to test-fire those tiles, starting with a bisque firing to 1728°F / 942°C. In a notebook, make note of how much more shrinkage has occurred. Do some additional firings, gradually increasing the temperature with each subsequent firing:

1728°F / 942°C, or cone 08

1945°F / 1063°C, or cone 04

2232°F / 1222°C, or cone 6

2345°F / 1285°C, or cone 10

  Each of the tiles in photo **1** was made with the same clay. Each was fired to one of the cone temperatures above (from left to right). It's easy to see how the clay's fired color changes due to the firing temperature. The tile in photo **2** was bisque fired to cone 08. Its fired length is 9.3cm and the total shrinkage rate, from wet to fired, is 7 percent.

**1** : Same clay fired at four different temperatures

**2** : Tile bisque fired to cone 08

  The test tile in photo **3** was fired to cone 10 and measures 7.6cm as a result. This tile has a substantial shrinkage rate of 24 percent, which is so high that warping and cracking are likely. Handles and spouts would move a great deal as the pots dry and are fired. A good way to address the problem is to add percentages of grog, silica sand, or fire clay . . . or a combination of all three. Adding these materials will drive down the shrinkage rate. Using fire clay will raise the clay's melting point.

**3** : Tile fired to cone 10

  The test tile in photo **4** is the same clay, fired to cone 10 again, but with 5 percent silica sand, 5 percent fine grog, and 2.5 percent fire clay added. Now look at the shrinkage rate: 13 percent. This is stoneware clay; its color is slightly lighter, and there's no warping.

**4** : Silica, grog, and fire clay added, fired to cone 10

You might wonder why not use the cone 08 bisque temperature and skip the modifications? The cone 10 firing vitrifies the ceramic more fully, and the result is a stronger fired pot.

**CONE PACKS**

Pyrometric cones are one of several ways to monitor the firing process. Instead of setting the cone directly on a kiln shelf, you embed it at the proper angle in a wad of clay and let the clay dry.

**BISQUE FIRING**

Usually, a single cone that matches your target temperature is sufficient for a bisque firing.

  Dip a small wad of the same clay that your pots are made with into silica sand. Work the sand into the wad **(1)**. The sand helps evaporating steam escape during the firing, so the wad won't explode. The triangular cone has been made to lean in one direction, and it will bend that way when its rated temperature is reached **(2)**. Push the cone down into the wad of clay so that it leans at the proper angle **(3)**. Don't stand the cone perfectly straight up! Use a wire or needle tool to poke holes into the clay wad **(4)**. This, too, helps evaporation. Let the clay dry thoroughly before you use it.

**1** : Work silica sand into wad of clay

**2** : Cone is made to lean

**3** : Push cone into clay at angle

**4** : Poke holes into clay wad

**GLAZE FIRING**

The cones, representing different temperatures, act as monitors for various stages in the progress of glaze firing; this is especially helpful in a reduction firing. A reduction atmosphere (gas and wood-fired kilns) requires the potter to make adjustments—based on assessments of the process as it's happening—throughout the firing. The programmed electric kiln (oxidation atmosphere) has streamlined much of the work, but you still can benefit from the feedback that only a cone pack provides. Two types of packs will be shown here: cone 10 firing and cone 04 firing.

Fired cones

  Roll out a short coil of clay and flatten it. Use a fork to create furrows all along the length of the coil **(1)**. Position the lowest-temperature cone first, as shown in photo **2** , so that it will be able to bend unimpeded. (Here, I'm using an 08 cone. When I can see through the kiln's peephole that it has bent properly, that's the signal it's time to start the reduction phase of the firing.)

**1** : Create furrows in clay with fork

**2** : Position lowest-temperature cone first

  Position the second cone with the next-highest rated temperature (cone 2) as shown in photo **3**. There should be enough room between the two so that the second cone can bend properly, too. This one will signal that vitrification is taking place, so that I can minimize the reduction atmosphere and let the kiln heat more quickly. The third cone is cone 8 **(4)**. It signals the initiation of the glaze reduction phase and warns me that the firing is in its final stages.

**3** : Position cone 2 next

**4** : Position cone 8 next

**5** : Cone 9 is the warning cone

  Cone 9 is next **(5)**. When it bends, it's also a heads-up warning that my target cone-10 temperature is imminent. Once it has bent, the desired peak temperature has been reached **(6)**. When the tip touches down, the firing is finished. Cone 11 is the guard cone **(7)**. The fired cone pack shows that the kiln reached the target temperature but did not get hot enough to melt the guard cone **(8)**.

**6** : Position cone 10, the target, next

**7** : Cone 11 is the guard cone

**8** : Fired cone pack, with guard cone still standing

  As another example, if you were doing a cone 04 firing, cones 05, 04, and 03 might be used **(9)**. For this firing, use cone 05 for the warning cone, 04 for the target, and 03 for the guard. No matter what type of kiln or atmosphere you fire in, increasing the temperature much past that needed for the guard cone to bend will have negative effects on your pots.

**9** : Cone 03 guard; cone 04 target; cone 05 warning

**BISQUE AND GLAZE FIRING**

Pots are usually fired twice. Though a bare, unfired pot may look and feel dry, the first firing drives out every last vestige of water—even the kind called "chemical water"—and expels, as gas, any foreign bodies. The initial firing process transforms the clay into an irreversible ceramic state called bisque.

Each of the three major types of clay—earthenware, stoneware, and the group of high-fire clays that include porcelain—is fired to bisque by controlling the rate at which the kiln reaches the temperature necessary for that clay to become hard, yet still porous. Bisque firings can be accomplished in any kind of kiln, as long as it's done in an oxidizing atmosphere.

Bisque firings are done to lower temperatures and can take a longer time than the typically hotter glaze firing. Controlling the rate, duration, and firing temperature allows waters and gases to leave the clay without causing the damage that a quick, hot firing would do. Clay thick ness (no greater than ½ inch, or 13mm) and the degree of wetness still present also play roles in how the clay responds to the firing process.

The effective firing range needed to attain the bisque state must be adjusted for the qualities of the materials that make up the clay. The clay manufacturer will provide guidelines for a suitable firing range, but you should expect to do some testing, too. Typically during a second firing, the glaze coating becomes glass-like and fuses to the vitrified clay. Some glazes may be fired in either oxidation or reduction; others work only in one of these specifically. One example of this is a glaze that uses copper as a colorant. In reduction, it might turn red, but in oxidation the same glaze is green.

No matter what kind of pots you make, you have the option of using either a premixed (commercial) glaze or one of the glaze recipes given in this book (see this page). Keep in mind, however, that not all hand-mixed glazes are food-safe. Commercially made glazes are marked with that information.

Glazes are greatly affected by firing temperatures. Generally, the higher the firing temperature, the more limited the range of glaze colors possible. Lower-fire temperatures, used for earthenware mostly, offer a rainbow of glaze color options. The most durable pots are made with high-density clays, well fitted to their glazes, and fired to high temperatures, like cone 10.

Most modern electric kilns are equipped with a digital controller that can be easily programmed to fire the kiln. The controller utilizes segments to regulate the firing process, and each segment contains three stages. The rate of increase in the kiln's temperature is called the 1) ramp. That ramp is paired with a 2) target temperature. The third is the 3) soak, or hold. The hold is the length of time that the target temperature is to remain constant, and it allows water or gases to be driven off, or some form of heat treatment to take place. You can set a programmable electric kiln to make all these adjustments for you, though you must always attend the kiln throughout its firing process. In the case where you don't have an electric kiln with a controller and are instead using a gas or wood-fired kiln, you can always approximate a similar firing program by using the Bisque Firing Cycle at right. For this you will need a pyrometer (see more about telling temperatures on this page).

In any event, have an advance plan for what you'll do if something goes wrong. Keep fire-safety equipment nearby and practice how to use it.

As for me, I fire my glazes in three different atmospheres, to three different temperatures, to get three different results: bisque firing, high-temperature glaze firing, and raku. The first two I fire in my gas kiln. Pots made with a raku clay body get a low-temperature firing in a small gas raku kiln.

**bisque firing cycle**

Because the purpose of the first firing is to drive off residual water, all clays can be successfully bisque fired within a temperature range that is equivalent to cones 10 to 6. The peak temperature I recommend, 1670°F / 910°C, can be attained at the rate of 190°F / 105.5°C per hour (3°F / 1.6°C per minute). Monitor the rate with the pyrometer in the earlier stages of firing; the cone pack will tell the rest of the story. With so many variables at play, testing and note taking can be very helpful.

**PREPARING THE KILN**

  The real guts of a kiln are its interior surfaces and the "furniture" (shelves and supports) that can be stacked inside it **(1)**. Like other interior parts of the kiln, the furniture is made from refractory materials that won't melt at high firing temperatures. In electric kilns, only clay-based shelving should be used **(2)**. For atmospheric kilns, you can use silicon carbide or clay furniture.

**1** : Examples of kiln posts

**2** : Kiln shelving

  Before loading your pots into the kiln, inspect previously used shelves and posts for glaze drips, flaking kiln wash (a protective, heat-resistant solution), and cracks. The first two can stick to the bottoms of pots; a cracked shelf can break during a firing. If a shelf is cracked more than one-quarter of the way across, take it out of service. Don't discard a cracked shelf, though; break it into chips **(3)** with a hammer and use them for post extensions **(4)**.

**3** : Break cracked kiln shelves into chips

**4** : Kiln shelf chips can be used as extensions

  To grind shelves, you need tools. Photo **5** shows a 4½-inch (11cm) electric grinder with a diamond disk (at left) and a masonry rub brick (at right). Either tool will do the job. Grinding produces a lot of dust, so work in a well-ventilated space, and wear a good respirator and safety glasses. Hold the disk of the electric grinder at a slight angle **(6)** , or use the flat surface of the brick **(7)**. Occasionally, post ends will need to be grinded, so they can stand straight **(8)**.

**6** : Hold grinder at a slight angle

**7** : Use flat surface of masonry rub brick

**8** : Grind a post end, if needed, to level it

  During the firing, your pots must sit on the shelves. Because there are fluxes in every clay body, some melting will occur. Even if you've been fastidious about cleaning glaze from the bottoms of your pots, they can still fuse to the shelf. Use a kiln wash made of equal parts alumina hydrate and EPK kaolin for any kind of shelf or post end, in any type of kiln. Mix them with enough water to get the solution to the consistency of cream.

  With a housepaint brush, apply a thin coat of kiln wash to the shelves **(9)**. You don't want to paint it on too thickly or it may peel or flake off during firing. Apply kiln wash to _one side_ only.

**9** Apply kiln wash to one side of shelves

You may want to dip up to ½ inch (1.3cm) of the post ends in kiln wash, too. Dip them only once in a while, or when needed. Finally, always be sure to clean the edges and side walls of your shelves with a sponge and water. Heated kiln wash can peel off the side of a shelf and fall into the pots below it.

Kiln furniture

**LOADING A BISQUE KILN**

When your pots are bone-dry—not cool to the touch—they are called green ware, and they are ready to be bisque fired. Since fuel efficiency is of paramount concern, it's best to wait until your studio's shelves are filled with mugs, bowls, and jars. The tighter you can stack your green ware in the kiln, the better. In most cases, you will be able to fit more pots into a bisque firing than in a glaze firing because the unglazed pots can touch each other and even be stacked one inside another. A tightly packed kiln, full of pots and furniture that absorb and conduct heat, ensures a more even distribution, or conduction, of that heat. In gas kilns, stacking tightly is especially important because open spaces might otherwise create flame paths that would cause uneven heating. If firing with gas, make sure the burners are cleaned of any foreign matter on or near the orifices. If you're using an electric kiln, vacuum the elements. Loose debris on heating elements can cause overheating and degrade the elements more quickly.

  The first shelf is always placed on top of posts set on the kiln floor. Three posts should be spaced triangularly, so that they support two corners of the long sides of the shelf and the center of the shelf's short side. On that first shelf place three more posts, aligned over the floor posts underneath **(1)**. Then the kiln is ready to be loaded with pots. In my gas kiln, the chimney flue bricks run the length of the floor under the shelf.

**1** : Space posts triangularly for optimal support

  Load the shelf with the largest pieces first and then fill around them with smaller ones. Here, a stack of GP bowls is separated with ¼ cup (30g) of silica sand between each one **(2)**. The sand allows moisture to escape and provides level seating for each subsequent bowl **(3)**. Carry the stack of bowls with your fingers spread equally around the foot of the bottom one **(4)**.

**2** : If stacking bowls, fill each with silica sand

**3** : Sand allows moisture to escape

  Place stacks as close to the edge of the shelf as possible; leave just ¼ inch (6mm) of space **(5)**. Here, one of the posts has been moved in order to make loading the larger bowls easier. Reposition the posts when everything is in place. If there is space, both vertically and horizontally, a smaller bowl can be placed inside a larger one **(6)**.

**5** : Place stacks close to shelf edge

**6** : Place smaller bowls in larger ones

  You can also stack bowls with rims together **(7)**. Make sure the pots fit well and are stable **(8)**. To stack different forms on top of each other, utilize the supporting form's axis of greatest strength; in photo **9** , a bottle is positioned in the mouth of a jug along the axis of the handle and spout.

**7** : Or stack bowls with rims together

**8** : Check that inverted pots fit well and are stable

**9** : Stack pots along axis of greatest strength

  Photo **10** shows the space-saving method called "tumble stacking." First, nestle two jugs together. Lay a third jug on top of the bottom pair **(11)**. Pots can extend a short way off the shelf, to maximize space.

**10** : Nestle two jugs together

**11** : Lay a third jug on top

  Use the nooks and crannies. It's okay to put a bowl on its side, between stacks of other pots **(12)**. Ramekins have been stacked so they perch on the lips or feet of neighboring pots **(13)**. Just keep in mind that during the firing, your pots will shrink and move. Keep things stable.

**12** : Bowls can be stacked on their sides

**13** : Make pots stable—they will shrink and move

  If you can't determine, by eye, that your stacks are below the level of the post, span a post with a ruler **(14)**. If any pots touch it, reposition them so they won't get broken when the next shelf is installed. Load the smallest items, such as stamps, inside other items **(15)**.

**14** : Check stack height with ruler

**15** : Load smallest items inside other items

  Holding it level, carefully lower the shelf so as to tap the posts with it first; withdraw it a bit, then set the shelf down **(16)**. Check that the shelf is stable before you set anything on it.

**16** : Lower shelf onto posts

  The next shelf is ready for three more posts **(17)**. Remember to position them directly above the other three posts. This vertical midpoint in the kiln is a good place for cones, if you're using them. Place them first, by a peephole, before loading more pots.

**17** : Add three more posts and repeat stacking

**LOADING A GLAZE KILN**

Preparation is key to loading a kiln with glazed pots. Before putting that first pot in the kiln, make sure you've cleaned the feet of your pots of any glaze so that drips don't melt and stick the pot to the kiln shelf. If you have pots with lids, remember that both the lid and its seating area must be free of glaze. Check that spouts aren't plugged with glaze. Grind off old melts and apply kiln wash to your shelving and posts (see this page). Vacuum any loose bits off the kiln floor, walls, and lid or arch; those tiny wayward pieces of kiln flotsam seem to find their way onto pots. Before you load, make any necessary cone packs and give them time to dry (see this page).

Loading a glaze firing isn't nearly the jigsaw puzzle that a bisque firing is. You won't be able to fit as many pots into the kiln this time because they shouldn't touch each other. You'll still arrange the pots in such a way that shelf space is used efficiently.

For a gas kiln, allow some air space between the tops of the pots and the shelf above them, so that gases can circulate. Use posts ½ to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5cm) taller than the pots you plan to put on that shelf. In an electric kiln, pots and posts can be nearer to equal in height. In any event, it's a good idea to alternate the heights of shelves, to avoid creating areas of uneven heating.

  Place three posts on the first shelf. Locate each support directly over another support, all the way up the course of shelves. (If posts don't line up vertically, shelves can crack.) Place the cone pack so it can be clearly viewed through the peephole. Then begin loading the pots. As you can see in photo **1** , the posts are taller than the mugs.

**1** : Place cone pack near peephole

  It's a good idea to load pots in such a way that their handles face out, toward the wall of the kiln. While it's okay for handles to hang over the shelf edge, it's important that the entire _foot_ of a pot be on the shelf, so the pot doesn't warp during the firing **(2)**.

**2** : Pots' feet should be on shelf

Fired raku pots with crackled surfaces

**RAKU FIRING**

Of all of the firing techniques available, raku is probably the most immediately gratifying one. With the right clay body, glazes, and kiln, a pot can move from a bisque firing to a raku glaze firing and onto your table in less than an hour. While the temperatures reached in such a short time won't completely vitrify the clay body (which helps make a pot durable), this technique can result in some great decorative pieces.

During a raku firing, bisque-fired pots are usually heated to 1950°F (1066°C), or until their glazes melt. One by one, the glowing-hot pots are moved from the kiln and each one carefully placed inside a metal can (or some other airtight container), where it undergoes intense reduction because of the presence of carbonaceous material. This reduction process transforms the glazes, creating lustrous or iridescent effects, while any exposed or unglazed part of the pot usually turns a satiny black from the smoke of the burning materials. When raku firing, always take care to protect yourself from the possibility of burns. Wear heavy-duty gloves, such as those that welders use, and only remove your hot pots from the raku kiln with a good pair of raku tongs. For raku firing, you'll also need to have the following on hand:

**Bisque-fired pots.** Most commercial clay suppliers sell raku clays. While pots made from your regular clay can be raku fired, a raku clay expels water easily and is thermal-shock resistant. Bisque-fire your pots and coat them with raku glazes (see this page for a recipe) before you fire them.

**Kiln.** Any kiln that can reach 1950°F / 1066°C can be used to heat the pot prior to the raku reduction process. A small, gas-fueled fiber kiln heats pots more quickly and efficiently than does a larger one, as you probably won't want to raku fire dozens of pots in a single session.

**Reduction bins.** A suitable bin is a galvanized metal one, such as a 5–10 gallon (19–38L) garbage can. The lid should fit well; the smoke must be contained if it is to thoroughly penetrate the pot. Prepare one bin for each pot you intend to fire.

**Reduction materials.** Pretty much anything that burns and creates smoke is a "reduction material." The most popular kinds are straw, sawdust, and newspaper. Fill the reduction bin with the combustible material _before_ you put a heated pot in it.

**Tongs.** You'll need long-handled steel tongs to remove pots from a hot kiln. These are available through most ceramic suppliers.

**Leather gloves.** High-quality leather glove _s_ are an absolute must for raku. Welders' gloves are ideal and can be purchased at any good hardware store.

**Metal water bucket.** After the pots are reduced in the bins, some potters like to then place them in water momentarily so that body reduction and glaze color are stabilized. It's always a good idea to have a garden hose nearby in case of fire.

**Clothing.** Wear protective clothing because you'll be exposed to flame and smoke during the process. Never wear nylon or synthetic fabrics. A long-sleeved, cotton T-shirt, long pants, and leather shoes provide the best protection. You might want to wear a respirator during the reduction phase to filter the abundant smoke.

Raku pots reducing in bins full of straw

  Apply glaze to the interior of a bisque-fired pot first. Spoon a free pattern of glaze onto the pot's exterior, leaving some of the clay body exposed **(1)**. If using, apply on-glaze colorant with a brush, as shown in photo **2**.

**1** : Apply glaze to pot

**2** : Apply on-glaze colorant, if using

  Arrange the glazed pots, 1 inch (2.5cm) apart, on a kiln shelf set inside the raku kiln **(3)**. Because they are fired quickly, raku glazes tend to bubble vigorously, so each pot needs more space around it than in a typical glaze firing, to ensure that it won't stick to its neighbors.

**3** : Arrange pots an inch (2.5cm) apart

  Your raku kiln should be positioned on a concrete pad or other nonflammable and level surface. Always ignite the burner _before_ closing the kiln **(4)** , so that gas doesn't collect inside—a potentially hazardous situation. When the burner is firing smoothly at low pressure, put the lid on the kiln **(5)**. Allow the kiln to heat slowly for at least 10 minutes, so the water from the glaze can evaporate completely.

**4** : Light burner

**5** : After burner is lit, put lid on kiln

  While the kiln is heating, prepare your reduction bins: fluff the straw before you put it into the bin **(6)**. Don't overfill the bin or pack the straw too tightly. After the kiln has preheated, increase the burner pressure every 5 minutes. After 20 or 30 minutes, the pots inside the kiln should be glowing cherry red or hotter **(7)**. Protect your eyes from long exposure to thermal radiation. Usually, the glazes bubble shortly before the target temperature is reached. After an additional 5 minutes, the glazes become smooth and the glossy ones turn shiny. When that happens, the firing is complete and it's time for reduction. Turn the kiln off.

**6** : Prepare reduction bins

**7** : Pots in kiln will glow red/orange

  Bring the first bin close to the kiln (within reach is good). Lift the lid with one gloved hand and grasp a pot with the tongs **(8)**. Replace the kiln lid so the remaining pots stay hot. Carefully place the pot into the reduction bin **(9)**. Use your gloved hand to add a handful of fluffed straw, quickly, on top of the pot that's inside the bin **(10)**.

**8** : Lift lid with gloved hand

**9** : Remove pot with tongs and replace lid

**10** : Place pot in bin and add a handful of fluffed straw

  After the straw has burst into flame, place the lid on the bin **(11)**. This suffocates the fire; the burning straw will consume the oxygen, creating a reduction atmosphere inside the container.

**11** : When straw ignites, put lid on bin

  Move the smoking bin away from the kiln **(12)**. Repeat the unloading process until all of the pots are in their bins. In most cases, a thorough reduction will take a minimum of 30 minutes. Afterward, unload the pots with tongs and cool them in water. Don't submerge closed forms, like bottles, or they might trap the steam and explode. When the pots are cool, use fine steel wool or a scrubby sponge to clean the surface haze off the glazes. Be careful not to cut yourself on any sharp glaze bits.

Loading glazed pots into a raku kiln

**BUILDING A RAKU KILN**

A raku kiln is a simple, speedy, and efficient way to glaze fire pots, and constructing your own raku kiln is relatively easy to do. Unlike an atmospheric, draft-style kiln, a raku kiln doesn't need an extended chimney to circulate air and pull out the gases.

Here's what you'll need to build a 24 x 18-inch (61 x 46cm) barrel-shaped kiln:

  **Tin snips, measuring tape, needle-nose pliers, and utility knife**

  **A sheet of steel mesh or hardware cloth that measures 24 x 100 inches (61 x 254cm). The galvanized, zinc-coated, or plain steel should be 19 gauge or heavier, and the mesh size either N inch (6mm) square or N x K inch (6 x 13mm). Don't use aluminum, which might warp or melt.**

  **40,000-BTU raku system, which includes a Venturi burner, high-pressure safety pilot valve with thermocouple, hose (K inch, or 1.3cm, in diameter), gauge, and low-pressure regulator**

  **A sheet of K23 or K26 (2 inches, or 5cm, thick) insulating fiber blanket that measures 24 x 80 inches (61 x 203cm); available from a ceramic or refractory supply dealer**

  **A fine-particle respirator with cartridges rated for the micron size of the blanket fibers and safety glasses**

  **Wooden board, 24 x 6 x O inches (61 x 15 x 2cm)**

  **20 feet (6.1m) of nichrome wire, available from a ceramic supply dealer**

  **52 two-hole ceramic buttons, each 1K inches (3.8cm) in diameter. You can make these buttons yourself out of clay and fire them to cone 06.**

  **Steel wire**

  **One or more mullite or corderite kiln shelves that measure 14 x 12 x O inches (35.6 x 30.5 x 2cm) each**

  **40- or 100-pound propane tank**

  Photo **1** shows the bottom half of a completed barrel-shaped raku kiln, upside down. To make it, use your tin snips to cut two end walls, 11 x 17 inches (28 x 43cm) out of the mesh. Flatten them with weights, such as bricks. For the curved barrel piece, cut a piece of mesh 24 x 27 inches (61 x 69cm) long and flatten it.

**1** : Bottom half of raku kiln, upside down

  Starting at one corner, attach the barrel piece to an end wall by using the needle-nose pliers to hook one of the barrel's free wire ends over an adjacent wire in the end wall **(2)**. Curve the barrel piece to meet the other corner of the end wall. Attach the rest of the barrel's free ends in the same way; the top of the curve will be 2 inches (5cm) shorter than the long side of the end wall **(3)**. Repeat the process for the second end wall.

**2** : Attach barrel to end walls with needle-nose pliers

**3** : End walls are taller than curved bottom

  When this barrel half is turned over, the end walls will suspend it above the concrete pad **(4)**.

**4** : End walls hold bottom half of barrel above concrete

  The other half of the barrel will be the kiln's lid. Cut two end walls, each 9 x 17 inches (23 x 43cm). Use your tin snips to cut curves with a 9-inch (23cm) radius in the longer sides of the new end walls. Make small cuts so you don't trim too much. Attach the barrel's mesh to the two end walls as before. Photo **5** shows a completed end wall of the lid.

**5** : Completed end wall of lid

  The following steps involve the cutting and installation of ceramic fiber. Since breathing its loose fibers presents a health hazard, always wear a cartridge respirator; use safety glasses to protect your eyes. Keep your work space clean by vacuuming with HEPA-filtered equipment instead of sweeping, since doing so will loft fibers.

  Roll out the fiber blanket on a clean floor. Measure a section 24 x 27 inches (61 x 69cm). Lay the wooden board under the area you want to cut and use your utility knife to cut across the fiber (the board protects the blade and floor). Line the inside of the bottom half of the kiln with the fiber. There should be 1 inch (2.5cm) of extra fiber along both long sides. Fold it over the edges **(6)**.

**6** : Fold fiber blanket over edges

  Cut 48 pieces, each 7 inches (18cm) long, of nichrome wire with the tin snips. Use the pliers to bend each wire in half. From the inside of the kiln, attach the buttons to the fiber blanket by pushing the ends of a bent nichrome wire through the holes. Each end should straddle a wire on the other side. From the mesh side, twist the wires' ends, trim them, and then fold them back toward the blanket **(7)**.

**7** : Twist nichrome wires to hold buttons in place

  Cut a circular burner port, 3 inches (7.5cm) in diameter, in the center of one of the bottom end mesh walls. Cut a centered, rectangular exit port in the lid half of the mesh that measures 4 x 3 inches (10 x 7.5cm).

  For the burner port on the mesh, measure 1½ inches (3.8cm) up from the edge of the fiber blanket in the barrel. To locate the exit port on the mesh, measure 2 inches (5cm) down from the surface of the blanket in the lid. Both ports should be laterally centered.

  Cut the four end walls from the fiber blanket. For the portholes in the blanket, lay the matching mesh pieces on the fiber and mark their outlines. Remove the blanket pieces and cut them out. Attach the four end-wall blankets with nichrome wire and buttons. Photo **8** shows the end wall of the lid with the exit port, and photo **9** shows the end wall of the bottom half with the burner port.

**8** : End wall of lid with exit port

**9** : End wall of bottom half with burner port

  Photo **10** shows what the kiln looks like when it's ready for firing. The ports are lined up exactly with each other, and the wire handle is on top of the lid. To make a handle for the lid, you'll need steel wire, pliers, and the measuring tape. Wrap one end of a 60-inch (1.5m) length of wire to the mesh. With one hand resting on the lid where the handle will be, arc the wire high enough so you're sure you'll be able to grasp the handle. Loop the wire through a segment of the mesh 8 inches (20cm) away from the first connection, then back to the starting point. Repeat the wire looping until you've used it all; secure the wire's end. Cut a second piece of wire 15 inches (38cm) long, to bind the strands together. Use the pliers to compress the cut ends inside the bundled wire, so they can't cut your gloves.

**10** : Finished kiln

  Position the nozzle of the burner so that its tip is ¼ inch (6mm) away from the plane of the burner port **(11)**. The space lets secondary air enter the kiln, which improves combustion.

**11** : Place burner nozzle ¼ " (6mm) from burner port

  Install the kiln shelf in the bottom half of the kiln. Position it at the port end, above the burner port. The wider part of the shelf spans the sides of the kiln and rests on the walls, as shown in photo **12**. The burner's flame will enter from underneath it, travel the length of the kiln, and then go back out the exit port in the lid.

**12** : Insert shelf above burner port

**connecting and lighting a gas burner**

You will need to hire a licensed plumber to safely connect your kiln's burners to a fuel source. Once the burners are safely connected, follow these steps carefully to light the burners.

  **Make sure all valves leading to your burners are closed. Open your kiln's lid or door.**

  **Open the gas tank's main valve and then the valve preceding the safety shut-off valve near the burner.**

  **Use a butane lighter or light a piece of paper. Hold the flame close to the tip of the pilot burner.**

  **Depress the button on the safety shut-off valve and ignite the pilot burner. Hold the button down for one minute before releasing it.**

  **Slowly open the main burner valve until it ignites. Turn the pressure down to a low flame.**

**CONVERTING AN ELECTRIC KILN TO GAS**

If you'd like to have a gas kiln but your studio is too small or your budget too limited to buy a commercial one, you can convert an electric kiln to gas.

Any electric kiln can be modified to use LP or natural gas; you might want to purchase a used electric kiln, since even a new, smaller one is not inexpensive. Most cylindrical electric kilns have an interior volume of 5 to 20 cubic feet. The one shown in this demonstration has a volume of 9 cubic feet. To calculate the volume of this kiln design, use this formula: 3.14 x radius2 x height/depth (π x r2 x h).

Knowing your kiln's volume will help you determine the sizes of the flues and chimney you'll build with bricks, as well as the ratings of the burners needed. The "quasi-downdraft" style shown here has the chimney inside the chamber, which vents through the lid. The bottom shelf acts as the cover for an exit flue in the floor, which leads to the base of the chimney.

In the past thirty years, most electric kilns have been constructed with high-quality, low-alkali insulating firebrick (IFB), most often K23 brick. While the refractory industry recommends against using K23 brick (which is rated to 2300°F / 1260°C) for kilns that will be fired to cone 10 (2381°F / 1305°C), experience tells us that this is okay. Just don't fire a kiln built with bricks having this rating to temperatures exceeding cone 10, or they will soon start to degrade. If you're in doubt about the rating of the bricks in the kiln you're interested in, ask the manufacturer.

Electric kilns are wrapped in a thin steel skin that helps protect their relatively thin firebrick walls. If the steel skin is visible from inside the kiln, it's not safe to use anymore. It's okay if the steel on a used kiln has a bit of corrosion. Make sure the kiln's floor isn't corroded from glaze drippings, either. The lid should feel solid, and not have any cracks in it. You won't be using the electric elements, kiln sitter, or controller, so their condition isn't important.

Use a screwdriver and an adjustable wrench to remove the terminal boards, elements, controller, and any other electronic gear attached to the interior or exterior of the kiln. Most electric kilns have easily separated sections.

You'll put the sections back together after you've cut the burner ports.

Install your kiln in a well-ventilated, suitable location, on a concrete floor or pad. Allow 3 feet (1m) of clearance from all walls, and fireproof walls near the kiln with gypsum board or some other inflammable material. If you're unsure of how to fireproof the kiln area, consult a contractor. Never locate a kiln inside a living space.

Here's what you'll need:

  **Permanent marker, tape measure, tin snips, file, and chisel**

  **O-horsepower (0.56KW) electric drill**

  **K-inch (1.3cm) drill bit**

  **Respirator**

  **Keyhole saw (purchase a cheap one; you'll dull the blade by cutting brick)**

  **K26 soft-type insulating firebrick (IFB)***

  **Brick saw (needed only for HD refractory bricks)**

  **Heat-setting refractory mortar, K gallon (1.9L)**

  **Palette knife**

  **Ceramic fiber blanket (1 square foot, or 30.5cm, will be plenty)**

  **Kiln shelf made of mullite, corderite, or silicon carbide**

  **Acrylic paint or food coloring**

  **4K-inch (11cm) electric grinder (optional)**

  **Rubber mallet (optional)**

* You can also use 28 PCE (for "polymetric cone equivalent"), a lowduty firebrick, but the insulating firebrick (IFB) is easier to cut and will work just fine here.

  Position the electric kiln's steel stand in the desired location. If your kiln doesn't have a stand, use concrete blocks to support the bottom section. Don't stack the blocks tightly together; allow ¼ inch (6mm) air space between them. Never position a kiln directly on the floor of your studio. Doing so can cause a serious fire.

  Cut the two burner ports first. Rest the bottommost section of the kiln on a sturdy table, with one side of it hanging over the edge so you can access the bottom edge of the steel skin. Use the permanent marker and the tape measure to locate the center of the side of the faceted section, directly opposite the section that has the lid's hinge **(1)**.

**1** : Overhead view of kiln

  The inside edges of the ports should be positioned 16 inches (41cm) apart, so make two locator marks, each 8 inches (20cm) away from the center mark. Use your marker to register the edges of both burner ports. Draw the burner ports as two rectangles, each 4 inches (10cm) high by 6 inches (15cm) wide, at the bottom edge of the steel facing. Each rectangle will be 6 inches (15cm) wide and should start from the locator marks you just made **(2).**

**2** : Top view of burner ports

  Drill a hole, ½ inch (1.3cm) in diameter, in each of the upper corners of the two rectangles you've drawn. Use the tin snips to cut out the rectangle for each port. If steel skin is too tight, use the grinder to cut the skin. File any sharp edges and points. Put on the respirator. Using the top edges of the rectangular openings as guides, drill a series of perforating holes, ½ inch (1.3cm) apart, through the bricks.

  Now you'll cut up through the (undrilled) sides of the bricks with the saw. Make your cuts at an angle that widens out, so that the burners' flames can move unimpeded into the kiln.

  Break the bricks across the perforated top line; sometimes a chisel helps. Use the large file to smooth the three walls of the two burner ports. Position this bottom section of the kiln on the stand. Add the other sections, being sure to align the facets properly as you do.

  Stack concrete blocks, firebricks, or a combination of the two under each port opening, until the blocks are level with the openings' bottom edges. Now construct tunnel-like extensions, with two sidewalls and a spanner, for each of the port openings. These will be lined with cut pieces of K26 firebrick and supported by the stacks you just made. Cut the bricks to:

**Inside section:** 3 x 4 x 1 inches (7.5 x 10 x 2.5cm)

**Outside section:** 3 x 7 x 1 inches (7.5 x 18 x 2.5cm)

**Roof spanner:** 4½ x 6 x 1 inches (11 x 15 x 2.5cm)

The 4-inch (10cm) pieces line the ports' inside walls and the 7-inch (18cm) pieces insert into the outside walls. This creates a port that comes out of the kiln at a slight angle so the flames will run parallel to the trough inside **(3)**.

**3** : Burner port

  Mix the refractory mortar according to the manufacturer's directions. Use it to paste the port liner pieces to the kiln and to each other. Use the palette knife to apply the mortar to the brick and kiln face—but not the inner surfaces. When the bricks are in place, use more mortar to fill any gaps. You can also bind some ceramic fiber with mortar to secure the small structure even more firmly **(4)**.

**4** : Burner port showing cowl

  Cover the mortar and set it aside; you'll be using more of it later.

  Now you can stack the rest of the kiln sections back on top of each other. Make sure the facets line up as they did before you took the sections apart. Position the lid with the hinge on the side that is opposite the side with the burner ports.

  The next step is to construct a simple, L-shaped flue system, which includes an entry flue, trough, chimney flue, and chimney, out of K26 IFB **(5)**. The bricks in the kiln pictured here are a mix of 28 PCE firebricks—I used splits 1¼ inches (3.2cm) deep—and K23 IFB, cut to size, plus a few straights, which measure 9 x 4½ x 2½ inches (23 x 11 x 6cm). You have the option to use the full-sized straights for this flue system, but make sure the recommended interior measurements stay the same. It doesn't matter what the flue's outer dimensions are, though larger bricks may affect the amount of space between the burner ports.

**5** : Construct flue system

  Now you'll set bricks into a narrow channel across the kiln's floor. This channel will connect the entry flue to the chimney flue and let the exhaust gases travel under the pots and out the chimney. Arrange two brick walls between the pair of burner ports. Build the walls parallel to each other, standing the bricks on their narrower sides, 6½ inches (17cm) apart **(6)**. If the last bricks in each row come up short, fill the end gaps with IFB (insulated firebrick), and mortar them together. If the bricks are too tight, use the rubber mallet to place them. Each burner's flame will move along an outside wall of the trough.

**6** : Floor flue system (without shelf)

  Next, construct the entry flue at the end of the trough, against the wall that's below the lid's hinge **(7)**. The size of the flue box will be one brick's width, or 4½ inches (11cm), deep. The entry flue's final interior dimension will be 6½ inches (17cm) square. Cut each of the flue box's sidewalls 7½ inches (19cm) long. (When the kiln shelf covers the top of the trough, the flue's interior dimension will become the right size.) Stand one of the sidewalls on its end, on top of one of the trough rows, where it meets the wall. Make sure they are stable. Mortar the two sidewalls to the trough and the kiln's wall. Mortar a spanning brick that measures 9 x 4½ x 1½ inches (23 x 11 x 4cm) to the two sidewall bricks into place, for the roof of the flue box.

**7** : Collector flue

  Place a 20-inch (51cm) square shelf on top of the trough. Snug it up against the flue box you just made **(8)**.

**8** : Floor flue system (with shelf)

  The opening at the chimney end should measure at least 4½ x 6½ inches (11 x 17cm). The chimney rises from this end of the trough and exits through the lid, near the handle. The two parallel sides of the chimney are made from cut splits of firebrick that measure 9 x 3½ x 1½ inches (23 x 9 x 4cm). Stand them vertically and flush with the outer walls of the trough. Securely mortar them to the kiln wall and to the front-facing chimney bricks. Since the kiln's interior is curved, cut one edge of each split at a gentle angle so they'll fit well **(9)**.

**9** : Chimney and flue system (without shelf)

  The face of the chimney is also composed of splits 9 x 4½ x 1½ inches (23 x 11 x 4cm). These bricks are set horizontally, on one edge, all the way up. Securely mortar them to the inside face of the sidewall. The first facing brick spans right across the trough; mortar it into place. If your shelf is a bit long, cut notches in the sidewall bricks to get started and lay the first facing brick on top of the shelf, as shown in photo **10**. When positioned correctly, the two sidewalls and a face brick form a vertical channel with an interior measurement of 9 x 2½ inches (23 x 6cm).

**10** : Chimney flue stack mortared to the side wall

  The elevation of the chimney exit should be level and flush with the top of the kiln **(11)**. If it isn't, cut small pieces of brick to make it work. To finish the construction of the chimney, adhere it the top edge of the kiln wall with ceramic fiber, stripped to ¼ inch (6mm) thick, and mortar. Cut the first pieces of ceramic fiber long enough to span all of the brick joints. (A nifty trick is to moisten the kiln wall and the fiber first, then mortar the brick, and quickly press the fiber onto the edge. Together, the fiber and mortar become like a refractory Band-Aid.) After doing this area, continue the sealing process all the way around the top edge of the kiln wall **(12)**.

**11** : Chimney flue exit

**12** : Chimney and collection flue (note fiber gasket)

  Close the kiln's lid and put a bit of weight around the outer circumference. This presses the fiber into place. Let it set for 2 hours before proceeding. Don't put weight in the center of the lid, or you may damage it!

  Before you cut the exit flue through the kiln's lid, moisten the fiber gasket around the chimney exit with inexpensive acrylic paint or food coloring. Close the lid tightly and then lift it to see if an imprint of the chimney's opening transferred to the lid's underside. The colored imprint will be your guide for cutting the exit flue. If the mark isn't clear, try again.

  Using your drill, make a pilot hole (large enough for the keyhole saw) at each _inside_ corner of the colored imprint on the lid. Use the saw to cut all the way through the brick lid and then around the _interior_ edge of the colored imprint. Carefully remove the brick cutout **(13)**. Use a straight file to smooth the rough edges of the exit flue. When you close the lid, the flue should line up with the chimney opening.

**13** : Vent hole in lid closes over chimney

**GAS BURNERS FOR A CONVERTED KILN**

You're going to need two burners for this design. In order to get the right size burners, use the formula on this page to find the volume of the kiln, in cubic feet. Multiply the cubic feet by 10,000 British Thermal Units, or BTUs, and divide the result by 2 (the number of burners). The burners for a typical gas conversion kiln should be rated at 45,000 BTUs _each_. Have a licensed plumber install the gas line to the burner.

For a typical gas conversion kiln such as this one, you'll need the following gear for safe firing:

  **2 Venturi burners, 45,000 BTUs each, with pilot burners**

  **100-pound (45.5kg) propane tank**

  **2 gas regulators. One regulator must be located at the tank and the other within 15 feet (4.5m) of the kiln. Both regulators should be set at 5 psi.**

  **Black piping (it's always a good idea to have a licensed plumber do this work)**

  **One main gas shut-off valve, needle type**

  **One shut-off valve per burner, needle type**

  **High-pressure safety pilot valve with thermocouple**

Connecting and using this equipment still depends on your knowledge of safe mechanical practices. For more information, consult the latest version of the freely distributed International Fuel Gas Code for safety regulations and precautions. Don't take shortcuts when dealing with a gas appliance such as your kiln. If you can't locate your kiln in a protected outdoor setting—both electric and gas types—install a good ventilation system that expels all fumes from your work space.

To light your burners, see the sidebar on this page.

**common glaze types**

Glazes, and the innumerable variations possible when their basic formulations are adjusted, are often grouped according to their primary characteristics. This descriptive guide gives some examples taken from the rich and varied world of glaze types.

**Ash.** Oxides present in the ashes of burned wood create variegated colors and surfaces on fired clay. Wood ash glazes and patinas are usually dimpled with rivulets.

ASH

**Celadon.** Shiny, transparent glazes that are traditionally green, gray, blue, or amber. Their colors are derived from the presence of iron oxide in the recipe.

CELADON

**Chun.** A type of opalescent glaze that is usually light blue in color, with a soft-looking satin-gloss surface. Like celadon, chun glazes usually depend on iron for their coloration.

CHUN

**Copper red.** A reduction firing is needed to achieve the glossy, brilliantly red color.

COPPER RED

**Crystalline.** The formation of crystals that float in a glassy glaze usually develop when the melting glaze is low in viscosity. Recipes with titanium, zinc, or wollastonite tend to form crystals during firing.

CRYSTALLINE

**Majolica.** An opaque, tin- or zirconium-based type of pure-white glaze.

MAJOLICA

**Raku crackle.** This glaze requires a high-alkaline flux to help create its dynamic crackle effect.

RAKU

**Salt.** Adding sodium to the kiln chamber while firing unglazed clay bodies creates this dimpled "orange peel" surface.

SALT

**Shino.** Shino's naturalistic and varied tones come from the early melting of an abundant amount of sodium fired in a reduction atmosphere.

SHINO

**Tenmoku.** Varying percentages of iron create black, dark brown, or amber in this glossy glaze.

TENMOKU
**troubleshooting glaze flaws**

There are times when glazes don't perform exactly as we'd intended and we're left wondering what went wrong. It helps to keep in mind that materials change over time, applications can vary, the wall thickness of a pot can have a huge effect on glaze-body interface, and firing conditions present countless variables. To help you troubleshoot some specific common glaze problems, I've made a few suggestions below.

---

**FLAWS** | **POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS**

  | **Blistering.** Thin, fragile bubbles or craters in glazes containing certain ingredients. | • Check your notes for the length of time of the firing; may be the result of underfiring or overfiring.

• If the glaze recipe contains cornwall stone, manganese dioxide, soda ash, or lead, adjust the amounts.

  | **Crawling.** The glaze rolls back on itself, separating or beading up, and leaving patches or fissures of exposed clay. | • Apply a thinner coat of the glaze.

• Handle bisqueware with clean hands.

• Adjust the amount of clay, alumina, or zinc in the recipe.

• Glaze fire more slowly.

  | **Crazing.** A web-like series of super fine cracks in the glaze. | • Bisque fire to higher temperature.

• Fire more slowly during the last 100°F / 37.8°C.

• Increase the amount of silica in the formula.

  | **Pinholing.** Minute craters in the glaze surface | • More air needed during bisque firing.

• Fire more slowly at the peak of glaze firing.

• Reduce the amount of soda or potassium.

  | **Running.** Drips and rivulets in the glaze. | • May be the result of overfiring.

• Reduce the amount of flux in the glaze recipe.

• Apply the glaze more thinly.

  | **Shivering.** The glaze lifts, chips, or flakes off of the pot, most commonly along a sharp edge, rim, or lip; the opposite of the condition that causes crazing (see above). | • Add a fluxing agent, such as a feldspar, to the recipe.
**engobe, glaze, and raku recipes**

Whether you work with low-fire materials or high-fire; earthenware, mid-range, or raku clay; an electric or a gas kiln; and fire in an oxidation or a reduction atmosphere, you can probably find something useful in this collection of recipes. Use them as they're shown here, or experiment and adjust to your heart's content.

**Engobe**

Use this base engobe recipe on stoneware or porcelain and at any stage of dryness, from wet to leather-hard.

**COLORANTS**

Colorants can be added to any base-type engobe recipe, but the percentage needed will vary according to its unique properties. Another way to color a base recipe is to use a manufactured fritted color, or a stain. Regardless, the amount of colorant—whether it's an oxide* or a stain—will vary; therefore, for the best results, always test the mixture with your own clay, kiln, and atmosphere.

• When zinc is in the unfired glaze coat, ***chrome's** color may be green to brown or pink. Also, high-calcium glazes can change the color to gray. Chrome is refractory. Use 0.5–6 percent.

• **Copper** carbonate and oxide create a range of greens in an oxidation atmosphere and reds in reduction—even in an engobe. Use 0.5–8 percent.

• ***Manganese** dioxide and manganese carbonate can create natural purple to chocolate brown, and even bronze, if used in high enough concentrations. If the manganese isn't ground finely enough, there will be speckling in the engobe. Use 0.5–12 percent.

• ***nickel** oxide can produce soft grays, and sometimes hints of green and blue, depending on the kiln's atmosphere and temperature, and how thick the glaze coat is. Nickel is refractory. Use 0.5–3 percent.

• **Rutile** is a form of titanium dioxide. It can create colors in the range of soft iron-yellow to burnt orange. Under or over certain glazes, rutile can go gray. Use 0.5–12 percent.

• ***Tin** oxide is an opacifier (i.e., it reduces a glaze's transparency). It can make an engobe white. Use 2–8 percent.

• ***Zirconium** is an opacifier, but is not as strong as the more expensive tin oxide. In an engobe, it makes a cooler white than tin does. Use 2–15 percent.

* Any oxide marked with an asterisk is known to be either a human health or an environmental hazard. Seek further information regarding how to protect yourself and safeguard both the local groundwater and/or the public water supply, before handling, firing, or eating from wares glazed with the material.

Mason stains are combinations of fritted oxides that you use to color transparent or opaque glazes, slips, engobes, or even clay bodies. (The stains may also be applied directly with a brush for a decorative effect; mix them with water and a fluxing agent.) Here are some suggested stains for adding the BDC Base and percentages to try.

**glossary of ceramic terms**

**Absorbent.** The quality of a material to draw water into its structure through actions such as gravity or capillary. Green ware and bisque ware are most absorbent in the ceramic cycle, making them ideal for glazing.

**Appendage.** An object or a thing that is attached to a central form for aesthetic or utilitarian purposes. Appendages include spouts, handles, added feet, lids, and the like.

**Ash.** A material obtained by burning animal or vegetable material and composed of both organic and inorganic materials. When melted during a firing, the results of the interaction between the minerals may be seen in varied glaze effects.

**Atmosphere.** The condition, inside the kiln chamber, that is defined by the amount of oxygen or temperature present during firing.

**Atomizer.** A breath-operated device used for spraying small amounts of slip, engobe, or glaze onto a pot. By blowing air through a tube positioned over a draw pipe inserted into the liquid, the liquid is drawn up and out, creating a fine spray.

**Ball clay.** Highly plastic clay that is composed of fine particles and usually fires to a cream color because of the presence of iron and titanium.

**Bat.** A flat disk, usually made of wood, plaster, or plastic, that easily detaches from the wheel head; used to transport a pot without touching it.

**Batch.** A mixture of materials, in a quantity large enough to be used, that make a slip, engobe, clay body, or glaze.

**Bentonite.** A very plastic clay having super-fine particle sizes, originating from the decomposition of volcanic ash, and used in a glaze recipe to suspend the ingredients or else provide plasticity to a clay body.

**Bisque.** Either a) porous wares, strengthened by being fired to a low temperature or b) a necessary firing stage prior to the glazing process.

**Blistering.** Bubbles in fired glaze due to gases released by the clay or glaze during firing. Appears in the cooled ceramic piece if the bisque-fire temperature wasn't high or long enough, or if the glaze firing was done so quickly that the bubbles didn't have time to heal.

**Bloating.** Bubbles trapped inside the wall of a ceramic due to gases in the clay body not having been fully removed during the bisque firing, or else the kiln was fired too quickly at a low temperature during a glaze firing.

**Blunge.** Mixing water with clay or other materials to a usable consistency. Usually refers to the mixing of slips, engobes, or glazes with a mechanical impellor or auger.

**Body-glaze interface.** The point during melting when a clay body and glaze interact to the extent that there is bonding.

**Boiling point.** Because they become liquids at different melting points, the variable nature of a glaze's ingredients gives each glaze its own boiling point; for water, 212°F / 100°C.

**Bone china.** A translucent, porcelaneous ceramic invented in Britain. It derives its name from the inclusion of a high percentage of bone ash as flux.

**Bone dry.** A clay body, heated to just over 212°F / 100°C, without any atmospheric and physical moisture; bone-dry pots are completely dry and ready for firing.

**Boxing.** A space-efficient method for stacking pots, either lip to lip or foot ring to foot ring, for drying or firing.

**Casting slip.** A liquid form of clay suspended in water and used to create a clay form. Usually used in conjunction with a plaster mold.

**Catalyst.** Something that causes change in other more refractory materials, somewhat like a flux does, but doesn't undergo radical compounding change itself.

**Centering.** The term given to one of the first steps in making a symmetrical form on the potter's wheel. After the clay is secured to the wheel head, it is wetted and made to spin evenly and true before other stages of shaping.

**Ceramic.** A clay product permanently converted by firing.

**Chattering.** The rhythmic, bouncing motion of a tool's edge on a pot's surface during trimming; usually unintended, but may be used as a technique to create a decorative motif.

**Chemical water.** Water that is bound into the molecular structure of clay. It must be evaporated by firing to a minimum 1112°F / 600°C. When chemical water is gone, clay becomes ceramic. Chemical water makes up 14 percent, by weight, of dry clay.

**China.** Commonly used to refer to ceramics made from porcelain clay because of the association with that type of pottery's place of origin.

**China clay.** Another name for kaolin, and used regardless of where it's quarried; the main ingredient in porcelain clay bodies.

**Chuck.** A simple, thrown vessel made from stiff-moist clay, bisque-fired ceramic, or plaster; used to hold a form during a particular phase of throwing or trimming.

**Clay.** A malleable material made of hydrated silicate of alumina. Decomposed igneous rocks disintegrated by weathering and their movement by natural forces; classified as either primary or secondary, based on the distance transported from their source. The farther a clay has traveled the finer its particle sizes will be, resulting in greater plasticity.

**Clay body.** A compound mixture—made of natural clays, fluxes, and fillers—with dependable qualities; used to make forms that, when fired to specific temperatures and atmospheres, become durable ceramic objects.

**Compression.** A reduction in size as a result of pressure. In throwing, the method of making the clay tighter and less prone to cracking as it dries. In the relationship between a clay body and a glaze, proper compression makes the glaze fit the clay body well; too much compression, however, causes shivering.

**Coning.** A useful technique that, when used in the early stages of throwing, helps to center the clay. Also, the shape that results, as "cone."

**Cone pack.** One or more pyrometric cones set into a ceramic base and placed into the kiln to report the effects of temperature and changes to the rate at which the heat increases.

**Contraction.** A decrease in size due to temperature change. Because clay bodies and glazes contract after being fired, it's important that they do so easily.

**Cracking.** The effect of changes in thickness, form, shrinkage rate, and speed of drying on clay objects. Cracking in ceramic forms may be due to poor glaze fit, being bisque fired or cooled too fast, or when a reduction phase is begun too early, or too strongly.

**Crackle.** Small cracks caused by crazing of the matrix; sometimes used as a decorative effect.

**Crawling.** Glaze pooling or pulling away from the clay body, leaving bare spots. Sometimes used as a decorative element by deliberately formulating the glaze to ensure crawl.

**Crazing.** A network of fine cracks in the fired glaze, caused when the cooling glaze contracts more than the clay body does. Crazing can show up years after the firing took place. Unless the ware was under- or overfired, add 2-percent increments of silica when next mixing the glaze.

**Cross-draft kiln.** A kiln design that causes gases (flames) to enter the chamber at one wall and exit at the opposite wall, into the chimney.

**Damper.** Plate-like or other simple opening located in a kiln's chimney. It can be closed with bricks to reduce the amount of oxygen in the firing chamber. An active damper is slid open or closed, to regulate the flow of gases being emitted.

**De-airing.** Removing air pockets from pliable clay by hand or machine.

**Deflocculation.** To make a slip, engobe, or glaze more fluid by adding a soluble alkali.

**Double dipping.** Glazing by dipping a pot upside down, and then jerking the pot up while keeping the rim under the surface. The resulting splash inside the pot glazes its interior. Also, applying two or more layers of glazes to get a variable and blended effect.

**Dunting.** Unwanted cracks in a fired ceramic piece; caused by sudden temperature changes during firing or cooling.

**Earthenware.** Pots made with a clay having a porosity of 5 percent or greater; may also be used to refer to certain clay bodies or firing ranges.

**Engobe.** A clay slip with coloring oxides and flux added. Used as a decorative element or as a primary surface on a pot, and applied by brushing, dipping, or spraying.

**Expansion.** An increase in size caused by an increase in temperature.

**Feldspar.** A family of minerals formed in the earth from cooled and crystalized magma. Used primarily as fluxes in clay bodies and glazes; being composed of silica, alumina, and various alkalis makes feldspar a naturally occurring glaze.

**Fettling.** Using a fettling knife to remove clay from a form that is pliable to dry.

**Fireclay.** A family of plastic combinations of minerals formed from decomposed soils and vegetation; high in alumina content and therefore refractory.

**Firing.** The heating process by which clays and glazes are made ceramic; a minimum temperature of 1112°F / 600°C is required.

**Firing cycle.** The period of time over which clay pots are fired and cooled in a kiln to become ceramic.

**Fit.** The relationship between a clay body and glaze whereby they are able to expand and contract together sufficiently.

**Flocculation.** To make the heavier particles in a glaze, slip, or engobe suspend more readily by adding an acidic or a magnesium-based flocculant, such as epsom salt, to the mixture.

**Flux.** An alkaline oxide, or combination of oxides, that interacts with other oxides to cause melting to take place.

**Glaze.** A super-cooled liquid produced by fusing silica with soda, potash, and other oxides, including those such as alumina that assist in its adherence to and interface with clay. Sometimes called glost.

**Green ware.** A finished clay form that is not yet dry enough to be fired.

**Grog.** Ceramic particles, of various sizes, added to clay to improve its wet strength and other desirable throwing qualities like "tooth" (texture); usually made from high-fired fireclay or, less commonly, earthenware or porcelain.

**Heat-work.** The combined effects of time and temperature to which a ceramic is exposed within the kiln; measured by the pyrometric cone.

**High-fire glaze.** A glaze formulated to be fired at or above 2192°F / 1200°C.

**Impression.** A surface mark made by stamping or paddling a soft or leather-dry clay form.

**Inlay.** A decorative technique by which leather-dry clay is incised, then filled with a colored slip, engobe, or glaze; the excess is scraped off later, after drying. Also called mishima.

**Iron oxide.** The most common coloring agent used in clays and glazes. In combination with various other oxides, this metallic oxide produces browns, blacks, grays, greens, oranges, pinks, and yellows.

**Kaolin.** See China clay.

**Kiln.** The oven used to fire ceramics, usually constructed from refractory materials and designed according to the fuel needed.

**Kiln controller.** A digital machine, connected to thermo-couples and also to the power source of an electric kiln, that sends commands to a kiln's heating elements; used to operate complex firing cycles.

**Kiln furniture.** Refractory posts and shelves used to support pots inside a kiln during firing.

**Kiln sitter.** A mechanical device that assists in turning off an electric kiln at the end of a firing. Most kiln sitters feature a small rod that sits in the center of a cone that is suspended between two holders. When the given temperature is reached, the cone melts and the rod triggers the power to shut off.

**Kiln wash.** A thick, fluid mixture of refractory materials applied to kiln shelves and furniture to protect from glaze drips and adhesion.

**Kneading.** Stretching and compressing clay to remove air bubbles and make it ready for handling.

**leather-dry.** Clay that is no longer tacky and is nearly stiff; may be trimmed, cut, assembled, or carved.

**low-fire temperature.** A range of temperatures to which certain clay bodies and glazes are fired; from cone 022 (1085°F / 585°C) to cone 2 (2057°F / 1125°C).

**Marbling.** The effect of insufficient kneading.

**Matte.** The surface quality of a glaze that is soft, usually opaque, and nonreflective.

**Maturing temperature.** The temperature to which a glaze or clay body is fired to attain either a full melt or vitrification.

**Melting point.** The temperature at which a raw mineral oxide or a mixture of oxides begins to melt.

**Mesh.** See Sieve.

**Mid-range.** Temperatures to which certain clay bodies and glazes are fired; from cone 3 (2093°F / 1145°C) to cone 7 (2191°F / 1200°C).

**Motif.** A shape or an image within a pattern or alone, as decoration.

**Mullite.** An alumina silicate in a clay body produced by vitrification. Because of its large crystal structure, this strong material is often used in the manufacture of kiln furniture.

**Neutral atmosphere.** The condition inside a kiln that is being fired somewhere between a complete reduction and a complete oxidation atmosphere.

**On-glaze colorant.** A wash comprised of one or more oxides that is used to paint decoration on top of a glazed surface before firing.

**Opacifier.** A mineral oxide, such as tin oxide and zirconium, that causes clouding of a glaze. Also, oxides that in excess cause crystalline or bubbling matrices are such agents.

**Oven ware.** A family of pottery forms that is able to withstand extreme changes in temperatures. Made from ceramics that are either porous but fragile, or vitrified to the extent that the free silica has been sufficiently melted to become fused; making successful ovenware provides a difficult challenge for the potter.

**Oxidation.** Often referring to the atmosphere in a kiln, it is technically the combining of oxygen with compounds found in a ceramic, at temperatures above red heat. Oxidation wields a different effect on clay bodies and glazes than neutral or reduction atmospheres do. Electric kilns are the most effective tools for achieving oxidation atmospheres because of the absence of gases introduced by carbonaceous fuels.

**Paddle.** A tool used to make impressions into, change the form of, or compress a pliable clay surface or wall.

**Peephole.** A small opening in a kiln's wall.

**Physical water.** H20. Water that has been added to a clay body during its manufacture; it is removed by evaporation.

**Pinhole.** Tiny craters or indents in the surface of a glaze after it has been melted.

**Plaster.** Semihydrated calcium sulphate made from gypsum; used for making molds, stamps, and drying slabs because it absorbs moisture from and releases clay easily.

**Plasticity.** The ability of pliable clay to be easily given form and either maintain that form or by force be changed instantly; a phenomenon by which a nonelastic solid is at the same time a liquid.

**Porcelain.** A type of clay body or ceramic. Usually white and translucent, with a post-fired absorption rate of 0 to 1 percent.

**Porosity.** The quality of a fired ceramic to absorb moisture through capillary action.

**Preheating.** Initial firing step that evaporates physical water from clay bodies and glazes.

**Primary clay.** Any type of clay found at its source of origin; kaolin and bentonite are two.

**Pugmill.** A machine that mixes and compresses a malleable clay body, thereby removing air pockets; a machine that uses the process of vacuum to do this.

**Pull.** Raising a pot's wall during throwing or making a handle; also, the phenomenon of gases being drawn up a kiln's chimney.

**Pyrometer.** An instrument used to indicate the temperature inside a kiln. The pyrometer measures the reading coming from a thermocouple or probe.

**Pyrometric cone.** An instrument, made from a combination of clay and glaze materials, that responds to the amount of heat-work happening inside a kiln during firing.

**Quartz.** Another name for silica, flint, and Si02; the primary form of silica.

**Raku.** The process of firing a ceramic that originated in Japan. This fast firing technique requires that the clay body be formulated so that dunting is unlikely because the ceramic is withdrawn from the kiln usually at temperatures around 1940°F / 1060°C. Oftentimes a heavy reduction done in organic materials is a final feature of the technique.

**Re-absorption.** The action by which a dry clay body draws moisture from the air.

**Reclaim.** To process and make useful a clay body after it has dried.

**Reduction.** The condition of the atmosphere inside a kiln when oxygen is removed from the oxides in the ceramics.

**Refractory.** Resistant to high temperatures; brick, ceramic fiber (blanket), and other products manufactured using materials with high melt points.

**Resist.** A material or technique for blocking areas of clay from the adherence of an engobe, slip, or glaze.

**Rib.** A broad, flat tool, made from wood, ceramic, metal, plastic, or rubber, used to shape or compress a clay body; shapes and sizes vary greatly.

**Run.** When glaze or ceramic color moves as a result of melt and gravity.

**Sand.** Silica, or quartz, found in nature in a granular form. While most sands contain other oxides as well, silica sand is a pure form that features a high melting point.

**Satin matte.** The surface quality of a glaze that looks waxy soft and at least somewhat opaque.

**Scoring.** To scratch or incise a clay surface onto which an appendage is to be added or attached.

**Scumming.** Blemishes on the surface of bisque ware or other porous ceramics caused by the migration of alkalis.

**Secondary clay.** Sedimentary clay that has been removed by natural forces from its point of origin.

**Sedimentation.** The settling of heavier minerals out of a solution.

**Setters.** Kiln furniture designed to hold tiles or pots in a stack, thus saving space.

**Sgrafitto.** From the Italian; incising through a layer or layers of slip or engobe to expose the layer underneath it.

**Shard.** A broken piece of ceramic, glaze, or glass.

**Shivering.** The flaking of glaze from the surface of a ceramic. Considered a glaze defect, shivering occurs because the clay shrinks or contracts more than the glaze does, placing it under a too high compression.

**Short.** A term describing a clay body having too little plasticity and subsequently slumping or cracking easily.

**Shrinkage.** Decrease in size due to the evaporation of physical and chemical waters as well as melt during firing.

**Sieve.** A tool used to screen larger particles from slips, engobes, and glazes.

**Silica.** One of the primary oxides in clays, glazes, engobes, and refractory materials.

**Sinter.** To bond together refractory materials without melting them. Sintering is the stage before melt.

**Split.** A refractory brick used in kiln construction; usually 9 x 4½ x 1¼ inches (23 x 11 x 3cm).

**Stilt.** A refractory support to hold or suspend pots slightly above the kiln shelf during firing.

**Stoneware.** A mid-range to high-temperature type of clay; fires between cone 6 to cone 10.

**Straight.** A refractory brick used in kiln construction; usually 9 x 4½ x 2½ inches (23 x 11 x 6cm).

**Terra-cotta.** Italian word for fired earth. Often used to describe low-temperature orange to red earthenware clay bodies or ceramics.

**Terra sigillata.** A suspension of water, fine particle clay, and sometimes coloring oxides, that is brushed, dipped, or sprayed onto a claywork. When burnished, terra sigillata has a shiny or waxy surface that, because it is tightly compressed, helps prevent the absorption of water.

**Thermal shock.** Cracking caused by stress within a ceramic object due to a sudden change in temperature or because a glaze did not expand as much as the pot did.

**Thermocouple.** A metal probe capable of withstanding high temperatures that is positioned inside a kiln. It relays energy to a pyrometer, which displays the result.

**Throwing.** Using a turning wheel to shape clay.

**Tooth.** The word used to describe a quality of coarseness in a clay body. Tooth is created by the addition of aggregates such as grog or sand to the body.

**Translucent.** The quality of a melted glaze in which there is some scattering of light; not completely transparent.

**Transparent.** A melted glaze in which light can fully penetrate the glass matrix.

**Trimming.** To remove excess or support clay from a leather-dry form with a tool.

**Turning.** See Trimming.

**Undercut.** A bevel, cut into the base of a freshly thrown pot, that makes removing and trimming a pot easier.

**Underfired.** A term describing a ceramic that was not fired to the maturing temperature intended. Underfiring can cause defects such as too much porosity, glaze crazing, pinholing, dullness, lighter color than intended, weakness, or fragility.

**Underglaze.** A decorative, glaze-like material that is applied to either a clay body or a ceramic; it bonds to the ceramic to nearly the same extent that a glaze does. Most intense effect when coated by a transparent glaze.

**Vitrification.** The reaction of a ceramic, when exposed to a maturing temperature, to melt but still hold its shape.

**Wedging.** A clay preparation technique that combines mixing with compression by hand.

**Wheel.** Potter's wheel. A machine driven by electric motor or foot that provides the torque and centrifugal force necessary for throwing, trimming, or decorating clay shapes. Egyptian potters are credited for the invention of the potter's wheel.

**acknowledgments**

**FROM SIMON:**

Many people have helped in the preparation of this book, but above all I would like to thank Abrams/STC Craft for embracing a how-to pottery book. I would also like to thank STC Craft editor Liana Allday for her patience and diplomacy in overseeing the project. Additional thanks go to my friend Bruce Dehnert who was the fellow writer of this book and also photographed the "how-to" images. And many thanks to editor Suzanne Tourtillott for her tireless attention to detail.

Special mention goes to Jennifer Adams for her ongoing support and contributions throughout this project.

Finally, I also pay tribute to the tradition of pottery making, which has been passed down to me through my family—without them, I would most likely never have become a potter.

**FROM BRUCE:**

A few years ago I was teaching a class of sophomores at UMASS Dartmouth when a student with a laptop excitedly suggested, "Hey, let's see how Simon Leach does that!" In less than a minute we were watching Simon's videos on YouTube and seeing other possibilities flow from his fingertips. From the early stages of writing this book, I have appreciated Simon's passion for describing his own ways of making pots and how he has continued his family's tradition of sharing what they know. In addition to Simon, an enormous thanks also goes to Jennifer Adams.

Without mentors, writing this book would have been impossible. My long-ago teachers from the University of Montana—writing teachers Madeline DeFrees and William Kittredge, and ceramics teacher Rudi Autio—are owed a debt of gratitude. The examples of my dear friends Susan Peterson and Fred Olsen are not forgotten. I've also been mindful of my teachers at Alfred University—Wayne Higby, Anne Currier, Andrea and John Gill, Val Cushing, and Tony Hepburn—who vicariously had much to say along the way. Thanks to Dr. Bill Carty, at Alfred, who provided invaluable technical guidance.

Without places like Peters Valley Craft Center, education in the arts would be greatly diminished. I thank the Center for its support during this project. My assistants—David Stieglitz, Julia Whitney, Alison Lenig, Nicholas Jacobsen, Tom Stollar, and Amber Zuber—are very much appreciated, as is Shafer Hall at the Four Faced Liar in Greenwich Village, where much of the manuscript was written. I am enormously grateful for the book's editors, Liana Allday and Suzanne Tourtillott. As always I would have swam up the wrong river without the patient support of my wife, Kulvinder Kaur Dhew, my son Zedo Foy, and parents, Jeep and Char.
