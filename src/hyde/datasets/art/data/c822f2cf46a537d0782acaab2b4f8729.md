## INTRODUCTION

* * *

Soon after I had started writing this book, a senior figure in an auction house said to me: 'What I really want to know is how a 1960s Warhol, such as a _Liz_ , can go from selling for $2 million in 1999 to $24 million in 2007 – in just eight years!'

Since then, _Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)_ , 1963, one of Andy Warhol's highly sought-after _Disaster_ series, has set a new world record for the artist, making a stunning $105.4 million at Christie's New York in November 2013. It was just one of a number of new price highs set in 2012–13 that demonstrate just how decisively the market for modern and contemporary art, at the top end, shrugged off the effects of the 2008–9 financial crisis and powered back to reach heights that eclipse even the 2007 season, the peak of the previous art market boom. Indeed, 2013 stood out in art-market history as its highest grossing, ever, for sales of fine art at auction.

This book is an attempt to answer that question: to show how the whole art trade has profoundly changed in this century and how it is still evolving.

The total value of the art market, including all categories, was estimated at $65.7 billion in 2013, a figure which comprises both dealer and auction sales; it has grown by 154 per cent since 2003. For fine art at auction – paintings, sculpture, photography and drawings – the total was $12.05 billion in 2013. Unlike in other industries, exact figures are impossible to obtain. Dealer sales are not public, nor are the increasing number of sales over the internet. Auction figures, while often considered transparent, can be skewed by financial instruments and 'buy-ins' – works that do not sell. And the auction price may not be the final value if a work is bought by a dealer and marked up. Many indices to track the performance of art have been created, alongside the growing interest in art as an asset class. None are perfect, and a recent study has found that they may be over-optimistic in their calculation of the returns on investing in art. A recent book, _Art as an Investment? A Survey of Comparative Assets_ by Melanie Gerlis, concludes that art is a very fragile asset from an investment point of view.

The ascendency of contemporary art, which now completely dominates the market, is the most notable of these changes. Between 2004 and 2012 this market grew by 564 per cent in value – far eclipsing the previous traditional heavyweight category of Impressionist and modern art. This is partly due to the lack of supply – there is a diminishing inventory in all other sectors – but is also due to the changing profile of collectors; an overlap between the worlds of art, fashion, luxury and celebrity; the impact of emerging economies; and the sharply increased interest in art as an investment. It also reflects changes in the wider world, notably the nature and polarisation of wealth, and the impact of globalisation and the internet.

Contributing substantially to growing this market have been the new players. Foremost are art fairs, which have burgeoned across the world to an extraordinary degree. The internet has zipped information on art, artists, exhibitions and events around the world, provides a new selling platform for art and reaches a far younger demographic than the 'old' market ever could.

'Superstar' curators and art advisors have played a major role in determining artists' credibility and their validation in both the not-for-profit and for-profit fields, and indeed the permeability between the two – as curators move from the public to private sectors – is increasing. Public museums, once standing aloof from 'the market', are increasingly involved with this new world. Even the most traditional ones now show contemporary art or commission artists' interventions so as to be inclusive and remain relevant to their time.

The fashion for private museums, the billionaire's 'must have' in the twenty-first century, has triggered and accelerated demand for high-impact works by 'brand-name' artists. Apart from those in China, where some also feature traditional art, these private spaces overwhelmingly exhibit contemporary art – further boosting the fame and fortunes of living artists.

The art market is a large mansion with many rooms, and contemporary art is just one of them – and even within that room there are enormous variations. The present 'winner takes all' scenario concerns just a small number of living and recently dead artists, whose work is chased by a growing pool of ultra-wealthy buyers, anxious to acquire the trophy works that will give them incontestable bragging rights. And the higher the price the better in this billionaires' playground. In many cases we are not even talking about 'art' anymore. The production, indeed overproduction, of some living artists puts their work squarely into the category of luxury goods. Some of these changes in the art market have an echo in the fashion industry, which moved from a personal, artisan-led trade in the 1970s to the corporate, branded behemoth companies we see today.

This is the world I look at in the following pages. It is only a partial view of the art market, the one that is most visible and in the news this century. Indeed, the picture of a totally booming market for modern and contemporary art should be nuanced – the strong top end disguises a weaker situation further down the scale, particularly among mid-market galleries, who are classically squeezed between the big operations and the smaller, lighter emerging dealers. This scenario is still being played out, with the mid-market galleries the most under threat. I shall come back to this in Chapter 2.

I have been helped by so many people when writing this book that it would be impossible to name them all. Some are quoted by name, many others did not want to be identified. I extend my heartfelt thanks to them all. I would particularly like to thank my colleagues at _The Art Newspaper_ for their unfailing support and unquenchable good humour over many years. My thanks also go to my commissioning editor Lucy Myers of Lund Humphries for excellent suggestions as to structure, and to Howard Watson for his eagle-eyed copy-editing. Any mistakes are, of course, entirely my own.

Finally, thanks to my husband Christopher, for his constant belief in me, and to my children Sacha, Olivier, Benjamin and their wives for sharing me with the art market.

### NOTES

_Currencies_. When a price conversion is necessary for comparative purposes, the historic converter tool at oanda.com has been used unless a conversion at the time of sale was already provided by the saleroom or dealer.

_Auction prices_. Auction houses publish pre-sale estimates, both for individual works of art and for the final results of the sale, without taking into account the buyers' premium. This varies from 12.5 per cent to 25 per cent depending on the hammer price, and depending on the auction house. (As of December 2013, Christie's and Sotheby's charged 25 per cent on works up to $100,000, 20 per cent on works between $100,001 and $2 million, and 12.5 per cent thereafter.) These fees must be added to the final hammer price. In this book, prices with premium are given unless otherwise indicated.

## GAGOSIAN THROWS A PARTY

'It smelt and tasted of money, but cold money.'  
Guest at Gagosian's opening in Le Bourget airport

_Wednesday 17 October 2012_ : The invitation was one of the most hotly sought-after in the autumn season. The thick card, with what looked like a field of golden wheat on the front, fell through Parisian letter-boxes with a thud a few weeks before. Inside, a rather mysterious X-shape invited the recipient to the opening of a show by the German artist Anselm Kiefer, as well as the dinner afterwards.

The party was being held to celebrate the launch of Gagosian's newest space in Le Bourget, at the time the twelfth outpost of the mega-dealer's art empire, which spans the world from Beverly Hills to Hong Kong. Larry Gagosian, the acknowledged master-dealer of his age, who had started his career 30 years earlier selling posters in a Los Angeles car park, was opening a second space in Paris and, to cap it all, right in a private airport. As someone commented at the party: 'Before, billionaires could jet into a city to visit an art gallery – but they still needed a limo to get there. By putting his new space in an airport, Larry has eliminated the need for the limo!'

The 250-odd guests in Le Bourget that night were offered another form of transport – a train. While Gagosian's white-cube space, in a former 1950s hangar, was capacious, with 1,650 square metres, it was too small for the number of guests. In any case it was filled with an installation of a caged-in, golden wheat field, along with paintings of flower-strewn meadows in the adjoining galleries, some so freshly painted that you could smell the oil. So after the _vernissage_ of the show that evening, guests were rattled in a small shuttle 300 metres down the road to another, far bigger hangar, hired for the occasion. Here the interior was mostly plunged into darkness, but the aviation theme was strong: blue lights around the walls and red spotlights on the tables, which were laid out in the form of a cross, lit with lines of LED lights like a landing strip. This, then, as guests realised, was the 'X' in the invitation.

But what really made them gasp were three full-size private jets, looming out of the darkness, parked between the arms of the cross. To one side, a flashing black-and-white checkerboard dancefloor pulsated to the music of a DJ.

Among the international smorgasbord of guests were artists – Californian Ed Ruscha in open shirt and bootlace tie, Anselm Kiefer in sober white shirt and French Marcel Duchamp prize-winner Tatiana Trouvé in patterned black-and-white; architect Jean Nouvel, responsible for the elegant refit of the gallery; collectors, including the Irish hotel mogul Paddy McKillan, Greek financier Dimitri Mavrommatis, and French photographer and philanthropist Jean Pigozzi in a colourful shirt; decorator Peter Marino; members of the Picasso family; Swiss/Spanish film star Vincent Pérez; and museum curators, among them Suzanne Pagé, who now buys art for Bernard Arnault, the luxury-goods mogul who owns Dior, Dom Pérignon, Louis Vuitton and much else besides.

Then there was a smattering of European princely scions and art dealers, including Jay Jopling of White Cube, with his girlfriend, the Asian-American actor Hikari Yokoyama, and Thaddaeus Ropac, a big-league art dealer fresh from opening his own new mega-space – bigger than Gagosian's – in Pantin, just outside Paris.

Ropac had inaugurated his space with a show by Kiefer, long planned, before Gagosian suddenly announced that he too would open his new space with Kiefer. 'I'm speechless!' said a stunned Ropac when he heard the news. But the art market is a ruthless jungle: the only concession was moving his opening to follow that of Ropac. Badly placed on a table near the exit, Ropac quickly left the party.

Permanently tanned, Gagosian has been compared to a lion, or more unkindly, to a shark. The leonine comparison is the most apt: with his full head of crisp grey hair, snub nose and strong jaw, along with his don't-mess-with-me demeanour, at the time Gagosian was the undisputed leader of the pack, the dealer who revolutionised the way contemporary art was sold. He turned his galleries, and many of the artists he represents, into 'brands' recognised across the world. He was the first art dealer ever to create a worldwide network of art galleries, which he uses to run a global art enterprise that represents 77 artists and handles dozens more; his empire was reported, in 2012, to generate revenues of almost $1 billion a year.

Gagosian appears to be single-mindedly focused on his business: he has no children and no apparent succession plan. He does have girlfriends, the present being Chrissie Erpf. She was at his side at the Le Bourget party, seated at one end of the giant 'X' table with the more important guests. As the evening wore on some guests took the dance floor, in a desultory fashion: many were concerned more about getting back to Paris. The whole evening was, says one guest, 'A demonstration of luxury, power and money. The evening was glamorous, impressive, but somehow grim: it smelt and tasted of money, but cold money.'

Gagosian's party encapsulated much of the scope of this book, bringing together most of the players and the themes we shall meet in the coming pages: the glamour, the exclusivity, the spending and the global nature of the market today.

The art market has always had glamorous parties, but nothing on the scale or ambition of that evening. The market has had its prolific artists, but historically none were able to produce so much, so fast, thanks to armies of assistants and a globalised world. It had seen a few international dealerships such as Wildenstein or Marlborough, but nothing on the global scale of Gagosian. It had seen a 'branded' gallery in Duveen, but nothing with the scope, size and influence of today's mega-dealers. It had seen a handful of massively wealthy collectors, such as Henry Huntington or Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, but nothing comparable to the pool of 2,170 billionaires across the globe, worth an aggregate total of $6.5 trillion, reported in 2013.

Contemporary art has seen other peaks, for example in late nineteenth-century Europe, but had never seen the art of today become so fashionable, desirable and sought-after on a global scale. Perhaps most importantly, it had never seen museum building – mainly due to private initiative – taking place simultaneously in so many countries, with all vying for the latest, largest and most striking contemporary artworks. And it had never seen the hordes of intermediaries, advisors, agents, bankers, socialites, art fund managers and independent curators who had appeared, riding on the coat tails of the boom.

In the following chapters we shall look at all these different players: how contemporary art has become the overwhelming force in the market; how dealers and auctioneers went global; and why art prices have rocketed so high that one player quite seriously believes that he will see a $1 billion artwork in his lifetime.

From Dusty Booksellers to _The Art People_

'I am convinced I will see a work of art sell for $1 billion in my lifetime.'

Francis Outred, head of contemporary art, Christie's

_12 November 2013_ : It was a freezing evening in New York as sleek black limousines with tinted windows disgorged their passengers in front of Christie's Rockefeller Center saleroom in New York. As the visitors hurried into the building, passers-by were photographing the reflecting orange flanks of the ten-foot high, polished steel _Balloon Dog_ , 1994–2000, by Jeff Koons, positioned outside. The slick, shiny sculpture was one of a handful of big-ticket items going on sale in that evening's post-war and contemporary art evening sale, all expected to shatter existing records: a Bacon triptych was, indeed, widely tipped to set a new world record for any work of art sold at auction. So the excitement was intense as potential bidders, top dealers, collectors and moneyed prospects pressed through the glass doors to pick up their bidding paddles and place tickets. Those deemed not quite as important were directed to a side room, linked by video to the main saleroom up a double staircase on the first floor.

Christie's had heavily hyped the sale with an extravagant marketing campaign focused particularly on the Koons, rebranding its catalogues in orange and placing inserts even in its Dubai sales material. The piece, claimed the firm in its press release, was the 'Holy Grail for collectors and foundations . . . and has always communicated the prominence and stature of its owner,' hammering the message home with: 'To own this work immediately positions the buyer alongside the very top collectors in the world and transforms a collection to an unparalleled level of greatness.' The promotion was taken, indeed, to a new level of hyperbole; even Christie's head of contemporary art, Brett Gorvy, weighed into the heavy sell, writing to clients that seeing the offerings in the coming event had rendered him 'almost speechless'.

So intense was the interest in the run-up to the sale that Christie's made a last-minute change to the schedule, adding an extra 15 minutes to the start time to accommodate the 1,400 visitors – and, more intriguingly, moving the Bacon ( _Three Studies of Lucian Freud_ , 1969) from a comparatively lowly position as lot 32 to lot 8A. Why? Christie's said that it meant those who were likely to bid on other items would do so knowing the outcome of the Bacon – and outside observers pointed out that Chinese buyers love the auspicious figure eight . . .

The most cherished clients of the auction houses do not attend these evening sales openly: they are whisked into the buildings via separate entrances and hidden in 'sky boxes' overlooking the room, from where they can watch the auction and talk by telephone to the staff. That November evening, Christie's had so many of these special clients that it built another skybox at the back of the saleroom, with one-way glass so the guests could see but not be seen – making it look a bit like a duck blind, as one observer noted.

There was a palpable sense of excitement as the smartly dressed crowd jostled to find its seats – some clutching miniature balloon dogs. Auctioneer Jussi Pylkkänen started by reading out the lot numbers of works that came under financial arrangements of one sort of another, mainly 'guaranteed', either by Christie's itself or by third parties, meaning that someone had already promised to buy them at an undisclosed price. As the list of these works lengthened – 23 lots out of the 69 on offer – the audience murmured and then burst out laughing. In total, Christie's or outside guarantors had underwritten about $500 million worth of the art on offer that evening.

Auction houses always start such sales with a sure-fire winner to get the room pumped up: in this case, it was the fashionable artist Wade Guyton, whose ink-jet print set a new record at $2.4 million, well over its $500,000–$700,000 estimate. Other successes followed – a Jean-Michel Basquiat at $12 million, a Christopher Wool at $26.5 million, another record, and then Pylkkänen paused, drew in his breath as the Bacon came up: 'Let's start this at $80 million,' he said: seven bidders jumped in, some in the room, others bidding through Christie's staffers on telephones. The increments – the amounts by which the bids were increased – were going in multiples of $5 million; at $100 million, a 23-year-old Korean, Hong Gyu Shin, raised his paddle. Super-dealer Gagosian pulled out after $105 million, but at $122 million, there were still two bidders in the fray, who were represented by Christie's Xin Li, deputy chairman Asia, and Lock Kresler, head of private sales. Pylkkänen's hammer finally fell at $127 million for Kresler as the room applauded; he was later revealed to have been bidding for the New York dealer William Acquavella.

Christie's staff – all wearing the obligatory black – scurried to a small knot of journalists standing on one side of the room to give them the final price including fees: $142.2 million. Within minutes a newsflash had gone out: the price set a new record for any work of art at auction, smashing the previous record holder, Munch's _The Scream_ , 1895, which had made almost $120 million at Sotheby's just 18 months before (Sotheby's New York, 2 May 2010), although if adjusted for inflation, Van Gogh's _Portrait of Dr Gachet_ , 1890, sold at Christie's in 1990 for $82.5 million, achieved the higher price in relative terms ($147.42 million in 2013).

Meanwhile, the auctioneer was sweeping on: three lots later the Koons came up. Like the Bacon, it was guaranteed by a third party; it had been sent for sale by print mogul, art collector and dealer Peter Brant; in the room, the gossip was that its sale had been underwritten by the state of Qatar.

_Balloon Dog_ was one of five created in the 1990s, and the four others – each in a different colour – already belong to well-known collectors: the beleaguered hedge-fund mogul, Steven A. Cohen, whose SAC fund had paid a $1.8 billion fine for insider trading the week before; Los Angeles collector Eli Broad; Christie's owner François Pinault; and the Greek industrialist Dakis Joannou.

The estimate was $35 million–$55 million, but this time there were only two bidders, one of them the New York mega-dealer David Zwirner. Telephone pressed to his ear, he bid up to $49 million, dropped out, entered again, but finally lost the lot to the other bidder at $52 million, making a final price with fees of $58,405,000 – a new record for any living artist at auction. After the sale, Christie's triumphantly announced that its total of $691,583,000 was the highest amount ever made in any art auction. A stunning 11 lots had sold for over $20 million each. And despite that evening's buying orgy, the same crowd pressed into Sotheby's glass-and-steel York Avenue premises the following night. More money was splurged on art, with Warhol's _Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)_ , 1963, racing past its $60 million-plus pre-sale estimate to make $105.4 million, again a new artist record at auction.

The two evening sales alone raised over $1 billion: the Bacon, it emerged later, was bought by William Acquavella on behalf of Elaine Wynn, ex-wife of the Las Vegas gambling tycoon Stephen Wynn, himself also an avid art collector.

### SOTHEBY'S AND CHRISTIE'S – THE LUXURY BRANDS OF THE ART WORLD

There are thousands of auction houses in the world – the French site Artprice says it collates results from 4,500 of them, although the industry leader Artnet goes for a more modest 1,500. In 2013, the line-up of the biggest was:

1. Christie's, $7.12 billion

2. Sotheby's, $6.3 billion

3. Beijing Poly International Auction Co., 7.88 billion yuan (CNY) (around $1.3 billion)

4. China Guardian Auctions Co., 55 billion yuan (CNY) (around $1.08 billion)

5. Bonhams, $895 million.

Another significant player in the market for contemporary art is the New York-and London-based Phillips, which does not communicate figures.

Christie's belongs to the luxury-goods mogul François Pinault, who bought it for just over $1 billion in 1998 through his holding company, Artémis. Sotheby's is a publicly quoted company without a controlling shareholder. Poly is part of a sprawling conglomerate that includes the Chinese army. China Guardian is a privately owned company established in 1993. Bonhams is also privately owned, and has been through a number of changes since its founding in 1793. Today it belongs to Robert Brooks and a business partner, the Dutch entrepreneur Evert Louwman. Phillips belongs to a Russian luxury-goods group, Mercury, and has carved out a niche market in the contemporary art field, selling recently produced works by younger artists as well as design and photography. Its accounts are not public, but it expanded into expensive new quarters at 450 Park Avenue in New York in 2010 and has bought a £100 million building in London's Berkeley Square for its saleroom.

The 'big two', Sotheby's and Christie's, remain far and away the dominant firms. Their combined figures, depending on the year, account for about 80 per cent of the market at the top end; in the contemporary art sector, they alone generated over half of total art sales at auction – about $800 million in 2013. This is not because they hold more sales, but because the value of their sales is so much higher than elsewhere. Except for the occasional blip, and until the Chinese houses emerged as players after 2004, virtually _all_ high-value works of art sold at auction went through Sotheby's and Christie's; Phillips de Pury accounts for just one on the list of the 48 top prices paid for art. All attempts to muscle into this duopoly have failed, most spectacularly at the beginning of the twenty-first century, as we shall see later.

Sotheby's and Christie's have been a key element in the transformation of the art market in the twenty-first century. While the 'big box' dealers and a tsunami of art fairs have also played a significant role, the auction houses, with their powerful marketing departments and global reach, have been the motor of the market's growth. They have created and stimulated demand, particularly in the emerging economies, and been the public 'face' of the market with its constant flow of news about high prices, press profiles of personable auctioneers and fashion-oriented features in magazines about the specialists.

Back in 1999, however, both firms were on the ropes after revelations that they had colluded to fix commission fees in the early 1990s: Sotheby's then majority shareholder, the 'shopping mall king' A. Alfred Taubman, went to prison for a year, while Christie's, which had handed over evidence of collusion, was not prosecuted, although both firms had to pay a total settlement to clients of $512 million. But with new 'clean pair of hands' chief executives and a rising art market, particularly after 2004, the firms were able to put the scandal behind them rapidly.

Sotheby's and Christie's are the luxury brands of the market, and they have grown in lockstep with consumer luxury brands. They embody some of the essential qualities of consumer luxury brands: a long history; personal service; elitism; exclusivity. While their names have long been recognised as 'top of the market' in the established markets of the US and Europe, this is particularly important in emerging economies. Here the names 'Sotheby's' and 'Christie's' are aspirational, prestigious 'foreign' brands. Culturally, bidders from new markets tend to favour the auction process, which they see as more transparent; some Asians, many of whom love gambling, are seduced by the competitive element of auction. And in addition the Asian respect for longevity means that the auction houses' extended history is an enormous plus, and it is significant that when Christie's held its first auction in Shanghai in September 2013, it missed no occasion to hammer home its foundation date of 1766.

Since 2010, Christie's has been run by Steven Murphy, who arrived from a music and publishing background, and he brought with him a change of culture in the firm. The firm's newest recruits now come from a business background, rather than an arts one, and Christie's is aggressively seeking ways to move beyond the traditional 'auction house' profile and into a more consumer-oriented one. It now calls itself ' _The Art People_ ', with colour advertisements that show specialists posed very much in the _Vanity Fair_ style of photo-shoots about celebrities. Murphy has been responsible for bolstering the marketing, 'content' and digital side of the business, recruiting from consumer-brand specialists and the publishing industry.

While Christie's, Sotheby's and to a lesser extent Phillips are renowned today for their high-octane, 'branded' auctions that attract banks of television cameras, headline-hitting prices and a glamorous, cosmopolitan audience, the auction world was a totally different business until the mid-twentieth century. Sotheby's was founded as a book auctioneer, although this was not the dusty pursuit one might imagine today: books and libraries were prestigious accoutrements of a gentleman's world. Christie's, founded soon after Sotheby's, specialised in pictures and furniture, and from all accounts James Christie was a remarkable salesman and silver-tongued auctioneer who was famed for his eloquence in the auction box.

Even in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the auction houses behaved in many ways that would be recognised today – enticing clients with smart catalogues, selling art by private treaty and even extending credit to prospective buyers, but these were not the core of their businesses. Auction houses, large and small, were principally suppliers on the 'wholesale' market selling to dealers on the secondary, or resale, market. Major collections were more likely to be sold through art galleries than through an auctioneer well into the twentieth century, as auctions were still considered not prestigious enough.

The art market then, and for decades to come, was still a secretive, closed place where business was transacted on a handshake between people who generally knew each other. Auctioneering was just as personal: dealer James Roundell, who was at Christie's between 1973 and 1993, remembers:

There were no paddles until 1988; the bidders held up their hands, and the auctioneer called out the name of the person – '£1,000 to Smith' for instance. If it was an unknown person then a staffer would get their name. It was generally the convention that auctioneers did not disclose, as the sale was going along, whether a lot was unsold. Instead they would call out a fictitious name from a prepared list, for example players for Chelsea football club! If buyers at an auction could not tell what was being sold and what was not then it made the sale seem to be going better than it in fact was.

The anecdote reveals what a small world it was. This was partly due to the distribution of wealth, which was concentrated in far fewer hands. Until the late twentieth century, there were under 100 buyers in the world for major works of art, those that fetched over $5 million: 'Twenty years ago, 20 per cent of the _Forbes_ 500 were our clients,' says Thomas Seydoux, formerly with Christie's, now working in the dealing partnership Connery Pissarro Seydoux. It was a largely personal world, and one which did not require much long-distance flying except to the US and Japan, let alone knowledge of very different cultures and languages.

### NEW MONEY, NEW BUYERS

All this changed at the end of the twentieth century. With the disappearance of communism in Russia, and the shift in China towards commercial liberalisation (even if the political system remained communist), coupled with the 1991 economic liberalisation in India, suddenly there were vast new markets to exploit – and a growing number of wealthy consumers hungry for the consumer goods that they had never had, and the desire to flaunt their money with prestige products.

Today, say auctioneers, the number of buyers at a high level – over $5 million – has exploded to about 1,000 or more. 'We don't even know them, and they come in at the top from the start,' says Seydoux: 'For a major contemporary painting we might make a special catalogue to send to prospective clients,' says one auction house specialist: 'We might print 500, and of those there could be 100 possible, and 50 strong candidates at that level.' Globalisation means, he says, that buyers can come from all over: 'Every season we see a different part of the world stepping up – Hong Kong, Indonesia, Brazil, Singapore, Colombia, Malaysia, now even Azerbaijan' (see Chapter 7).

### GLOBALISATION

Globalisation is certainly the key reason the auction houses have grown to the mega-businesses they are today. For a start they were far better placed to capitalise on the growing wealth around the world compared to dealers, as they already had a network of contacts in countries such as Russia, China and India. They had marketing machines that enabled them to penetrate these new markets far more swiftly than could dealers, who overwhelmingly functioned out of a single country. And the auction houses pack their advisory boards with well-connected people from across the world. Christie's boards, for example, include the Turkish collectors Kemal Has Cingillioğlu, Çiğdem Simavi and Usha Mittal, wife of the Indian steel-magnate Lakshmi Mittal, the 41st richest person in the world according to _Forbes_ , while Sotheby's has Pansy Ho, daughter of Hong Kong's 'king of gambling' Stanley Ho.

It is a truism that art follows money, and as newly rich countries' economies grew, so the auction houses were there to 'educate' them on buying art. From the 1950s on, Sotheby's and Christie's were expanding internationally: Sotheby's was the first auction house to hold a sale in Hong Kong in 1973; Christie's opened in New York in 1977 and held its first sale in Hong Kong in 1986. Christie's and Bonhams opened in Dubai in 2006 and 2008 (Bonhams ended sales there in 2011). But the real prize, from 2004 onwards, was the exploding Chinese market, which in 2011 briefly became – according to its reported figures – the biggest market for art in the world (see Chapter 7). At end of 2013, Christie's held its first sale in India, in Mumbai, raising INR96.6 million ($15.5 million), double pre-sale expectations.

Along with expanding internationally, the other major change in auctioneering was the transformation of the business base. Until the late twentieth century, the auction houses' main focus was selling works of art at auction on behalf of consignors, and getting rewarded by commission – very low or inexistent in the case of the vendor, higher in the case of the buyer. They did not hold their own inventory, nor had they yet aggressively developed services to buyers and sellers or started their prolonged assault on the dealer sector.

Supply being crucial in the art market, the auction houses realised that the way forward was modern art. In the 1970s Old Masters ruled the roost, with an Andrea Mantegna – _The Adoration of the Magi_ , 1462 – retaining the top spot as the most expensive work of art sold at auction until 1987. But things changed after Vincent Van Gogh's 1889 _Sunflowers_ made £22 million at Christie's in London in 1987, the first time a modern painting had beaten an Old Master. The sale sent an electric shock around the world, hitting headlines everywhere, because it went to the Japanese firm Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance. It marked the beginning of a three-year boom driven by Japanese buying.

Impressionist and modern art would dominate the market in the 1980s and 1990s, but here also supply was finite and diminishing, as the best pieces were cherry-picked for museum collections, disappearing from the market forever. The auction houses quickly realised that the lucrative new potential was in a field that until then they had hardly touched: contemporary art.

Today, contemporary art has become the biggest-grossing part of Sotheby's and Christie's business. In 2013 Christie's sold $2 billion worth of art in the post-war and contemporary art category; Sotheby's reported $1.4 billion in its contemporary art category. The two houses define the category a little differently, Christie's treating artists as 'post-war' when their most formative period was post-1945; and 'contemporary' when they are living: Sotheby's doesn't make this distinction and essentially the two categories cover the same period.

It seems astonishing, today, the level of controversy provoked by the auction houses' first forays into this market. The conventional wisdom was that contemporary art was the dealers' preserve, and only appeared at auction after a generation. But a watershed moment had happened back in 1973, with the Scull sale at Sotheby's New York.

The 50 contemporary American works on offer – by the likes of Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol – had been recently bought by a New York taxi-fleet owner, Robert Scull. He had bought heavily, then flipped it all into auction for a then-unprecedented $2.2 million total. Jasper Johns' _Double White Map_ , one of his target works from the 1960s, bought for $10,000, made $240,000; Rauschenberg's _Thaw_ , purchased in 1958 for $900, sold for $85,000. The auction provoked outrage and, according to Scull's wife, a dust-up with Rauschenberg: the venerable critic Irving Sandler claimed that Rauschenberg accosted Scull after the sale and shouted: 'Kiss me – I like to be kissed when I'm being fucked!' As Sandler told the story, Rauschenberg never spoke to Scull again, but in retrospect that sale was a key turning point, leading the auction houses towards the contemporary art market and also turning the market into an investment or commodity market. Nicholas Maclean of the art dealership Eykyn Maclean points out: 'The perfect market is where you know you have a constant supply, and only contemporary art can provide this. And art dealers will always try to support the market for their artists.'

A further boost came in 1998, when the luxury-goods tycoon François Pinault bought Christie's for $1 billion. As a collector of contemporary art and as the owner of a host of branded products, his influence was decisive in transforming the auction business. He encouraged the head of contemporary art, Philippe Ségalot, to develop his department, which he did with gusto, for example by organising the _Think Pink_ party at Christie's in 1999, wearing a Pink Panther tail sticking out from under his dinner jacket to promote the sale of Jeff Koons' _Pink Panther_ , 1988. The work sold for a then astonishing $1.8 million on 16 November 1999 at Christie's New York, going to newsprint magnate Peter Brant. 'I underbid it, and afterwards someone came up to me and said, "Aren't you insane?"' says the Swiss-born, globe-trotting curator, art dealer and auctioneer Simon de Pury. 'I responded: "Yes, insane for not getting it."' _Pink Panther_ resold on 10 May 2011 at Sotheby's New York for over $16.8 million (under its $20 million to $30 million pre-sale estimate, and coupled with a guarantee).

In 2004 an auction of contemporary art smashed the $100 million barrier for the first time, and set 30 new auction records for artists from Jackson Pollock to Takashi Murakami. Within a year the $100 million total was swept away when in November 2005 Sotheby's racked up $157.5 million in its contemporary art sale in New York. And while contemporary art plunged in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008–9, it recovered astonishingly quickly. Since 2011 it has been the biggest grossing part of both Christie's and Sotheby's businesses, as we have seen, particularly at the high end. The majority of the 80 lots that sold for over $14 million in 2013 were from this sector, and they generate huge amounts of media attention and are the main focus of the major auction houses.

### THE FINAL FRONTIER – WET PAINT ART

The next step for the auction houses, after selling contemporary art on the secondary market, was to sell art directly from the studio on the primary market, a tactic that they have been exploring for some years now. One way was to buy an art gallery, but as we shall see this was not a success. Nevertheless, the auction houses do sell directly from artists in emerging markets such as in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and China, where the gallery system is not well established, where the benchmark for prices remains auction results and where artists gallery hop. Selina Patta Sumbung, representative of Christie's in Indonesia, and freshly arrived in the art business from the finance industry, told me in Singapore: 'We are going to be selling young artists' works; we need to broaden the base of our buyers, bring in younger people.' Asked if galleries were unhappy about this, she said: 'Christie's is a brand, and we need to move it along, modernise it and make it better known, not just remain a saleroom for older art.'

The most famous, or even notorious, direct sale took place at Sotheby's London in 2008, when Damien Hirst bypassed his dealers, Gagosian and White Cube, and consigned 218 works to the auction house. The direct-from-the-production line works were made for a new money market – sparkling and gilded, they shouted 'bling!' and were a re-run of the artist's greatest hits, but with the volume turned up, so to speak. On the first day of the sale the financial services company Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, but the second day of the sale progressed as spectacularly as the first. With nothing apparently unsold, the auction raised £111 million, although subsequently various unconfirmed reports claimed that the auction house had given long payment terms and even that some winning bids – up to 30 per cent – were never settled (see Chapter 8). Sotheby's has always maintained that the sale was a success. Other artists were thought to be interested in doing the same thing, notably Takashi Murakami, but the financial crisis that swept through the world and continued for the following 18 months ended any such projects at the time.

### FINANCIAL SERVICES AND GUARANTEES

As well as engaging massively in the field of contemporary art, the auction houses have been expanding in other ways, notably in the financial services sector. Because of their far greater capitalisation, they are able to offer financial guarantees to sellers in a way that dealers generally are less able – or willing – to do.

Guarantees are not new, and in their simplest form – which auction houses call 'naked' or a financier might call 'plain vanilla' – are quite simple: the auction house promises a certain price to the vendor, whatever the outcome of the actual auction. If a painting fails to sell, then the auction house pays the vendor and keeps the art, either re-offering it in a subsequent sale or offloading it privately. If the painting sells under the guaranteed sum, then the auction house pays out the guaranteed sum to the vendor. If it sells for more, then depending on the contract, the 'overage' or 'upside' would be split between auction house and vendor.

The use of guarantees has gone in and out of fashion along with the strength of the market – in boom times they appear, only to disappear when times are tough. They exploded at the end of the twentieth century, came back to bite the auction houses and then morphed into something very different after the 2008–9 global financial crisis. In 2013 they returned strongly. Guarantees are widely credited with contributing to today's booming art prices as they reassure vendors that they can successfully sell publicly – and reward those who underwrite the sales.

One of the first people to use a guarantee was Sotheby's chairman Peter Wilson, who in 1956 promised £35,000 for Nicolas Poussin's _The Adoration of the Shepherds_ ( _c_.1633–4) to its owner. While he lost money at the sale – the work sold for just £29,000 – it achieved a record price, and the publicity generated more than compensated for the downside. Shortly after the sale, the _Adoration_ was consecrated by being acquired from the winning bidder by London's National Gallery, where it still hangs.

However, this case was exceptional and it was only in the early 1970s that guarantees started to be used more regularly, notably by Sotheby's to bag the Scull collection. In the wake of the mid-1970s oil crises they disappeared, only to be revived at the turn of the century by Louis Vuitton Moët and Hennessy (LVMH) in what has become a case study in commercial suicide.

In 1999 LVMH, which belongs to the French luxury-goods tycoon Bernard Arnault, bought Phillips, an auction house founded in London in the eighteenth century, for $125 million. Arnault then transformed the firm into 'Phillips de Pury and Luxembourg', bringing in Simon de Pury and Daniella Luxembourg, two very well-connected former auction-house specialists and dealers, to run it.

Arnault and Pinault, owner of Christie's, are rivals, each owning massive luxury-goods conglomerates. Pinault already owned Christie's; Arnault's idea was to create a new, sleek and well-financed competitor to Sotheby's and Christie's and turn Phillips into a luxury 'brand' that would get a seat with them at the top table. LVMH poured money into the venture, but the only way it could obtain consignments was by 'buying' them via guarantees. In 2001 in New York it sold 72 French and German works of art from the Los Angeles collectors Nathan and Marion Smooke, offering them the biggest guarantee in auction history – almost $180 million. The sale raised just $86 million, leaving LVMH staring at a huge loss. Its shareholders rebelled at the level of losses – reported to be $400 million – in the wake of the economic downturn after September 2001 and in 2002 the firm threw in the towel, selling Phillips to Simon de Pury and Daniella Luxembourg.

As the art-market boom mounted, in 2004–7, so did guarantees. Sotheby's promised a total of $902 million in its 2007 sales, double the amount for 2006 and up from $131 million for 2006. Christie's, as a private company, does not reveal such interesting data.

The sourcing for auction and negotiations with vendors take place about three months before each sale, and in 2008 the auction houses were caught out by the September crash. The May auctions in New York that year had been fruitful, raising over $1.5 billion. So the salerooms had made over-optimistic promises to vendors for the November sessions and were locked into prices that, after the financial meltdown in September, suddenly became totally unrealistic. The November sales at Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips de Pury brought in under half the predicted totals. For example, Christie's 75-lot sale saw a punishing 37 works fail to find buyers, including Peter Doig's _Pine House (Rooms for Rent)_ , 1994, estimated at up to $6.5 million and guaranteed. Having become Christie's property, it was reoffered at the firm's London sale in October the following year, where it made just £1.4 million ($2.3 million).

Chastened, the auction houses stopped the guarantees for a time, but they soon crept back. This time they were in a different guise, and one that many consider to be problematic. New symbols flowered in auction catalogues, notably a horseshoe-shaped one that signalled an 'irrevocable bid' at Sotheby's in 2008.

How it works is this: the auction house finds someone who promises a certain amount for a work of art. If no one bids any higher, then the bidder gets it, paying the normal buyer's premium. If it goes higher, then the auction house shares the upside with the bidder, in an arrangement that may be 50/50 or on a sliding scale. There is a difference between Christie's and Sotheby's, in that Christie's rewards the third-party guarantor just for participating, whereas Sotheby's only pays out when the work goes to another bidder.

Sotheby's invariably couples irrevocable bids with a guarantee, meaning that the irrevocable bid, in the words of its UK chairman Melanie Clore, 'becomes the reserve'. Whatever the outcome, the work is effectively pre-sold in advance of the auction, making something of a mockery of the whole process. The auction houses don't see it in this light, of course, and argue that it has been a powerful argument to bring in consignments for sale.

The fundamental issue is one of transparency, and dealers – who are hardly beacons of transparency themselves – complain that Christie's system, when the third-party guarantor is rewarded whatever the outcome, means that the actual price published is different from the one paid, since the guarantor gets a kick-back. In this context it is interesting to note, on Christie's website auction 'results' page, the tiny question mark above the price attained for the Bacon and the Koons – both guaranteed – at its November 2013 sale. 'Price Realized is hammer price plus buyer's premium and does not reflect costs, financing fees or application of buyer's or seller's credits,' the question mark reveals, meaning, essentially, that the exact final price is unknowable to anyone but the buyer, seller and some of the auction-house staff.

A tiny pool of collectors and dealers are believed to be supplying the guarantees, notably the Mugrabi family (see Chapter Eight), the Qataris, Peter Brant and New York dealer William Acquavella, something that certainly reinforces the 'inner circle' nature of the art business at the top. As we saw, in its 12 November 2013 auction Christie's had various such arrangements for 23 of the 69 lots, while Sotheby's filings showed that it had $206.4 million in guarantees on its sale the following night.

Whatever the ethics of the guarantee system, it has certainly been a major factor in wooing owners of major art to sell at auction, has almost certainly led to price inflation, and has been an important factor in flipping the market, at the top end, towards auction.

Another inducement offered to clients with the most attractive works for sale goes under the curious name of 'enhanced hammer'. This means that not only does the auction house waive the normal seller's fees of about 10 per cent, but it agrees to give all or part of the buyer's fees – which can be up to 25 per cent – to the vendor or to the third-party guarantor. In the case of the Koons' _Balloon Dog_ mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, its owner Peter Brant had cut a deal with Christie's to receive all the buyer's fees up to a certain, undisclosed price, which trade sources rumoured was $70 million. The sculpture did not make that level, and in an interview with the _New York Times_ , Brant said that as a result Christie's had made no money from the sale at all. But bringing in a really stellar work of art encourages other vendors to put their works into the same sale, which is why the auction houses are prepared to take a financial hit on that consignment. However, this fierce competition is increasingly having an impact on the firms' bottom lines: while Christie's does not reveal profits, Sotheby's has consistently noted thinning auction commission margins and in 2013 increased its buyers' fees because of this (Christie's followed suit a few months later).

Guarantees are not the only way the auction houses have expanded their business model in the twenty-first century. They increasingly offer financial services to clients, from taking art as collateral against loans to lending money to secure consignments. These loans can be advances to clinch a deal, in which case a small symbol alongside a lot number, indicating that the firm has a 'financial interest' in the lot, often means that a loan has been made to the vendor. Rates of interest vary from 9 per cent to 25 per cent – a lower rate being applied by auction houses on works they will be selling, as opposed to loans against a collection.

Such financing can occur before a sale. In the case of the Elizabeth Taylor collection, for example, Christie's is believed to have obtained a contract to sell her property well before her death. In exchange she was given a multimillion line of credit, at a time when her business, House of Taylor, was struggling. The investment paid off: the Elizabeth Taylor sale, held in December 2011, was a knockout success, raising $157.7 million and selling every single item offered, from a massive 33-carat diamond ring that made $8.8 million to a pair of faux fur Louboutin heels sold online for $780 after the main auctions.

### ATTACKING THE DEALER TERRITORY: PRIVATE SALES AND SELLING SHOWS

The area which has seen the greatest expansion by the auction houses this century is private sales. As with everything else, this is not new – indeed, such sales have been conducted by auction houses as far back as their foundation: James Christie even managed to sell privately some ivory chairs and a sofa to King George III in 1781 (they are still in the Royal Collection).

In 2000 Christie's sold just $185 million privately; Sotheby's didn't even separate out such sales until 2005, when it published a figure of $271.8 million. Compare with 2013, when both Christie's and Sotheby's announced $1.2 billion each in private sales.

In this realm, the auction house matches a buyer and a seller, taking a percentage on the way past – 'On the same level as the saleroom premium,' says Alex Platon, formerly head of private sales at Sotheby's London. The system works two ways, with vendors sometimes choosing not to take the saleroom route and asking the auction house to find a private buyer. Discretion, the avoidance of possible family recriminations and the fear of the work being 'burned' by failing to find a buyer at auction are all reasons. Alternatively, buyers may ask the auction house to look out for a particular work. The auction houses have 'got the best address books in the world,' says Francis Outred, head of contemporary art at Christie's.

It is customary in the art world to say that the auction houses 'know where the bodies are buried', meaning the firms know the locations of works of art, even if they are not actually for sale. A quick call or visit to the owner, a persuasive conversation – and the work may become 'available' if the price is right. Thomas Seydoux says that in the Impressionist and modern field, in 2012, 50 paintings worth over $20 million were sold – 40 of them privately.

The danger here is that if none of the prospects bite, then the work of art will go to auction, where it is 'burned' because it has already been exposed to possible buyers. And surely, I wondered, private sales cannibalise the auctions by taking works that otherwise would go under the hammer? Platon says not: 'For a start, if five people bid on, say, a Picasso, then there are four disappointed clients when it sells. That is an opportunity for us to try to find them comparable works.'

By muscling into the domain of private sales, Sotheby's and Christie's are functioning exactly like dealers, and as the twenty-first century advanced, so they ramped up their attack on their territory. As well as acting as an intermediary between buyer and seller, they looked to plug other gaps in their business – such as acquiring inventory for sale and becoming dealers themselves.

'Traditionally, Sotheby's and Christie's fought each other for about 40 per cent of the market. Then in the early 1990s, they realised that the growth would come from attacking the other 60 per cent, the part held by dealers,' says Roundell. The first step in this process came when Sotheby's and the New York dealer William Acquavella bought the inventory – 2,300 works of art – of the Pierre Matisse Gallery for $153 million, in 1990. This was gradually resold over the following years, but in 2011 Sotheby's investment in the partnership – the remaining inventory – still stood at $46.9 million. One failed attempt was the purchase, again by Sotheby's, of the André Emmerich Gallery in 1996. The idea was to handle artists' estates, but the gallery soon lost a significant one, the Albers estate, and Sotheby's closed the gallery in 1998.

Undaunted by these examples, Christie's pursued the idea of vertical integration by attempting to enter the primary market. In 2007 the firm bought the British art gallery Haunch of Venison from Harry Blain and Graham Southern, provoking much shock and protest by art dealers, who saw this as the potential end of art galleries altogether. If the auction houses could successfully sell 'wet paint' art, then primary-market dealers were left with no role at all.

Blain, a personable former stockbroker, had founded the gallery with Southern, who was formerly with Christie's in 2002, and they were successfully racking up good sales both in the primary and in the secondary markets. At the time of the acquisition, Haunch of Venison was turning a £1.6 million profit on turnover of £66 million. Among the bold-name artists they represented were Bill Viola, Richard Long and Turner Prize-winner Keith Tyson.

Christie's owner François Pinault was a client, and the firm wanted to find a way into the primary market as well as using the gallery to broker secondary-market sales. At the time, Haunch was considered a competitor to other major players such as Hauser & Wirth or White Cube, with a good roster of artists. But almost immediately after the controversial takeover, some of Haunch's artists left, including Tyson.

Replacing them proved problematic – as an arm of an auction house, Haunch was debarred from most art fairs, hampering its ability to attract artists, who want the international exposure that fairs can give them. After a splashy initial exhibition in New York, two museum professionals recruited in 2009 quickly departed. Blain and Southern left the firm in 2010 to set up their own gallery after trying, and failing, to buy it back from Christie's.

Still seeking ways to expand their markets, and with the private-gallery route proving problematic, the auction houses found another solution. Sotheby's inaugurated what it calls a 'dedicated private sale exhibition gallery', S|2, in its York Avenue headquarters in New York in 2011, and it organises six curated exhibitions there a year. Christie's uses its Rockefeller building to hold temporary exhibitions, and both houses have been far more aggressive since 2012 by developing exhibitions across the world. In 2004 Sotheby's started selling sculpture in an annual show in Isleworth, Florida, followed by another in Chatsworth House (the British stately home of board member the Duke of Devonshire). Christie's held a first show – of work by Barry Flanagan – at Lord Rothschild's Waddesdon Manor in 2012. In 2013 Christie's and Sotheby's expanded by opening private selling spaces in London, adding to those they already have in Hong Kong. Some are held in collaboration with dealers, as was the case with a sale of Yayoi Kusama works in Hong Kong in 2012, when the Japanese artist's Tokyo dealer Ota supplied the consignments. Sotheby's 'Beijing Art Week' in December 2013 also featured a number of dealer-sent works including a $50 million Rembrandt (it didn't sell). As far as the results are concerned, the salerooms have taken another leaf out of the dealers' book, in that they do not have to communicate results, nor indeed do they distinguish private sales from selling exhibitions in their annual reports.

### THE BATTLE OF VOLUME V. VALUE

While Sotheby's and Christie's are often confused in the public mind, much to the chagrin of their respective press offices, they have different marketing strategies: Sotheby's has concentrated on a higher-value policy, although it refuses to give the minimum value of a single consignment it will accept. Christie's, unsurprisingly, has a tactic adopted from the luxury-goods industry, that of segmenting its market. So it seems plausible that it is financing its higher end through lower-value sales made either through its lower-value Christie's South Kensington outlet in London or by its growing online business. The firm does not disclose minimum values – it says 'it all depends, in the sale of a collection there may be low-value items' – but a rough calculation from lots sold would put the average price in the region of $60,000 in 2012. One can surmise that the powerful guarantees it was offering in 2013 – many of them not laid out to third parties – could well come from the more profitable lower end of the business. Sotheby's sold 35,300 lots in 2013 making an average lot value of $148,000, a figure which includes wine.

These different strategies were the subject of a vicious activist-shareholder attack on Sotheby's in October 2013, when Daniel Loeb of Third Point Capital – which had increased its holding of Sotheby's stock (stock market symbol BID) to 9.3 per cent – launched a broadside against the company's policies. Loeb pointed to a 'deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's . . . Strategically, we cannot help but ask if ceding the market for lower value lots to your key rival has allowed them to generate profits and relationships with emerging collectors which they are using to compete against you at the top of the market.' Loeb also complained that Sotheby's had insufficiently appreciated the growth of the markets for modern and contemporary art, and was lagging behind Christie's in China, the Middle East, private sales and in its online strategy. And Loeb called for the departure of William F. Ruprecht, Sotheby's chief executive.

Loeb's attack particularly focused on Sotheby's weakening position compared to Christie's – in 2012 the French-owned firm sold $6.3 billion, up 10 per cent over the previous year, whereas Sotheby's sales dropped by 7 per cent, with $5.4 billion. In the all-important contemporary art sector, Christie's was outpacing its rival – it reported $1.6 billion of sales in 2012, up 34 per cent over 2011, while Sotheby's in the same year reported sales of $1.3 billion, up only 8 per cent.

It is not clear if there was a connection, but shortly after the November New York auctions Sotheby's long-time auctioneer and head of its contemporary art department, Tobias Meyer, left the company – although his contract was finishing and he left 'by mutual decision'. Christie's also had a high-profile departure, that of Amy Cappellazzo, chairman of post-war and contemporary art development and responsible for the firm's push into internet sales. Both Meyer and Cappellazzo announced they intended to work privately, with Cappellazzo saying: 'The market has changed considerably, it's now a vast industry, and there are tremendous opportunities.' Cappellazzo soon announced that she was going into partnership with the leading art advisor Allan Schwartzman and forming a company called Art Agency Partners. A third departure in 2013 was Alex Platon from private sales at Sotheby's France, again to set up on his own. These well-connected powerhouses will certainly be bringing more competition to the private-sales departments of the auction houses in the coming years.

The Emergence of the Mega-gallery

'You sell more if you have a bigger space.'

Tobias Meyer, former head of contemporary art at Sotheby's

_16 October 2013_ : As autumn leaves scurried around London's Regent's Park, a bevy of muscular guards stood watch on Gagosian's stand inside the annual Frieze art fair. On the booth were just five pieces – all by Jeff Koons, and all extremely pricey. One was a painting and the other four were sculptures, including the shiny _Sacred Heart (Blue/Magenta)_ , a candy-shaped treat with a bright bow; an upright lobster; a cat hanging in a sock; and the final one, a confection of bright yellow rubber ducks suspended in a tyre. The most expensive piece was the heart, priced at a toothsome $22 million (in an edition of three plus one artist's proof); the lobster was around $7 million, and the ducks were priced at $5 million. The guards were window-dressing, to an extent, as it was unlikely anyone would try to lift them off the stand; they were mainly there, the guards explained to enquirers, to prevent sticky fingers sullying the perfectly polished pieces.

The reason for the muscle-flexing was more a power play between two art dealers – the 'king', Larry Gagosian, who despite his vast empire was just beginning to show some cracks, and the heir apparent to the title, the German-born, New York dealer David Zwirner, whose booth was smack-bang opposite Gagosian's at the fair. Earlier in the year Zwirner had held an exhibition of sculptures from Koons – white plaster figures holding shiny blue gazing balls such as one might see in a garden centre – despite Gagosian representing him. It was not the only chink in the Gagosian armour: earlier in the year, Zwirner had snaffled the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama from Gagosian. And the previous year Gagosian had lost representation of Damien Hirst as well as being involved in some damaging, publicly reported lawsuits.

Gagosian was not taking this lying down, of course: at the same time as the _Gazing Ball_ exhibition, he mounted his own, much bigger show of Koons' work, including three shiny balloon animals up to 12-foot tall, 'Lined up,' as critic Jerry Saltz noted: 'like cabin cruisers at a boat show.' Six months later, Koons became the most expensive living artist at auction – and Gagosian still represents him. The battle lines were drawn: the outcome is still being played out.

The art market has seen two seismic shifts of power and money in this century: firstly, the rise of the auction houses, as we saw in Chapter 1, and their increasing encroachment on the dealers' territory. The second is the polarisation of the dealer world, with the emergence of a few 'mega-galleries', with multiple spaces in different countries, staff counts of 100 or more, tens of dozens of artists on their rosters and attendance at a dozen or more fairs a year. They have the means to hire renowned curators, produce museum-quality non-selling exhibitions accompanied by swanky catalogues – and ensure that their artists get the best possible endorsements, both in the for-profit and the not-for-profit fields.

At the same time, and in contrast to the monolithic auction market, dominated by the Sotheby's/Christie's duopoly, the rest of the dealer world is highly fragmented. It remains highly individualistic, with relationships still very personal in nature. Art economist Dr Clare McAndrew reckons there are roughly 295,000 art dealers in the world, a figure that does not, however, reflect the reality that only 10 per cent account for 60 per cent of the market. McAndrew says that just a handful (1 per cent) make sales of over $70 million every year. The bulk of dealers (90 per cent) are small businesses with under $1.4 million in annual turnover.

While her research covers all dealers, from those handling antiquities to galleries representing young emerging artists, contemporary art is the field of _all_ the major art galleries today, and is a direct reflection of the boom in the market for post-war and contemporary art. This in turn reflects two things: firstly, with the growth of the overall market for art, only contemporary artists can feed demand with a continuous supply; and secondly, a profound shift in the profile of wealth, taste and art collecting, which we shall look at in Chapter 4.

Things were not always thus. Contemporary art used to be a minor part of the art market, with the major money going into Old Masters and modern art. Dealers did not have the status they have today: Gilbert Edelson, one of the founders of the Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA), recounts that in the early 1960s museums required dealers to use the side entrance when visiting: 'They were considered a bit shady,' he says.

'The real taste-makers early on were the museum committees, perhaps even more so than the dealers,' says Adam Sheffer, director at the New York gallery Cheim & Read.

The shift from museums being the taste arbiters to dealers setting the agenda happened gradually, and was mirrored by the shift from the dealers' role of buying and reselling to representing contemporary artists. That has continued to develop, ultimately leading to an identification of the artist with a gallery that has become today's 'branding'.

One significant element that changed the contemporary art world, and which set the stage for what would happen in the twenty-first century, was 1980s prosperity and Wall Street. This boom period of 'greed is good', the catchphrase from the 1987 film _Wall Street_ , washed into the art market as into other sectors. This was a period of outrageous speculation, art funds and highly leveraged buying by the Japanese, particularly between 1987 and 1990. While the focus was still mainly on Impressionist painters such as Van Gogh and Renoir, the heightened interest in art and the huge prices it was achieving also impacted on the contemporary market. Artists such as Julian Schnabel (whose work is recognisable in some of the shots from the film) became feted celebrities – 'arrogant rock stars', says Olav Velthuis, author of _Talking Prices_. 'It was a moment where power in the boardroom was associated with the finer things in life, along with buying real estate and art – they were part of the trappings of wealth,' says Sheffer.

The long art-market slump that followed the 1990 property crash – a time when according to dealers sales came to a complete stop – was also the period that saw the beginnings of what have become today's mega-dealers. In the later days of the 'superstar artist' phenomenon, Larry Gagosian was building his empire, having earned his nickname of 'Go-Go' because of his aggressive pursuing of art on the resale market in the 1980s.

He was the trailblazer for this new breed of dealer, the others being Hauser & Wirth, Zwirner, White Cube and Pace. All operate on the primary market, representing living artists, handling secondary-market works, and most look after artists' estates, which can be highly lucrative. Only one, White Cube, does not – yet – handle any estates; its then exhibitions director, Tim Marlow, said: 'Actually it's probably because the artists we work with are all alive and they're all the same age as I am or Jay [Jopling, owner of the gallery] is . . . we can't really go to them and say when you die can we have your estate.'

These mega-dealers have multiple locations around the world, from Beijing and Hong Kong to São Paulo, Beverly Hills and a cluster of European locations such as Athens, Paris, Zurich and Rome. These 'big box' galleries almost completely control the artists at the top end of the contemporary art market, and maintain their markets, if necessary, when works appear at auction. Their global spread has also had the effect of concentrating the market on a few well-known artists. 'You buy the same art whether you are in Russia or China,' says Thomas Seydoux: 'There is a conformity of the global market, of taste and buyers, and it's due to the internet, and also partly due to decorators; they all do the same work for clients.' This homogenisation has the effect, of course, of driving the prices for a few top artists higher and higher – at least, while the boom in contemporary art lasts.

As well as spreading globally, the big dealers have also spread physically by opening immense new galleries – sometimes on an astonishing scale. In New York in 2013, Hauser & Wirth opened a 24,700 square foot gallery on 18th Street in a former discotheque and roller rink. Its entrance is like a temple – up four broad flights of steps alongside walls adorned with Martin Creed candy-coloured stripes. At the top, almost hidden by a vast desk, are the receptionists, while above them flash blown-up images of all the gallery artists. The cavernous space was inaugurated with a sprawling exhibition by Dieter Roth, complete with a jumbled artist's studio with one of the artist's sons actually working away at a table at the back. In 2014, Hauser will increase its empire with Durslade Farm in Somerset, set in 100 acres of farmland around a group of listed buildings – a farmhouse, stables, cow sheds, piggery, threshing barn and other outbuildings.

Back in New York, two blocks away from Hauser's roller rink, another gigantic art space rose in 2013 from a destroyed three-floor parking garage. David Zwirner called in his favoured architect, Annabelle Selldorf, to create a museum-like locale. Rising to five storeys with a roof garden above, the gallery boasts a series of dazzling, almost featureless white spaces of minimalist elegance, and suitably kicked off with a Dan Flavin show. It is Zwirner's third such gallery in the district, giving him a total of 70,000 square feet of exhibition space.

Beating them all is, of course, Larry Gagosian. Just being taken on by Gagosian – who waits until another dealer has nurtured a budding talent, and then pounces – can boost an artist's earnings by at least 20 per cent immediately and, longer-term, can confer superstar status, turning the artist into a 'brand'. Gagosian, as noted in the Prologue, runs 13 galleries, spread through three continents, handling 77 artists or estates.

Nothing pre-destined Gagosian for this: he does not come from an art background; he built up his empire through a sharp eye, acute business sense and a ferocious determination to succeed. 'He is completely insecure because of his family background; you need to understand that. That's what lies behind his driving ambition,' says one art dealer. A number of years ago at a panel in Dubai, Gagosian recounted two anecdotes, one concerning his wardrobe as an adolescent, and one concerning an early collection of coins as a young man. In both cases he proudly showed off his possessions – only for the person to whom he was showing them to reveal that _he_ had something much better. So he quietly wrapped up his things, he said, and put them away.

The story of Gagosian's climb to his present position (he is worth $300 million, according to various sources, and _Forbes_ published his firm's turnover at $925 million in 2012) has been often recounted. As mentioned, his career was launched in the early 1970s when he started selling posters while working as a car park attendant. By 1979 he had opened a gallery in New York and already had reeled in clients such as Eli Broad, the housing billionaire and collecting kingpin of Los Angeles, and producer Douglas Cramer, selling them works on the secondary market.

But the key moment was the meeting with art dealer Leo Castelli in 1980. 'He absolutely engaged Leo and Leo was absolutely fascinated by Larry . . . he loved being around him, he loved his energy, he loved his dynamism and they went into business together at 65 Thompson,' says Sheffer. In her biography of Castelli, Annie Cohen-Solal gives an example of Gagosian's _chutzpah_ : walking together, Castelli had shaken hands with a modestly dressed man. Gagosian continues the story: 'We walked on, and I asked him, "Who was that man?" "There's no one like him," he replied, "He's one of today's greatest collectors!" So I asked him, "Why don't you introduce me?" and we went back, and he said: "This is Larry Gagosian, this is Si Newhouse." I asked Si for his telephone number and wrote it on my pack of cigarettes, and the following day, I called him.'

In 1988, Gagosian spent a sensational $17 million buying Jasper Johns' _False Start_ at Sotheby's sale of the Ganz collection – for Si Newhouse, who in the meantime had become his client.

Gagosian is a controversial figure: he has been involved in a number of high-profile lawsuits, which may not have put him or his business practices in the most flattering light. He is currently engaged in a court battle with the billionaire collector Ron Perelman over the purchase of a Jeff Koons sculpture (see Chapter 8), and he is not a member of the invitation-only Art Dealers Association of America.

London dealer James Roundell defends him, however:

Gagosian has really raised and kept the profile of the art gallery at the top; without him the market would be much weaker. He's a good thing for the commercial market, he lends it glamour and a 'face' and his galleries give depth and variety to the art that is for sale in the contemporary market. The PR departments of the major auction houses would like people to believe that all the market activity is taking place in the auction arena. The publicity Gagosian attracts helps to demonstrate that the market is not one-dimensional, and that there is a lot happening in the dealer sections of the market.

Matthew Carey-Williams, a director of White Cube in London, concurs: 'Larry has his place in the history of this particular profession. What he's done and what he will be noted for is the expansion of the primary or the bringing together, the primary and the secondary as one and really challenging auction houses as the only people that were allowed to sell secondary work.' And even Gagosian's bitterest critics acknowledge that he puts on acclaimed, museum-quality shows – such as late Monet in 2010, Lucio Fontana in 2012 and a number of knockout Picasso exhibitions.

Where Gagosian's brilliance lies is not in nurturing artists – he usually lets other galleries do that – but in turning them into 'brands' just as his gallery is also a 'brand'. He sells to many of the world's biggest collectors, including the billionaire hedge-fund manager Steve Cohen of SAC Capital, record executive David Geffen and publisher Peter Brant, to name but a few. With an impressive roster of clients and a rich list of big-grossing artists, plus connections to art historian Diana Widmaier Picasso and lucrative estates such as that of Robert Rauschenberg, Gagosian has dominated the market since the 1990s. In 2013 his empire ran to 153,000 square feet (14,200 square metres), more, noted _The Art Newspaper_ , than the entire exhibition space of Tate Modern, including the oil tanks. And what he has understood, as the party described in the Prologue demonstrates, is that you have to spend money to make money. A Gagosian party – its ultra-thick invitation card sometimes delivered by special courier – is the place to be seen, in the best location, with the best people.

### GETTING BIGGER . . . AND BIGGER

While Gagosian's real-estate empire beats that of his fellow 'mega-dealers', Zwirner, Hauser & Wirth, Pace and White Cube are expanding physically, as outlined earlier in this chapter. These rival galleries are also run by larger-than-life figures: David Zwirner, in contrast to Gagosian, comes from an art background: his father was the well-known German dealer Rudolf Zwirner. Ivan Wirth, from Switzerland, is married to Manuela, daughter of the department-store magnate and art collector, Ursula Hauser. Pace is in the hands of father-and-son Arne and Marc Glimcher, Arne having started the gallery in 1960 in Boston. White Cube belongs to the well-connected Jay Jopling, son of a British cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher.

The sheer size of these galleries is a major characteristic of the art trade in the twenty-first century. Asked why the physical space of a gallery is so important, Sotheby's former auctioneer Tobias Meyer once told me: 'You sell more if you have a bigger space.' Artists in the twenty-first century want galleries on the scale of their ambitions, and the vast white cubes deliberately evoke museums, conferring a sort of cultural imprimatur in the visitor's mind. Tim Marlow, speaking when he was the director of exhibitions at White Cube, was, however, more nuanced: 'Our model is not to make bigger and bigger spaces, but you have got to be flexible, you've got to give artists something that is ambitious enough, that doesn't feel like a small scale, domestic-market-driven space. That is not going to make a reputation for an artist and it's certainly not going to make an impact in a place like Hong Kong or São Paolo.'

What is certain is that size does matter in the art world, and super-sized pieces sell for more. The current fashion for contemporary art is driven by the demand from private museums and art spaces for high-impact artworks, which are generally on a large scale as well. When the Chinese artist Zeng Fanzhi joined Gagosian, he started making a new series of very large paintings: perhaps the artist's practice, but also chiming neatly with Gagosian's clientele, which likes the big. Art Basel, the top art fair in the world, even devotes a mega-hall, Art Unlimited, to these sometimes ridiculously outsized works.

As an example, the largest sculpture in the world is planned for Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – Christo's _The Mastaba_ , a 150-metre-high, flat-topped pyramid made from 410,000 multicoloured oil barrels and installed in the desert 150 miles from Abu Dhabi city. Its cost would also be gigantic: $340 million, which would make it the world's most expensive sculpture as well.

Responding to the trend, in 2013 a new fashion started sweeping through the art world – inflatable pieces, which cleverly solved the problem of making huge works by making transportable ones. At the Frieze New York art fair, Paul McCarthy's gallery, Hauser & Wirth, installed his 80-foot-high _Balloon Dog_ right outside the tent – and sold it for just under $1 million. Other examples were at the 2013 Venice Biennale, with Mark Quinn's _Alison Lapper Pregnant_ , a blow-up version of his Fourth Plinth sculpture in London's Trafalgar Square in 2005, and _Inflation!_ , a whole exhibition of such pieces on the site of the coming M+ museum in Hong Kong in 2013.

### DEALING ON A HUGE SCALE: THE NAHMADS AND THE MUGRABIS

To the five mega-galleries we have mentioned have to be added two families who function as dealers and traders in the market: the Nahmads and the Mugrabis. Both are, in the words of New York journalist Andrew Decker, 'the mega-dealers nobody knows'. The Nahmad family consists of brothers David and Ezra and their children; the patriarch, Giuseppe, known as Joe, died in 2012. It was he, according to his obituary in the _Financial Times_ , who 'Essentially . . . regarded the buying and selling of art as a futures market.' Two nephews run galleries, one in New York, one in London (see Chapter 8). David's son Helly runs a space in the upscale Carlyle Hotel on Madison Avenue; Ezra's son, also called Helly, runs the gallery in Cork Street, London. Both Hellys have younger brothers named Joe, also in the art business.

The Nahmads are familiar figures in the saleroom, where the extended family, including assorted wives and girlfriends, camp in the front row under the auctioneer's nose and, unlike any other bidder in the saleroom, dispense with a bidding paddle altogether, so well-known are they. Heavily invested in the Impressionist and modern art market, the Nahmads have been reported to have inventory worth some $4 billion, including 300 Picassos worth $900 million, all held in a Geneva warehouse; David Nahmad was reported by _Forbes_ to be worth $1.75 billion in 2013.

They have a symbiotic relationship with the auction houses, through whom they sell extensively. 'They are always one step ahead,' says one dealer: 'They always owe more than they are owed, by also putting works of art on consignment.' It is impossible to confirm the financial arrangements between the firm and the auction houses, but dealers claim that the Nahmads and other major trade buyers benefit from long payment terms and highly advantageous commission rates.

While the Nahmads focus on the Impressionist and modern market, the Mugrabis, a family of private trader/dealers of Israeli origin (father Jose, sons Alberto and David), dominate the market for Warhol and Basquiat, and buy heavily into more contemporary material such as Koons, Hirst, Christopher Wool and Richard Prince. Their holdings run to over 3,000 works, with 800 Warhols alone (see Chapter 8).

While attention is often concentrated on the top five galleries, there are 100 or so major dealers close behind, with most focusing on the primary market, although some concentrate on the secondary market. An instant snapshot of virtually all the major dealers in the world in modern and contemporary art can be found by looking at the exhibitor lists for the major art fairs, which also include up-and-coming galleries in the younger sections.

All these dealers operate at the top end of the market, but below them there is a vast hinterland of smaller but still significant gallerists. It is practical to separate them into three levels – the top end; then the middle tier, which might have up to a dozen employees; and then the 'mom and pop' stores, which are small operations with just two or three employees.

In the contemporary market these small galleries are very important, as the 'hunter-gatherers' of new talent; the gallerist might have been at art school themselves, before setting up in business. If successful, as they mature, so do their artists and indeed collectors, who – and this is obviously a generalisation – often are of the same generation.

The personality of the dealer is crucial to the art trade. As a result, there are few dynasties in the dealer world: galleries often wither or lose their significance after the disappearance of their founder, and only rarely have children been able to carry on the flame. The great names of the past – Kahnweiler, Vollard, Duveen, Agnew's, Lefevre, Arthur Tooth, Galerie Charpentier – are no more; legal problems have beset Wildenstein and Knoedler, with the latter closing in 2011 (see Chapter 8). The problem, then, is how to ensure the survival of the business: 'This is the holy grail for all of us,' said Marlow, at the time director of exhibitions at White Cube, 'That you transcend your generation, working with the artists you grew up with, and also finding younger, emerging artists. And a lot of major dealers have also looked to a generation of older artists. That way you reinforce your programme from both ends.'

But while the biggest galleries, with their huge financial clout, and the smallest galleries, with their light structures and low overheads, are best placed to survive in today's market, this is not the case for the mid-sized galleries. They are classically the 'squeezed middle', whose costs are not as compressible as in the smallest structures, and who need to maintain a presence at art fairs in order to retain their endorsement and, indeed, their artists. Their problem is classically the migration of artists – or poaching – towards the bigger, better established galleries. For the artists, this is a career choice – the larger galleries can give them greater exposure, particularly international, underwrite higher production costs and boost their prices. For the gallery, it can be lived as a betrayal. Marianne Boesky, for example, was devastated by the departure of Takashi Murakami to Gagosian in 2006 after she had promoted him for seven years. In France, Kamel Mennour, who first showed today's stars Adel Abdessemed and Kader Attia, saw both depart. 'It was hard, I was depressed for six months after Adel left,' Mennour said at a panel in Barcelona in 2013. Abdessemed is now with David Zwirner.

The question to ask is whether the fact of being taken on by Gagosian or one of the other top gallerists is self-fulfilling and makes the artist a success, or whether the gallerist just recognises and develops existing talent and star potential. By being able to turn an artist into a 'brand', by exhibiting them around the world; by being able to fund shows in national museums, and by placing work in leading collections, the galleries can create a star. We are too close to them, for the moment, to know who will be the durable survivors in the art world, but a cautionary anecdote comes from _The Art Dealers_ , a series of interviews conducted in the 1980s by Laura de Coppet. In her interviews half of the artists cited by the dealers are indeed now established as major names – Lichtenstein, Rauschenberg, Johns, Warhol, Judd. But many others are lesser known today: Judy Pfaff, Ned Smyth or Richard Bosman, for example. And yet Leo Castelli, Ileana Sonnabend and Annina Nosei – all renowned for their discrimination and perception, cite Julian Schnabel as the most promising artist of their time, one sure to succeed and endure. While Schnabel is still around, no one today would consider him as significant as the major names cited above. The list of nominees for Britain's Turner Prize over the years reveals, along with well-known names today, others that rapidly dropped from public view.

### HOW DEALERS CONTROL SUPPLY

The problem with the contemporary art market, from the dealers' point of view, is that supply is more or less infinite, as long as the artist is alive and producing. In all other sections of the market, the inventory is restricted and indeed shrinking, as works go into private foundations, collections and museums, in many cases never to re-emerge. (Many European national museums are barred by law from deaccessioning, or selling their holdings; US museums are less strict and do sell works donated or purchased in the past, sometime to great outcry.)

For historic art, rules of supply and demand operate, and are seen at their greatest extreme in the auction room, where a few potential buyers battle it out for a prize work. But contemporary art poses a different problem, as dealers are faced with promoting the reputation of an artist and justifying the price structure.

The role of the gallery is to promote an artist by 'placing' – the euphemism for selective selling – work in the best possible collection, making sure that there is a good geographical spread as well as prestigious destinations. For galleries trying to boost their artists' reputations, this process of endorsement is easiest for a successful artist: the gallery will have a waiting list and chose which buyers to sell to; for those disappointed, the only other way to buy a work is to wait until one comes up at auction, and then slug it out with whoever else wants it.

This explains why there can be a considerable disparity between gallery and auction prices. The market darling in 2011–12 was the hotly sought-after German painter Gerhard Richter, whose market is tightly controlled by his long-term dealer Marian Goodman, with whom he has been since 1985. One of Richter's late abstracts ( _Abstraktes Bild_ [809-4], 1994) sold at Sotheby's London on 12 October 2012 for £21.3 million. Goodman says she has to be increasingly vigilant about whom she sells work to: 'Gerhard and I do the pricing together, and we're certainly not trying to match auction prices,' she told _Art and Auction_ magazine in June 2012: 'One of the things we have to be careful of is speculators, and we are very careful about the prospective owners. This is necessary and we advise it because our prices are so very much lower than auction prices. Gerhard himself has said that the auction prices are crazy.'

So, dealers have created an artificial rationing system to keep control over work and prices, even beyond the first sale. Maintaining the price is important, because setting a price on a work of contemporary art is inevitably quite arbitrary. Unless it comprises expensive materials, such as Terence Koh's gold-plated faeces, sold in glass cases at Art Basel in 2007 for $500,000, or indeed Damien Hirst's $100 million diamond-studded skull, _For the Love of God_ , 2007, the cost of making a painting, for instance, is minimal.

Because dealers ration art in this way, they also need to control the auction process, where they cannot set prices. They have two ways of doing this: firstly, by bidding on their own artists' work to ensure prices don't fall below the gallery level. This 'support' also extends to encouraging their collectors to buy at auction when a work comes up for sale. Where a hot, 'rationed' artist is concerned, the gallery will try to prevent 'flipping' or resale for a higher price by selecting who to sell to, and by making the buyer sign a resale agreement by which they promise to offer a work back to the gallery first. While these agreements are generally thought unenforceable in law, they probably do have some weight, if only moral.

This 'rationing' of art is normally carried out discreetly, but a court case in 2010 lifted the lid on the normally secretive deals. That year a Miami real-estate promoter, Craig Robins, brought an $8 million breach of contract action against the David Zwirner gallery, claiming it had reneged on a promise to sell three Marlene Dumas paintings to him. Court documents revealed that Robins had previously resold a Dumas painting through Zwirner, but had asked the gallerist to keep this confidential. Dumas is opposed to resale of her works and Robins wanted to be able to buy more of her work. However, Zwirner did tell Dumas and as a result she blacklisted Robins from buying any more of her work on the primary market. It turned out that she kept a 'black list' and a 'grey list' of collectors forbidden from buying her art: the people on the 'grey list' were, according to Dumas 'not to be called crooks' but were also not to be sold to 'for the time being'. At the next Dumas show, Zwirner did not offer three paintings to Robins, leading to the lawsuit. The judge found that there was no evidence of a confidentiality agreement to keep the initial resale secret, and the two sides finally settled the case without prejudice on either side.

Until now, we have mainly focused on the upper end of the art market, and this is the part that has produced the most heat in the twenty-first century. But with the emergence of the 'mega-galleries' and an increasingly polarised world as far as wealth is concerned – the two phenomena are intertwined – there is increasing pressure on the 'squeezed middle market': in a panel at the Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA) in London, February 2013, ICA director Gregor Muir noted the erosion of buying by upper-middle-class professionals who come from academic, medical or accounting backgrounds. And in an interview for _The Art Newspaper_ , Brian Washburn of New York's Washburn gallery, said: 'People are buying the young, hot artists for speculation or the big established names from a certain period. They aren't focusing on the middle market.'

One sign was the closure, in 2013, of the highly regarded Parisian Galerie Jérôme de Noirmont. De Noirmont spelt out the problem very clearly in a letter sent to all his clients:

The future appears to be in certain specialized niches for simple structure galleries, and in the branding of mega-galleries, just as powerful as they are big with several international locations. It would therefore be necessary to move to the next level to continue to ambitiously serve the artists in this increased competition. That would mean enlarging our premises, recruiting numerous employees including several on a high level, and greatly expanding the list of represented artists [. . .] Such a significant development implies huge investments in terms of finance, time and energy along with major risk taking and responsibility. Personally, not wanting to leave France, such an expansion seems unrealistic to us.

The top galleries are, today, very different from the operations of the twentieth century. While the personality of the dealer remains essential, they are also highly professional enterprises with forceful press officers – and most also hire outside public relations companies. They use state-of-the-art technology for invoicing, inventory management and so on. Monitors can track who is in the gallery, what works of art visitors look at first, which they look at longest. And staff behind the reception desks have mug-shots of leading collectors, artists, even critics, so that if one comes in, they can alert those higher up. A director will shortly amble by – quite by coincidence of course.

Some dealers regret today's emphasis on the money-making side of the business. 'The missing element in the art world which has been atrophying and been pushed aside in recent years is the cultural conversation,' says Michael Short, who has worked as a dealer in New York and London: 'The reason why this or that artist should be worth so much money is because of his or her contribution to the culture, and that's not even part of the discussion anymore.'

ARTISTS

From Starving in Garrets to Founding Their Own Museums

'Then artists became stars, exhibitions became events and Anselm Kiefer came in a helicopter to the opening of his show in the gallery.'

Collector and dealer Paul Maenz

_10 July 2013, New York_ : Three days before, a number of artists, dealers, critics, actors and curators had received an emailed invitation to a super-secret event: a six-hour performance of rapper Jay-Z's song 'Picasso Baby', in Pace Gallery's Chelsea space, to be turned into a video by Mark Romanek. 'Attendance at this performance constitutes your consent to be filmed. Everyone in attendance will be required to sign a release granting the right to use their likeness from the performance for any and all purpose,' warned the invitation.

Despite the secrecy, by the time the likes of artists George Condo, Mickalene Thomas, Rashid Johnston, Andres Serrano and Lawrence Weiner; film director Jim Jarmusch; art historian Diana Widmaier Picasso and prominent critic Jerry Saltz were being ushered into the gallery, some fans had gathered in the street outside in clusters and the police were directing operations. Inside, eight cameras were being set up and guests were being asked if they wanted to perform face-to-face with Jay-Z in the roped-off centre of the space. The reference was clear – Jay-Z was inspired for his video by performance artist Marina Abramović's _The Artist is Present_ , which saw her sitting in MoMA facing visitors for a total of 736 hours (14 March–31 May 2010).

Jay-Z finally entered the room dressed in a simple white shirt with a prominent gold necklace, bracelet and watch; as the waiting crowd whooped and applauded, he stepped lightly on to the platform and started rapping. Improvising some of the time, he sang, 'I just want a Picasso, in my casa' and 'I'm the new Jean-Michel [Basquiat] surrounded by Warhols', punctuating this with the refrain: 'Picasso baby'. Abramović, who arrived like a star in a vast black SUV, was among those who interacted with Jay-Z that summer afternoon, circling him before finally leaning her forehead against his and staring into his eyes.

Jay-Z – whose real name is Shawn Carter – is not only a performer; he is an impresario, savvy investor, art collector (advised by Salon 94 dealer Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn) and very, very wealthy: according to _Forbes_ , he was worth $475 million in 2013.

The Jay-Z event was far from the only intertwining of the worlds of art, music and celebrity. Perhaps the most prominent collaboration that same year was between pop singer Lady Gaga and Jeff Koons, who designed the cover of her third album, _Artpop_ , in 2013. The cover showed a naked sculpture of Gaga, legs splayed around a shiny blue gazing ball. Product placement, deliberate or not, continued in the music, with Koons mentioned more than once in the lyrics. The album was launched in an extravagant 'artRave' event at Brooklyn's Navy Yard where Koons sculptures were exhibited along with a Benjamin Rollins Caldwell installation made up of old computer parts. Previously Gaga had courted some ridicule with a filmed collaboration with Abramović during a three-day retreat when she learnt her 'Method' and was shown naked in various bizarre poses.

The question is, of course, who benefits most from these collaborations? In the highly competitive world of pop music, increasingly outrageous events are the only way to get noticed. And taking pop music into the domain of 'art' lends it an intellectual credibility that takes it beyond mere entertainment, as well as, for the artists, increasing their visibility to a younger demographic.

The artist-as-superstar is not new. In the Renaissance Leonardo da Vinci was so famed that France's Francis I carried him off as a prize trophy to Amboise, where the artist died three years later, supposedly in the king's arms. In the nineteenth century, the paintings, lives and scandalous loves of Britain's Pre-Raphaelites made them famous, and their prices exploded: a William Holman Hunt sold in 1874 for £11,000 (about £1 million in 2012, according to the Bank of England), while in 1876 the lauded French painter Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier sold the detailed Napoleonic battle scene _1807, Friedland_ (1861–75) to an American department store magnate for what was then considered the astronomical sum of $60,000 ($1.6 million in 2013).

But for every success story, there were far more _artistes maudits_ (accursed artists). Among the best-known are Van Gogh, who committed suicide in 1890 in penury, aged just 37, and Amedeo Modigliani who died of tubercular meningitis in 1920 at 35, addled with drink and drugs; neither achieved the successes in their lifetimes that came shortly after their deaths. Many more artists, of course, died poor without achieving recognition either during or after their lifetimes.

The iceberg situation endures today: the visible tip of success hides a vast chunk of failure or at least invisibility. According to Don Thompson, some 45,000 artists in New York and London alone are struggling to make a living; only 75 in New York have superstar status with a seven-figure income. But this figure can be read the other way as well: probably at no moment in history have there been so many, and so many very rich, artists.

Finding out exactly how much they are worth is tough, as the cut they are taking home from their galleries is not public, nor are details of how much the various deals they make with luxury-goods companies, for example, are worth. Or at least, only their business manager knows, because, yes, many artists do have business managers today.

At the top of the pyramid of wealth, although not necessarily of critical approbation, stands Damien Hirst, who the _Sunday Times_ reported as being worth £215 million in 2013. His friend Jeff Koons holds the world record for a sale, at auction, of any work by a living artist, as we saw in Chapter 1. But the $58.4 million did not go to Koons himself, since the work was being resold by the investor/collector and billionaire publisher Peter Brant. However, Koons sells other high-priced works, in editions, on the primary market through his dealers Sonnabend, Gagosian and Zwirner, and at colossal prices (see Chapter 2). At Zwirner's _Gazing Ball_ exhibition in summer 2012, 17 works in editions of three with one artist's proof were priced from $300,000 to $3 million, with an average price of about $1.6 million. All sold.

Also high in the wealth stakes are Takashi Murakami, Brice Marden, Julian Schnabel, Jasper Johns, Anish Kapoor, Zhang Huan, Cai Guo-Qiang and Zeng Fanzhi. To them must be added a swathe of names who have probably made millions from their art, without hitting the same levels as the above: John Baldessari, Ed Ruscha, KAWS, Barry McGee, Fernando Botero, Claes Oldenburg, Banksy, Nan Goldin, Gilbert & George, Tracey Emin, Georg Baselitz, Chuck Close, Andreas Gursky, David Hockney, Cindy Sherman, Gerhard Richter, Antony Gormley and many others – the list is not definitive. Then there are a couple of names who are totally unknown to most people, even in the art world.

These are the richest artists you've never heard of: graffiti artist David Choe painted the Facebook headquarters in 2007 and was rewarded with stock, which now makes him worth about $200 million. The Welshman Andrew Vicari has made an estimated $142 million from supplying portraits and paintings of horses, battle and genre scenes to Middle Easterners, particularly in Saudi Arabia. Finally, Thomas Kinkade, who painted high-kitsch scenes of pastoral cottages and gardens which are sold mainly as reproductions through a chain of franchises in US shopping malls, left some $66 million on his death in 2011.

Inevitably, most of the top end of the art market today links back to Andy Warhol and indeed many of his innovations, applied and amplified by artists of the twenty-first century, are some of the reasons for the current market boom.

Warhol was the trailblazer for so much: the obsession with the media and celebrity, the commoditisation of art and the industrialisation of production, with the artist's 'hand' removed from the process. He even anticipated the link-up with luxury goods, a connection that has massively contributed to growing today's market. 'The Blackglama ads [for mink coats], doing the windows for leading department stores, the portrait series of the 1970s – all these were about luxury goods produced for very rich people,' says author and critic Blake Gopnik, who is working on a Warhol biography. 'He was dissolving the boundaries between high and low art by selling out the art form – and he was doing it deliberately.'

'Other artists going back over the centuries would ingratiate themselves with the powerful figures of the day, such as the church or bankers. There's nothing new here,' says Gregor Muir, director of London's Institute of Contemporary Arts, continuing:

Artists remain competitive in the present, but it's interesting to see how they're guided by our present culture of excessive wealth. In 2004 when Maurizio Cattelan's _La Nona Ora_ [1999], sold for over $3 million, showing the Pope felled by a meteor, it created a shock wave. It was a work well within the canon of cool contemporary art. At the time, it was not considered to be bling or a work by a big name. It set a new precedent and spiked artists' interest. Subsequently, I suspect some, not all, wanted to compete with this new price level for work by a living artist. A few would continue to forge ever closer ties with key international collectors and in some ways they started to embrace their lifestyle, with artists frequenting the best hotels and rubbing shoulders with the money as never before. It might even be argued that some started to produce work that was geared to the taste of the new collecting base. Moreover, these artists were becoming big business in themselves and it felt as though people with branding expertise were a part of the picture, alongside finance experts who could do the figures and exploit their market. During this period, the rapid price hike for contemporary art could not have been achieved by dealers alone.

A characteristic of this century has been the extraordinary ascent of some young artists, whose careers have been totally made by the market – and probably manufactured for the market as well. An example is Jacob Kassay who makes quite plain, silvered 'paintings'. In 2009 two works sold through his dealer Eleven Rivington at the Nada art fair in Miami for $8,000 each. Within a year his work was such hot property that a piece was auctioned at Phillips de Pury for $86,500 – ten times its low estimate; on 11 November 2013 a new record of $317,000 was set at Phillips New York. Matthew Day Jackson, Wade Guyton, Oscar Murillo and Nate Lowman are other examples of young artists – some in their 20s – who have achieved extraordinary market success virtually without any museum approbation. Michael Short says:

It's fascinating that a gallery or auction house can presume to ask so much money for, or say a work of art is at such and such a value, when the artwork hasn't proven itself through exhibitions in galleries or museums or hasn't been evaluated by the critics or curators; the work's value can be created by, and reside in, the expectations of the market.

It is not possible, within the scope of this book, to cover the whole spectrum of artistic creation and artists in this century. What follows are some aspects of artistic practice that are relevant to the market today, by responding to its needs or by contributing to its growth. The majority of artists would not recognise the scenarios described; they make respectable livings without ever hitting the headlines or achieving record-breaking prices.

### CELEBRITY

Throughout the centuries, some artists were famed in their time: Leonardo and Michelangelo in the Renaissance, Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723–92) or Jean-Hippolyte Flandrin (1809–64). But the mass media of the twenty-first century has created and broadcast the cult of celebrity as never before. The trailblazer, as always, was Andy Warhol. He was obsessed by celebrity and many of his most recognisable works feature the stars of his time: Elizabeth Taylor, Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe; in the 1960s he also became a celebrity as well as creating others such as Baby Jane Holzer. And he founded his own star magazine, _Interview_ , so taking care of his own public relations.

Today's artists have jumped on the same bandwagon, understanding that their personality is also part of their art and a key element in promoting it. In 2004 the artist Sam Taylor-Wood – at that time married to dealer Jay Jopling, founder of White Cube – filmed footballer David Beckham sleeping in a Madrid hotel, commissioned by London's National Portrait Gallery ( _David_ , 1 hour 7 minutes, 2004). The nod to Warhol's _Sleep_ , a 320-minute film from 1963, is evident. Its subject, John Giorno, was a close friend of Warhol's, but unknown to the public. Taylor-Wood took someone already famous, and in doing so boosted her own celebrity. Taken up by the media, artists such as Taylor-Wood, Rachel Feinstein or Cecily Brown have been featured more as personalities than for their work, and even a challenging character such as Tracey Emin has fuelled the media's desire for sensation. Her drunken appearance on a television show in 1997 – after attending a Turner Prize dinner – and her controversial artworks, including _My Bed_ , 1999, a bed littered with detritus, have ensured her staying power, at least in the British media.

Until 1980s New York, many contemporary artists did not necessarily seek commercial success. Blinky Palermo was roundly criticised in the 1970s for making textile paintings, which friends accused him of producing purely for the market. Talking in 2013 at his exhibition at David Zwirner, Richard Serra remembered how different things were in the 1960s. 'If someone came in and said they'd sold out a show, people would say, "too bad",' he said: 'It meant the audience understood what the work was.' This was anathema for Serra and his peers, who included Carl Andre, Chuck Close and Robert Smithson, who were trying to foster a new language. 'If someone came into Max's [Kansas City] with a white suit on and shiny shoes and said they'd sold out the show; obviously, if they're collectors that know what this work is about, it can't be any good,' Serra said.

### COMMODIFICATION

In an age where the notion of art as an alternative asset class has become widely touted and a number of art funds have been formed, some contemporary artists certainly give the impression of creating works that are ideal for commodification. It used to be that collectors prized the fact that an artwork was original and unique; today, the existence of multiples or series of highly comparable works is an advantage, not a disadvantage. This means that one example can go into a museum, another one or two to famous collectors – so enhancing the value of the remaining pieces in the series. And it helps if they are highly recognisable and even the same size, like Richard Prince's _Nurse_ paintings or Rudolf Stingel's silver or gold slabs. Even better if the prices are public, for instance sold and resold at auction, as then the series can be analysed and put into indices just like another commodity. 'Richard Prince, Douglas Gordon – they go to Gagosian and they get caught up in this Walmartisation of the artist in the gallery,' comments one dealer.

Warhol, again, anticipated this by producing silk screened works on a huge scale; he is supposed to have produced over 1,000 portraits in his lifetime, and the sheer number of works he made has certainly boosted his market, particularly as they are so comparable. Many other artists have worked in the same vein this century: in China, for example, Zhang Xiaogang's _Bloodline_ series runs to over 100 works. This is not new, and throughout history artists have worked in series _–_ there are 45 versions of Breughel the Younger's (1564–1637) _The Birdtrap_. But for sheer numbers of works on the same theme the hands down champion is Damien Hirst, with the series of _Spot Paintings_. While he actually made the first 25 in the series, a number of assistants then continued the task. So far he has – or rather they have – made 1,365 spot paintings, and between January and March 2012 these were shown in simultaneous exhibitions around the world in all the Gagosian art galleries. However, the project may have backfired in this case, as sales were rumoured to be weak, potential buyers having been put off by the sheer numbers. Coupled with a downturn in his prices after his 2008 Sotheby's sale, prices for spot paintings slumped, their average price falling from over $1 million in 2007 to under $400,000 two years later; although they perked up a little afterwards, the average price was still under $600,000 in 2012.

Coupled with this commodification of work by some artists is a clear adaptation of themes and materials to the market. While there is nothing new in this, the arrival of buyers from new economies this century has certainly triggered, among some artists, works that seem tailored to their tastes. Damien Hirst's 2011 sale at Sotheby's featured his familiar themes of pickled animals, spots, spins, butterflies – often on gold grounds, some combining the elements with butterflies and artificial diamonds on a spin background. Andreas Gursky's giant photographs have recorded Hong Kong stock exchanges – and are popular among financiers – and almost abstract patterns in the Bahrain desert, a clear pitch for Middle-Eastern buyers. Cai Guo-Qiang's exhibition in Qatar (Mathaf, 5 December 2011–26 May 2012) included galloping Arabian horses and 99 gold-plated ones, desert landscapes, robed Arabs and a suspended camel: not themes he has explored in the rest of his work. At the centre of a map of the world in a giant screen painting by Takashi Murakami at his concurrent show in Doha (Al Riwaq, 9 February–24 June 2012) was . . . little Qatar. And Kiefer's _Let a Thousand Flowers Bloom_ show at White Cube Hong Kong (16 May–25 August 2012) featured Mao figures, about which the Chinese artist Zhang Xiaogang commented: 'Why repaint this topic? Is this done specifically for the Chinese market?'

### INDUSTRIALISATION OF PRODUCTION

Demand for works of art has been greatly ramped up by the proliferation of art fairs and biennales globally, but globalisation has also partly provided a solution by supplying the means to create huge amounts of art – and big works, which are, as we have seen, what the market wants.

China in particular, with its cheap and abundant labour, has proved an excellent resource, and a number of Chinese artists have huge studios: Zhang Huan, for example, employs about 200 assistants in his Shanghai studio. For Ai Weiwei's _Sunflower Seeds_ (Tate Modern, 12 October 2010–2 May 2011), 100 million tiny seed husks were hand-painted by 1,600 workers in the traditional ceramic production town of Jingdezhen over two and a half years. Some Western artists have moved production to China as well, notably the Belgian artist Wim Delvoye, who established an 'art farm' outside Beijing where pigs are tattooed with Louis Vuitton designs, and the African-American artist Kehinde Wiley, who has studios in Beijing and two others in Africa.

However, big studios are not confined to China. In Europe, the German artist Anselm Kiefer produces his jumbo-sized paintings and sculptures – sometimes incorporating airplane parts – at a studio in Croissy-Beaubourg, near the French airport of Le Bourget, site of one of his dealer Gagosian's spaces. But the prize for the biggest studio must go to the American artist Sterling Ruby, who has a compound of buildings on three-quarters of an acre in California, close to Los Angeles, where he produces his sometimes 16-foot high, poured-urethane 'stalagmites' as well as his soft sculptures and densely patterned abstract paintings. Jeff Koons has 1,500 square metres in New York's Chelsea District, where he employs 120 assistants and is proud that he personally never touches the works. 'I articulate the fingertips of the different people I work with,' he told me in Basel in 2012, at the exhibition of his work at the Beyeler Foundation (13 May–12 September 2012).

As well as using armies of assistants, artists have also started turning to multiples to keep up with demand. Photography, video and sculpture come in editions and these can be increased by changing the scale. The 80-foot high inflated scarlet _Balloon Dog_ , 2013, by the California artist Paul McCarthy, sold, according to his gallery Hauser & Wirth, for $950,000 at the end of Frieze New York. Inside the fair, another 'edition' – each a different colour – of 40 smaller inflated _Balloon Dogs_ , priced at $25,000, was on offer on Hauser's stand: all sold, again according to the gallery, at the VIP opening.

### LUXURY AND FASHION, GOOD BEDFELLOWS . . .

Art has almost always been a luxury product: unique, expensive pieces that enable the owners to proclaim their wealth and taste. Pictures of exotic fruit and costly flowers were the 'must-have' for the wealthy merchants in the Dutch Golden Age; the palazzos of the Medici in Renaissance Italy, or the great baroque palaces of Catherine the Great in Russia, filled with paintings, sculpture and precious objects, also proclaimed the owners' status and power.

What distinguishes art from a handbag, sunglasses or watch is that it also has 'symbolic value' above its 'market value' and this is what gives it its special status. Art has the ambition of transcending its creator and time; and luxury goods use art as a way of projecting themselves on to that higher, 'symbolic' level: 'Art is at the centre of the Cartier name,' Cartier North America's CEO Frédéric de Narp, said at the opening of a LVMH-sponsored exhibition by Richard Serra at New York's Museum of Modern Art in 2007: 'Everything we produce is a piece of art. It's in the DNA of the brands.' Without sponsorship from luxury-goods companies, many other major exhibitions would not have been possible, and the tie-up with museums, as in the case above, is designed to enhance the brand – again, by conferring 'symbolic value' on it.

This overlap with luxury is one of the major thrusts of the art market in the twenty-first century, with artists, dealers and auction houses deliberately copying the production and marketing techniques of luxury goods, so blurring the distinctions, while the luxury-goods firms attempt to elevate their products to the level of art.

The luxury-goods companies have actively sought, and obtained, manifold tie-ups with artists, the best-known example being Takashi Murakami designing handbags for LVMH, but there are many others. At Miami Beach in December 2013, for instance, Christian Dior offered wallets, handbags, jewellery, sunglasses, scarves, footwear and even charms designed by the German artist Anselm Reyle, in a pop-up store in the Design District's Moore Building. Damien Hirst has designed scarves for Alexander McQueen – again part of the LVMH stable – at prices up to $1,500.

In doing this, artists and their galleries are following basic marketing principles, by what is called in the commercial world 'brand stretching'. This means segregating the market into levels. At the top end is the artist's prime production of top-level and often unique works; lower down are limited editions, smaller works, works on paper and so on; at the bottom end are posters, postcards and editions of all sorts. Japanese artist Yoshitomo Nara, for instance, has produced _Too Young to Die_ ashtrays that retail for just tens of dollars. Hirst has been very savvy in mining this vein, producing prints of his best-known pieces for his shop _Other Criteria_ , with a print of his diamond-encrusted skull offered for £7,000 (edition of 250) but a plate printed with butterflies on sale at just £25.50.

Indeed, the rules of marketing luxury goods, and that of art, are astonishingly similar. In _The Luxury Strategy_ , authors J.N. Kapferer and V. Bastien set out management principles that include 'making it difficult for clients to buy' (think of the waiting list for some of the hottest artists); 'raise your prices to increase demand – and keep raising prices' (as we see in Chapter 8 prices in galleries never go down, to maintain confidence) and 'keep non-enthusiasts out' (galleries will select who to sell to). And the list also includes 'cultivate closeness to the arts for initiates', which recommends that workers in the industry should visit 'galleries, biennales and exhibitions of modern art'.

Another reason for this luxury/art link up is the arrival in the market of buyers from new economies, whose awareness of art tends to be motivated by brand name recognition. A typical example was when LVMH plastered its shops worldwide with garish designs by the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama. Sales of her work took off, according to her London dealer Glen Scott Wright of Victoria Miro, as never before. 'The collaboration with LVMH exposed Kusama to places she would never have reached otherwise,' he said, speaking at the 2013 Art Dubai fair, where he successfully sold a number of her works. 'Every glossy magazine did colour spreads – with her 2011–2012 retropsective in Madrid, Paris, London and New York she got critical renown but with LVMH she became a household name.'

The tactic of luxury-goods brands is to link up with museums and so gain cultural endorsement. There are manifold examples of this, from the much-criticised Armani-funded shows at the Guggenheim and Royal Academy in 1999 to, for instance, the Esprit Dior exhibition at Shanghai's private Museum of Contemporary Art (13 September–20 November 2013). This expensively produced, slick advertisement for the brand included dresses, sketches, jewels and perfume bottles, as well as a functioning Dior atelier actually making clothes.

### GOING IT ALONE

One result of today's 'celebrity culture' has been the increasing willingness, or even alacrity, of successful artists to change their galleries to promote their own careers, or increasingly even to run their careers themselves using an agent.

As already touched upon, examples are legion of artists leaving the dealers who very often believed in them and promoted them, only to see them depart when they achieved success. In 2003 John Currin left Andrea Rosen for Gagosian; in the next few years Chris Ofili and Lisa Yuskavage moved to Zwirner while Paul McCarthy severed his 14-year relationship with Luhring Augustine to go to Hauser & Wirth. 'The artists don't want to stay in the mid-tier galleries – they want to go with the big ones, and today they can call the tune if they have a certain kind of career,' says one dealer. The bigger galleries are better able to promote artists more widely, able to finance the scale of their ambitions and give them international shows. Speaking to the _New York Times_ in 2006, Ed Ruscha said: 'The art world as it is now is a much more accelerated industry. It's a much bigger and, in many ways, much nastier world.'

As well as moving galleries, successful artists are shattering the traditional exclusive relationship between themselves and their dealers, and globalisation has accelerated this. As we saw in the Prologue, Anselm Kiefer made new works for Gagosian, Ropac and White Cube in Hong Kong in 2012; in same year the New York gallerist Michael Werner opened his new London space with a show of paintings by Peter Doig – right under the nose of his supposedly 'exclusive' British dealer Victoria Miro. And because few artists have written contracts with their galleries, leaving them is easy; even if there is a contract, few galleries would want to compromise their reputations by going to court.

Some artists have achieved such financial success and fame that they are starting their own museums, notably in China: the gunpowder artist Cai Guo-Qiang is building one in his hometown of Quanzhou, while Zeng Fanzhi has hired the Japanese architect Tadao Ando to design his Yuan Museum in Beijing, due to open in 2015. In Tokyo Takashi Murakami has set up his own space while, in London, Damien Hirst is developing a building to show his collection of about 2,000 artworks, from Richard Hamilton and Francis Bacon to Sarah Lucas, Jeff Koons and Banksy.

## Chapter 4  
THE NEW TASTE-MAKERS

* * *

Collectors, Curators and Advisors

'When I started out, 30 years ago, millionaires had boats and jets – but didn't necessarily have any art at all. That has changed, for the very wealthy today, it's not fine not to be interested in art.'

Thomas Seydoux of dealing partnership Connery, Pissarro, Seydoux

### THE COLLECTORS

_12 November 2013_ : 'Eu-genio! Eu-genio!' The flashes were popping as photographers scurried to get the best angles, while behind them technicians were jockeying for position with their pole-mounted floodlights. Wave after wave of glamorous women, in precipitously high heels and short tight skirts, clamoured to have their picture taken with the suntanned Mexican with the whiter-than-white teeth who cheerfully complied, while his public relations staff desperately circled around trying to control the flow of admirers.

The evening before, hundreds of guests had converged on a grand hacienda surrounded with lush tropical gardens and studded with marble statues for an opening soirée that brought together the cream of the art world and a few film celebrities such as Eva Longoria and Will Ferrell. Again, Eugenio's appearance was accompanied by garish bursts of flashes as photographers pursued him among the stone pillars and plushy sofas that that been laid out for guests inside the house. The next evening, the same crowd – swelled by hundreds more – revelled at an 'after party' in a vast sports stadium where golden staircases were illuminated by blue pencil lights, where the musicians' faces were painted white and black in Batman 'Joker' style, and where legendary DJ Mark Ronson kept the music going until after 5 am.

The scene was not taking place at the Cannes film festival, but in Mexico City, at the inauguration of Museo Jumex, the latest private museum created by one of the most prominent art collectors in Latin America, Eugenio López Alonso. López, the only heir to the Jumex fruit-juice fortune, has been amassing contemporary art since the 1990s and his now 2,700-strong holdings are reported to be worth some $80 million. In 2001 he opened his first art space within the ochre walls of the family company's industrial complex in Ecatepec, in the gritty suburbs of Mexico City. In 2013 his long-planned museum in the city centre, designed by the British architect Sir David Chipperfield, opened its doors. Its honey-coloured exterior clad in travertine marble, light and airy interiors and elegant design were an immediate hit with the art-world luminaries gathered for the occasion.

Just a few steps away from Jumex stands another billionaire's private museum, the Soumaya, created by Carlos Slim Helú, the richest man in the world in 2013 according to _Forbes_. Inaugurated two years earlier in a much-criticised building designed by his son-in-law, the museum contains a jumble of works from Helú's 66,000-strong holdings, ranging from Old Masters and landscapes and portraits from Mexico's colonial era, via coins, photographs, Impressionist and modern painting, right up to a closely packed array of Rodin and Dalí sculptures on the top floor, the only level with natural lighting.

The two institutions, while so close physically, stand at the opposite ends of the spectrum of what have often been dubbed 'vanity museums' and the vogue for these private art spaces is one of the most significant factors in boosting the art market over the last generation. The number of such spaces, which range from splashy new architect-designed buildings such as the coming Frank Gehry-designed LVMH museum in Paris to the Berlin Sammlung Boros, housed in a completely refurbished concrete bunker, is rising constantly. According to _Xinhuanet_ , China alone had nearly 535 private museums and 3,589 museums overall in 2012, and the _BMW Art Guide by Independent Collectors_ in 2013 listed more than 217 spaces for contemporary art worldwide.

### THE BILLIONAIRE'S MUST-HAVE – A PRIVATE MUSEUM

A private museum has become the 'must-have' for many of the world's ultra-wealthy – 'ego-seums' as the _Guardian_ has dubbed them. It gives them entrance to a private, rarefied club with their peers and access, as we have seen, to a glamorous and select lifestyle – and gives them bragging rights over everyone else. And it has upended the former ways of judging value – what Lucien Karpik called the 'expert-opinion regime' of critics and curators – and replaced it with the 'dealer-collector' system. Today's mega-collectors have become the taste-makers of our time, along with the new breed of independent super-curators and art advisors. Added to this, the art market itself, with its constantly highly publicised prices and the hoop-la around its year-long calendar of events, also imposes a vision of what is significant in artistic practice today.

Private collectors are setting the agenda for which artists are the most significant by stimulating other collectors to emulate them and compete for works, which drives up prices; their purchases no doubt have an impact on the critical appraisal of artists' reputations. The examples are legion: one wonders where Rudolf Stingel would be without François Pinault's support. Eugenio López has actively promoted Mexican artists such as Damián Ortega and Gabriel Orozco, and has certainly contributed to their growing international profile; a piece by Ortega, _Cosmogonía doméstica_ , 2013, stands on the place outside the Museo Jumex.

The Florida-based Rubell family, with their own museum, helped the hot young Colombian star Oscar Murillo on his way by giving him a five-week residency in their foundation in 2012. He made 50 paintings in that period, all bought by the Rubells. Murillo's work subsequently soared at auction, hitting a high of $401,000 at a Phillips New York sale on 19 September 2013.

The shrinking finances of public institutions, coupled with the growing firepower of the mega-wealthy, has only accelerated the shift, particularly now that the acquisition budgets of some private collectors are vastly bigger than those of major public museums. The Ukrainian pipe king Victor Pinchuk, for example, is thought to have spent some $180 million at the London White Cube gallery in one year alone. As a contrast, London's Tate spent just £3.9 million on acquisitions in 2011.

The range of private collectors is as diverse as their museums. Some are long-term, committed collectors such as Dallas' Howard Rachofsky and Vernon Faulconer, who opened The Warehouse in 2013 to show their collections, with a strong curatorial and educational component. Rachofsky, along with two other local collectors, has promised his entire collection to the Dallas Museum of Art – a gift of over 800 works. His advisor, Allan Schwartzman, explains: 'Rachofsky evolved side-by-side with the other collectors and they saw the opportunity to do something significant for public benefit. Public institutions just don't have the money to sustain their ambitions today.'

Some collectors have been accused of being 'specullectors' – a fusion of collector and dealer – and this certainly applies to Charles Saatchi. His Boundary Road gallery in the late 1980s was ground-breaking and a spring-board for the generation of Young British Artists. But since 2000 Saatchi could be defined as an investor using his successive galleries to 'pump and dump', giving prominence to artists destined to be resold quickly afterwards.

In some countries, private art spaces fulfil the role that the state cannot, or does not want to, take on. This is the case in Indonesia with Dr Oei Hong Djien, whose three museums show traditional Indonesian painting and contemporary art. In India collectors Kiran Nadar and the mother-and-son duo Lekha and Anupam Poddar have established exhibition spaces within their family company buildings. In China, cultural 'soft power' is actively promoted by the leadership. 'Outsourcing museum building to private collectors is one part of a larger government strategy,' says someone who knows the Chinese museum scene well: 'It enables exhibitions to be more risky, without the government being clearly involved, as well as allowing management structures to be less bureaucratic.'

Another motivation, particularly in China, is real estate, and developers use the museums as enticements for their residential or commercial projects. 'A lot of museums "hang out a pig head but sell dog meat",' says Shen Qibin, the former director of the Zendai Museum of Modern Art and the director of the Zendai Himalayas Art Centre, funded by property magnate Dai Zhikang: 'They are museums in name only, and sell works like galleries.'

### COLLECTORS: A CHANGING PROFILE

With the rapid growth of the ultra-rich around the world, the changing profile of art collecting has had a major impact on the market and partly explains the vogue for contemporary art. With wealth this century passing from largely inherited to largely self-made, art buyers do not all have the same cultural references that previous generations had. Most collectors think about the investment angle – after all, they are often spending a goodly sum of money – so this aspect has also had a major impact on the market this century.

Thanks to the rapidly made fortunes, both in some Western industries such as finance, the internet and resources and in emerging economies, new faces are coming in all the time, and sometimes directly at the multimillion dollar level. 'Previously a collector would start modestly, say with an Utrillo, then gradually progress to Monet,' says Robert Holden, a London-based private dealer. The now famous example is when a collector bid $95.2 million for Picasso's _Dora Maar au Chat_ , 1941 (estimate $50 million), in Sotheby's New York on 3 May 2006. Little suspecting the firepower the bidder was about to unleash, the auction house had placed him halfway down its immense saleroom, where auctioneer Tobias Meyer had difficulty even seeing him. The agent was finally revealed to be buying on behalf of the previously unknown Georgian mining magnate, Boris Ivanishvili.

'Collectors always used to have an eye towards the "investment" aspect but they also bought an artwork because they loved it as well, it intrigued them, it enriched their lives in some way,' says Holden. 'Now it's way more about being in an investment portfolio. With all the prices available on the internet, it's unavoidable: you can rail about it, but that is the way things are today.'

In many of the emerging economies – where people are more comfortable buying tangible assets such as gold than with stock exchanges – an important trigger is this investment focus, particularly in countries such as India and China. At the 2012 India Art Fair I met one buyer publicly celebrating a purchase in the bar: 'I am going to double or triple my money in a year!' he crowed, probably with unwarranted optimism: 'Eighty per cent of the art bought from local dealers and local art fairs will never resell for as much as the original purchase price. Never, not a decade later, not ever,' notes art economist Don Thompson.

Art has become to this age what rock was to the 1960s – the hip place to be. It is celebrated in the media, reality television shows are made about it (including _Work of Art – The Next Great Artist_ with Simon de Pury, 2010, and _Gallery Girls_ , 2012) and celebrities are increasingly linking up with it. As Seydoux said at the beginning of this chapter: 'For the very wealthy today, it's not fine not to be interested in art.' But for most buyers at the high level today, the art has to be recognisable, which is why the highest prices are made by just a tiny group of artists. 'It's a lemming market, everyone doing the same thing,' says Nicholas Maclean.

Emulation can be a powerful trigger. I remember a Polish billionaire telling me he had just visited Pinchuk in Kiev, where he had seen his art foundation. This man, who apart from having paintings for his houses and yacht acquired by his decorator had no previous engagement with art, suddenly wanted to know how he could go about 'having the same thing as Victor'.

One characteristic of some of the new buyers is their youth. Buying expensive art used to be something people came to progressively, often waiting until they were in their 50s and 60s. But today, big buyers can be in their 30s – or even younger. A 31-year-old Malaysian tycoon called Low Taek Jho, and better known as Jho Low, is rumoured to have spent the record sum of $48.8 million on Jean-Michel Basquiat's _Dustheads_ , 1982, at Christie's New York on 1 May 2013. The firm did not want to comment. Or the 36-year-old Filipino real estate developer Robbie Antonio, a familiar figure at art fairs, who is building a house – designed by Rem Koolhaas – which will display the projected 35 portraits of himself commissioned from artists such as Julian Schnabel, Marilyn Minter, David Salle, Zhang Huan, members of the Bruce High Quality Foundation and Takashi Murakami – all for 'The Museum of Me', as _Vanity Fair_ dubs it.

### THE SUPER-CURATORS

'When I started writing about art, there were no curators. Now they are everywhere. They go to the same biennales; speak the same meaningless art language; and control the art world from within by privileging their creativity ahead of the artist's. For 5,000 years art survived perfectly well without curators. Now they are its gate keepers.'

Art critic Waldemar Januszczak

'Even cheese is "curated" today.'

_Andrew Renton,_ professor of curating at Goldsmiths' College, London

Among with a new breed of collectors, the twenty-first century has also produced a massive new role in the art world, that of the independent 'super-curator'. The prime example of this new breed today is Swiss-born Hans Ulrich Obrist, who in 2009 was voted, by _Art Review_ , the art world's most powerful person. As co-director, with Julia Peyton-Jones, of London's Serpentine Gallery, Obrist is a man of such energy and ubiquity that as well as curating exhibitions, he is also constantly in an airplane to a far-flung biennale; hosting early-morning chats; burrowing into artists' studios; writing catalogues, talking on panels and producing an astonishing series of books as well as amassing thousands of hours of recorded interviews with artists. Indeed the joke in the art world is that there must be not one, but several Obrists.

His prominence and influence would not have been possible even 20 years ago, when contemporary art had a much smaller place in the world, curators were generally linked to an institution and few people had heard of them anyway. Today Obrist, Okwui Enwezor (who will curate the 2015 Venice Biennale), Robert Storr, Massimiliano Gioni, RoseLee Goldberg, Hou Hanru and Paul Schimmel are, if not household names, among the stars of the art world.

'Curating has become one of the dominant forces in the contemporary art world,' said Andrew Renton, speaking at an ICA panel in 2010. Paul Schimmel, at the time chief curator at the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art, noted in 2002: 'The most important change in curatorial practice today,' is 'the role of the independent curator – a kind of journeyman curator or wandering global nomad who does not have the shell of a museum for protection.'

This rapid rise became essential in an expanded and globalised art world, and mirrored the rise and rise of so many biennales, fairs, transnational art galleries and new collectors. And they became famed in their own right – 'Robert Storr's Venice Biennale', for example, or 'Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev's documenta' – and as the high priests of the art world they have immense power over determining which artists are, or are not, significant.

It is customary to date the emergence of the independent curator to 1969, when Swiss curator Harald Szeemann staged _Live in Your Head: When Attitudes Become Form_ at the Kunsthalle Bern, a sprawling and controversial international survey of post-minimalism and _arte povera_. It was roundly criticised by the authorities, causing Szeemann to leave the institution – and become one of the first independent curators. Then followed a five-decade career during which he organised some 200 exhibitions and travelled the world, as attested by a well-known photograph taken in his office, showing a veritable cascade of luggage labels from all his trips. Szeemann was twice curator for the Venice Biennale (1999 and 2001) but most importantly established the 'thematic' style of curation, which really came into its own in the 1990s.

With the astonishing proliferation of biennales all through this century, demand for independent curators was ramped up. 'I think the new generation of curators did not want to be encumbered by a collection; they wanted to think through ideas in terms of exhibition making,' says Renton, now director of Marlborough Contemporary in London. 'They did not want to be restricted by the collection in the museum. The curator used to be a very static individual, tied to one location.' Now, though: 'You often see curators move from project to project, even wearing two hats simultaneously, which is super-interesting. For example, someone at Tate might sit on a curatorial panel of something more independent. You can also see the migration from commercial to institutional, and from institutional to commercial. Now the migration is much more seamless, relaxed and bi-directional.'

This overlap between the commercial and non-commercial worlds has accelerated in the twenty-first century. With rewards high in the gallery world, in contrast to the often puny remuneration in the museum sphere, let alone its tortoise-like pace of promotion, a number of curators have skipped across the fence. The most high-profile ones include Lisa Dennison, who left the Guggenheim Museum to join Sotheby's – where she is apparently excellent at using the financial language familiar to its clients. Scott Schaefer, former curator of paintings at the Getty, has also moved to Sotheby's. John Elderfield, curator emeritus at the Museum of Modern Art, is now a consultant to Gagosian. In London, Tate's former curators Ben Tufnell and Emma Dexter joined the commercial world, Tufnell initially with the now defunct Haunch of Venison; Dexter is with London's Timothy Taylor.

In an almost unprecedented example of a move in the other direction, dealer Jeffrey Deitch became director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA) in 2010, an appointment that was quickly and extensively criticised after his exhibition programme was accused of 'dumbing down'. All four of the institution's artist trustees as well as chief curator Paul Schimmel left, in his case going into association with Hauser & Wirth; they are opening a gallery in Los Angeles in 2014. Deitch left the post in 2013. The academic Robert Storr, director of the 2007 Venice Biennale, curated a critically admired show of Ad Reinhardt for Zwirner in 2013.

Nevertheless, there has been criticism of the conflicts of interest represented by these super-curators, whom many see as too involved in the market. 'The word "independent" is a misnomer,' says David Elliott, himself a well-known curator: 'Many of the super-curators have become bound up with the system and with the galleries. The problem is that you have to go with the market if you want access, and you have to cosy up to the donors to exhibitions – who are the galleries as well.'

The other problem posed by the 'star system' of today's super-curator, say some artists, is too much emphasis on the curator: the curator can become the interpreter before the fact, and not after it. The Indian photographer Dayanita Singh told me:

With some curators, they have become so important that the artist becomes just a prop to their vision. This isn't very healthy, as the curator sets the agenda – and the danger is that it could turn art into a third form, a sort of 'neither mine nor yours', which is exemplified by the national pavilions in the Venice Biennale, where the curators predominate.

### THE ART ADVISORS

_'Anybody with an iPhone and a pair of Louboutins can call themselves an advisor.'_

Anonymous New York dealer, 2013

The subject of curators inevitably leads into a consideration of the role of art advisors – and indeed, many advisors call themselves 'curators' today. While curating has been transformed in the late twentieth and twenty-first centuries, it is hardly new; the role of art advisor, however, is much newer. Both have a massive influence on what art is bought and endorsed – and both have been extensively criticised for homogenising taste in today's art world.

Advising collectors on what to buy has a long history: in the seventeenth century Diego Velázquez bought extensively for King Philip VI of Spain, at one point acquiring works by Titian, Tintoretto and Veronese during a trip to Italy. In the nineteenth century, newly rich industrialists, not trusting their taste, used intermediaries to buy art – so Paul Gauguin successfully brokered work by his teacher Camille Pissarro, as Don Thompson tells us. Alfred Barnes, founder of Philadelphia's renowned Barnes Collection, was guided by the (rather second-rate) artist William Glackens.

But for the most part advisors were also art dealers until the late twentieth century, and were responsible for some formidable collections, for example Duveen, who advised Morgan, Frick and Mellon; Agnew's (Kenwood House); and Vollard (the Russian collectors Sergei Shchukin and Ivan Morozov, many of whose acquisitions are now in the Hermitage in St Petersburg).

Today dealers are no longer the only ones leading the dance: the sheer size of the art world and a shift in the way money is made has forced a radical change. Keeping abreast of what is happening is a full-time job, demanding constant travel between fairs, biennales and auctions. 'Clients don't have time to hit the ground as much as I do,' says the New York advisor Lisa Schiff, adding: 'If you have a good advisor, they will help you sift through the machinations of the art world!'

Couple this with the changing profile of collectors: 'The rich of today are . . . different from the rich of yesterday,' points out Chrystia Freeland in her book _Plutocrats_. Their wealth is, she says, 'to a notable degree' first or second generation. These extremely wealthy people are so busy making money that they do not have time to run around a globalized art world. The sheer amount of art on offer, artists to see, shows to attend and fairs to trawl through means that they delegate the buying to a trusted advisor. This is not the only thing the very rich outsource: they use advisors for all aspects of their lives, from picking a cosmetic surgeon to decorating their homes.

The top advisors, those working for well-known collectors, wield extraordinary power in the market. The well-connected British aristocrat Mollie Dent-Brocklehurst, now a director of Pace London, used to work for Darya (Dasha) Zhukova, partner of Roman Abramovich and founder of the Moscow Garage Centre for Contemporary Art. The New York-based Sandy Heller advises hedge-fund honcho Steve Cohen and Abramovich. Art dealer Jeanne Greenberg Rohatyn works with the rapper Jay-Z, but one of the most important advisors is Allan Schwartzman, who has a long-term association with Howard Rachofsky as well working for Bernardo Paz. 'Many advisors follow trends and the momentum of the market at the moment,' says Schwartzman: 'And they tend to function like gate-keepers and dealers rather than as guides. And so much of buying art today is from newcomers and is about the market.'

But in order to get access in a market where the hottest artists are 'placed' with selected clients and simply not available for sale to just anyone, the advisor is key – if they have the right clients. 'When certain artists are in demand, I might know about it early on,' Schiff says: 'Although my clients are ultimately the person buying, I do the dance, I present the collector and I teach them the etiquette of being a collector – what to do, what not to do.' Among the no-nos, she says, the most important is never, never to talk about investment to the gallery.

This access extends to getting in early to art fairs and so getting first dibs on the best works. This is, of course, against official policy, but it happens: Emmanuel Perrotin was famously banned from Art Basel for a year, after he allegedly gave his exhibitor pass to François Pinault, the luxury-goods mogul and collector, who skipped around the fair with his advisor Philippe Ségalot picking out works of art during the set-up. In 2011 at the Paris Foire Internationale d'Art Contemporain (Fiac), exhibitors – all sweating away at a black-tie fundraising dinner at the Museum of Modern Art – learnt with fury that Pinault and the world's other top luxury-goods magnate Bernard Arnault, and their advisors, were trawling the fair in their absence. 'The very reason we came here was to meet them,' snarled one American dealer. 'And we were paying for the dinner, to make things worse!'

On the other side, a dealer working with a trusted advisor means that they can be sure that the client will not 'flip' works by reselling quickly at auction or to someone else. Even so, art advisors get a mixed press. 'You have to be very careful with some of the so-called advisors,' the dealer Gérard Goodrow once told me: 'They come to your stand, reserve pieces, take jpegs and then shop them around, adding 20 per cent. Then another agent takes them on and adds another 20 per cent. Pretty soon your work of art is being offered around at double the price.' Goodrow cited the case of an abstract Gerhard Richter at Art Cologne, tagged at €2.2 million. By the time it had passed through various advisors it ended up at €4.5 million – before finally selling for €2.5 million at the original booth.

Other dealers complain of advisors going on 'fishing expeditions': taking an image on an exclusive basis and then shopping it around. As the London-based dealer and collector Kenny Schachter memorably puts it: 'What spreads faster than the MRSA superbug virus? An art advisor hitting the send button a few hundred times after telling an owner they'd only offer a painting to one client.' And dealers are frustrated by the fact that advisors sometimes stand between them and the 'principal', i.e. the client, who of course they are dying to get their hands on directly.

How do they work? The industry norm is to take 10 per cent on the purchase price from the client, or to work on a retainer, or a pre-agreed combination of the two. What is frowned on is 'double-dipping', taking a cut from both sides, since that represents a conflict of interest.

There are no diplomas for art advising, and indeed the term covers people working in different ways – many dealers also do advising or consulting and some banks have divisions for advising their collector clients. The main trade body is the 100-member strong New York Association of Professional Art Advisors (APAA). Its president, Wendy Cromwell, explains: 'Dealers inevitably have a financial interest: art advisors, at least the good ones, have only one loyalty, and that is to their clients.' The APAA is by invitation only and has a code of ethics – members can be booted out if they break them. Nevertheless, many well-known advisors are not members, often because they also function as dealers.

A more serious criticism often levelled at advisors is that their growing influence has led to the homogenisation of taste. With the current boom in private art spaces around the world, plus the access afforded by the internet, every art space tends to have the same artists – it is as if the advisors are 'ticking the boxes'. 'I do think one of the dangers is that you have to be careful not to build the same collection over and over again,' Schiff says. 'And yet all of my clients have a Christopher Wool, but I am very happy about that overlap. To an extent homogenisation of taste is generated by the market but they play into each other, and perhaps you could call it a consensus, as advisors, collectors and curators ultimately come together over certain artists.'

An Event-driven Lifestyle

'I think one of the biggest ways the art market changed was when art fairs became social events, and they took over as lifestyle choices.'

Thomas Seydoux of dealing partnership Connery, Pissarro, Seydoux

_14 June 2011_ : It was a hot day in the vast Messeplatz in Basel, Switzerland, and the sweating 'super VIPs' – those who had received the coveted 'first choice' cards for early entry to the Art Basel fair – were crowded into the lobby awaiting the 11 am opening.

In the increasingly dense crush were major collectors such as Berlin's Christian Boros, the always-fashionably-dressed Norah and Norman Stone, who collect sexually explicit art, Los Angeles power-house collector Eli Broad, supermodel Linda Evangelista and artist Takashi Murakami, as well as some of the most influential museum directors and curators in the world, from Beatrix Ruf of the Kunsthalle Zurich to Nicholas Serota of Britain's Tate.

In their wisdom, the fair organisers had chosen to inaugurate a new electronic system that year, which involved guests slotting their cards into a reader, which released the arm of the turnstile. As 11 am came and went and the visitors were admitted painfully slowly, with those at the back pressing up against those blocked against the barriers at the front, the crowd became increasingly outraged. 'They're treating us like animals!' fulminated one woman at the front.

These were VIPs, with an acute sense of entitlement, not people accustomed to waiting patiently in line, and soon enough they were in open revolt: the murmured complaints turned to irate squawks. One collector, Don Rubell of Miami, attempted to duck under the arm of the turnstile, only to get stuck halfway and be forced to clamber out backwards. Others simply unhooked the black straps between the gates, and surged in; the black-clad Swiss security guards, unprepared for this display of civil disobedience, tried to push them back, but soon abandoned the attempt, and indeed finally flung open the barriers and let everyone in, willy-nilly. Some people actually ran to their chosen stands to ensure that they were first in line to get a work of art they coveted. And after the deals were done, visitors flocked to the VIP lounges, talking about which of the multiple conversations, visits, museum shows and smart dinner parties they were planning to attend. Later they would repair to Donati or Les Trois Rois for dinner, or brave the scrum at the Kunsthalle bar for a post-prandial Prosecco.

### MULTIPLYING LIKE MUSHROOMS AFTER THE AUTUMN RAIN

The notion of commercial art fairs goes back a long time – at least to the fifteenth century. However, most of the major events we know today were created in the twentieth century – such as London's Grosvenor House Antiques Fair (founded in 1934, but closed in 2009), the Paris _Biennale des Antiquaires_ (1962) and The European Fine Art Fair, TEFAF in Maastrict (1975). Unlike today, when art fairs are overwhelmingly about contemporary art, the most important fairs displayed antiques, works of art and Old Master paintings, with a few brave souls offering modern pictures. These fairs all had datelines, so were debarred from selling anything contemporary anyway.

'The world's first fair for modern art', as contemporary art tended to be dubbed then, was Cologne's Kunstmarkt, started in 1967, according to Isabelle Graw. It was created in the wake of the German event documenta, which allowed a committee member, Hein Stünke, to sell works in lieu of his fee, which documenta could not afford. Stünke, who co-founded the Cologne event with Rudolf Zwirner (father of dealer David), realised what a huge commercial potential there was in this field, according to Graw.

By 1970, says economic historian Stefano Baia Curioni, there were three significant contemporary art fairs (Kunstmarkt, Basel and Art Actuel in Brussels). Ten years later there were three more (Bologna, Chicago, Fiac in Paris). From then on, the expansion accelerated rapidly – 14 fairs in 1990, 68 in 2005 and, by 2011, when Baia Curioni's statistics end, 189. By 2012, it was generally agreed that the figure had topped 200. This, as we shall see, is problematic for the newcomers, as there is barely a chink left in the art-world calendar to accommodate a new event.

So what explains this proliferation? The answers are multiple, but their roots can be found in Chapter 1 of this book, which charts the auction houses' migration from being mainly 'trade-only' wholesale operations to becoming retailers, moving aggressively into the dealers' territory and selling directly to collectors in swish evening sales.

### ART FAIRS: THE DEALERS' RESPONSE TO THE AUCTION HOUSES

The dealer community is fragmented, as we have seen. Most are individually unable to muster the resources, both human and financial, to compete with the auction houses' international reach. Nor, sitting in their galleries, can they recreate the conditions of an auction, particularly the ticket-only evening sales when just being there marks out the visitor as a VIP. Dealers cannot fabricate the now-or-never side of auction, when a buyer is reassured by the presence of someone else wanting 'their' lot, and can be pushed into making that snap decision before the hammer falls.

Art fairs are the response dealers found to counter the increasing sway of the auction houses, as well as allowing them to internationalise. And in a field that has no recognised diplomas or powerful trade associations, participation in a fair assures the dealer's credentials. 'I come from South Africa, and people don't necessarily know my gallery,' says Joost Bosland of Stevenson, in Cape Town. 'When I say I exhibit at the Basel and Frieze fairs, it tells them about us.'

Fairs are the dealers' party – happening at fixed dates, for just a few days, with the same high-octane 'now-or-never' atmosphere as an auction and the same sense of being one of the select. The first day – or two, in the case of Art Basel – is reserved for VIPs, who, armed with their special card, get access to the fair and much more, including a fleet of shiny black BMWs or Audis to ferry them around. And some VIPs are more important than others: Frieze and Art Basel operate a three-level system granting access at different times of the day.

As all the big collectors tend to come on the first day alone – by the weekend, even the gallery owners have left, leaving juniors to look after the stand – there is certainly a 'now-or-never' feeling, with pressure to close a deal before someone else does. 'I've often seen people buy a work at a fair just because they saw another person looking at it,' says one dealer.

### GLOBALISATION

In the age of globalisation, art fairs give dealers, who overwhelmingly operate out of a single country, access to the burgeoning new markets for art around the world. In this way they can emulate the international reach of the auction houses, and compete, to an extent, with the handful of 'mega-galleries' that have multiple outlets. Their interest is threefold – to seek new markets for their existing artists, find new artists to bring back to their home base and, of course, connect with new collectors.

Fairs have been mushrooming around the world, and the financial crisis of 2008–9 had virtually no impact on this. Art Dubai and ShContemporary (postponed in 2013) were started in 2007; ArtHK in Hong Kong in 2008; the Indian Art Summit (now India Art Fair) and Art Rio in 2009. Istanbul got a new fair in 2013, Sydney and Moscow in 2014; two new ones were created in Silicon Valley in the same year. 'Every week, and that's no exaggeration, I get some city calling me and asking me to organise an art fair for them,' says Sandy Angus, one of the founders of ArtHK: 'The other day, the island of Jersey told me they wanted an art fair. _Jersey_!'

The advantages for a location to host a fair are obvious – it brings business and a raised profile to the city, along with big-spending visitors. The economic benefits of holding a fair are difficult to quantify, but according to one report, between 2002, when Art Basel Miami Beach was held for the first time, and 2010, revenue from the average Miami-Dade hotel room grew 51 per cent, and in December alone, it grew by 79 per cent. Even the local airport benefits, with private jets paying landing fees during the fair. Art Basel Miami Beach – and the multitude of satellite events that are held at the same time – has enabled Miami to rebrand itself as a cultural centre and boost its tourism industry. Despite the presence of some high-profile collectors such as Martin Margulies or the Rubells, the Florida city was hardly on anyone's culture circuit until the fair arrived. And at the end of 2013 the city's new profile as an art destination was boosted by the opening of the Pérez Art Museum Miami (PAMM), in a landmark Herzog & De Meuron-designed building on the waters of Biscayne Bay.

National pride is also involved, and hosting an art fair is a way of putting a country on the world's cultural map. So particularly in the Gulf, where states are feverishly competing to build museums and kick-start an art scene, fairs may be partly state-funded. Dubai's art fair is part owned by the Dubai International Finance Centre, and Abu Dhabi Art is wholly created by the emirate's cultural arm.

Many question the logic of organising and funding an art fair in Abu Dhabi, a country with essentially just one major buyer, in the form of the royal family. And cultural differences have been sharp: Western dealers have found it tough to accept the quasi-religious status of the local rulers who will sweep into the fair when it suits them – at 2 am in one case – forcing the dealers to wait on their stands until they arrive.

But with Abu Dhabi currently building three massive museums as well as funding ambitious public art projects such as the Christo _Mastaba_ (see Chapter 3), dealers are banking on getting kudos for 'supporting' the fair. They hope that payback will come one day with juicy sales for their artists.

### GROWING THE MARKET FOR ART

As well as extending art galleries' reach, art fairs actually grow the market for art, says Tim Etchells, whose company runs multiple fairs – not only in the art field – and who co-founded ArtHK. 'Done properly, an art fair creates its own market place and expands the market itself,' he says. He talks about a 'pyramid' of visitors to a fair. At the top are high-end collectors; under them is a middle layer of wealthy individuals – 'They're buyers of art, not necessarily collectors; there's a subtle difference.' And then the third tier is the general public 'who love going to an art fair and may get tempted by works on paper and gradually start moving up the chain. It's the second two tiers that are very important to grow markets – as well as creating a buzz.'

That all-important 'buzz' is what has enabled the major art fairs to become 'destination events', and indeed Frieze London has completely altered the cultural landscape in the British capital in October, with galleries programming new shows, auction houses holding auctions and even museums putting on major exhibitions to coincide with the fair. In a place like Miami Beach, the fair has achieved such importance that artists only want to show there during the event: 'It's tragic for Miami really,' says dealer Thaddaeus Ropac. He also notes that elsewhere as well, such as during the Paris Fiac: 'Some of the strongest museum shows are now put on during fairs.'

This 'destination' aspect is bolstered by the activities around them: the VIP programmes featuring visits to local collections, talks and, of course, the parties. Art Basel Miami Beach in particular is renowned for its sometimes highly decadent parties, with the combination of tropical climate, Latin-American lustiness, availability of drugs and luxury hotels that seem to invite excess, with draped beds – some equipped with television screens – dotted around the swimming pools. 'Art Basel Miami Beach is an excuse for people to take five days off and basically go nuts,' says one dealer who knows the scene well.

Luxury-goods brands were not slow to join the party, spotting the opportunity to piggy-back on the prestige of the art world, and of course many employ artists to design their wares. As well as the classic handbags brands, champagne merchants and fashion crowd, jewellers got in on the act – one year Cartier made a big noise in Miami Beach about their 'Jean-Nouvel designed' stand, although this was pretty underwhelming, consisting mainly of transparent plastic walling.

Another year, Ferrari held a chic party in the newly finished Herzog & De Meuron car park in Miami Beach, with pouting models in the tightest of dresses draped over the scarlet Testarossa. As a chilly wind whisked in from the sea, guests were given scarlet scarves and 3D glasses to watch a promotional film on an immense screen erected above the bar, while swigging champagne. All the art world was there, of course – curators, critics, dealers, collectors, and artists – along with journalists and photographers to record the occasion. This 'event' side of art fairs mirrors the luxury-goods industry, which is aware that to bring the consumer into a shop, it has to offer an 'experience' that goes beyond just walking in and buying a product, which after all could be as easily bought online.

Banks also spotted the opportunity that art fairs presented, with sponsorship giving them the chance to offer something to their high net worth individual (HNWI) clients as well as enhancing their 'cultural' credentials. Frieze sponsor Deutsche Bank has a separate area, with its own entrance, where clients can await the 11 am opening: they are then launched into the heart of the fair while other VIP visitors are still queuing up outside.

The tie-up between art fairs and banks went horribly wrong, however, in 2008 when one month before Art Basel Miami Beach opened, a Florida jury indicted the head of UBS's worldwide wealth management business, Raoul Weil, for allegedly helping thousands of Americans hide their money in secret accounts. The indictment said that the bank had trawled for new US clients at the fair, and the bank had indeed been holding smart dinners for hundreds of guests in a huge tent directly on the beach.

The case ended in a deal between the Swiss government and the bank, with the institution disclosing the names and details on 4,450 secret accounts to the Swiss government which then handed them over to the US Internal Revenue Service, which dropped its legal action. The party was well and truly over – the dinner did not happen the following year – but despite the hoo-ha, UBS remains the lead sponsor for all the Basel fairs.

### THE BACKLASH

In 2011 the collector, dealer and billionaire investor Adam Lindemann published a broadside in the _New York Observer_ starting: 'I'm not going to Art Basel Miami Beach this year.' It went on:

Here are all the things I'm absolutely not going to: Tuesday it's a lunch with Ferrari chairman Luca di Montezomolo (nice name!), then there are cocktails for artist Teresita Fernandez (I like her, she's pretty, she's Cuban and she won a MacArthur fellowship), then there's my friend Lapo Elkann's Ferrari party, which I'll have to leave to make the dinner Delphine Arnault is having (she's the daughter of the owner of LVMH, no less) for Berlin-based artist Anselm Reyle. He's just designed a line of bags for Christian Dior, he's very handsome and smooth, his work is rather out of favor now but I think he's on his way back (though it may take a while). Then I'll probably have late-night drinks at Maria Baibakova's, because she's young and cool, she's Russian and she has a great apartment in Miami, and, oops, I forgot my promise to show up at the Rubell Collection opening party sponsored by US Trust.

On Wednesday there's a W magazine party for hot Brazilian artist Beatriz Milhazes, then there's the Galerie Eva Presenhuber dinner (she has good artists, as always) and there's also a dinner at some wonderful Mexican collector's house where I go because I love authentic Mexican food. Somewhere there will be a raging White Cube party, and Emmanuel Perrotin will once again bring over Paris's Le Baron nightclub, where, late into the night, dealers will come hunting for a one-night stand. On Thursday, if I'm still pumping, there's a dinner for Berlin gallery Contemporary Fine Arts (those Berliners know how to party), and then there's Simon de Pury's Phillips Auction House party (it's crazy and they have fun Russian partners), then there's Aby Rosen's mega-dinner party at his W hotel, followed by a debauched party in the hotel nightclub hosted by party boys Stavros Niarchos (very internationally cool), Alex Dellal (major London hipster) and Vito Schnabel (a fast talker who represents some promising youngish artists).

I make no apologies for publishing such a large excerpt of the text as it gives insight to the extent to which collectors such as Lindemann are wooed during an art fair, and how attractive fairs can become a lifestyle choice.

His trumpet blast turned out to be slightly off-key, however, in that he actually did attend the fair, but a spate of other writers and critics also weighed into the fray, extending their criticisms to the whole contemporary art market, the 'very shiny, very expensive art' on offer and the trophy hunters who wanted it. The respected art critic Jerry Saltz said: 'Auctions are out of control as people with penises buy the work of a handful of artists with penises for the highest prices ever paid', while Dave Hickey said: 'Art editors and critics – people like me – have become a courtier class. All we do is wander around the palace and advise very rich people.'

We looked at the new class of collectors who have been so important in transforming the art market in the twenty-first century in Chapter 4, but it is important to also note the major role art fairs have played in bringing new collectors into the market.

Fairs are very much in tune with the changing profile of collectors, who particularly in the contemporary field overwhelmingly come from a new-money background. Vast fortunes have been made this century in fields such as real estate, finance, commodities, retail and, of course, luxury goods, by entrepreneurs who do not necessarily know much about art. For them, often time-pressed, an art fair offers a convenient one-stop shop, a compelling event to brag about back home, a way to compare a number of works by the same artist and a less intimidating way to see art than in icy white-cube galleries, with their unapproachable, posh reception staffers.

### SATELLITE FAIRS

The main fairs are not the only place where collectors can see and buy art: because the most popular fairs are heavily over-subscribed, a mass of 'satellite' fairs have sprung up around them this century. They are held in hotels, tents or former skating rinks – anywhere the organisers can rent space at the same time as the main fair, be it the Armory Show, Art Basel or Frieze. Their growth seems recession-defying – even in 2009, as the art market suffered along with the rest of the world's economy, Art Basel Miami Beach still had 17 such events – only a slight drop from the 21 it had seen at the top of the art-market boom in 2007.

### MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH . . .

The problem for the trade is that the massive expansion of fairs has had a backlash caused by jeopardising dealers' businesses 'back home'. While the biggest galleries have the resources, staff and artist stables to exhibit at a dozen fairs a year, this is not the case for the smaller ones. The trade has got into a catch-22 situation here: fewer and fewer collectors actually visit galleries, except for the _vernissages_ , because there is always an art fair around the corner. By increasingly participating in fairs, dealers have cannibalised their own businesses; many now make between a third and three-quarters of their annual turnover at fairs; and one study for _Blouin ArtInfo_ claims this figure can be 90 per cent.

Fairs are expensive. As well as being absent from their galleries, dealers need to pay for accommodation, shipping, entertaining their clients at the fair and booth rentals. For an average-sized booth, between 50 and 80 square metres, rental costs vary from a few thousand dollars ($9,000 for New York's Outsider Art fair) to some $50,000 for Art Basel. And rental fees are just the beginning: the study cited above reckons that all in, costs of doing Art Basel are over $122,000.

For the 'big box' galleries such as White Cube, Gagosian and Hauser & Wirth, fairs are another way to generate revenue and cement relationships in countries where they may already have galleries. And they have large staffs to administer the logistics – 150 employees in the case of Zwirner. But attending fairs is much tougher for the smaller and medium-sized galleries, who need to do fairs to bolster their credentials and bottom line. As for the emerging galleries, their price points are so low that even though stand costs are generally reduced in the sections that house them, they absolutely need to sell to cover costs.

Because doing fairs is so expensive, dealers may be tempted to abandon their ground-floor, plate-glass premises and move into cheaper first-floor galleries, the argument being that few come to their galleries anyway. Here again there is a catch-22 situation, because selection for fairs is based on their programme at the gallery, and if this is not good enough, then they will not get into the fair. And if they do not get into a fair, it hits their bottom line as well as their prestige – clients will think they 'have not made the grade' and their artists will be annoyed and might even jump ship for another gallery.

### SELECTION COMMITTEES: HOW NOT TO MAKE FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE

This is why the question of selection is highly touchy. The committees are generally made up of other dealers, who are sitting in judgement on their colleagues. 'Being a selector is terrible for relationships between dealers. There is always the feeling, "who spoke out against me?" It becomes very personal,' David Juda, formerly on the selection committee for Art Basel, once told me.

Because the system works by dealers on the committee choosing others, the competitive element is high. 'If two dealers represent the same artist, and one is on the committee, it is obviously tempting for him to reject his competitor,' says one. For fear of being blacklisted, the unsuccessful candidate generally keeps quiet although in 2011 there was a very public row after the Berlin gallerist Gerd Harry Lybke of Eigen+Art was not given a booth at Art Basel. He vocally accused the selection committee of bias, as three of its six-member committee came from Berlin. In a further move, he made sure that the artists he represented would not be on view at Basel either – so other galleries, in a show of support, refrained from showing names such as Neo Rauch, Martin Eder and Carsten Nicolai. Also rejected that year was Berlin dealer Giti Nourbakhsch, and she weighed into the row. In an open letter she accused the Berlin-based committee members of excluding her as revenge for leaving the organising committee of the annual Gallery Weekend – as the three Berlin committee members were also part of that event. The question was resolved in a different way, as Nourbakhsch closed her gallery the following year, although she denied that the Art Basel rejection was the deciding element.

While committee members – off the record – maintain that the quality of the Eigen+Art stand was the reason for the rejection, the gallery was reinstated the following year. The three Berlin gallerists were still on the committee in 2013, but in a probably unconnected changeover, Juda and Claes Nordenhake have since left, to be replaced by Lucy Mitchell-Innes (Mitchell-Innes & Nash, New York) and Franco Noera (Turin). While committee members vociferously proclaim that participation in the system is enormously demanding and time-consuming – which is indeed true – it is also worth noting that it is a sure-fire way of ensuring that the gallery stays in the fair.

Basel reported over 1,000 applications for 304 slots in 2013, but these figures do not quite reflect reality, as some applicants will never get into the top fairs, however much they try. Also generally excluded from art fairs are auction houses, for the simple reason that fairs are the dealers' way of fighting back against their strength and influence. There have been exceptions, notably at the traditional art fair TEFAF, which was partly founded by the late Robert Noortman, whose firm was bought by Sotheby's in 2006 (to whom it owed substantial sums of money; in 2013 the firm closed). Noortmans continued exhibiting at the fair, infuriating Christie's which threatened to take the event to court unless it was also allowed in. Christie's specially created vehicle, King Street Fine Art, exhibited the following year but then was quietly dropped.

For some fair organisers, excluding the auction houses does not make sense, as they invite their well-heeled clients to visit their booth. The Russian investor and art-market analyst Sergei Skatershikov, who bought Viennafair in 2012, included both Sotheby's and the local Dorotheum in the event. 'For Sotheby's, it was an interesting proposition, as instead of organising a preview of their sales, they brought them to the fair. There was some opposition from galleries at the beginning but when we explained that the auction houses would bring at least 100 fresh visitors to the fair, and ones that do buy art, they changed their minds,' said Skaterschikov at the time. 'And we tucked Sotheby's right at the back, so their clients had to walk through the whole fair to get to them.' It may not have been such a winning strategy for the auction houses, as neither returned in 2013; Skatershikov subsequently ended this investment.

Auction houses are constantly trying to find a way to encroach on fairs, as part of their continuing expansionist thrust. 'The opening of Art Basel or Art Basel Miami Beach is one of the prime moments in our activity, that's when our major sales are made,' says the Berlin and Stockholm dealer Claes Nordenhake. 'And that's also when the major auction houses send all of their specialists with clients, and they steer people away from the booths! And they organize dinners around the fair, take the best tables at the best restaurants! And they send gorgeous 30-something consultants who hold their 60-something collectors by the . . .' he hesitates a moment, chuckling, then concludes: 'by the tie!'

Indeed, just before the 2013 Art Basel Miami Beach fair, director Marc Spiegler sent a letter to the three main auction houses, asking them not to indulge in activities such as:

Promoting works that have been consigned to their house, either for private-treaty or auction sale, as an alternative to buying works at the show; using iPads or similar devices on the show floor to promote works for sale by the auction house; interrupting gallerists during conversation with collectors; disparaging works for sale; initiating contacts with clients inside the booth and then leading clients outside.

According to Spiegler, the auction houses agreed to curtail such activities.

'The auction houses use the fairs as a barometer of the market, and they are saying, "These galleries do all this business at art fairs and what are we doing? We're doing nothing. How can we get a piece of that pie?"' says another dealer. Christie's has in fact started its own fair in a small way, with an event held during Frieze week in October in London, and was one of the sponsors of the new African art fair, 1:54, held on 16–20 October 2013 in Somerset House, London.

### DO FAIRS CONTRIBUTE TO OVERPRODUCTION?

The exponential growth of fairs has brought into sharp focus another problem with which the market is increasingly grappling, that of over-production. To supply fairs around the world, as well as their own spaces, galleries need inventory, and artists have responded in two ways. Firstly, they increasingly outsource their production (see Chapter 3). They have also boosted production through the use of multiples: prints, photographs, videos and editions.

The need for supply has been further stimulated by biennales, triennales and other 'pluriennales', which have been growing almost as fast as art fairs. The increase in the two sorts of event has happened in parallel: in 1970 there were ten pluriennales, including São Paulo, Venice and documenta, a figure that had grown to over 100 by 2011. These events, which are virtually art fairs in disguise since a good part of the works of art on display are for sale, have also ratcheted up the pressure on artists to produce.

Selling art shown at the Venice Biennale was official between 1942 and 1968, with an Italian dealer, Ettore Gian Ferrari, given the job of placing works for any willing artist, earning 15 per cent for the biennale and 2 per cent for himself. However, the artists' dealers started objecting to being cut out of the deal, and the practice was ended. This does not stop business happening, more or less obviously.

Examples are numerous: in 2007 White Cube staffers at the British pavilion in Venice were handing out lists of Tracey Emin's work and I was informed by one that 'about 75 per cent is already sold but there are some monotypes left'. Prices ranged from £3,000 to £100,000. And in the 2011 São Paulo Biennial the collector/dealer Larry Warsh was heavily promoting Ai Weiwei's giant reproductions of bronze zodiac animal heads, the originals of which were looted from Beijing's Summer Palace in the mid-nineteenth century. A smaller edition, in gold-gilded bronze, was commercialised in eight editions and, according to Warsh's not-for-profit AW Asia, 'several have been placed in private collections'. In 2013 the pan-national Zeitz Collection, headquartered in Kenya, bought no less than 85 works at the Venice Biennale, including the installation at the Angola pavilion, which won the Lion d'Or.

A reproach levelled against the proliferation of art fairs is the way it has encouraged what some call 'art fair art': 'moderate in size . . . in tune with dominant market trends,' says Velthuis. An example is certainly Tracey Emin's editioned neons with easy-to-like slogans ( _The last great adventure is you_ or _The passion of your smile_ ) which sold strongly at Art Basel Miami Beach in 2013.

### POLARISATION

The art fair landscape is constantly evolving, and is highly competitive: with such a busy calendar, there are virtually no time slots left in the year that do not conflict with another fair's dates. And the business has become cut-throat – while organisers deny this, fairs are deliberately planned to occupy the terrain and eventually force other competitors out. This is generally thought to be the case with Frieze Masters, featuring art before 2000 and going back to antiquity. It was inaugurated to great acclaim in 2012 and seems to have in its sights the smaller, but successful, Pavilion of Art and Design (PAD) held in London's Berkeley Square in the same month of October. Frieze has also successfully occupied, to considerable surprise, New York, where its event held on the out-of-the-way Randall's Island debuted in 2012 as well, and is certainly giving the Armory Show a headache: a number of satellite events changed their March dates to May to coincide with the newcomer. Frieze is also rumoured to be planning a Masters fair for New York – which would also go head-to-head with more traditional fairs in Manhattan.

This concentration into big brand events is best illustrated by Art Basel, which now runs three massive fairs, one in Hong Kong (it bought into the existing HK event in 2011 and completely rebranded it in 2013) and Art Basel Miami Beach, started in 2002 (the initial 2001 edition was cancelled in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attack). Will this concentration into big groups continue? Asia is certainly a magnet, and the smaller Art Stage Singapore would provide a ready-made springboard for a group wanting to penetrate this market; its owner Lorenzo Rudolf told me in 2012 he was actively looking for 'partners'.

What seems to be the future is a couple of powerful groups – Basel and Frieze – plus their satellites; the well-established Fiac; and then a host of more specialised regional fairs such as Art Dubai, the India Art Fair or the Brazilian events, which offer different fare from the 'big box' providers. But with middle-market galleries feeling the pinch, the question for the future is, how many fairs can the market sustain if a significant number of these galleries – their clients – go to the wall?

Selling Art Online

'Will we see a work of art sold for $100 million over the internet? Absolutely! But perhaps not in our lifetime.'

Thomas Galbraith, managing director of auctions, Paddle8

_15 June 2011_ : The dinner at the Beyeler Foundation just outside Basel was announced as an 'intimate' celebration of the work of the Swiss artist Christian Marclay, whose 24-hour video _The Clock_ , 2010, had just been awarded the ultimate accolade, the Lion d'Or for best artwork at the Venice Biennale. Hosted by the Swiss bank Credit Suisse, the party was held during Art Basel, and inevitably attended by leading figures in the art world and beyond – from hedge-funder Steve Cohen and uber-dealer Larry Gagosian to comedian and actor Will Ferrell.

But the focus of the evening was not only on Marclay: it kicked off, to the surprise of some of the 200-odd guests, with a promotion of Artsy, an online art start-up. The brainchild of Princeton computer science graduate Carter Cleveland, Artsy (at the time called Art.sy, with the suffix standing for Syria, which became problematic after the bloody civil war started; so the domain name was changed). The site had attracted the most money – $5.4 million – and the most glamorous backers of any of the art-related internet companies being created at the time. Investors included Twitter founder Jack Dorsey and Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, along with art-world heavyweight 'advisors' Gagosian, John Elderfield, chief curator emeritus of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art – who was then working for Gagosian – and Marc Glimcher, president of Pace Gallery.

On hand to promote the project were three very glamorous investors in the venture: Chinese-born Wendi Deng, at the time still married to press mogul Rupert Murdoch; former _New Yorker_ editor Tina Brown, and Dasha Zhukova, partner of the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. Deng introduced Cleveland as: 'A genius – our Mark Zuckerberg,' referring to the Facebook founder. Then Cleveland – tall, casually dressed in a white shirt with the sleeves turned back – explained to the guests that Artsy would allow art to find a much wider audience through the internet. He drew a parallel with music: 'Hundreds of years ago, music was something very few people had access to,' he said. 'It was mainly performed in courts, for the aristocracy and in churches.' But the radio and record player changed all this, and music became universal. 'Art,' he continued, 'is still widely unappreciated. Just like music, anyone can grow to fall in love with art.'

Thanks to technology, he explained, users would be able to access art over the web. Users would input their tastes into the site, and it would suggest other artworks they might like. Sorting the world's art into categories – period, colour, genre and so on – was the task of the 'genome project' which Artsy's team was working on. And he invited the audience to try out the site on computers dotted around the tables. As a few guests looked at the computers, most continued gossiping and mingling with a few commenting, _sotto voce_ , that Cleveland's reading of history and music was a trifle jejune.

Fittingly, the soirée ended with music as well – when Marclay presented 'Shuffle', in which a violinist, cellist and bass clarinettist improvised a work from random cards the artist presented to them, perplexing more than one in the audience.

Vast fortunes have been made by internet companies in the twenty-first century, from social media sites such as Facebook to companies selling everything from books to footwear. Artsy is just one venture for selling art that sprang up in the middle of the first decade of the century, and it certainly has the highest profile. But it is not alone. Tens of millions of dollars have been invested in the sector, with over 300 start-up companies offering data, information and research as well as art for sale. These range from, for example, Newbloodart offering works by young artists at a few hundred dollars or Eyestorm, selling limited edition prints, to sites selling at higher price ranges, such as Paddle8, Artnet or Artspace, which have made sales well into six figures and even beyond. In 2013 Amazon added art to its site, selling works consigned by dealers in the same way as it sells books, CDs or laptops. Some auction houses, such as Heritage in Texas or Saffronart in India, make most of their annual revenues through online auctions, and Christie's has been actively expanding its internet presence in a bid to reach younger clients.

The idea of selling art online is not new: dozens of art sales sites were started up during the 'dot.com boom' of the late 1990s, but most collapsed in the spectacular bust of 2000, sometimes with astonishing rapidity. I remember going to a conference in 2000 in Paris on the subject, and meeting an executive whose start-up was so new he did not even have cards printed yet. It turned out he did not need them – the venture went belly-up before they were even delivered.

At that time, the lure of the web brought in many high-profile personalities: Lord Poltimore, now a kingpin at Sotheby's, left Christie's to join eAuctionroom.com, while Thomas Hoving, former director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, joined Artnet. Both tenures were brief and, while Artnet is still around, eAuctionroom quickly disappeared.

Amazon also made an earlier foray into the field by linking up with Sotheby's and putting $45 million into a joint venture, which saw Sotheby's supply works from 'partner dealers' and Amazon selling them, as well as running its own department for low-cost art and decorative items. The venture, which coincided with Sotheby's pleading guilty in the auction-houses collusion case, was abandoned after less than a year, losing Sotheby's some $100 million. Very few of the sites launched at that time have survived today, exceptions being Artnet and Eyestorm.

However, the belief that the internet was the future for the art market did not go away, and a whole new generation of sites are now battling for attention. The arguments are the same as during the first boom: the internet, by instantly spreading information about art and artists round the world, by collapsing time zones and by making buying art as easy as buying a book, would reach manifold new buyers and grow the market colossally. The internet, it is argued, enables people who would be hesitant about entering an art gallery to browse and educate themselves before buying, from the comfort of their homes. The old model, where a dealer or auction house had to physically have inventory, store and display it, would be swept away, as the art could be held by any number of vendors around the world but displayed on a single site. High-definition photography would ensure that a collector could examine the work virtually before buying.

Assessing the size of the market is tricky. According to Clare McAndrew, online sales in 2013 through dealers and auction houses could be estimated at $3.5 billion, or 5 per cent of global sales of art and antiques and .05 per cent of the global e-commerce market. Auctions, she says, were estimated to make up the majority of those sales at around 54 per cent of the total. She also predicts that the sector might grow at least 25 per cent per annum, meaning that it could reach close to $14 billion by 2020. While she admits that this figure could be 'bullish' – the 25 per cent increase is based on luxury-goods sales growth – she points out that the US auction house Heritage reported close to $900 million in annual sales in 2013, nearly all online. Other sources have very different figures; Chris Vroom, one of the two founders of Paddle8, calculates the current market as under $1 billion, and predicts a $10 billion to $15 billion market – but only in 10 or 12 years' time. Thomas Galbraith of Artspace is less bullish, reckoning that the current market is worth $150 million, but will grow to $2 billion by 2020. Finally, the insurer Hiscox estimated the online market at 1.6 per cent of the global market, making it $870 million in 2012. With transactions not being as easily traced as auction sales, the conclusion must be that no one really knows how much the online market for art is truly worth.

What has evolved between the 1990s dot.com boom and the early-twenty-first century is what is called 'behavioural acceptance' – the increase in the number of people who feel comfortable using and buying over the internet. In the art field, 'People are more and more willing to spend larger amounts online,' says Thomas Galbraith of Paddle8: 'Initially it was up to $2,000, now they are happy at $10,000.' In 2013, he said, the average price for a work sold on his site was $6,000, and the highest price – for a work sold in a charity auction – was $1.3 million. 'I think efficiencies of operating online are going to continue and grow across the market: auction houses, dealers and transactions at lower levels make so much more sense. If you send a $10,000 work to an auction house and it doesn't sell, you incur perhaps $3,000 costs both getting it to the firm and back – and it hasn't sold!'

Few if any sites are yet in profit – some are in 'pre-revenue' mode, which is a way of saying they are not even trying to make money. This is not unusual, of course, among internet start-ups: many take years to deliver hard cash rather than just sweet dreams. 'No one is making gobs of profit,' says David Frankel, partner at the venture capital fund Founder Collective, whose company invests in art sales sites, among them Paddle8. 'But there are significant revenues flowing already, absolutely.'

The most important thing, says Frankel, is to build 'trust marks'. This is by surrounding the transaction with, for example, a recognised specialist to authenticate the work, by offering remedies if something goes wrong – as do Amazon and eBay. 'If you surround a piece of work with enough trust marks, you build yourself as a trust mark,' says Frankel. 'It is even more important to build trust online. And normal business rules apply – you respond quickly to a client, email doesn't wait 24 hours and so on: the operational competencies have to be there, because if you get anything wrong you're dead.'

There are different models for how art is actually sold over the internet. One is the straight auction site, where the user bids for an artwork; the site acts as an agent, taking a commission from buyer and seller: this is how Christie's operates its online-only sales. Other examples are Paddle8 and Amazon.

Then there are 'e-commerce' sites, where you click and buy, like the eBay model, although the art sites shudder at the comparison. Most 'curate' their offerings and add editorial content, so avoiding an indiscriminate artistic free-for-all. eBay, however, is planning to enter the higher-end online market in 2014. The arrival of Amazon into this increasingly crowded market place in 2013 provoked derision and fear in equal measure. Its initial offerings, at least at the high-value end, were ridiculed with some jeering user reviews, which did little to enhance the project. And Amazon's 180 galleries – which offer tens of thousands of works – do not boast any of the big names: no Zwirner, Pace or Gagosian, or even well-respected smaller galleries, the sort one would see in established art fairs, although it has been trying to recruit them. Art on Amazon is sold just like cookware or books – with the overwhelming majority of the 4,500 artists offered being deeply unknown. The site takes a 5 to 20 per cent cut on sales from the seller. But at the low price level, with 200 million customers worldwide, its established name and reliability – its 'trust marks' – Amazon could well upturn the applecart for other contenders in this field, such as Exhibition A or ArtStar, which mainly sell limited edition prints.

Artsy is building a huge database to create its 'Art Genome' algorithm, which breaks down artworks and artists into 170 different criteria. Then, working like the music radio Pandora, which predicts tastes from music chosen by users, Artsy suggests other art works similar to those users have chosen. Initially Artsy aggressively pursued content, getting as much on the site as possible, with quite a high 'burn' rate – the amount it was spending on the operation. Some internet insiders were scratching their heads about how it was actually going to turn all this ownership of art knowledge into cash.

Initially, Artsy was showing art for sale for free, collecting a percentage from galleries if a sale was made. However in 2013 it converted to a model used by some other sites, by charging a monthly subscription fee (between $400 and $1400) for gallery listings–much like renting a space in a shopping mall, but in the virtual world.

In the art market where supply is key, particularly at the higher price levels, the sites have different ways of getting the art to sell. At the lower levels, artists can put works for sale directly on to the site – for instance Saatchi Art. Moving up the scale, sites such as Artspace, Paddle8 and auction houses 'curate' their offerings, by selecting their vendors and content.

Art dealers are ambivalent about listing works of art for sale with internet firms, particularly at the top end of the market. While in theory showing inventory online should increase dealers' reach, they do not want to expose their best pieces indiscriminately. 'I don't understand why any dealer would want to put rare, important high priced works on the internet,' says one prominent New York dealer: 'The benefit of being a dealer, as opposed to an auction, is that the details around the availability, prices and ownership of these objects remain entirely private.'

Not everyone succeeds in this new market. The most spectacular failure was the VIP art fair, the first exclusively online fair to recruit pretty well all the major dealers, which launched its first edition to immense fanfare in 2011. The fair was like a 'real world' fair, with a VIP opening, limited period and the possibility of communicating directly with dealers through the site. However, the site crashed when it opened, leaving the galleries who had paid to participate absolutely fuming. A second edition solved the technical glitches but failed to produce enough sales; VIP converted to a 'lead site' and limped on into 2013 when it was quietly bought by Artspace.

Artspace, which had raised $13 million in funding by mid-2013 and boasts the Russian heiress and art collector Maria Baibakova as an investor and 'artistic director', is an e-commerce model, selling contemporary art from dealers as well as limited editions from museums, taking a cut of the proceeds. By the autumn of 2013 it had 250,000 registered users. Paddle8, which works on an auction model and has carved out a niche hosting benefit auctions as well, had $10 million in funding and reported 100,000 registered users in 2013.

The auction houses are also active in this new world, and many allow online bidders to participate in live auctions. Christie's is particularly active, and is making a major thrust into selling online in its bid to broaden its business and find new buyers: in the first half of 2012, it reported that 46 per cent of online buyers were new. It cut a $100 million deal that same year with the Andy Warhol Foundation to sell off 20,000 items from the artist's estate, some merely scraps, with most being dispersed online. The foundation had just disbanded its authentication board, saying it had better things to do with its money than to fight lawsuits, so none of the works have a certificate of authenticity, although Christie's gives a 'certificate of provenance'. The deal is not without controversy, as a few works sold through Christie's had been initially denied by the board, but then re-established as authentic.

As well as the Warhol material, Christie's is increasingly organising online-only sales of everything from watches and jewels to prints, photographs and new media, again as a way of reaching a younger clientele. These auctions generally feature mid-level material and the sales are time-limited: bidders must register in advance and pay the usual fees on top of the hammer price. Other auction houses already make the bulk of their sales online, such as Heritage Auctions in Texas, which specialises in coins and collectibles, whose sales of $878 million in 2013 make it the fifth biggest auction house in the world. Some Indian auction houses such as Saffronart operate almost exclusively on the web, as do some Chinese ones.

Selling art online brings in a new way of doing business, because of the anonymity of the transactions. If something does not sell, then no one knows and the work of art is not 'burnt', i.e. devalued by having been publicly rejected. Interestingly, this is leading to less, not greater transparency in the market, running counter to the freer access to price data the internet was supposed to foster. Couple this with the growing number of private sales by the auction houses, then comparing prices is likely to become less easy, not more so. And there is a tax issue: some auction sites do not charge sales tax, while others such as Paddle8 do. Christie's says that sales tax or VAT is charged 'based on the location of the property at the time of sale and subsequent final delivery address'.

What remains the major unknown in this brave new world is the extent to which high-end sales will migrate online. While the market for low- and mid-value works of art seems secure, the jury is still out on whether very expensive works of art will ever sell over the internet. In 2012 Christie's established a new record for a work of art sold over the internet, at almost $10 million (Edward Hopper, _October on Cape Cod_ , 1946, sold for $9.6 million, at Christie's New York, 28 November 2012). Christie's was not prepared to say whether the buyer, who was already an established client, had seen it in the 'real world' but they were in contact with a specialist and it is safe to assume that either the buyer or an agent had physically examined the work, and that the transaction was just completed online.

To what extent has the internet contributed to the growth of the art market in the twenty-first century? While the arrival of this new selling platform is certainly significant, an equally important contribution is the availability of information about prices. This has certainly facilitated the creation of multiple indices, analyses and price guides that are eagerly seized on by advisors, bankers, fund managers and so on to bolster their promotion of art as a new asset class. None of these indices are entirely satisfactory, as they only present part of the picture. They do not include dealer transactions or online sales, and more importantly, some do not take account of 'buy-ins', the works that do not find buyers. So if ten Warhols are offered for sale, nine are bought in but one triples its estimate, then performance indices could record a fine result. The other problem, notably with the Mei Moses index which is based on repeat sales, is the bias in favour of more desirable works of art. These sell more often, so skewing the figures, according to a Stanford University study.

These attempts to reduce art to the position of any other, quantifiable asset do not take account of the specificity of the art world. Part of the lure of buying art is about the environment – the pleasure of being wooed by the auction-house specialists, the fun of the fairs, rubbing shoulders with other high-octane players in the art world and the testosterone-fuelled excitement of the actual auction. Clicking away on a computer can never replicate this experience and one reason I believe that the very high end will never migrate online is that getting on your party-going Prada is just so much more fun than staying home in your pyjamas.

New Worlds, New Money

'There is a story that before the 1940s, if a letter arrived at Christie's in London with a foreign stamp, it was put directly into the bin because 'it couldn't be important'.'

François Curiel, President, Christie's Asia

_15 September 2012_. Baku, Azerbaijan. The vast white-and-gold ballroom of the newly opened Four Seasons hotel, with its faux-marble columns ending with elaborate Corinthian columns and hung with glittering crystal chandeliers was the setting for Christie's first foray into the Central Asian republic. The firm had shipped in a group of collectors, dealers and in-house specialists for a three-day visit, culminating in a black-tie dinner in the hotel. They had invited just about all the Azeri glitterati, led by members of the ruling family: the president's wife, Mehriban Aliyeva, her daughter Leyla and niece Aida Mahmudova, both glamorous socialites and inveterate travellers as well as practising artists.

Mahmudova is the founder of Yarat!, a not-for-profit art space, and earlier in the day had treated guests to a contemporary art moment. She had organised an art show in a half-destroyed building where the visitors picked their way cautiously across the crumbling concrete floors to see the work of 19 young Azeri artists, from a sculpture of brooms by Ali Hasanov to woven carpets with the pattern melted into long streams by Faig Ahmed. At lunch beside the Caspian Sea, guests were seated among the Christie's representatives, including Viscount Linley, the firm's UK chairman who chatted amiably to the guests.

Later that day local ambassadors mingled with art collectors, dealers and even French film star Gérard Depardieu – at the time making a film in the country – at the pre-dinner preview of works of art, brought by Christie's as a taster from its upcoming sales in Dubai, London and New York. In a jumble of styles and dates, the exhibition featured a seventeenth-century Caucasian Dragon carpet, a Tamara de Lempicka portrait, a Farhad Moshiri painting of a ceramic and an eighteenth-century French landscape as well as works by international brand names Warhol, Hirst and Richter. But the centrepiece of the display was Picasso's _Femme au Chien_ , a flaccid work in pastel blue and grey, one of six the artist painted between 1961 and 1962 of his wife Jacqueline and their Afghan hound Kaboul. This was due to be auctioned in New York later in the year, with an estimate of $5 million to $7 million (the painting sold for $6,354,500 at Christie's New York on 7 November 2012). Aliyeva and her daughter Leyla, both in midnight-blue long gowns, posed either side of it for the photographer. Christie's specialists, from the Islamic art scholar Dr Amin Jaffer to modern and Impressionist art department deputy chairman Andreas Rumbler, were on hand to talk visitors through the works on view. And after everyone had settled around the candlelit tables, Lord Linley welcomed them to Christie's first event there: 'We will be back again, but bigger and better,' he promised.

Flushed with oil money, Azerbaijan has been galloping to catch up with the West, and as the British ambassador Peter Bateman commented during the Christie's dinner: 'The country was isolated for so long under the Soviet Union, but now has clear aspirations to enjoy the good things of life, including Western art and culture'. This particularly applies to its luxury-goods industry. The capital Baku – which has unkindly been dubbed 'Dubai on the Caspian' – is acquiring all the brand-name shops, while extravagant hotels are being thrown up. The country, or at least its rulers, see culture and art as an entrée to a sophisticated, international lifestyle, and evidence of that is the Zaha Hadid-designed cultural centre, a massive, sinuous white construction housing the Aliyeva Foundation museum, an auditorium and conference halls, inaugurated in 2012 and costing an estimated $300 million. The foundation funded an exhibition of Azeri art, _Fly to Baku_ , which toured around Europe, including stops in London, Vienna, Rome and Moscow, between 2011 and 2013. As a sign of the blurring of luxury goods and art, its curator, Hervé Mikaeloff, is also consultant to Louis Vuitton projects.

For the moment, Azerbaijan and its neighbour Kazakhstan, both awash with oil wealth, are tadpoles in the art market – Azerbaijan, according to United Nations figures, imported less than $500,000 worth of art in 2012. But their tiny, wealthy, ruling cliques have multiple homes and are potential buyers of art for their planned museums – as well as high-value jewellery and watches. Which is why the auction houses are so busy wooing them.

### GROWTH ECONOMIES: THE MOTOR OF THE MARKET

The appearance of the emerging economies (or growth economies, as they are often now called) in the art market from the mid-1990s onwards has been a key element in its transformation into the burgeoning growth industry it is today. And while these economies were decelerating in 2013, their dramatic first phase of growth in the first decade of the twenty-first century drove up prices and brought in swathes of new money, bringing art from around the world into what was then a US-EU dominated axis, and introducing a new breed of buyer whose tastes, behaviour and motivations were often very different from those the art world had known before. These new economies have spawned growing numbers of mega-wealthy people, whose fortunes continue to increase even if their home economies are slowing – and they are among those who are driving prices for a small group of 'international brand names' to such high levels today.

_Forbes_ magazine started listing the world's richest people in 1987, when there were 140 billionaires worth a total of $295 billion, with the US, Japan, West Germany, the UK and Hong Kong the main countries on the list. Compare this with 2013, when _Forbes_ counted 1,426 billionaires worth $5.4 trillion, coming from 58 different countries including Kazakhstan, Belize and even tiny St Kitts and Nevis. Other estimates put the numbers even higher: 2,170 billionaires worth $6.5 trillion according to a WealthX report.

Back in 2004, after selling the first painting to make over $100 million at auction – Picasso's Rose period _Garçon à la Pipe_ , 1905, Sotheby's auctioneer Tobias Meyer was emphatic. 'It has taken 14 years to shatter the previous record of $82.5 million [paid for Van Gogh's _Portrait of Dr Gachet_ ] in 1990. It will take less time for this record to be broken,' he predicted, saying that with the end of communism in Russia, and the shift to a more market-focused economy in China, 'We are just seeing the beginning of incredible growth in art prices.'

Meyer was not wrong. In 2011, the all-time record for any work of art – even adjusting for inflation – is believed to have been set when Cézanne's _The Card Players_ , 1892–3, sold for a reported $250 million to Qatar. And even when colossal prices were set by collectors from the US or Europe, it was often because bidding from emerging economies drove them up to the new levels.

Until the late twentieth century, the art market was dominated by the US (46 per cent in 1990, according to McAndrew), the UK (23 per cent) and France (17 per cent, a share that has regularly fallen since then to about 6 per cent in 2013). The market was not only mainly in the US and Europe, it was also dominated by American and European artists until about 2004, when Chinese and Indian artists started making inroads into the price charts. Then after 2004 contemporary Chinese art exploded, driven mainly by foreign buyers, and by 2006 the Chinese artists Zhang Xiaogang, Yue Minjun and Zeng Fanzhi were among the top-ten grossing contemporary artists.

Acquiring art tends to stand at the top of the pyramid of needs. After the prestige cars, diamond-encrusted watches, vast house and luxury yacht, comes the desire to own something that others do not have and cannot have: a trophy work of art. In this there is little difference from the motivations of the American 'robber barons' of the nineteenth century, who the renowned dealer Joseph Duveen so cannily persuaded that owning a work of art would enhance their social status.

Newly wealthy nations have always wanted art and the pattern has often been repeated. In the early twentieth century, for example, Japanese buyers entered the market with a vengeance as the country started catching up on its 250 years of isolation. Among notable collectors was the wealthy ship-owner, Prince Matsukata Kōjirō (1865–1950), who rampaged through artists' studios, galleries and auction rooms, buying up thousands of works of art for a projected museum. In 1922 the _New York Herald_ referred to him as a 'mysterious Japanese' who had 'been buying at extravagant prices all sorts of valuable pictures, tapestries, potteries, etc.' But the 1920s depression put an end to his collecting, and most of his holdings were dispersed.

Japan again entered the market during the super-heated years of its 'bubble economy', 1986–91, when the country went on a prolonged art-buying spree. But it turned out that many of the Impressionist artworks that had been bid to the stars during this time were being used for tax evasion: when this became public, art buying stopped suddenly and dramatically, sending the market into a prolonged slump in the early 1990s. And Japan itself, mired in decades-long recession, has never come back into the art market in a significant way.

Each market is different: some have long artistic and collecting traditions that were suppressed under communism or during the upheavals of the twentieth century – the dictatorships in Latin America, for example. Other countries, notably in the Gulf, did not have that tradition. However, the pattern of collecting art tends to be similar in most growth economies. Buyers generally start by collecting art from their own country, often from the nineteenth century, before moving on to their own contemporary artists; they then make the leap to buying international contemporary art. This leap is often facilitated by art fairs as they reach into new territories (see Chapter 5) and is also influenced by the rain-makers in the country, such as Eugenio López in Mexico or Bernardo Paz in Brazil, whose collections spark others to follow them in their choices.

According to Paul Hewitt, managing director for growth markets for Christie's, the move into art often follows the same pattern. '[Emerging economies] might be invited to or asked to have a pavilion at the Venice Biennale and/or the lead galleries of the country might then start to exhibit in the international art fairs,' he says. 'Then their key collectors begin to go onto international acquisition committees and then you start to see dialogue between the collectors, the patrons and people of those countries with their equivalent numbers in other countries: that is pretty much the case in the Middle East and in India.'

The creation of these committees is a good indication of how the emerging economies' art is being endorsed and given an international profile. Tate, for instance has committees for Latin American art (launched 2002), Asia-Pacific (2007), Middle East and North Africa (2009), Africa (2011), South Asia and Russia and Eastern Europe (2012). In New York, the Museum of Modern Art C-MAP research group has a global reach and has groups focusing on Latin America, Fluxus and experimental practice in Eastern and Central Europe, and performance art in Asia. In Paris the Centre Pompidou has an 'international circle' with a Latin American group, although it is less structured than Tate's.

These international acquisition committees have both bolstered and created new markets for art, as museums strive to be more inclusive and show art from around the world, not just from their own regions. They are also a clever way of acquiring art for little investment, as the members of the committees generally are well-heeled collectors who contribute both works of art and cash. At Tate, acquisition committee members donate £10,000 each per year, and may give more in cash or as support for exhibitions. The committees can include a few dozen members, so the amount garnered each year is substantial, particularly as the art from some countries may not (yet) be expensive. Eugenio López, founder of the Jumex Foundation in Mexico, who is vice chair of the board of trustees of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, contributes $500,000 every year to the institution, but he says, 'It is important to have someone from Mexico on museum boards.'  And for some members of these acquisition committees, the chance to valorise their own holdings may well be an added attraction.

While in some growth economies such as in Latin America, India or Turkey there was a thriving domestic art scene, with collectors, local artists and art galleries, in communist or former communist countries (China, Russia) the notion of an art market was virtually inexistent or controlled by the government. This lead to artists being employed by the state and 'official' art being the only sanctioned work, even if there was an underground movement.

The situation in the Gulf countries (essentially Qatar and the United Arab Emirates) was different: they have tiny national populations and until recently no art schools or museums. In addition painting was not central to the region's cultural traditions, and the Islamic unease with the figurative further hampered artistic practice. But it would be wrong to imagine that there was no local art or collecting: the Qatar Fine Arts Society was founded in the early 1980s, and in the country Middle Eastern and Arab artists have been collected since the 1990s by a member of the ruling family, Sheikh Hassan bin Mohamed bin Ali Al Thani. Most are now in the Mathaf Arab Museum of Modern Art. Middle Eastern buyers have traditionally also been very interested in Orientalist painting – rather curiously, since these are very figurative and often racy, with barely clad, swooning odalisques and so on. Qatar possesses an extensive Orientalist collection and an Orientalist museum, although this does not yet have a permanent home. Sharjah, one of the seven emirates in the UAE, founded its own biennial as early as 1993.

Museum patronage in all the growth economies has been key to the explosion of interest in contemporary art; in some countries, such as Azerbaijan, Qatar, Singapore, Hong Kong and the UAE, museums are state funded; in many other countries – Russia, China, India, Turkey and Indonesia, for example – private patronage has been filling a gap, since these countries did not have virtually any museums of contemporary art. Mexico and Brazil already had a good museum infrastructure to which private collectors have added their own spaces.

It is impossible within the scope of this book to examine all the growth economies, but the following case studies look more closely at some of the most significant players: China, the hubs of Hong Kong and Singapore, India, the Gulf and Russia.

### THE ASIAN TIGER ROARS: CHINA

The most stunning demonstration of the transformation of the art market in the twenty-first century is China, with the appearance of its contemporary artists, its buying prowess and the current craze for private museums. This is a story that is still being played out: the question is whether Beijing, or Shanghai, will one day topple New York's supremacy as the world's major centre for the sale of art.

The figures are amazing: in 1990, China, including Hong Kong and Macau, represented less than 0.4 per cent of the global art-sales pie. This jogged along in the single figures until 2009, when it suddenly made an astonishing bound: 18 per cent, then 23 per cent in 2010 and 30 per cent in 2011, when it overtook both the UK and the US to become, in that year, the largest art market in the world, according to a report by Clare McAndrew, although subsequent information threw doubt upon the validity of figures reported by Chinese auction houses.

How were these figures established? They come partly from recorded auction sales in mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau, and partly from an estimate of dealer sales made by McAndrew.

What has driven these Chinese figures are the emergence of a middle class with disposable income and a top crust of highly wealthy individuals, whose fortune often comes from real estate. Their buying in turn has boosted the results of Chinese auction houses, which within a decade have come from nowhere to make a significant impact. In 2013, no less than nine Chinese auction houses figured in the top 20 in the world, according to figures published by the French Conseil des Ventes Volontaires de Meubles aux Enchères Publiques. In total, China counted 355 auction houses in 2012, according to an Artnet report.

Poly, which belongs to the army and has its own museum in Beijing, is the leading house and in 2012 established an office in New York and another in Hong Kong the following year, where it now holds auctions. Its sales in 2013 were CNY7.88 billion (around $1.3 billion). Guardian, the second largest and founded in 1993, also holds sales in Hong Kong and reported a sales total of $1.08 billion in 2013. Both only sell Chinese art, from traditional to contemporary, but are believed to be considering selling Western art in the near future.

Figures for China are notoriously unreliable and almost certainly inflated (the auction houses record sales that are never paid for, and even 'buy-ins' when a work is hammered down on the reserve without a buyer). Nevertheless, the writing is on the wall – with its 1.6 billion population and a growing middle class with disposable income, demand for art in China will continue to grow. And there is a distinct parallel here with the luxury-goods market, as Chinese consumers race to acquire all the trappings of an affluent lifestyle. However, the mainland Chinese market is handicapped by high import taxes of 24 per cent and a complex system of definition of the work of art in question that confuses even the Chinese. The opening of a free-trade zone in Shanghai is, however, encouraging dealers and auctioneers: according to Philip Dodd, who runs the cross-cultural agency Made in China, art hotels and galleries are setting up there.

China emerged as a force on the art market in 2006, when prices suddenly jumped ten-fold and values for some of the top Chinese names doubled in just a year. Top sellers were Zeng Fanzhi, Yue Minjun, Zhang Xiaogang and Chen Yifei: for example, a Zhang Xiaogang sold for over $1 million – comparable works had been under $100,000 in 2004. But the boom peaked in February 2008, and in the wake of the financial crisis prices collapsed: in 2009, the auction revenue for Zhang Xiaogang, for example, was 86 per cent lower than in 2008. Recovery was extremely rapid, with three years' continuous growth (2009–11) followed by a sharp drop in 2012, due to a slowdown in the Chinese economy. The current record for a work of art by a Chinese artist is $65.4 million at a Guardian auction in May 2011, given for _A Peaceful World_ , 1940, by the prolific artist (and faker) Qi Baishi (1864–1957). For a living Chinese artist it is $23.3 million, for Zeng Fanzhi's _The Last Supper_ , 2001, sold at Sotheby's Hong Kong on 18 October 2013.

The Chinese art buyer is distinct from those in most other growth economies (Turkey is another exception), in that they buy across the whole range of art and antiques, with particular enthusiasm for traditional goods – jades, scrolls and particularly porcelains, which can achieve quite astonishing prices – and this is what accounts for the huge figures being reported. For instance, a calligraphic work by the Song dynasty (960–1279) painter Huang Tingjian made $64 million in 2010 and porcelains particularly from the Qing period (1644–1911) can achieve immense sums. This is not necessarily good news for the Western art dealer, who wants to sell international contemporary art to the Chinese. So while the auction figures look compelling, the reality is that there are still few collectors of contemporary Western art in the country. The bulk of these sparkling totals come from Chinese art, sold by Chinese auction houses in China to Chinese people.

An example is the entrepreneur Liu Yiqian who bought the Huang Tingjian mentioned above. He and his wife Wang Wei have established two Long (or Dragon) museums in Shanghai, which display their collections of traditional, revolutionary, and modern and contemporary Chinese art. Another such museum owner is the property developer Dai Zhikang, who opened the Himalayas Art Museum in a vast shopping mall in Pudong, Shanghai, in 2013. The number of private museums 'is growing every day,' said Dai on a panel in London in 2013, explaining that collectors such as himself were key to re-establishing museums and an artistic heritage. 'We have waited 100 years for this moment. We will get the money first, and then we will get our dignity back. When China becomes the world's number one economy, Chinese works of art will become the most valuable in the world!'

However, some Chinese collectors are looking beyond their own artists, with one example being the Indonesian/Chinese collector and agricultural products magnate Budi Tek, who has added large-scale works by Adel Abdessemed, Mona Hatoum, Fred Sandback and others to his collection of Chinese artists such as Ai Weiwei, Zhang Xiaogang and Fang Lijun. They are displayed in his Yuz museum in Shanghai, which opened in 2014.

The number of museums, both private and public, planned to be opened in China is both eye-wateringly huge and certainly more aspirational than realisable. In an official report published in 2012 the Culture Ministry gave a target of providing one museum for every 250,000 people by 2020, with 20 per cent of them privately funded. That would mean 6,400 museums. But even if the figure is wildly exaggerated, there are certainly many private museums being created. Shanghai, for example, at the end of 2013 boasted no less than 12 spaces: three Zedai-owned art spaces including Shanghai Himalayas museum, MOCA, Rockbund, two Long museums, OCAT, K11, Yuz, Aurora and Minsheng. Only two existed in 2009. As we saw earlier, the country has 3,589 museums in total, 535 of them being private. However, only 2 per cent are for contemporary art and many of the museums are not for art at all – Beijing has a tap water and a tank museum, for example.

Between 2012 and 2013, both Sotheby's and Christie's obtained licences, under rather different conditions, to hold sales on the mainland. In 2012 Sotheby's signed a ten-year deal with the government's cultural arm, GeHua, to hold sales in the Beijing freeport and by agreement elsewhere. In 2013, Christie's got a licence from the Shanghai city fathers to hold sales anywhere on the mainland. Both are still barred from selling cultural relics (items made before 1911 or 1949, depending on the category) on the mainland: 'Christie's got the right to open a Chinese restaurant in China, but they are not allowed to serve Chinese food!' chuckled one commentator.

Shortly after obtaining the precious licence, Christie's owner François Pinault presented to the Chinese authorities the two Zodiac heads that had been looted from the Summer Palace during the nineteenth-century Opium Wars. They had sold for €30 million at Christie's Yves St Laurent auction in 2009 but remained unpaid, the buyer saying it was a 'patriotic gesture' not to settle up. After the failed sale, they were returned to Pierre Bergé, St Laurent's partner, who finally sold them to Pinault. Is there a connection between the gift of the heads and obtaining the licence? What is certain is that Christie's also has powerful commercial interests in the mainland because of its luxury-goods business there.

In September 2013 Christie's launched its first sale on the mainland, in the Shangri-La hotel in Shanghai, garnering $25 million for a slight catalogue that included wine, jewellery, watches and art. But while the sale was rather modest, the event was not. Christie's flew in collectors from around the world as well as 150 of its own specialists, entertaining them with cultural visits, panels, a splashy dinner hosted by François Pinault and catered by his favoured chef Pierre Gagnaire. In the same week, the Chinese authorities announced that a 29-square-mile area in Shanghai's Pudong district had become a free-trade zone, so allowing Christie's to import works of art without paying the punishing taxes.

### HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE – THE BATTLE TO BE THE HUB

Despite the growing importance of mainland China, the art sales hub of the region is Hong Kong, the territory whose special status under the 'one country, two systems' ends in 2047. Its acceptance of the capitalist system, freedom from tax and censorship, as well as its hassle-free efficiency, have made it the place of choice for auction houses Sotheby's, Christie's and Bonhams and others from Jakarta, Taiwan, Seoul and Tokyo who hold sales there twice a year. With foreign auction houses barred from selling 'cultural relics' – the most juicy of the categories that include historic material – on the mainland, Hong Kong has been the antechamber to the rest of China for almost 40 years.

However, its museum infrastructure is weak, although due to improve after 2017 when the ambitious M+ is inaugurated in the West Kowloon Cultural District, a vast area just across the bay from Hong Kong Island. Plans are afoot for conversion of an old police station into a contemporary art hub, mainly financed by the deep-pocketed Jockey Club, although there is some dissention within the club about the financing and structure of the project.

'For a long time Hong Kong didn't consider culture a priority for the government, preferring to concentrate on its business aspects,' says local dealer Jean-Marc Ducrop: 'It left culture to private initiative, notably university museums. But all this changed when its art market started developing at the end of the twentieth century and "cultural tourism" grew. And the fact that Singapore made art and culture a priority certainly stimulated Hong Kong to change its policy as well.'

Singapore is, indeed, desperate to snatch some of the art business from Hong Kong and to that end has been investing massively in museums. It is building a new National Art Gallery, boasting 60,000 square metres and costing S$532 million (£274 million), which is set to open in 2015, and has converted Gilman, a series of small former barracks, into a complex of art galleries. According to Singapore Cultural Statistics 2012, the number of museums doubled between 2005 and 2011 – there are now 56 such institutions. And there is a state-of-the-art freeport within the precincts of the airport for storing valuables in total discretion, where owners can visit their gold or Nan Goldins (see Chapter 8).

The stability, safety and discretion of Singapore have led to it being dubbed 'the Switzerland of Asia'. It has an art fair – Art Stage Singapore – held in January every year in the behemoth casino/hotel/leisure facility, Sands Bay, and more in preparation. Even so, it is in no way the challenger to Hong Kong, which boasts the major international art fair of the region, started in May 2008 as ArtHK, which is now heavily 're-branded' as a Basel event. In 2013 it attracted most of the leading art dealers of the world, as well as major collectors from the whole region: Australia, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as mainland China. This fair has grown very fast under the Basel banner, and there is some question as to whether it has outgrown its market. In 2013 sales were patchy, excellent for some, particularly those selling known 'brand names' such as Yoshitomo Nara, but non-existent for others (Dominique Levy of New York took home her display of Warhol dollar signs).

Few think Singapore will succeed in its challenge to Hong Kong. As the Malaysian gallerist Valentine Willie told the _Straits Times_ : 'Hong Kong is just where the action is . . . The EDB [Singapore's Economic Development Board] of all agencies should understand basic economics: you can't manufacture demand.'

### INDIA – THE UGLY DUCKLING?

As one of the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) nations, and with a burgeoning population of 1.2 billion (2011 census) and a growing middle class, India should be the natural challenger to China. It has a growing group of affluent consumers – what McKinsey and Co calls 'the global Indians' – businessmen, landowners and high-end professionals, who represent some 1.2 million households. And, says McKinsey, 'a new breed of ferociously upwardly mobile Indians is emerging [whose tastes] are indistinguishable from those of prosperous young Westerners.' By 2025, McKinsey predicts there will be 9.5 million Indians in this class. More significantly, the number of ultra-rich Indians has grown sharply this century – _Forbes_ listed 55 billionaires in 2013.

Since the economic liberalisation in 1991, which brought huge inward investment, newly rich Indians have been enthusiastically buying yachts, houses and other luxury products. And yet the Indian art market has stubbornly underperformed compared to China. Data on art imports from the United Nations in 2012 (the last year when complete figures were available) put these at just $61 million, whereas China in the same year imported art to the tune of some $2.5 billion.

According to the London dealer Conor Macklin of the Grosvenor Vadehra Gallery: 'The Indian market is still too small – it needs more good galleries in Mumbai and Delhi, but also more activity in the other major cities such as Bangalore, Hyderabad, Calcutta. But the appetite for art is growing along with the size of the middle class, and I believe in its future.' He says, 'Indians buy Indian art, and Indian artists are undervalued in relation to China, or to their American, European peers,' adding that international museum shows such as the V.S. Gaitonde travelling show at the Guggenheim (24 October 2014–11 February 2015) are also stimulating interest.

Indian buyers split into resident and non-residents (NRIs), although the very wealthiest live the typical billionaires' lifestyle with multiple homes in different countries. Many NRIs are based in California, Singapore and Hong Kong. While the older and more traditional collectors pulled back from the market after the financial crisis, a younger demographic – who largely view art as an alternative asset – has been lively and active.

The Indian art market only really came into the spotlight after 2000, with Sotheby's sale in New York of the Chester and Davida Herwitz collection on 5 December 2000, which offered 193 lots of Indian art, making $1.38 million. The same year also saw two auction houses launched: Saffronart and Osians. Auction buyers were mainly NRIs, with residents not buying in international sales.

In 2004, the splashiest gallery India had ever seen opened: Bodhi Art. During its five-year existence, Bodhi inaugurated spaces in Delhi, Singapore, New York and Berlin, and trawled in leading artists – among them Anju Dodiya, Atul Dodiya, Jitish Kallat, Subodh Gupta and Shilpa Gupta – while wooing clients with expensive dinners at restaurants around the world. But it all ended with the financial crisis in 2008, and Bodhi closed down.

Without state patronage, it has been left to private collectors to start their own museums. Foremost among them are Kiran Nadar and the mother-and-son duo Lekha and Anupam Poddar. Both Nadar and the Poddars have established private art spaces in Delhi to show contemporary art. A newer arrival is the 'sugar baroness' of the south, Rajshree Pathy, who was due to open the Coimbatore Center for Contemporary Art (CoCCA) in Tamil Nadu in 2014. There are a few other small initiatives such as that of Sangita Jindal, who publishes the magazine _Arts India_ and is planning a small private space in Mumbai.

The problem is that government support for culture is non-existent, with social and economic issues more pressing. Art education is also notable by its absence. Unlike in China, which has made culture a 'pillar industry' and gives land free for the construction of private museums, there is no government help for private initiatives in India. And Indian buyers tend to be very domestically focused: when they say they buy international names, they often mean Anish Kapoor or Raqib Shaw.

The leading local auction house Saffronart only held online auctions until 2013, when it, as well as the Mumbai auction house Pundoles and Christie's, started live sales in Mumbai. 'These sessions all brought in new buyers in the country, whereas previous buyers were mostly NRIs,' said Macklin. 'The auction houses' strategy is working – in emerging economies collectors need to be seen buying, and they often like to be seen as well.'

Indians have a tradition of investing in tangible assets – gold being particularly favoured – and art became, in the boom years 2004–8, the hottest new investment. Sales of modern and contemporary art hit twin peaks in 2006 and 2008 when $144 million and $145 million worth respectively were sold at auction. For example, in 2008 a painting of pots and pans by Subodh Gupta sold for over $1 million. According to Macklin, stock exchange trading would actually slow down while traders followed Saffronart's online auctions. A number of art funds were started, with most hitting the market between 2006 and 2008; at the time, the online site Livemint estimated that they jointly raised about RS300 million ($440 million). By buying heavily into the market for Indian contemporary art they pushed prices up sharply, but because they were mainly funds with a short 'lock-in' period of 36 months, the financial crisis of 2008–9 had a dramatic effect. Prices dropped by 67 per cent in a year; a comparable painting by Gupta to the one noted above now fetches little more than $300,000 – and many offered for auction have been bought in. Some funds folded; the biggest, Osians, has been in dispute with the Indian authorities, having been barred by the Securities and Exchange Board of India from accessing capital markets until its investment schemes were wound up and money refunded to investors.

The result has continued to depress prices for contemporary artists and hit confidence among buyers. The market for the Moderns and Progressives has fared much better, although it also dropped in the wake of 2008.

Much has been written about India being the 'new China' as far as the market is concerned. But whether in the domestic market, with its high taxes (12 per cent on art sales, depending on the city, and 15 per cent on imported art), inwardly focused collectors and lack of government interest and support, or in the international market, where buyers still tend to go for their own artists, the country is certainly not ready yet to step into that position.

### DESERT GOLD: QATAR

A British protectorate until 1971, the tiny state of Qatar – just 4,400 square miles, slightly smaller than the state of Connecticut in the US – boasts the highest per capita income in the world, with over $100,000 for its 1.9 million inhabitants, and GDP of $183 billion, thanks to oil and particularly gas revenues. Just some 11 per cent of the population consists of Qatari nationals, and most of the rest are poorly paid migrants, some working in conditions of near slavery. Unlike in the UAE, artists have not protested over these labour problems.

Between the late 1990s and 2005, the biggest buyer of art in the world was Sheikh Saud bin Muhammed Al Thani, a cousin of the then ruler, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. During a frenetic buying spree, which lasted some eight years, Sheikh Saud – extremely slender, long-haired and with a small moustache – disposed of apparently bottomless funds both for his own art purchases and for those of the state. As the president of the National Council for Culture, Arts and Heritage (NCCAH), he was driving forward an incredibly ambitious programme of building and collecting for five cultural institutions for Qatar's capital Doha. Top architects were hired to design them: I.M. Pei for the Museum of Islamic Arts (MIA), Arata Isozaki for a National Library, a futuristic project standing on three huge columns; Santiago Calatrava for a Photography Museum, a building with two immense 'wings' which could open and close like a lens. A National Museum and a Museum of Traditional Clothes completed the 'wish-list' quintet.

To fill these institutions, Sheikh Saud swept like a whirlwind through the art market in an astonishing spending spree that was almost surreal in its eclecticism: Islamic art, of course, but also photographs, cameras, natural history specimens, art-deco furniture, books, Roman glass, a Fabergé egg, jewellery, a Roman statue auctioned from a British stately home, antiquities, vintage cars and a massive collection of vintage bicycles. Those who worked with him recounted how he would fly around the world in his private jet, dealer in tow, visiting private collectors and bagging entire collections on the spot. This is how, for example, he acquired the Bokelberg group of photographs and the Spira collection of cameras. A partial inventory established in 2005 put the value of his holdings at over $365 million; press reports have claimed he had spent over £1 billion.

However, in 2005 Sheikh Saud was suddenly removed from his position, disgraced and briefly imprisoned for alleged misappropriation of some $500 million. His collections in Qatar – there was always doubt about what was his, and what was intended for the museums – were impounded. All the museum projects, except the MIA, were halted, and the NCCAH eventually became the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA). While the inner workings of the Qatari court have never been fully elucidated – why, for example, was he suddenly disgraced after years of buying? – evidence obtained by _The Art Newspaper_ showed that he, and the Islamic art dealer Oliver Hoare, had been involved in producing grossly inflated invoices, multiplying prices by a factor of five when items were transferred to the Qatari state. Sheikh Saud has now been pardoned and is buying again for himself, but apparently has left swathes of unpaid bills for art purchases, according to dealers.

The affair only put a temporary halt to buying by the Qatari state, and a new Al Thani emerged as the world's biggest art buyer. Sheikh Saud's cousin Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, sister of the current emir, chair of the QMA, has been spending as lavishly as her predecessor. This time, however, the thrust is towards modern and contemporary art, but the buying has followed similar patterns: she, either for the family or for the state, it is not clear, swoops on individual works or whole collections before they come to the market. The extent of Qatari buying was revealed in _The Art Newspaper_ in 2011 and while no purchase has ever been confirmed, the collection is reliably believed to include the $250 million Cézanne, _The Card Players_ , 1892–3; the 'Merkin Rothkos', a group of 11 works by the artist worth $310 million; works by Lichtenstein and Koons from the estate of art dealer Ileana Sonnabend worth an estimated $400 million, as well as the 'Rockefeller' Rothko, _White Center (Yellow, Pink and Lavender on Rose)_ , 1950, bought at Sotheby's New York on 15 May 2007 for $72.8 million. There is a rumour, unconfirmed but not specifically denied, that Qatar approached cosmetics heir Leonard Lauder in an attempt to buy his $1 billion collection of Cubist works – a group that his public relations consultant says he always intended to donate to New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, which he did in 2013. Qatar never comments on acquisitions but has been identified as the buyer for many major art purchases in the last decade – something that is certainly exaggerated, as the market counts many other deep-pocketed buyers. A case in point was the sale of Edvard Munch's _The Scream_ , 1895, which sold for a record-breaking (at the time) $119.9 million at Sotheby's New York on 3 May 2012. Until financier Leon Black was revealed as the buyer, 'the desert', as insiders often refer to Qatar, was rumoured as its destination.

Published figures maintain that Qatar was spending up to $1 billion a year on art in 2013. There are also persistent but unverifiable rumours that Qatar is engaged in the art market by giving guarantees – notably for Koons' _Balloon Dog_ , which sold for a record price for a living artist in 2013 (see Chapter 1).

The QMA has sponsored exhibitions outside the country, notably Murakami at Versailles in 2010 and Hirst at London's Tate in 2012, the latter to the tune of $3.2 million. Both artists were then given massive exhibitions in Doha, Murakami in 2012 and Hirst in 2013. For this Hirst brought the diamond-studded skull, _For the Love of God_ , 2007, as well as making his largest ever shark in formaldehyde. Outside an as-yet unfinished medical centre, he placed _The Miraculous Journey_ , 14 giant bronze sculptures showing an embryo from conception to birth. The series, conceived in 2005 and which took three years to make, cost $20 million.

Qatar is conservative, and not used to seeing much figurative art; naked antique statues brought from Athens for an exhibition about the Olympics in 2013, for instance, were quickly removed, leaving empty plinths. While Sheikha Al Mayassa seems determined to change the traditional mindset in the country, 'cultural sensitivities' mean that there is censorship. For instance, the Murakami exhibition in 2012 had none of his more extreme sculptures such as _Miss ko2_ with her gargantuan breasts, or _My Lonesome Cowboy_ , clutching a lasso of sperm from his erect penis.

A persistent rumour maintains that Qatar is interested in buying the auction house Christie's. Like the Loch Ness monster, this story regularly raises its head and then disappears – at least according to the auction house. The rumours were fuelled by the fact that some former Christie's people went to work in Qatar, notably Edward Dolman, former British CEO who headed Sheikha Al Mayassa's private office between 2011 and 2014 before going to Phillips, and Jean-Paul Engelen, head of public art programmes. Guy Bennett, former co-head of Christie's Impressionist and modern art department, is widely believed to buy for Qatar. Other specialists are buzzing around as well – the French curator Hubert Bari, who once worked with Sheikh Saud, has been buying pearls and jewellery, for a planned museum to be established in Al Wakrah, a recreational and commercial area being developed in a former pearling village near Doha.

What puzzles outsiders is where the contemporary and modern art acquisitions are headed, since there are no apparent plans to build a museum for them. While Dolman has said that some spectacular museums will be unveiled in time for the 2022 World Cup, none so far have been designated as being devoted to this field. In Qatar three museums have opened so far: MIA, Mathaf Arab Museum of Modern Art, housed in a former school building, and the Al Riwaq centre, a boxy, warehouse-looking art space close to MIA. A National Museum is currently under construction, designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel, but is not apparently destined to show international art. It may simply be that the royal family is acquiring the art to decorate its multiple residences, which include a 17-bedroom house in London's Park Lane.

It is therefore surprising that an art market virtually does not exist in the tiny state. Sotheby's has held a few auctions in Doha – in 2008, 2010 and one of contemporary art in 2013, although many of the lots in this sale were acquired by European and American bidders. There are no art fairs of note and the gallery scene is almost non-existent. The Dubai-based Third Line gallery briefly had an outpost in Doha but this closed after 18 months of activity, in 2010. 'We found that there was hardly any audience for buying art there, outside the royal family,' says its director Sunny Rahbar.

In 2013, the crown prince, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, became, at the age of 33, the new Emir after the abdication of his father. Interested more in sport than culture, he was rumoured to be concerned by the high level of spending by the QMA, and its series of costly exhibitions which attract few visitors compared to the resources put into them: the Adel Abdessemed show at Mathaf, for example, had attracted just 2,000 visitors after two months. One sign of cost-cutting came at the end of 2013, when a planned natural history museum was put on hold. Certainly, if one day Qatar stops buying so extravagantly, it will have a massive effect on the global art market. As New York dealer David Nash told the _New York Times_ : 'When they [the Qataris] finish their buying program and withdraw from the market they will leave a big hole which I don't see anyone else ready to fill at their level.'

### ABU DHABI

While Qatar has been the biggest spender in the last five years, the UAE was initially seen as the potentially most important player in the art market in the region, because of a highly ambitious museum-building programme. The UAE, with 5.5 million inhabitants, has immense revenues from energy resources; Abu Dhabi, the largest and richest of the seven emirates that make up the state, is the leader and is driving forward a $27 billion plan started in 2004 to develop Saadiyat Island, including establishing five cultural institutions designed by leading architects. At the time the island was a little-developed sand flat but by 2013 it was transformed by the addition of a golf course, luxury hotels and residential complexes.

The 2008–9 financial crisis jolted the initial fervour, plans were scaled back and completion dates were postponed, and some doubt remains about whether all of the initial projects will be completed. Certainly going ahead is the Louvre Abu Dhabi, designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel (planned to open on 2 December 2015) and the Sheikh Zayed National Museum (Norman Foster; completion 2016). The immense Guggenheim Abu Dhabi (Frank Gehry; completion 2017) has proved more problematic, with persistent rumours that it will never see the light of day as well as opposition from artists concerned about the working conditions for the labourers. These concerns have not been totally resolved.

Art dealers inevitably see the Louvre and Guggenheim as honey-pots and have been buzzing around the region for the last few years, as have some artists. Jeff Koons – family in tow – attended the 2009 edition of Abu Dhabi Art, an art fair that is organised by the cultural authorities; the normally reticent dealer Larry Gagosian even spoke on a panel the same year. He sent his 'private' collection (i.e. works of art for sale) to the emirate in 2010 for an exhibition entitled _RSTW_ , which stood for the five artists shown: Rauschenberg, Ruscha, Serra, Twombly, Warhol and Wool.

The curious thing about all this that there is essentially a single major buyer, the royal family, notably Sheikha Salama bint Hamdan Al Nahyan, the wife of the crown prince, and a few other members of the family, including her daughter Sheikha Maryam and Sheikha Shamsa, who is married to the crown prince's brother.

Buying for the Louvre Abu Dhabi is in the hands of a committee run by the specially formed Agence France-Museums. But there has been trouble in paradise: the €1 billion, 30-year agreement between the emirate and the French state to start up and supply the institution proved problematic, with the Emiratis complaining that France did not fulfil some of its promises and that the agency was spending too much on expenses. The composition of the Agence was changed in 2013, amid promises that things would improve. As for the Guggenheim, some acquisitions have been announced and commissions are expected, but nothing massive has yet been made public.

On the basis of these projects, for two years art dealers agreed to exhibit at Abu Dhabi Art, on inconvenient dates in November between Frieze, Fiac and Art Basel Miami Beach, on the implied basis that they would be rewarded one day. They sat for hours among the artificial palm trees in the gloomy basement of the Emirates Palace Hotel waiting for the Sheikha and her entourage to sweep in and – hope against hope! – decide to buy something. Some were upset by the bargaining style of the Sheikha's advisors, who came in on the last day demanding huge discounts, knowing that dealers would be loath to go back home without a single sale. Some dealers gave up on the project and ceased exhibiting: 'I wasn't going to wait in my booth until 2 am to pander to some spoilt, arrogant local princess,' said one. Many of these grievances have been solved and the fair is now held on Saadiyat Island itself, but as an essentially artificial creation, it is still struggling to find a genuine raison d'être.

### DUBAI

Apart from the art fair – which is based, as we have seen, on one major buyer – Abu Dhabi has no local art market, with very few galleries. This is not the case in Dubai, which does have a gallery scene and a valid art fair, Art Dubai, held in March, which puts the emphasis on artists and galleries from the greater MENASA (Middle East, North Africa and South Asia) region.

The local auction market is weak. Christie's has held sales of modern, contemporary and Middle Eastern and Arab art in Dubai since 2006; Bonhams held sales in Dubai between 2008 and 2011, when it abandoned them. Christie's sales peaked in 2008 with over $20 million sold in its May sale, and then declined to around $6 million or even less: in an attempt to bolster them, lower value lots were added in 2013, and the sales did better, raising just over $10.5 million (excluding watches).

Christie's local director Michael Jeha says that the investment in the region is justified as the sales bring in clients for sales elsewhere, despite the low level of turnover. Paul Hewitt points out that the local sales maintain and develop relationships with local buyers for non-art purchases, such as high-value jewellery and watches.

There has been much debate about the reasons for the interest in art and particularly museum building in the Gulf, and much cynicism about the motives and aims, as well as debate about for whom these museums are intended. Officially, in both Qatar and the UAE, the line is that these new institutions are 'for the people': they promote cultural dialogue and build bridges between nations, and so on. Qatar has a 2030 'Vision' plan which looks towards the time when hydrocarbon resources eventually run out; Abu Dhabi is also looking to when oil revenues decrease and it will have to find other sources of income. The burgeoning populations in India and Asia, for which the Gulf is a transport and trading hub, are where these countries are looking for clients and visitors, and the museums are part of the cultural offer they are building.

### FROM THE STEPPES: RUSSIA AND THE CIS COUNTRIES

Russian buying has been one of the most significant forces in the art market since the fall of communism, and indeed even before 1990 the auction houses were wooing buyers. Simon de Pury recounts how he held the first art auction in Moscow since the 1917 revolution:

It was in 1988, I was with Sotheby's, and we cut a deal with the Ministry of Culture to sell work by Russian artists: we sold 119 works from Varvara Stepanova and Alexander Rodchenko to Ilya Kabakov. It was a huge gamble as to whether we could pull it off. Just before we started, none of the phones were working: going on to the podium was like walking up to the guillotine – if it was a success it would be everyone else's idea and if it was a disaster my head would be on the block! Then suddenly all the phones started to work, and the sale was a huge success.

Even so, the experiment was not repeated, says de Pury: 'The Russians were just spectators then – the buyers were all American or European: now, of course, it's the other way around.'

Paul Hewitt, who looks after growth markets at Christie's, came into the art world, significantly, from the luxury-goods business. 'We had been bubbling along in Russia for quite a long time, with representatives in St Petersburg – but we didn't really see the explosion of Russian client interest in the international sales until after 2007,' he says. At first, as often with new collectors, their enthusiasm was initially for their own artists – the online site Art Market Research (AMR) shows that the market for Ivan Konstantinovich Aivazovsky (1870–1900), famed for his sunlit seascapes in the Crimea, peaked in September 2008 with an index of 74,036 (from a base of 1,000 in 1976). Overall, a 'basket' of 100 Russian artists also saw their highest point in the same year; since then, the market for Russian artists has declined.

Unusually, the auction market for Russian art is not dominated by Christie's and Sotheby's. The London- and Moscow-based MacDougall's is also a player in this field, holding two sales a year in London. In 2013, Sotheby's, Christie's and MacDougall's totalled $63.8 million, $53.8 million and $28.7 million respectively for sales of Russian art – sale values that are not growing.

This does not mean that Russians have stopped buying. The big buyers – what the trade calls the whales, as in the gambling world – moved rapidly into the international arena, and in so doing have largely bypassed their own contemporary art, unlike in other growth markets.

Russians, flush with cash from oil and other resources obtained during the great grab of the 1990s, have been avid buyers of Impressionist and modern works, and international contemporary brand names, particularly from about 2007 onwards. 'When I joined Christie's in 2005,' says its former director in Russia, Sandra Nedvetskaia, 'About 99 per cent of my Russian clients were buying Fabergé and nineteenth-century paintings, but I worked to change their collecting habits and soon they started taking an interest in international contemporary art.'

The London-based billionaire Roman Abramovich is known for some high-profile art purchases, including Francis Bacon's _Triptych_ , 1976, Lucian Freud's _Benefits Supervisor Sleeping_ , 1995, as well as an archive of Ilya Kabakov works. Alfa Bank chairman Piotr Aven is a committed collector, particularly of the avant-garde Jack of Diamonds group. Other Russian buyers, working through agents, have been active in the saleroom, but remain more difficult to identify.

Paradoxically, Russian buying has not followed the usual pattern of collecting as in other growth economies. 'Up to this point in time [in 2013], support by Russians for contemporary Russian art is almost conspicuous by its absence,' says Hewitt. A sign of the weakness of this scene was when art galleries in Moscow – notably Aidan, Marat Guelman and XL and particularly those grouped in the Winzavod Centre – started converting to non-commercial models in 2013, while the not-for-profit art space in the Red October Chocolate Factory was shuttered by contemporary art dealer Vladimir Ovcharenko, who also closed his London outlet of Regina Gallery.

'Is this weakness because of the quality of art being made, or because the environment is unsuitable, or because of lack of support from patrons? Perhaps at this moment in the aspirational circle of those who collect art, what is being produced internationally is of greater relevance, appeal and allure to Russian patrons,' says Hewitt. William MacDougall of MacDougall's Auctions explains: 'Russians in Russia tend to collect traditional works of art, while those already in the West tend to collect international contemporary art. In both cases peer emulation is at play. Contemporary Russian art seems to have fallen into a gap between the two.' However, Nedvetskaia left Christie's in 2013 to start a new art fair in Moscow, saying that there was indeed a new market for contemporary art in the capital, and that she was also hoping to encourage international buyers to take more interest in Russian contemporary art.

While Russia has many major museums for traditional art, contemporary art is more poorly served. The state-funded institutions are a National Centre for Contemporary Culture, the Moscow Museum of Modern Art and a Multimedia Art Museum. As in other growth economies, private patronage is growing, notably the Garage Centre for Contemporary Art (GCCA), founded in 2007 by Dasha Zhukova, Abramovich's partner. Other art spaces have been founded by oligarch's wife Stella Kesaeva and the Russian construction magnate Vladimir Seminikhin, with his wife Ekaterina.

Some other former Soviet Union members, now part of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), are rapidly getting into the game, and being extensively wooed by auction houses in particular. In Ukraine, the pipe magnate Victor Pinchuk has been a major buyer, often through White Cube, for works by Hirst, Koons, Gursky and Murakami among others.

THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON

An Unregulated and Opaque Market

'Some in the art world desire a market that is neither open nor honest.'

Judge William H. Pauley III

'Art's an expensive business these days. After drug dealing and prostitution it's the biggest unregulated market in the world – except that it doesn't make as much money as either of them . . .' jokes Matthew Carey-Williams of White Cube. But while the market has gained the reputation for being unregulated, this is entirely not true: there is a whole raft of rules, from contract law, consumer legislation and export bars to bidding practices that frame the art trade both for auctioneers and dealers, and which vary from country to country. What is true is that the market lacks any oversight through a supervisory body, either statutory, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the US or the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK for the finance industry, or a self-regulating trade body such as Britain's Press Complaints Commission.

Auction houses are quick to point out that they function under a number of rules, depending on the country in which they operate. France regulates its _commissaire priseurs_ (auctioneers) very tightly through a body called the Conseil des Ventes Volontaires de Meubles aux Enchères Publiques, and imposes penalties for transgressions. In the US, auction houses point to an 11-page document issued by the New York City government with rules governing a wide range of elements – from reserves to quirkier aspects ('Every article sold or exposed for sale at public auction, in any street or public place, shall be removed therefrom by sunset on the day of such sale or display'). Despite, this, in the US there have also been persistent but so far unsuccessful attempts to ban the practice of so-called 'chandelier bidding', when the auctioneer takes imaginary bids up to the secret reserve during an auction. However, they do have to make an announcement to this effect before the sale, although to the outsider it may not be clear exactly what is being explained.

In China, where auctioneering is a very new phenomenon, having mainly started in this century, the environment is still totally unregulated. A buyer who acquires a non-authentic piece at auction from a mainland auction house has no recourse – _caveat emptor_! Manifold instances of fakes have surfaced. One notable case concerns Qi Baishi's _Eagle Standing on a Pine Tree_ , 1946, which ostensibly sold for RMB425.5 million ($65.5 million) at China Guardian in May 2011, but which is now suspected of being a forgery. Its buyer has refused to pay and the work was reportedly left in a warehouse. However, there are moves afoot, through the China Association of Auctioneers, to bring in some regulation, and the arrival of Christie's and Sotheby's on the mainland, with their tighter mode of operation, may also have a positive effect.

The art market's famed and openly acknowledged opacity concerning prices, ownership and transactions, coupled with the easy portability of art, have made it an easy target for all sorts of skulduggery from the just-legal to out-and-out criminality. With few in the trade keen on revealing what is going on behind the scenes – and aggressive lawyers protecting the interests of the biggest players – it is difficult to prove wrongdoing, although some recent and high-profile lawsuits have tweaked the curtain aside a little. Most of what follows, however, is based on hints and nudges rather than hard evidence.

### A CULTURE OF CONFIDENTIALITY

The market has always thrived on secrecy and the very opacity of the transactions suits most of its players. Does this matter? Yes, it does, in the twenty-first century, when buying art is no longer reserved for a tiny elite of people who move in the same gilded circles. The $65 billion-a-year market now extends across the world and is sucking in buyers, investors and collectors who are not necessarily sophisticated and wary. From the deceptive transparency of the auction process to imprecise pricing in art galleries, from currency arbitraging to tax evasion to money laundering, the art market, at its upper end, has always had its secret deals, insider trading and speculation. But with internationalisation, the internet and a closer alignment of the worlds of art and finance, the opportunity for wrongdoing is greater than ever before.

### PRICING AT AUCTION: AS CLEAR AS MUD

While auctioneering may be regulated depending on the jurisdiction, many aspects of the business remain shrouded in secrecy, particularly for pricing and ownership. For a start, the 'reserve', the minimum price the vendor will accept, is always secret – except when the auction house has farmed out the risk by finding a third party to guarantee the price. The auction houses defend the secret reserve, saying that the mystery adds to the theatre – to which dealer Richard Feigen once pithily countered, 'If I want theatre, I'll go to Broadway.' The auction houses also say that revealing it would be unfair to the consignor – bidders would allow the work to pass under the reserve, then try to buy it for a lower price after the sale. These arguments are reasonably unconvincing, in that the reserve is generally set at a couple of increments under the low estimate, so it is easy to guess; another giveaway is the auctioneer's announcement 'I'm selling' when he reaches the reserve and starts seeking real bids in the room.

While achieved prices at auction are apparently public and transparent, they are not necessarily a reliable guide to the value of a work of art. A dealer will mark up a purchase when reselling, and dealers – and collectors – regularly 'support' their artists at auction by bidding on works to maintain the price structure and ensure confidence in the artist is maintained. Examples of such support can be seen at virtually any contemporary art auction, with perhaps the most notable case being Damien Hirst's one-man sale, _Beautiful in My Head Forever_ , at Sotheby's London on 15–16 September 2008. At the time Hirst's main dealers were Jay Jopling and Larry Gagosian and a press report claimed that three of the artist's business colleagues, with an interest in ensuring his work maintained a high value, had 'propped up' sale prices by making purchases or bids totalling over half of the £70.5 million spent at the sale.

Further muddying the waters at auction are the various financial instruments that accompany the big-ticket sales, which are covered in Chapter 1. One cynical New York dealer said about auctions today:

It's no longer a level playing field. The auctioneers are like croupiers taking bets from people, there is a sort of investment banking situation going on with the third-party guarantors. The auction house staff get people on the phone, get them to bid against people who have a financial interest in the work that's being sold. A lot of shit is going on that most people don't know about.

In 2010, Phillips de Pury held an auction in New York, Carte Blanche 'curated' by the art advisor Philippe Ségalot, a sale which in hindsight has achieved notoriety because it reveals so much about the murkiness and potential conflicts of interest in the market.

Ségalot was at the time part of the now disbanded Giraud Pissarro Ségalot dealing partnership, and among his rich clients was the Qatari royal family. He found the vendors of the 33 lots in the sale, and also advised many of the buyers. In addition he took a percentage of the buyer's premium, in agreement with Phillips – so opening the possibility of gaining fees three ways, taking from vendor, buyer and from the auction house itself.

One lot in particular startled observers, when Warhol's _Men in Her Life_ , 1962, sold for $63.4 million. That same sales week saw comparable work _Coca Cola_ , 1962, sell for $35.4 million at Sotheby's and his _Big Campbell's Soup Can_ , 1962, make $23.8 million at Christie's – both far more iconic works. Quoted in _The Economist_ , dealer Irving Blum was shocked by the disparity in results, saying the prices were 'incredibly peculiar'. _The Men in Her Life_ carried a third-party guarantee, which at the time was reported as being given by Phillips de Pury's owners, the Russian Mercury group. Subsequently, however, a number of trade sources claimed Qatar had given the guarantee, and persistent rumours after the sale maintain that Qatar had bought it.

At the top end of the market, where the most expensive works are traded, a tight group of traders and investors seem to be closely involved in the market as collectors, dealers and financiers. In 2009 a telephone conversation between Alberto Mugrabi and Larry Gagosian showed the close links between auction house specialists and the trade – and how Mugrabi and Gagosian were protecting the market for Warhol, in which they are heavily invested. Mugrabi, seated in London's Claridge's Hotel, was discussing three Warhols that were due to be auctioned at Sotheby's that night, 25 June 2009. The vendor was Josef Froehlich, a wealthy Stuttgart collector.

Sotheby's had told him, said Mugrabi to Gagosian on the telephone, not to worry about the most valuable piece, _Mrs McCarthy and Mrs Brown (Tunafish Disaster)_ , 1963, estimated at £3.5 million to £4.5 million. 'I spoke to them. They have the _Tunafish Disaster_ is [ _sic_ ] pretty covered. That's going to sell,' he told Gagosian, but said that the other two works – _Hammer and Sickle_ , 1976, and _Diamond Dust Shoes_ , 1980 – were more problematic. Mugrabi hung up and called Alex Rotter, specialist for the sale at Sotheby's that evening. 'Obviously he's [Froehlich] putting the painting because he wants to fucking sell it not because he wants to . . . If he wants to sell it, tell him to be realistic. It's only better for him and better for me . . . Let me talk to my dad and I'll call you right back . . .' he said: 'I'll tell you what the bottom price is. And if the guy wants it, we can at least have a secure bid on it. And if he doesn't want it, then maybe he withdraws it from the sale.' A short conversation with his father Jose, in Spanish, followed, in which he settled a price of ' _dos'_ for the _Hammer and Sickle._ Finally Mugrabi made his fourth call, to Rotter again: 'My dad says that he can pay for the two pictures – for the _Hammer and Sickle_ and the _Shoes_ – £2 million all inclusive.'

Did they have knowledge of the supposedly secret reserve? This is certainly implied. At the auction, both works sold at the bottom of their pre-sale targets to Mugrabi: _Hammer and Sickle_ , 1976, made £2,001,250 (estimate £2 million–£3 million) and _Diamond Dust Shoes_ , 1980, made £634,850 (estimate £600,000–£800,000). According to observers at the time, apart from Gagosian and Mugrabi there were no other visible bidders. In the financial sphere, access to non-public information before a sale is illegal in several countries as 'insider trading': not so in the mainly unregulated art market.

Alberto Mugrabi and his associate, New York real-estate billionaire and art collector Aby Rosen, are often seen trawling art fairs together. In 2008 the _New York Times Magazine_ said this about Sotheby's evening contemporary art sale:

A number of the volume buyers – the Warhol hoarders – were in attendance: dealer Larry Gagosian, paper magnate Peter Brant, and Jose Mugrabi, the Israel-born Colombian textile merchant. With all these friends collecting the same thing – the Princes, the Basquiats, the Warhols, the Koonses – there are whispers of collusion among this group the art world has nicknamed 'the Cartel'. The idea is that you buy 20 or 30 artworks by, say, Richard Prince, put two or three of them up at auction, and you and your pals bid them up. At every contemporary-art auction now, there's a bump and the prices reset.

In November 2009 at Sotheby's New York Contemporary evening sale, Alberto Mugrabi told me directly that he was both bidding on Andy Warhol's _200 One Hundred Dollar Bills_ , 1962, and that an auction-house specialist, Loic Gouzer, was also bidding on his behalf. The silkscreen, estimated at $8 million to $12 million, made $43.7 million.

Alberto's father Jose is also a prominent figure at auction, typically wearing a baseball cap, spectacles propped on his forehead and with a mobile phone pressed to his ear. In 2009, film-maker and art-world gadfly Ben Lewis interviewed Rosen and the Mugrabis for his film, _The_ _Great Contemporary Art Bubble_. Jose Mugrabi was asked whether he and his associates 'protect' the market for Warhol paintings, of which they have holdings of 800 works: 'What do you mean, "protect"?' he said: 'I love the art so, so much . . .' – leaving the question unanswered.

What Lewis did not examine was the question of how much money is actually changing hands in all these top-of-the-market deals. Major buyers inevitably do not pay full fees – either buyers' or sellers' – if they pay them at all. And when they are consignors as well as buyers, it is conceivable that no money is actually paid. This is what one New York dealer claims, speaking about the Nahmad family of dealer/traders, who specialise in Impressionist and modern art: 'Everyone in the art world knows that the Nahmads probably have not paid cash for an object at auction in the last 30 or 40 years. This is a system of barter, and inevitably puts someone at a disadvantage over a normal buyer. I don't know if there's any buyer's commission ever paid.'

Another of these cashless deals came to light when the billionaire investor Ron Perelman got into a fight with Gagosian over a Jeff Koons sculpture in 2013. It concerned a _Popeye_ , which Perelman bought from Gagosian for $4 million. In fact, he was not buying an existing work of art, but rather a promise that he would get it when it was completed – essentially, buying a future in the work, which he could resell at a profit immediately. Perelman charged that Gagosian had a 'secret agreement' with Koons, meaning that when he did resell, most of any profit would go to Gagosian. But the most interesting part of the suit concerned a related transaction in which Perelman swapped eight of his unwanted works for a Cy Twombly painting and a Richard Serra sculpture he bought from the dealer. Perelman accused Gagosian of taking advantage of him, 'undervaluing works when purchasing them, overvaluing them when selling them, and pocketing the substantial differential'. Such swaps maintain a murky value for works of art – and might be very useful when dealing with the tax authorities.

### PRICING IN THE TRADE

In most markets, prices are public, and the highest bidder gets to buy whatever the commodity is. The prices, therefore, reflect the market value, how much someone is prepared to pay for it. They also generally reflect the intrinsic value of the piece – its production cost, plus other associated costs such as shipping and so on.

In the art market, however, you can forget all of this. For a start, art comes into the category of 'positional goods' – buying artworks boosts the owner's social status. They are bought for a variety of sometimes illogical reasons, including friendship with the artist or gallerist, so that other people cannot have them, or just plain love of the work. So the price is subsidiary to the other benefits that accrue from owning them. Pricing is not based on how much it costs to produce a work of art. Most artworks have no intrinsic value at all based on their constituent parts; only those that incorporate precious ingredients have a 'scrap' value.

So the price is arbitrary, and in the primary market, the dealer sets the price. At the very top end this tends to remain confidential because it is not, in fact, fixed. Prices in the art market apparently never go down, but galleries will discount deeply for favoured buyers, particularly museums or noted collectors whose acquisitions will enhance the artist's profile. They may also try to assess how much interest they have before setting a final figure.

This confidentiality suits everyone: collectors do not want publicity about how much they have paid for something; the dealer does not want other buyers knowing what discounts they can get, or to let their competitors know what prices they are selling at.

Even after a sale, a dealer does their best to control artists' prices. How do they do this? By manipulating the market: 'rationing' the art, selecting the buyers who will enhance the prestige of the artist and adjusting the price for museums or desirable collectors. They will control the market after the work has left their hands, either by supporting at auction, as noted earlier, or getting buyers to sign resale agreements and cutting them off if they do not play ball (see Chapter 2).

### CONFIDENTIAL, CONFIDENTIAL . . .

As for client confidentiality, auction houses and dealers all guard this very, very closely. Vendors do not want to be named for various reasons, including security, their tax arrangements and a general inclination to shun the limelight. The auction houses disguise their identity under various designations such as 'Property of a lady of title', 'From a private collection' and so on. These can be rather creative: in 2013 a court complaint about ownership of a Basquiat drawing revealed its vendor to be a New York and Chicago lawyer, David Ruttenberg. While perhaps technically 'Property from a Distinguished Midwestern Collection' as proclaimed in the catalogue, the work had been purchased by Ruttenberg just a year before the sale, after the drawing had gone through a number of European dealers' hands. And auction houses routinely omit any failed sales in the work's past in the provenance: _caveat emptor._

In the 1990s, New York Assemblyman Richard Brodsky fought a long and finally unsuccessful battle to bring in legislation to regulate auction-house practices such as chandelier bidding, and force the disclosure of reserves, guarantees and financing. 'The whole art market changed after the sale of Van Gogh's _Irises_ , in 1987 [11 November],' he says: 'Before the sale, Sotheby's had two possible bidders for the work, a Japanese who had $50 million to spend and the Australian Alan Bond, who had $26 million. Sotheby's wanted a new world record, so they lent $27 million to Bond, so he could enter the bidding process.'

The outcome is well known: Bond bagged the picture for $53.9 million, but defaulted on the loan: the work was finally sold to the Getty Museum in California for an undisclosed price. 'When Sotheby's lent the money to Bond, the firm went from being a market maker to a market participant,' says Brodsky. 'These extraordinary and confidential practices became the currency of the realm, and they changed the economic structure of the whole market.'

Much more recently, the art market's culture of confidentiality has been highlighted by some damaging faking cases. Most destructive was the 2013 Knoedler Gallery scandal. Knoedler, established in 1846, was one of New York's oldest art dealers but snapped shut in 2011 after being targeted by a lawsuit alleging it had sold a fake Pollock to Pierre Lagrange, a London hedge-fund trader. Knoedler and another New York gallery, Julian Weissman, had been selling works by the 'greats' of modern art – Pollock, Rothko, Motherwell and others – for almost 20 years for some $80 million, but, as the story unravelled, it turned out that they all came from a single source: an obscure Long Island art dealer called Glafira Rosales.

Initially prosecuted for tax evasion – amusingly, the New York state attorney pointed out that you have to pay tax if you make money selling art, even if the art is counterfeit – Rosales quickly bargained and pleaded guilty to selling at least 63 fakes. The forgeries had been turned out by a Chinese painter in Queens; they were given false signatures and authenticated, or at least not questioned, by a number of specialists. For all those years, Rosales had sold works without any verifiable provenance. She wove a story about these unrecorded, never-before-seen works; she invented her vendors, a Swiss client and a Spanish collector, both of whom she claimed wished to remain anonymous.

The fact that two respected art galleries were prepared to sell million-dollar pictures to their clients with a provenance of 'Mr X' and 'Mr X, Jr' is indicative of the widespread acceptance in the trade of this confidentiality. The clients themselves may be complicit in this culture, as they may well be indulging in some creative tax arrangements as well. Let's take the case of counterfeits produced by the German faker Walter Beltracchi, currently in prison in Germany for forgery. He was prosecuted for faking 14 works, but he has boasted that he produced hundreds of fakes, by 50 different artists, during a spree that lasted for decades and ended with his incarceration in 2011. Here is the ownership of just some of Beltracchi's productions after they were bought at auction or at dealers: André Derain, _Bateaux à Collioure_ : Serrano Finance and Trade SA, Wickhams Bay, Tortola, British Virgin Islands. Max Ernst, _La Mer_ : Gemstone Holdings, Hong Kong. Max Ernst, _La Forêt II_ : Salomon Trading LLC Cheyenne/Wyoming, US, and Hanna Graham Associates, Nassau, Bahamas – the list is long, and all involve tax havens of some sort or another.

### COLLECTORS ARE NOT SQUEAKY CLEAN EITHER

We have seen how galleries manipulate prices, and even how auction house prices are not necessarily reliable. Another major form of manipulation can come from the collectors themselves. Collectors often sit on museum boards and so have advance knowledge of coming shows, which generally enhance the reputation – and hence the price – of the chosen artists. They can buy up work before the show is even announced to the public, something that in other markets would be tantamount to insider trading. Or they can help a museum buy works by some artists in the hope of valorising their own holdings.

One case in 2005 concerned the British artist Chris Ofili, whose 13-part _The Upper Room_ , 2005, was acquired by Tate for £600,000 – well under its market value – from the Victoria Miro gallery for a substantial discount. Some of the paintings had already been reserved by gallery clients, but they relinquished their rights in return for the promise they could buy works in Ofili's following show. What was problematic – apart from the fact that Ofili was a Tate artist-trustee – was that Tate financed the purchase partly through donations from those very same clients, who obviously had an interest in the acquisition.

In 2013 Guggenheim Museum opened a solo show of Christopher Wool (25 October 2013–22 January 2014), an artist whose market had seen intense price hikes in the previous five years to the extent that one European curator claimed his work 'had become a parking lot for money'. In the catalogue, but not actually on view when the exhibition opened, was a 1988 painting, _Apocalypse Now_ , reading: 'SELL THE HOUSE SELL THE CAR SELL THE KIDS'. It turned out that the work belonged to former hedge-fund manager David Ganek, who was a Guggenheim board member when the Wool show was decided. He apparently sold it between the printing of the catalogue and the opening of the show – where it was replaced by a work on paper owned by . . . Peter Brant. Ganek resigned from the museum board and the painting was put up for sale at Christie's major New York auction in November 2013. Estimated at $15 million–$20 million, the painting set a new world record for Wool by selling for $26.5 million.

'The problem of collectors sitting on museum boards and trying to use their position to validate their own holdings is ubiquitous, and is being exacerbated by the new class of trustees, who today are investor-collectors,' said an American museum director in November 2013, who did not want to be identified as he was still the head of a major institution. 'They will try to use their position to either influence the purchases of the institution, in line with their own collection, or have their own works included in museum exhibitions. You cannot imagine how cajoled and caressed I have sometimes been to take a painting into a show!'

As egregious, he continues, is the pressure on museums to show a trustee's collection in part or in its entirety. Deep disquiet was expressed in 2009 when the Greek construction tycoon Dakis Joannou – one of the museum's trustees – showed his collection in New York's New Museum, in a show curated by the artist Jeff Koons ( _Skin Fruit: Selections from the Dakis Jouannou Collection_ , 3 March–6 June 2010). In addition, Joannou has the biggest private holdings of Koons in the world. New Museum director Lisa Phillips defended the decision, saying: 'In our case, there is a written agreement with Mr Joannou confirming the provision of our ethics policy that no trustee may lend a work to the museum if they intend to sell it. If we were exhibiting another private collection, we would require a similar written commitment.'

The problem for American museums, which is not necessarily the case in Europe or Asia, is that 80 per cent of museum acquisitions are through gifts and bequests, so the museums have to cosy up to rich collectors and hope they will fulfil promises to leave their works of art to museums. But, as Ed Able, a former president of the American Association of Museums, once told me: 'You can't know what's in the head of the collector.' Some museums demand that trustees refrain from selling works that have been loaned for a period – generally at least a year. But in one case that caused great disquiet in 2007, Alan and Simone Hartman – Oriental art dealers from New York, and the latter a trustee of the Boston Museum of Fine Art – auctioned off a collection of jade pieces three years after they were displayed as a collection in the museum.

In a vitriolic pamphlet published in 2005, an American publisher and editor, Paul Werner, accused the museums themselves of playing this game. 'Scholarship is routinely used to validate and promote works of art that happen to belong to a founder, sponsor or trustee of the museum that happens to promote the scholarship to begin with,' he wrote: 'Temporary exhibitions are means to hype the authenticity and value of the sponsor's holdings.' One example was Boston Fine Art Museum's controversial decision to exhibit _Things I Love: The Many Collections of William I. Koch_ , 31 August–27 November 2005 – including paintings, firearms and even two yachts and empty wine bottles owned by the billionaire and collector Bill Koch. The energy mogul, who is an honorary trustee of the museum, paid many of the costs including those of the catalogue, which included descriptions of his art by museum curators.

Sometimes, however, the museums themselves become victims; one of the most egregious examples was the Estella sale at Sotheby's in 2008. This group of about 200 works of contemporary Chinese art was put together by the veteran dealer Michael Goedhuis. Initially promoted as a serious undertaking to chronicle the period, with museum donations and an academic book ostensibly planned, the group was put on show in the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Denmark and then at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem in 2007–8.

However, it turned out that the collection may have been an investment vehicle all along, and while still in Copenhagen, Sotheby's visited to value the collection, having acquired it in collaboration with the New York dealer William Acquavella from the initial investors. Israel Museum director James Snyder told _The Art Newspaper_ : 'At the time we made our arrangements for the exhibition, there was no indication of any intention to sell the collection. We learned of this development only towards the end of our showing.' Three days after the Jerusalem exhibition closed, Sotheby's announced the collection was for sale, and the whole selection was sold, partly as a group in Hong Kong, April 2008, making $17.8 million, and partly filtered into other sales later in the year.

The increasing permeability between the private and the public sectors certainly has blurred the picture. Museums, even traditional ones, want to show contemporary art to show they are inclusive and hip, and to attract a younger demographic – all laudable aims in themselves. However, a conflict of interest can arise as a result of the financing of these shows – especially if they are actually also more or less disguised selling shows.

And then there is the problem of the clout of a well-known collector. When Christie's owner François Pinault, for example, buys a work by an artist, it automatically enhances that artist's value, and if the resulting purchases go on show in one of Pinault's two Venetian museums, that will boost it even further. François Pinault, as a collector, the owner of Christie's and its private selling spaces as well as two museums, certainly could manipulate the market if he chose. His private collection, which numbers over 2,000 works, has never been fully exhibited and is believed to be kept in Switzerland; parts of it are drawn on for exhibitions at the Dogana and Palazzo Grassi, his two Venetian museums. In 2008–9 he lent extensively to a show by Takashi Murakami in Versailles, which was run by his ex-director, the former French culture minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon. At the time the French blogosphere was crammed with mainly critical comments about the fact that Murakami's long-time dealer in Paris, Emmanuel Perrotin, counts Pinault among his best clients. A previous exhibition, of Jeff Koons, underlined the same problem of a potential collusion between Aillagon and Pinault; the luxury-goods mogul having sponsored the exhibition to the tune of €2 million and lent most of the works put on display.

In November 2013, as we have seen in Chapter 1, Christie's owned one lot and had financial interests in 14 others including the Bacon triptych that set the world record for a work of art at auction; another eight lots bore third-party guarantees. As a private company, the firm does not have to reveal its inner workings but Pinault himself could, if he wanted, have been responsible for some of this financing.

With the astonishing rise in the number of private museums this century (see Chapter 4), there is certainly room for collectors to abuse their positions, by using their institutions to promote artists who they subsequently put on to the market – enhanced with the value-boosting gloss of their imprimatur.

### MONEY LAUNDERING AND TAX EVASION

'The art market lends itself well to illegal transactions such as money laundering and tax evasion,' says Enrique Liberman, a New York attorney who specialises in art law. In addition to its confidentiality, the high level of monetary transactions, the unfamiliarity of enforcement agencies over values and the portable nature of art itself all contribute to the art market being a suitable vehicle for illegal activity. As other money-laundering techniques are coming under closer scrutiny, smugglers, drug traffickers and arms dealers are increasingly turning to the art market.

'Today there's too much money floating into the art world from sources that are unidentified,' says a veteran New York dealer. Laundering money through art is very easy, explains Richard Ellis, a former detective with Scotland Yard's Art and Antiques Squad who is now director of the Art Management Group:

The classic way is to go to auction and buy something, if necessary above the high estimate – you secure the lot and you walk away with something that has a value and is legitimate. It's impossible to track. The people who are laundering will have a number of people who will cover a vast number of auctions, even online. And the art they buy is resaleable. It's a simple as that.

According to Peter Lilley, author of _Dirty Dealing_ , the classic technique of laundering money is in three stages: placement, layering (or agitation or comingling) and then integration. The placement consists of buying high-value goods such as works of art, for instance. This is the most dangerous phase, because here is where the direct connection with the crime is still evident.

The next phase, layering, consists of shifting the asset around, for instance shipping it to various addresses before it reaches its final destination, or change its ownership frequently. 'The trick at this stage is to move money around . . . the whole purpose is to break the money up, create as much paperwork as possible to confuse and frustrate any active surveillance or future investigation, and at the end of the day, create a false provenance for the source of the funds,' says Lilley.

The final phase, integration, is when the asset is resold, producing 'clean' money, or if actual cash was 'layered', then it can be used to make a legitimate purchase – such as art, which can then subsequently be resold.

Drugs often form part of the equation. One of the best-known cases occurred in the late twentieth century, when the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) carried out one of the most audacious stings ever and managed to smash the immensely powerful Colombian Cali cartel of drug barons. It started in 1992, when the US authorities set up a phoney bank in Anguilla and tempted the barons to deposit their money with them, so gaining unprecedented access to their names, accounts and sources of income. Among the assets the barons quickly deposited were three paintings supposedly worth some $20 million. These works – Reynolds' _Portrait of a Gentleman_ , Rubens' _St Paul_ and a Blue period Picasso, _Head of a Beggar_ – were destined to be resold, and in 1994 the drug barons' representative was conned into taking them to Miami. But it was a set-up: the representative was arrested and the cartel was subsequently disbanded.

As for the paintings, there was an extraordinary twist to the tale – it turned out that they were fake. 'The question never satisfactorily answered was, had there been someone brave enough to sell the drug barons fakes?' says Ellis. He also says that there is another theory, in which it does not matter if the paintings are fake, as they can be swapped back and forth between companies, each time for a significant sum of money and transfer of ownership – producing an apparently 'clean' provenance.

In April 2013, a squad of FBI agents raided the Helly Nahmad Gallery in New York as part of an investigation into an illegal $100 million gambling ring run by a Russian crime organisation. According to Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Helly Nahmad was part of the 'Nahmad-Trincher Organization' run by Illya Trincher, 'a nationwide criminal enterprise with leadership in Los Angeles, California, and New York', which ran illegal gambling dens for multi-millionaire and billionaire clients. The attorney alleged that the organisation was partly financed by Helly Nahmad, and it laundered tens of millions of dollars through various companies. Nahmad surrendered to the US authorities in Los Angeles the day after the raid; and initially his lawyers vehemently denied any wrongdoing. However, within six months Nahmad had pleaded guilty to being the organiser and leader of a gambling ring, agreed to pay a $6.4 million fine and handed over a Dufy painting to the US authorities. The other charges were dropped, with the result that investigation of the Nahmad gallery's business practices were also dropped as well.

By keeping the value of art confidential, it is easier to under-declare prices, something that also comes in useful when evading tax. While tax avoidance is legal if not necessarily moral, tax evasion is illegal; the difference with money laundering is that the initial sum is 'clean', i.e. honestly earned, whereas laundered money comes from a dirty source. At its simplest level, art buyers may seek to evade sales or import tax by undervaluing their purchases.

This had apparently been routinely happening in mainland China, where import taxes are extremely high, until 2011, when a sudden clampdown by the customs authorities sent a chill through the market and dampened buying. Two employees of a shipping firm were imprisoned for a period, as were a museum curator and an art advisor, accused of tax evasion; 800 collectors were also investigated including Wang Wei, founder of two museums in Shanghai, who had to pay a heavy fine for an imported jade.

In 2004, New York authorities successfully prosecuted a number of art dealers as well as Dennis Kozlowski, the disgraced former Tyco CEO, for evading $1 million in sales tax by shipping empty boxes (rather than the art that had been purchased) out of New York – where the tax was payable – to New Hampshire, where it was not. This still goes on except in a slightly more sophisticated way. A Californian art dealer explains: 'For instance, if sending something to Arizona, we would make something up in plywood, put it in a box, and ship it that way. The buyer throws away the bit of plywood. It might cost $800 to make and ship but if you're saving $25,000 on tax it's worth it.' And it must be said that some genuine contemporary art works could look like a piece of cobbled-together plywood to the untutored eye of a tax inspector . . .

The mushrooming of freeports around the world can certainly help tax-dodgers. These state-of-the-art armoured warehouses are sited in at the airports of Geneva and Singapore as well as Luxembourg and elsewhere; a huge new facility is under construction in Beijing. The Geneva one, where the Nahmads stash their inventory, reportedly holds more than $100 billion of art. In the Singapore facility, which cost $100 million to build and boasts a vast commissioned sculpture by Ron Arad, almost a third of the space has been hired by Christie's. These huge, heavily guarded buildings contain a series of strong-rooms that can be used by dealers as an extension of their galleries – in a tax-free environment. If the work is resold while in the freeport, the owner pays no transaction tax, and while tax is payable in a destination country once a work leaves the freeport, the work of art might have changed hands a number of times, certainly complicating the task of tax authorities. A sign of the importance of the art market for these freeports is that they regularly take booths in the major art fairs to promote their services.

Yves Bouvier, the Swiss entrepreneur who is a major shareholder in the Luxembourg, Geneva and Singapore ports, denies that they are used for anything illegitimate. 'They are the worst place to hide anything,' he says: 'Everything is scanned and controlled, because we have to know what we have here.' Nevertheless, the discreet nature of their operation is attractive. While Bouvier says the extension to Singapore and Beijing is a normal evolution because of the growth of the art markets there, a Swiss crackdown on money-laundering in 2009, which allowed its customs to inspect inventories, might have been a motivator. In Singapore, a collector or dealer can visit their holdings – by prior arrangement – without even showing their passport since the freeport is within the airport perimeter.

### IS REGULATION OF THE MARKET POSSIBLE?

Every time a particularly shocking case hits the headlines – most recently in the Rosales case – the subject of stricter regulation comes back on to the agenda. Richard Brodsky's largely unsuccessful campaigns to regulate auction always came up against the general feeling that the police and legislators have better things to do than protect rich people from being cheated when buying art. And unfortunately, this is probably where matters will remain. Even the simple question of valuing and authenticating art is problematic, unlike other commodities where there is far more homogeneity of the basic material. The disparity of size and wealth among the principal actors – from a few big auction houses to a plethora of dealers, from the power-houses to tiny galleries – is also a bar to any self-regulation, even if there is a desire for this, which there certainly is not. The way the market is today suits most of its players just fine, and I do not see this changing any time soon.

## EPILOGUE

* * *

The market for contemporary art has had, since the end of the twentieth century, the most astonishing boom, due as we have seen to fundamental changes in the amount and nature of wealth, globalisation, the internet, the rise of private museums and the impact of emerging economies. It has also seen radical changes in the way the market works, and many veteran players no longer recognise the world they knew.

They point to the way auction houses have changed their mode of working, their increasing encroachment on dealer turf, their engagement with the market as financial participants and the question of who they are actually working for (except themselves) as one example. The polarisation of galleries into a big few and the rest is another, along with the threat to their very existence in the internet age. The event- and money-driven nature of art fairs is yet another.

The colossal rise in prices has put museums in the position of being unable to acquire works of art, in a market increasingly dominated by a tiny percentage of massively wealthy people. Indeed, museums, in an age when public patronage is fading and private patronage is growing, are often forced to be vendors rather than buyers to survive.

The increasing focus on art as an asset and speculation by a small number of influential and wealthy players have also changed the way art is created, produced and marketed. Indeed, in many cases this has challenged the very nature of a 'work of art' as a unique expression of the artist, as it has become a product made to satisfy an increasingly voracious market.

By the twentieth century, artists had largely wrested control of their own art from the prescriptive commissions of the Church, aristocracy and gentry, and moved into an era of uncompromised, radical creativity. But the democratisation and popularisation of art from the 1960s on seems now to have reversed, to an extent. Today there is an increasing identification of art, artists and art galleries with the global 0.01 per cent. This has benefited the major auction houses and the 'mega' galleries, but plays against the mid-market and smaller dealers, because their own mid-level collectors are priced out of the market and because the dealers themselves do not have the necessary financial resources to compete.

At the emerging-artist level, there is a worrying trend of 'cornering' the market by speculators, who push up the work of a young unknown and then flip it quickly on to the next speculator. Like a game of 'pass the parcel', the works go up in value each time – until they don't, and someone is left holding the parcel. 'It doesn't matter, because the speculator will have about five or six other artists' work on the go at the same time, so he or she will lose there, but gain elsewhere,' one art investor told me. The problem few address is the effect on the artist, who sees prices for their work skyrocket but then fall back to earth, without necessarily having any influence on the turn of events. And where does the artist go from there?

Is the boom sustainable? Is it likely to grow even more? We saw Francis Outred of Christie's claim that he expects to see a $1 billion work of art in his lifetime. Even allowing for his inevitable belief in the ecosystem that sustains him and his company, it is an astonishing expression of confidence. In many ways, today's booming market is good news for art and artists: art is enhancing far more people's lives than ever before, it is better diffused throughout the world and many artists are able to work to the scale of their ambitions. Some artists have become wildly rich; a host of other jobs have been created by the boom; art is put into hospitals to help patients and taken into prisons, and outreach programmes are being developed. Major institutions are acquiring and displaying art from across the world, so becoming far more inclusive. In some countries, notably the Middle East, art has enabled women to find a field where they can have a valid and effective role, while other sectors remain more difficult for them to enter.

Nevertheless, all markets are cyclical: the trick is guessing how long each cycle will last. Sales of art inevitably depend on the wider economic picture, and if this changes radically, then so could the market.

Over-production is a major issue. As long as the market is growing, there are buyers to mop up the work. But should the market turn down, the sheer amount of art for which buyers would be sought would inevitably dampen prices – and have a spiralling downwards effect. And the more artists align themselves with luxury goods, the less they will retain the specificity of a work of art, its position as a unique, spiritual object that transcends its time.

Another element that could be decisive is the fate of the many collections and private museums being created today, as the generation that built and funded them passes away. What will happen to the mighty museums being built in the Gulf, if the rulers of those states turn their attention – and energy-dollars – to something else? Children do not necessarily like their parents' choices in art, and the very nature of contemporary art, its fashionableness, means that it is quickly out of fashion. What will happen to all these private collections in a generation's time? Will state institutions want, or be able, to absorb all this work, which might start to look a bit old-hat – if they are offered it? And what happens if it all goes up for sale over a short period? That, even more than the economic environment, could depress prices and sap confidence.

There is an argument that the market is now 'too big to fail', that the trade and collectors will be forced to prop it up in the case of a downturn, in order to protect their investments. And then there is the 'this time it's different' position, as there are more and more emerging economies joining the party. In this scenario the growing and aspirational middle classes in these countries will enter the market at the lower and mid-levels and gradually progress up to higher price levels. But the polarisation of the market and the hollowing-out of the middle will make such progress difficult. With the concentration of power in the art market and its ties to a financial elite, we may be entering an era of duplication and conformity, where the focus is on repetition of form supplied by a few hundred 'bankable' names such as Koons and Hirst, rather than on a broad range of artistic creation at all levels.

 Buyer's premium was introduced in the 1970s and has gradually increased to the present rates, which are between 12.5 per cent and 25 per cent, depending on the price.

 While American museums can and do deaccession, many European ones are debarred by law from disposing of their holdings.
