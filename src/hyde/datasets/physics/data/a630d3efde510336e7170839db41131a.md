## **Preface**

The physics portion of the Medical College Aptitude Test (MCAT) contains questions to test your knowledge of basic physics and your ability to apply that knowledge to unfamiliar situations.

The goal of this book is to review basic physics with an emphasis on the principles and ideas, and to help you learn to approach new situations and think about them with a physics mindset. This book is not primarily concerned with test-taking techniques. It is designed to help you develop an intuitive understanding of physics, so that you will understand the MCAT questions and how to answer them.

Each chapter contains a discussion of a major physics topic, followed by problems to help you apply the concepts. Finally, there are MCAT-style passages and questions to help you get used to the MCAT format. All the problems have complete solutions in the back of the book, some with tips to help you approach problems and to solve them faster.

If you work through this book, taking notes with pencil and paper by your side, and solving the problems, you will improve your understanding of physics. And you will improve your score on the MCAT.

## Chapter 1  
Introduction

### A. Philosophy of the Book

This book is about the concepts of physics, with the goal to prepare you, the reader, to pass the physics part of the MCAT. The physics and chemistry portions of the MCAT consist mainly of a series of passages, each with several questions or problems. Often the passages involve unfamiliar situations and, rather than numbers, explanations, relationships among various quantities, and extrapolations to new situations. Physics and chemistry problems are sometimes mixed, and there is no ordering from easy to difficult. When pre-med students find out about the exam, they are often fearful.

How do you prepare for such a thing?

The short answer is: by thinking and doing physics.

This book actually has several goals. One is to give you a working knowledge of the basic concepts of physics. Although you will not need a battery of specialized equations, you should remember enough equations to understand the ideas. The text portion of this book covers all the topics listed in the MCAT study guide, but it omits details included in many freshman physics texts. Instead, it concentrates on the underlying ideas.

Another goal is to teach you how to solve problems in science. But you cannot learn to solve problems by simply reading about physics. The way to learn is to solve problems. Then you can solve future problems, for example, on the MCAT, by thinking in the same way as when you solved problems before. For this reason each chapter contains problems in the text with full explanations, as well as problems for you to solve at the end. The solutions at the back of the book tell you how to think about the problems, which clues to look for, and what methods to apply. The goal is for you to learn how to approach new problems.

In each chapter the initial problems are simple, in order to help you to practice your understanding of the concepts in that chapter. These problems may be easy questions or single problems involving some calculations. Although they are not a close approximation of MCAT questions, you will have difficulty on the exam unless you learn to do these first. Gradually, the problems in a chapter become more difficult, and at the end of every chapter there are MCAT-style passages. In all, there are 51 passages in this book.

### B. Reading this Book

Reading a book about physics is completely different from reading a novel. First of all, you must be at a desk and have paper and a pen or pencil. You should write down every equation, making sure you understand all the symbols. You should reproduce every diagram, working to understand, for example, why certain forces are there and no others, and so on. You may even try working the examples before reading the solutions and work the solutions out along side the text.

It is especially important that you keep an open mind and visualize what you read. In biology one can actually see organelles with an electron microscope. Understanding the operation of enzymes requires a little bit more imagination. In physics, you must rely on imagination even more, but it is not too different from imagining the working of enzymes. If you view physics as a mere collection of facts and equations to memorize, you will find it frustrating. Alternatively, if you approach physics looking for new concepts, themes and a new worldview, then your efforts will be better rewarded.

### C. Units

A widely held belief is that unit analysis is the least interesting activity of the physical sciences. Indeed, carefully carrying units through a difficult formula is sometimes about as interesting as painting a barn. But there are several good reasons to pay attention to units.

You can lose valuable points if you drop units, substitute into a formula, and forget to convert cm to m or the like. One way to guard against this type of error is to automatically convert any number to MKS (meters, kilograms, and seconds) as you read the passage, or at least flag the units that are nonstandard (i.e., not meters, kilograms, and seconds). Another way is to keep track of the units any time the units in the problem are nonstandard.

Another reason to pay attention to units is that they can alert you if you have written an equation the wrong way. For example, you may remember that flow rate _f_ is the volume (m3) flowing past a point per unit time (s) and that it is related to the velocity _v_ and cross-sectional area _A_ of the pipe. But how do you relate _f_ [m3/s], _v_ [m/s], and _A_ [m2]?

The only way to correctly obtain the units is to write something like

_f_ = _Av_

that is

where we may have left out a proportionality constant. In this case the formula is correct as written. Units may bring back to mind an equation you would have forgotten, counting for valuable points.

A third reason for keeping track of units is that they sometimes guide you to an answer without your having to use a formula or do much work, as the next example shows.

**Example:** How much volume does 0.4 kg of oxygen gas take up at _T_ = 27° C and _P_ = 12 atm? (Use the gas constant _R_ = 0.0821 L atm/K mol.)

**Solution:** Well, to the question, "How much oxygen?", we can answer either in kilograms or in liters. The problem gives kilograms and asks for liters, so this is a complicated units conversion problem. We will essentially construct the ideal gas equation using the units of the elements in the problem. We start with 0.4 kg.

(amount of O2) = 0.4 kg O2

In order to apply the ideal gas equation we need to convert to moles. We can do this by including the factors:

Both are equivalent to 1, but the units cancel, leaving us with moles.

Now we include a factor of _R_ because it has liters in the numerator and moles in the denominator. We obtain

This leaves us with units of atm and K which we want to get rid of. In order to cancel them, we can just put them in. This may seem strange, but it works. (Recall 27° C = 300 K.) Thus we obtain

For MCAT problems we generally work to one digit of accuracy, so we replace 0.0821 with 0.08, so that we have

It is generally safe to round to one significant digit. If it happens that two choices are close, then you can always go back and gain more accuracy.

This example involved more arithmetic than most MCAT problems, but its purpose was to point out that attention to units can speed up the solution to a problem. If this is the way you normally do such a problem, good. Most readers, however, would take longer working through this type of problem, using up valuable seconds on the MCAT. Remember that seconds can add up to points.

### D. Equations

Students generally have one of three attitudes toward equations:

1 sheer hatred (enough said),

2. cold pragmatism (plug in numbers and get an answer), and

3. warm fondness.

Try adopting the last attitude. Many students do not realize that equations are merely a way to contain useful information in a short form. They are sentences in the concise language of mathematics. You should not have to memorize most equations in the text, because by the time you learn each chapter, the equations should feel natural to you. They should feel like natural relationships among familiar quantities.

For example, consider one of the first equations you ever encountered, distance equals rate times time, that is

It makes sense that, in a given time, we can go twice as far if we go twice as fast. Thus Δ _x_ is proportional to _v_. On the other hand, for a given speed, we can go twice as far if we travel twice as long a time. Thus Δ _x_ is proportional to Δ _t_. We would never be tempted to write

_v_ = Δ _x_ Δ _t_

or

Δ _t_ = _v_ Δ _x_

because these equations give relationships among the quantities that we know to be wrong. Note also that the units work out correctly only in equation (1).

Another example is the second law of motion, which we will encounter in Section 3.B. If an object has a single force on it, then its acceleration is proportional to the magnitude of the force and inversely proportional to its mass. Instead of words, we simply write

Now let's think about the equation. What would we do if we forgot it? If we stop to think about it, we could figure it out. First, we know that force, mass, and acceleration are connected somehow. If we have two objects of the same mass, and we apply three times as much force to the second object as to the first, then we have a picture like that in Figure 1-1. The greater force causes the greater acceleration, so we can guess that they are proportional. We write

Figure 1-1

If we apply the same force to two objects of different masses, then we expect the smaller object to accelerate more (Figure 1-2). Thus we can guess that the acceleration is _inversely_ proportional to the mass, so we write

Figure 1-2

Combining these two proportions we get

_a_ = _F/m_

as in equation (2).

When you take the MCAT, you really should have the equation _F_ = _ma_ in your head, but if you train yourself to think this way, it will be easier to keep the formulas in your head. This will make it possible to recover the formula if you forget it. And you will understand physics better. Most importantly, you will be better able to apply the concept behind the equation.

Some equations are a little more complicated. An example is Newton's law of gravity, which gives the force of gravity between two objects:

where _G_ is a constant, _m_ 1 and _m_ 2 are masses of objects, and _r_ is the distance between them. How would you ever remember this equation?

Well, start with the idea that objects with more mass have a greater force of gravity between them, so write

Also, if objects are far apart, the force of gravity between them is less, so write

There is a constant, so write

The only part that needs to be memorized is the "square" in the denominator, so that we have

That's why we call gravity an inverse-square force.

The MCAT will not ask you to substitute into an equation like equation (3), but it may ask a question like, "What happens to the gravitational force between two objects if the distance between the objects is increased by a factor of four?"

We can tell from equation (3) that an increase in distance results in a decrease in force, because _r_ is in the denominator. Because the _r_ is squared, a factor of 4 in _r_ will result in a factor of 42 = 16 in Fgrav. The answer is that the gravitational force decreases by a factor of 16.

If this last point seems opaque to you, try some numbers on a more familiar equation, such as that for the area of a circle

What happens to the area when the radius increases by a factor of 3? (Answer: It increases by a factor of 9.) Try it with _r_ 1 = 4 m and _r_ 2 = 12 m, or with some other numbers.

Another equation is that for the surface area of a sphere

What happens to the surface area of a sphere when the radius increases by a factor of 3? (Answer: It increases by a factor of 9. Surprised? What about the factor of 4? Try it with _r_ 1 = 4 m and _r_ 2 = 12 m.) The surface area of a sphere is an equation that you just have to memorize. It is difficult to get an intuitive grasp why the 4π should be there. On the other hand, the _r_ 2 is natural in this equation. Why? (Think about units.)

Another example concerns the volume of a sphere

What happens to the volume when the radius is doubled?

In this chapter we discussed the importance of units in solving problems. If a problem involves only simple proportionalities and there are no unitless proportionality constants, then we can obtain a quick solution simply by keeping track of units. The example in the text demonstrates all the techniques involved.

We also looked at equations as the language of physics. If you read equations as sentences containing information for you to understand, then the equations will seem less foreign than if you look at them as abstract collections of symbols. Each time you encounter a boxed equation in this book, you should spend some time thinking about what the equation means.

### Passage 1

[ _You do not need to have any prior knowledge of electricity to deal with this passage._ ]

In a parallel-plate capacitor, two parallel metal plates are connected to a voltage source which maintains a potential _V_ across the plates. Positive charges collect on one side of the capacitor and negative charges on the other side, thus creating an electric field _E_ between the plates. The magnitude of the electric field is related to the potential and the separation between the plates according to

_V_ = _Ed_

where _V_ is measured in volts, _E_ in J/m, and _d_ in m. A charged particle placed between the plates will experience a force given in magnitude by

_F_ = _qE_

where _q_ is the charge of the particle in Coulombs, and _F_ is the force in N.

**A.** It decreases by a factor of 9.

**B.** It increases by a factor of 3.

**C.** It increases by a factor of 9.

**B.** It decreases by a factor of 3.

**C.** It stays the same.

**D.** It increases by a factor of 3.

**3.** In a given experiment, both a proton and a bare helium nucleus are between the plates. How does the force on the helium nucleus compare to the force on the proton?

**B.** It is twice as great.

**C.** It is four times as great.

### Passage 2

where _F_ is in N, _k_ is a constant 9 x 109 N m2/C2, _q_ 1 and _q_ 2 are the charges on the balls measured in C, and _r_ is the distance between the balls in m.

**1.** In a certain experiment, the separation between the balls is halved, while the charges on the balls are undisturbed. How would this affect the force between them?

**B.** The separation is decreased by a factor of 2, and all else is unchanged.

**C.** The separation is increased by a factor of 2, and all else is unchanged.

**D.** The separation is increased by a factor of 4, and all else is unchanged.

**4.** In a hypothetical situation, two balls of positive charge exert a force 12 N on each other. The charge on ball A is 2 C. If the charge on ball A is increased to 8 C, and all else unchanged, what would the force be?

**A.** 8 N

In a certain experiment, we are investigating the retarding force that a fluid exerts on an object moving through it. We guess that the size of the object is a factor, so we include _A_ , the cross-sectional area, in an equation. The relative velocity between the object and the fluid is a factor _v_ , as well as the density of the fluid _ρ_. So we guess

where _k_ is a proportionality constant with some appropriate units. Before we run the experiment,

## Chapter 2  
The Language of Motion

### A. Introduction

_Mechanics_ is about the motion of things. Before we can talk about motion in depth, we need to be able to describe motion and the things which affect it. Objects move, and we talk of how fast they go, that is, velocity. Their velocity changes, so we talk of acceleration. We can think of changes in acceleration, but it turns out (happily) that we rarely need to. Mechanics is concerned mainly with changes in velocity.

In this chapter we look at the fundamental elements of mechanics: force, mass, distance, velocity, and acceleration. Comparatively this chapter has a lot of equations (six that you should memorize) and the least interesting physics. It is an unpleasant way to begin, but it must be done.

### B. Force

A _force_ is a push or pull, and the units for force are [Newtons = N]. (Some countries continue to use an archaic unit called the "pound".) A Newton is approximately the amount of force that you would exert on an apple near the Earth's surface to keep it from falling.

Examples of forces include the force of a horse pulling a cart, the force of a spring pushing the chassis of a car, the force of gravity pulling you down, and the force on your head due to pressure when you are at the bottom of a pool.

### C. Mass

We can think about mass in several ways. First, the _mass_ of an object is a measure of the total amount of material (or stuff) in the object. The amount of stuff in an object is a fundamental property of the object. It doesn't change if you move the object to a new place, like a mountaintop or to Mars.

There is another way to think of mass. The mass of an object is a measure of how difficult it is to get it moving at a certain velocity if it starts from rest. For example, if John wants to set a car, initially at rest, to moving at 1 m/s, he has to push hard for a little while. We are assuming the car's motion has no friction. If John and the car were on the Moon, his task would be equally difficult. The fundamental concept here is the mass of the car, not the astronomical body the car is on. (See Figure 2-1.)

Figure 2-1

Saying this another way, the mass of an object is a measure of how much it hurts if your stub you toe on it. Stubbing your toe on a bowling ball is a painful proposition, even on the Moon.

There is a _wrong_ way to think about mass. Many people think the mass of an object is a measure of how difficult it is to pick it up. But that definition depends on where you are. It is easy to pick up a bowling ball on the Moon, but nearly impossible on the surface of Jupiter. The difficulty in picking up an object is a matter of weight, which is a force. And weight _does_ depend on the astronomical body near by.

### D. Vectors

In physics we often need to describe direction as well as size. For example, two forces _F_ 1 and _F_ 2 may both be 100 N and acting on a crocodile, but the crocodile's experience will be very different depending on whether the forces are both pointing north or one north and one south (Figure 2-2). In the former case he gets stretched, and in the latter case he goes flying. To describe forces we need to specify size and direction. That is, we need to use vectors. Force is a vector.

We denote vectors in diagrams by arrows, the length of the arrow showing the size of the vector and the direction of the arrow showing its direction.

We can add vectors by the tip-to-tail method. We leave the first vector fixed, and move the second vector so its tail is at the first vector's tip. If there are other vectors, then each vector gets added to the previous tip. The sum is the vector pointing from the first tail to the last tip.

Figure 2-2

**Example 1:** For the crocodiles mentioned before, if the vectors (both 100 N) both point north, then the sum is a force of 200 N pointing north (Figure 2-3, where the sum is shown dashed).

If one vector points north and the other south, then the first tail coincides with the last tip and the sum is zero (Figure 2-3).

Figure 2-3

**Example 2:** A crocodile has three forces acting on him: a 100-N force north, a 100-N force east, and a 100-N force southwest. What is the direction of the net force (that is, total force)?

**Solution:** We DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 2-4). The sum is a vector pointing northeast, about 40 N.

Figure 2-4

Note that, when you add vectors, the magnitude of the sum is equal to, at most, the sum of the individual magnitudes (and that only if they are pointing in the same direction). For instance, if three vectors of 100 N are acting on a crocodile, the sum can be anything from 0 N to 300 N, but no greater.

For MCAT problems, vector addition need not get more sophisticated than this. It is useful to keep in mind the Pythagorean theorem and elementary trigonometry.

**Example 3:** A force of 4 N is acting to the north on a rock and a force of 3 N is acting to the east.

a. What is the magnitude of the total force?

b. What is cos _φ_ , if _φ_ is the deviation from north of the direction of the total force?

**Solution:** We DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 2-5). There is a right triangle, so we can write

Figure 2-5

Also we write

cos _φ_ = 4N/5N = 0.8

If your trigonometry is rusty, now is a good time to relearn the definitions of sine, cosine, and tangent.

A vector is denoted by a half-arrow on top of a letter,  , for example.

### E. Position, Displacement, and Time

To specify position, we must give three coordinates _x, y_ , and _z_ , generally measured in [meters = m]. The symbol _s_ stands for the coordinates ( _x, y, z_ ). If an object moves from one position to another, the vector giving the change in position is the _displacement vector_ , Δ _s_ = _s_ 2 – _s_ 1. The magnitude of the displacement vector is called the _displacement_.

Time is a fundamental quantity in classical physics, denoted _t_ , measured in [seconds = s]. Often we will speak of a _time interval_ Δ _t_ = _t_ 2 – _t_ 1, that is, the time between a beginning time _t_ 1 and ending time _t_ 2. An _instant_ is a single moment of time.

### F. Velocity, Speed, and All That

We can think of the _velocity vector_ in terms of a speedometer reading with units [meters/second = m/s] and a direction. The magnitude of the velocity vector (that is, just the speedometer reading) is called _speed_. The word "velocity" is sometimes used to refer to the vector and sometimes to the magnitude. When in doubt, you should assume it refers to the vector.

If an object is traveling such that its velocity vector is constant, we say it is in _uniform motion_. An example is a car going a constant 30 m/s (freeway speed) west. We can write the following equations for uniform motion in one dimension:

When you see a formula in this text, instead of speeding by it, slow down and look at it. Ask yourself, "What is this equation telling me?" Equation (1a) is just another form of "distance equals rate times time" for an object in uniform motion. Since _v_ is constant, this tells you, for instance, that a car will travel twice as far if it travels for twice the time. This makes sense.

Equation (1b) is like the first, only Δ _x_ is replaced by its definition _x_ 2 – _x_ 1. Do you see why it is this and not _x_ 1 – _x_ 2 or _x_ 2 \+ _x_ 1?

But in some problems the velocity does change, and we must pay attention to several velocities, that is,

_v_ 1 initial velocity,

_v_ 2 final velocity,

and

_v_ avg average velocity.

The average velocity is defined as

This is different from equation (1). Equation (2) is the definition of an average velocity over a time interval when velocity is changing, whereas equation (1) defines a constant velocity and only holds for time intervals when the motion is uniform.

**Example:** A car goes west at 10 m/s for 6 s, then it goes north at 10 m/s for 5 s, and then it goes west again at 4 m/s for 15 s. What are _v_ 1, _v_ 2, and _v_ avg?

**Solution:** Well, we have _v_ 1 = 10 m/s and _v_ 2 = 4 m/s. For the average velocity we need to DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 2-6). The Pythagorean theorem gives us Δ _s_ = 130 m. Thus

Figure 2-6

### G. Acceleration

When an object's velocity vector is changing, the object is _accelerating_. Examples include a car speeding up ("accelerating" in common parlance), slowing down or braking ("decelerating", but physicists prefer to say "negatively accelerating"), and turning. In three dimensions, we define acceleration by

The numerator for equation (3a) gives the change in the velocity vector, so there is an acceleration if either the magnitude or the direction of the velocity vector change. We will talk more about this in Chapter 6. In one dimension the definition of acceleration is

The units for acceleration are [(m/s)/s = m/s · 1/s = m/s2].

**Example 1a:** Take north to be positive. A car is traveling south and speeding up. What is the sign of the acceleration?

**Solution:** Since the velocity vector points south and the car is speeding up, the acceleration vector must point south. With this sign convention, acceleration is negative.

**Example 1b:** Take north to be positive. A car traveling south speeds up from 10 m/s to 15 m/s in 10 s. What is its acceleration?

**Solution:** We write

This confirms our thinking in Example 1a.

**Example 2a:** Take north to be positive. A car is traveling north and slowing for a red light. What is the sign of the acceleration?

**Solution:** The velocity vector points north. Since this vector is shrinking, the acceleration vector must point south. Thus the acceleration is negative.

**Example 2b:** What is the acceleration for the car in Example 2a slowing from 10 m/s to 8 m/s in 1 s?

**Solution:** We write

**Example 3:** An Oldsmobile takes a certain amount of time to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph. A Porsche takes less time by a factor of 3 to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph. How does the Porsche acceleration compare with that of the Oldsmobile?

**Solution:** We look at equation (4)

Since Δ _v_ is constant, if Δ _t_ is smaller by a factor of 3, then _a_ is larger by a factor of 3.

### H. Graphs

Now we have three quantities, position, velocity, and acceleration, all related to each other algebraically. Often it is helpful to visualize these quantities graphically. The following principles apply

1. Given a graph of _x_ versus _t_ , the instantaneous slope at time _t_ is the velocity _v_ at time _t_.

2. Given a graph of _v_ versus _t_ , the instantaneous slope at time _t_ is the acceleration _a_ at time _t_.

3. Given a graph of _a_ versus _t_ , the area under the curve during interval Δ _t_ gives the change in velocity _v_ during that interval.

4. Given a graph of _v_ versus _t_ , the area under the curve during interval Δ _t_ gives the change in position _x_ during that interval.

**Example 1:** The graph of _a_ versus _t_ for a car which undergoes constant acceleration is shown in Figure 2-7. Sketch the graph of _v_ versus _t_. Assume _v_ = 0 m/s at _t_ = 0 s.

**Solution:** The area under the curve between 0 and Δ _t_ is shown in a "forward-slash" hatch. This area is Δ _v_ , that is, the change in velocity during Δ _t_. The reason for principle 3 above becomes clear if we recall the formula for the area of the rectangle representing the hatched region:

area = height x length  
Δ _v_ = _a_ Δ _t_

This is how we defined acceleration in equation (4). During the second interval Δ _t_ , the area is a Δ _t_ again. Thus the change in velocity is the same, as shown in Figure 2-8. For the next intervals of time, the quantity Δ _v_ is constant.

Figure 2-7

Figure 2-8

Note that Figures 2-7 and 2-8 give (almost) the same information in different forms. Figure 2-7 has the information that the acceleration is positive and constant, so the car is speeding up (if it is going forward). Figure 2-8 has the information that the velocity is increasing at a constant rate. This is the same thing.

Before you read the next example, consider an object thrown straight up. When it reaches the top of its path, what is the direction of its velocity? What is the direction of its acceleration?

**Example 2:** An apple is tossed straight up in the air. The graph of _y_ versus _t_ is shown in Figure 2-9. Sketch the graphs of _v_ versus _t_ and _a_ versus _t_.

**Solution:** To obtain an instantaneous slope, we can use an imaginary electron microscope to look at a small portion of the graph. A small section of Figure 2-9 has been enlarged using such a microscope. This portion looks almost straight, so we could calculate its slope if we had some numbers. We can at least read that the slope is positive and very large, hence the first point in Figure 2-10.

Figure 2-9

Figure 2-10

Figure 2-11

Figure 2-12

The second point on Figure 2-10 still has a positive slope, but smaller. The third point has a zero slope (see uppermost point in Figure 2-9). The fourth point has negative slope, and the fifth point has a slope more negative still.

It will not come as a surprise if we draw a straight line through these points, as in Figure 2-11. We take the slope at three points, but it is easy to see that the slope is constant and negative. We graph the acceleration in Figure 2-12.

Does this match your expectation? Particularly at the top of flight, did you know that the direction of the acceleration would be down?

**Example 3:** Figure 2-13 shows _v_ versus _t_ for a car. Sketch the graphs for _x_ versus _t_ and for _a_ versus _t_. (Say _x_ = 0 at _t_ = 0.)

**Solution:** Let's graph _x_ versus _t_ first. From _t_ = 0 to 1 s, there is no area under the curve, so _x_ stays constant. From _t_ = 1 to 2 s, the area under the curve is 0.5 m. (Recall the area of a triangle is _A_ = 1/2 base x height.)

From _t_ = 2 to 3 s the area under the curve is 1.5 m, so that the _x_ value jumps to 2 m (see the first graph of Figure 2-14). Between _t_ = 3 and 4 s, the area is 2 m and _x_ jumps to 4 m, and so on. Figure 2-14 shows the result.

For the graph of _a_ versus _t_ , the slope of _v_ versus _t_ for any point between _t_ = 0 and 1 s is zero. The slope jumps to 1 m/s2 for the interval from 1 to 3 s and drops back down to zero for times after 3 s. (See Figure 2-15.)

Think about all three graphs for a while and note how they give the same information in different forms.

Figure 2-13

Figure 2-15

### I. Uniform Acceleration

If an object has a constant acceleration vector, we say it undergoes _uniform acceleration_. Most MCAT problems involving acceleration will involve uniform acceleration. For uniform acceleration, we have the following:

that is, the average velocity over a period of time is the average of the beginning and ending velocities. This may seem like a natural definition of average velocity, but the definition of _v_ avg is given by equation (2), and equation (5) holds only for uniform acceleration.

See Figures 2-7 and 2-8 for an example. The velocity _v_ 1 is small, _v_ 2 is large, and vavg is exactly between them.

If we start with the definition of average velocity, we can write

This is a useful equation if you do not have and do not need the acceleration (see equation [7] below). Furthermore, if we substitute _v_ 2 = _v_ 1 \+ _a_ Δ _t_ (from equation [4]), then we obtain

This is the first equation which may seem a bit arcane. You should memorize it anyway. Working through the algebra will help you memorize it.

**Example:** A car is accelerating uniformly from rest. If it goes a distance _d_ in the first second, how far will it go in the first four seconds?

**Solution:** We want an equation involving the quantities mentioned in the problem, _a, v_ 1 = 0, Δ _x_ , and Δ _t_ , so equation (6) is it. With _v_ 1 = 0, we obtain

If Δ _t_ increases by a factor of 4, the Δ _x_ increases, and it increases by a factor of 42 = 16.

### J. Kinematic Equations for Constant Acceleration

For uniform acceleration there are four equations you should know:

The first equation we have seen before, the modified "distance equals rate times time" when velocity is changing. It should be easy to remember. The second equation is just the definition of acceleration. The third equation was in the last section. The last equation is the only one which is new, obtained by eliminating Δ _t_ from equations (7) and (8). It is useful for problems in which the time interval is neither specified nor desired.

**Example 1:** A cat drops from a ledge 2 m above the ground. If he accelerates 10 m/s2 downward due to gravity, how much time does it take him to drop?

**Solution:** Let's choose "up" to be positive and DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 2-16). We write the quantities we know:

Figure 2-16

We look for an equation which involves these quantities and no others. Equation (9) fits, so that

**Example 2:** A man drops to his death from the sixth floor of a building (20 m). As he is falling, his acceleration is a constant 10 m/s2 downward. What is his impact velocity? (He was a bad man, and if he had not died many other nice people would have.)

**Solution:** First we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 2-17). The impact velocity is the man's velocity just before he hits the ground _v_ 2. Thus our information summary is

_v_ 1 = 0 m/s

Δ _y_ = –20 m

_a_ = –10 m/s2

_v_ 2 = ?

The formula which contains this information and nothing else is (10), so that

His impact velocity is 20 m/s.

Figure 2-17

In this chapter we looked at the quantities which describe motion, that is, displacement, velocity, and acceleration, and the quantities which affect motion, that is, force and mass. Displacement is a change in location. Velocity is a measure of the change in location per unit time, while acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity per unit time. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, and force are all vectors, that is, they have direction as well as magnitude. We will be dealing with the vector nature of these quantities in future chapters. Most of the mechanics problems on the MCAT involve one dimension and uniform acceleration. In this case we can derive four equations, shown in Section J.

In addition, you should know the equations for the definition of velocity for uniform motion and of average velocity.

### Passage 1

A man is driving out of his driveway by backing up. He realizes he has forgotten his lunch, so he pulls back into the driveway. Car experts agree that the best way to do this is to press on the brake until the car comes to a complete stop, shift from reverse into first gear, then accelerate forward.

The driver, however, shifts into first gear while the car is rolling backward and pushes on the accelerator until he is going forward. This causes some wear on the transmission. The following chart shows some data about his progress. (Negative velocity = backwards.)

_t_ (s) | _x_ (m) | _v_ (m/s)  
---|---|---  
0.0 | 1.35 | –1.8  
0.5 | 0.60 | –1.2  
1.0 | 0.15 | –0.6

### Passage 2

A physics student leans out of the fortieth story of the physics building and drops two balls of the same size at the same time. One is 0.8 kg and made of iron, and the other is 1.2 kg and made of lead. Not only do the two balls hit the ground at the same time, the heights of the two balls match all the way down.

This somewhat counterintuitive result is an example of a general principle: If air resistance is negligible, then an object in free fall at the surface of the Earth has a downward acceleration of _g_ = 9.8 m/s2. Free fall means that only the force of gravity is acting on an object.

In the following questions, consider a ball dropped from the fortieth story of a building, and consider "down" to be in the positive direction. Consider air resistance negligible unless noted otherwise.

B. _g_ ( _t_ 2 – _t_ 1)

C. _g_ ( _t_ 2 \+ _t_ 1)/2

D. _g_ ( _t_ 2 \+ _t_ 1)

3. Which graph best represents velocity versus time?

A.

B.

C.

D.

4. How does the change in velocity from _t_ = 1 to 2 s compare with the change in velocity from _t_ = 3 to 4 s?

A. It is less.

B. It is the same.

C. It is greater.

D. It depends on the object.

5. How does the change in height from _t_ = 1 to 2 s compare with the change in height from _t_ = 3 to 4 s?

A. It is less.

B. It is the same.

B. 3Δ _x_

C. Δ _x_ \+ 9

7. A styrofoam ball of the same size as the lead ball takes a longer time to reach the ground. Which is a good explanation for this?

B. The force of gravity on the styrofoam ball is less than that on the lead ball.

C. Air resistance is a significant force in this problem.

D. There is a gravitational force between the ball and the building.

## Chapter 3  
Laws of Motion

### A. First Law of Motion

The following is _not_ a law of physics:

Most people think the above statement is a law of nature. Some very intelligent thinkers thought it was a law of nature, including Aristotle (ancient Greek, no intellectual lightweight) and more recently Descartes (famous philosopher). Because it is common sense (right?) that if nothing pushes on an object, it eventually slows to a stop.

But sometimes closer scrutiny conflicts with common sense, and when that happens we have to change our thinking, to retune our intuition, so that what once seemed wrong now seems right. That can be difficult, but that's physics.

Galileo discovered this law, although it's generally called Newton's first law of motion.

What does it mean for the forces to be balanced? Before we answer that question, let's look at a few cases. In the following figures (Figures 3-1a–f) we denote the motion of an object by "motion marks", so that   means the object is moving to the right.

**Case a.** There are no forces. In this case think of a rock in deep space moving along. The velocity vector is constant, meaning the rock continues traveling at constant speed to the right indefinitely.

Figure 3-1a

**Case b.** There are two opposed forces, equal in magnitude, perpendicular to the motion. In this case think of a marble rolling along a smooth level floor (no friction). Gravity pulls down, but the floor pushes up. The velocity vector is constant.

Figure 3-1b

**Case c.** This scenario is a nonexample, in which the right force is larger than the left force (hence unbalanced). The object will speed up.

Figure 3-1c

**Case d.** This scenario is also a nonexample with the left force larger than the right force. The object will slow down.

Figure 3-1d

**Case e.** Two opposed forces, left and right, are equal in magnitude. The case is between cases c and d. The object has constant velocity, that is, it will keep its speed indefinitely. Think about this one for a while. This stumps many people.

Figure 3-1e

**Case f.** The forces in all three directions are balanced. The object's velocity vector is constant.

Figure 3-1f

The forces are balanced if the vector sum of all the forces on the object is zero. We define _F_ net by

_F_ net = _F_ 1 \+ _F_ 2 +...

where _F_ 1, _F_ 2,..., are all the forces acting on an object. The vector _F_ net is the total force on the object.

**Example:** A woman kicks a soccer ball, and it rolls for a while at constant speed, then another woman stops it. Draw a diagram showing all the forces on the ball at the three times: kicking, rolling, and stopping.

**Solution:** Part a: The ball is kicked (see Figure 3-2). The vector _F_ grav is the force of gravity, and _F_ kick is the force of the foot on the ball. The symbol _N_ stands for "normal", a physics word meaning perpendicular to the ground. It is force the ground exerts on the ball.

Figure 3-2

Part b: The ball rolls along. It has only two forces acting on it (Figure 3-3). The ball does not remember (or care) what started it rolling. According to the first law, the balanced forces guarantee it will keep rolling indefinitely at constant speed.

Figure 3-3

Part c: The ball is stopped. Now there is a force of a foot on the ball as well (Figure 3-4).

Figure 3-4

Over the next several chapters there will be many problems to test your intuition on the first law.

### B. Second Law of Motion

So what happens if the forces on an object are not balanced? If the net force on an object is nonzero, then the velocity vector changes. There must be acceleration. In fact the larger the force, the larger the acceleration. (See Figure 3-5.) On the other hand, if we apply the same push to both a small car and a large car (Figure 3-6), the small car will have the larger acceleration.

Figure 3-5

Figure 3-6

We can write (in one dimension)

We have not proven this equation, but the discussion in the previous paragraph should make it seem reasonable to you.

In three dimensions, we write what is often called Newton's second law:

Most often, however, we will break up equation (2) into components:

Equation (3a), for example, states that the sum of all the horizontal forces is mass times the horizontal acceleration. We will discuss breaking vectors into vertical and horizontal components in Section 4.D.

Finally, we are able to make the connection between the units for force N] and for mass [kg], introduced in [Chapter 1. The Newton is defined by

**Example 1:** Bruce pushes a car (500 kg) on level ground starting from rest with a force 100 N. How long does it take to get the car rolling 1 m/s? (Assume no friction.)

**Solution:** We have the information _m_ = 500 kg, _v_ 1 = 0 m/s, _F_ = 100 N, and _v_ 2 = 1 m/s, and we want Δ _t_. We can find acceleration from equation (1), so we obtain

Then we can find Δ _t_ from

**Example 2:** A rocket provides a constant force to wagon A that rolls without friction. It starts from rest and after time t attains velocity v. A similar rocket providing the same force is attached to wagon B, which has five times the mass of A (Figure 3-7). How much time does it take wagon B to go from rest to velocity v? (Assume no friction.)

Figure 3-7

**Solution:** This one looks difficult, but if we write down the relevant equations, it is not so hard. We need to connect force and velocity, so we write,

We set _v_ 1 to zero because the wagons start from rest. Substitution gives

Since the problem asks about the change in time, we can solve for Δ _t_ to obtain

Now, _F_ and _v_ 2 stay the same, but m is five times larger for wagon B, so Δ _t_ is five times larger. The answer is 5 _t_.

### C. Third Law of Motion

The third law of motion is not so much a law about motion as it is a rule of thumb about pairs of forces. It is usually stated thus:

This is certainly poetic, but what does it mean? More clear (and less poetic) is the following:

**Example 1:** The Sun and the Earth exert a force of gravity on each other. Draw a force diagram.

**Solution:** See Figure 3-8.

Figure 3-8

_F_ ES = gravitational force of the Earth on the Sun,

_F_ SE = gravitational force of the Sun on the Earth.

**Example 2:** Two spacecraft push off from each other. Draw a force diagram.

**Solution:** See Figure 3-9.

Figure 3-9

_F_ 12 = contact force of craft 1 on craft 2,

_F_ 21 = contact force of craft 2 on craft 1.

**Example 3:** A basketball player jumps up. While he is in the air, he pushes the basketball horizontally. Draw all the forces _while_ he is pushing the ball. Ignore the tiny gravitational force between the player and the ball.

**Solution:** See Figure 3-10.

Figure 3-10

_F_ pb = contact force of player on ball,  
 _F_ bp = contact force of ball on player,  
 _F_ Ep = gravitational force of Earth on player,  
 _F_ pE = gravitational force of player on Earth,  
 _F_ Eb = gravitational force of Earth on ball,  
 _F_ bE = gravitational force of ball on Earth.

Notice that the magnitude of the force of the player on the ball is the same as that of the ball on the player. But the player moves hardly at all, while the ball springs toward another player. Why is the basketball affected more than the player? (Hint: Look at equation 1.)

### D. Force Diagrams

Already in this chapter we have seen a number of force diagrams. In this section we discuss some rules for drawing force diagrams. There are two types of force diagrams:

1. a diagram in which all the objects appear and the forces come in third-law pairs, and  
2. a diagram featuring one object and all its forces (or maybe several objects, but not all the objects in the situation).

In most problems we will want the second type, but it is important to know how to draw both, and knowing diagrams of the first type will help with the second type.

To draw the first type of diagram, we ask four questions:

1. What gravitational forces are important?  
2. What things are touching? (These give contact forces.)  
3. Does the problem mention any specific forces?  
4. Do the net forces in the diagram conform to expectation?

For each force we draw an arrow whose tail lies on the object _on which the force acts_. This may seem unnatural at first, but it makes things easier in the end. For some examples, look at the diagrams we drew in Section C.

**Example 1:** A girl jumps horizontally from a boat in the water. Draw all the forces on the boat, the girl, and the Earth. Ignore the tiny gravitational force between the girl and the boat, and ignore the drag force of the water on the boat.

**Solution:** First we add the gravitational forces in pairs (Figure 3-11).

Figure 3-11

Then we add the forces due to the boat and girl touching ( _F_ bg and _F_ gb) and the contact force between the Earth and the bat ( _N_ eb and _N_ bE). See Figure 3-12.

Figure 3-12

The net forces on the boat indicate that it accelerates backwards, which seems right. The net force on the girl indicates she would accelerate forward and down, which seems right. It is difficult to tell what is going on with the Earth.

**Example 2:** A vase sits on a table, which sits on the Earth. List all pairs of forces. Do this example on your own before you look at the solution.

**Solution:** See Figure 3-13.

Figure 3-13

_F_ Ev = gravitational force of Earth on the vase,  
 _F_ vE = gravitational force of vase on the Earth,  
 _F_ Et = gravitational force of Earth on the table,  
 _F_ tE = gravitational force of table on the Earth,  
 _N_ tv = contact force of table on vase,  
 _N_ vt = contact force of vase on table,  
 _N_ Et = contact force of Earth on table,  
 _N_ tE = contact force of table on Earth.

Drawing a diagram of the second type is easier, but you have to be careful not to leave out any forces nor to add any ghost forces.

**Example 3:** A roller skate is rolling frictionlessly on level ground to the left. Draw all the forces on the roller skate. STOP! Try doing this problem before looking at the solution.

**Solution:** Gravity is pulling down (question 1). And the ground is touching the skate, pushing up (question 2). There is no friction, nor any other forces, so the force diagram is Figure 3-14.

Figure 3-14

Figure 3-15

Did your diagram look like Figure 3-15 A or B? If so, you have not yet tuned your intuition about the first law of motion. Just because the skate is going to the left does not mean there is a force to the left. Only if the skate were speeding up to the left would we be forced to conclude that there was a force to the left.

In this chapter we studied Newton's laws of motion. In a sense, the first law of motion is the most subtle. If an object is moving at a constant velocity, then the forces on the object add to zero, and if the vector sum of the force vectors for an object is zero, then the object moves at constant velocity. Constant velocity means constant speed in a straight path. No force is required to keep an object moving.

The second law of motion concerns objects whose force vectors' sum is not zero: The acceleration of such an object is in the same direction as the total force, proportional to its magnitude and inversely proportional to the object's mass. That is _a_ = _F_ net/ _m_. Do you see why we use equations?

The third law states that forces come in pairs: If object 1 pushes object 2, then object 2 pushes object 1 in the opposite direction.

Pay especial attention to Section D on force diagrams. In solving problems, we are always interested in the forces on an object at a given instant in time. These include gravity, usually, and forces due to things touching the object at that moment. No other forces need to be included. In particular, do not include a force in a direction just because the object in moving in that direction.

### Passage 1

We perform an experiment which involves two masses _m_ and _M_ connected by a string which we will consider to be massless. Mass _m_ hangs over the edge of a table. The string passes over a pulley at the edge of the table and mass _M_ sits on the table, such that it moves along the table without friction. (See figure.) The tension in the string is the force that the string exerts where it is connected to another object or to more string. It is generally true that the tension anywhere along the string is the same as the tension anywhere else in the string.

In this experiment the mass _m_ is initially at rest and allowed to drop. Its position _x_ is measured downward from its initial position. At various times, the position _x_ and velocity _v_ of mass _m_ are measured and the results are recorded in the table which follows:

_t_ (s) | _x_ (m) | _v_ (m/s)

### Passage 2

The space shuttle is a spaceship which was designed for transporting a payload to near-earth orbits and to be used many times. When it stands on the launching pad, it consists of the orbiter itself, the external tank, and two booster rockets. The orbiter is 7.32 X 104 kg, while the whole assembly is 2.0 X 106 kg. The thrust at liftoff is 2.86 X 107 N, which is achieved by burning 3400 kg of fuel each second. The force provided by the engines is given by the product of the velocity of the exhaust gases relative to the ship and the rate (mass per time) at which fuel is burned.

As the space shuttle ascends, the rate of fuel burning is approximately constant, and so the mass of the shuttle decreases.

The following chart shows hypothetical data for the liftoff of a shuttle. We are assuming the shuttle moves in one dimension upward. Use 10 m/s2 for the acceleration due to gravity. The force due to gravity is _F_ grav = _Mg_ , where _M_ is the mass of the object, and _g_ is the acceleration due to gravity.

_t_ (s) | _x_ (m) | _v_ (m/s)

**A.** 4.3 m/s2

**B.** 5.4 m/s2

**C.** 8.9 m/s2

**D.** 14.3 m/s2

**2.** What is the approximate mass of the shuttle after 300 s?

**A.** 1.0 x 106 kg

**B.** 1.2 x 106 kg

**C.** 1.5 x 106 kg

**B.** The second law of motion states that acceleration is proportional to force.

**C.** The second law of motion states that acceleration is inversely proportional to mass.

**D.** The third law of motion states that there must be a second force, equal in magnitude but of opposite direction to the force accelerating the shuttle.

**5.** Consider a situation when the shuttle is in space and fires its engines, creating a force accelerating the shuttle. Which of the following BEST describes the force accelerating the shuttle?

**A.** The force of the shuttle on the air.

**B.** The force of the exhaust gases on the shuttle.

## Chapter 4  
Gravitation

### A. The Law of Gravitation

When a person does a great deal of work in a scientific field, it often happens that that person eventually receives credit for almost everything done by anybody (see Matthew 13:12 in the Christian Bible). For instance, Newton is given credit, at least in popular accounts, for almost every interesting thing that happened in science during the Renaissance. In fact, then as now, science is the activity of a community, with many people contributing to the revolution in thinking. For example, the essentials of Newton's first law of motion were discovered by Galileo, and Robert Hooke surmised the essential parts of the law of gravitation.

Newton's genius lay in his ability to see a simple underlying law for very different phenomena and to synthesize diverse branches of science. An example of this is his realization that both the motion of the Moon and the motion of a falling apple could be explained by the same force, the force of gravity. In this chapter we will study the physics of the gravitational force.

Newton's law of gravity states that any two objects exert an attractive force on each other given by

Here _F_ grav is the magnitude of the gravitational force between two objects, _m_ 1 and _m_ 2 are the masses of the objects, _d_ is the distance between the centers of the objects, and _G_ is a universal constant 6.67 x 10–11 m3/kg s2. Do not memorize _G_ , but do remember the equation. We discussed it in Chapter 1.

**Example 1:** What is the force on a cow (200 kg) standing on the surface of the Earth? (Assume _M_ Earth = 6.0 x 1024 kg, _R_ Earth = 6.4 x 106 m.)

Figure 4-1

**Solution:** Let's assume we have a spherical cow (Figure 4-1). We calculate

**Example 2:** What is the motion of an apple (0.1 kg) which has let go of its tree?

**Solution:** First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 4-2) showing all the forces on the apple while it is falling. There is only the force of gravity (nothing else is touching it), so we write

Figure 4-2

Since the total force is simply the gravitational force, we write

So the apple accelerates downward at 9.8 m/s2.

Equation (1) is easy to use in two types of problems:

1. obtaining the force between two planets ( _d_ is much larger than the radii of the planets), and  
2. obtaining the force between a planet and a small object on its surface ( _d_ is essentially the radius of the planet).

The previous examples illustrated this second use.

### B. Surface of the Earth

Most of us will spend most of our lives on or near the surface of the Earth. What is the force of gravity of the Earth on an object of mass _m_? The force is

where we use a calculation from the previous section. This number 9.8 m/s2 comes up so often in introductory physics that we have given it a name: The _acceleration due to gravity_ is

In working problems, however, we _always_ approximate this as _g_ = 10 m/s2 (even if the problem says to use 9.8 m/s2).

Please note: _Whenever_ there is gravity and we are at the surface of the Earth, which is in most problems, we will use

### C. Free Fall

An object is said to be in _free fall_ when nothing is touching it, so that the only force on it is gravity. Such an object is called a _projectile_. The simplest problem in free fall involves dropping objects near the surface of the Earth. We want to know which falls faster, a heavy object or a light one? Things become complicated if the object is too light, like a leaf fluttering to the ground, so at first we will consider two objects for which air resistance is only a small consideration. (We discuss air resistance in Chapter 6.) Let us start by doing a pair of examples.

**Example 1:** How long does it take a small rock (0.02 kg) to fall from rest 2 meters to the ground?

**Solution:** First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 4-3). There is only one force since nothing touches the rock and we are neglecting air resistance. Second, we find the net force

where the negative sign reminds us that gravity points down.

Figure 4-3

Third, we obtain acceleration by writing

(This result should look familiar.)

We also have

so that

Figure 4-4

**Example 2:** How long does it take a medium-sized rock (0.2 kg) to fall 2 meters from rest?

**Solution:** The rock is larger, and so is the force of gravity (and the force arrow, see Figure 4-4). We write

_F_ net = _F_ grav = – _Mg_ = –(0.2 kg)(10 m/s2) = –2 N

The acceleration is

_a_ = _F_ net/ _M_ = –2 N/0.2 kg = –10 m/s2

The rest of the problem is the same, so Δ _t_ = 0.63 s.

WHAT HAPPENED? The force of gravity was larger in Example 2, BUT the acceleration is inversely proportional to mass in the second law of motion. The net effect is that the acceleration is the same 9.8 m/s2 for both rocks. Try this at home with a pen and a stapler or some such thing. It is difficult to gain an intuitive grasp of this situation, but think about it until you also understand _why_ the two rocks have the same acceleration.

Let us revisit Example 2 in Section 2.H. There we saw an apple tossed straight up. It rose, came to a stop, and fell. We claimed that the acceleration was always negative (that is, down), even at the top point. We are now at a better position to understand why. Once the apple leaves the hand, there is only one force on the apple, the downward force of gravity. (See Figure 4-5.) The acceleration must be down as well. In fact, we now know the acceleration is a constant 9.8 m/s2, down.

Figure 4-5

### D. Horizontal and Vertical Motion

This section has no new equations but it does present one new idea, so prepare your imagination. A pencil and paper may prove handy.

Imagine you are sitting at the shore of a bay, and you see a boat traveling along at constant speed in a straight line. A sailor at the top of a vertical mast drops a grapefruit. (See Figure 4-6.) We will pretend air resistance plays no role (mostly true). Where will the grapefruit land?

A. In front of the mast.  
B. At the foot of the mast.  
C. Behind the mast.

Choose your answer before you read any further.

Figure 4-6

Few people choose A. Not many people choose B. If you are like most people, you chose C, thinking that somehow the boat moves out from under the grapefruit. If that was your answer, then you need to do some rethinking. Here is what really happens. Figure 4-7 shows two ships at four successive times, one ship at rest and the other in uniform motion. Sailors at the tops of the masts drop grapefruits at the same time. Both grapefruits drop to the foot of the corresponding mast.

Figure 4-7

What is going on in the previous example? Just after the grapefruit is released from the hand on the second ship, it still has its horizontal motion. If air resistance does not affect it, then it maintains its same horizontal motion from start to finish. The vertical motion, on the other hand, proceeds on schedule regardless of the horizontal motion. At _t_ = 0.2 s, both grapefruits have moved _vertically_ 0.05 m (the second has moved horizontally as well). As time goes on, the second grapefruit keeps up with the ship, and both grapefruits hit the deck at the same time.

If you do not believe the figure, try the experiment yourself. While walking at a constant speed, release an apple above your head (and a little forward). It will fall in front of your face and land at your feet. (See Figure 4-8.)

Figure 4-8

The picture of a boat in the bay and the resulting principle are due to Galileo:

Now let's leave the bay and travel to the edge of a cliff with a large plain at the bottom. We have two cannonballs, and at the same time, we shoot one horizontally off the cliff and drop the other. Which will hit the plain first?

Again, most people will say the dropped ball hits first. As long as air resistance plays at most a small role, they will hit at the same time. (See Figure 4-9.) For the second ball, the vertical motion of falling is not affected at all by its horizontal motion. It may help your intuition to realize that the shot cannonball does have a larger total velocity all the way down. Notice that Figure 4-9 looks just like Figure 4-7 with the boats removed. It is the same physical principle.

Figure 4-9

Up until now we have been using _v_ 1, _v_ 2, and _a_ to denote velocities and acceleration in one dimension. For these problems we will need to keep track of the vertical and horizontal pieces separately, so we need the symbols _v_ 1x, _v_ 2x, _a_ x, _v_ 1y, _v_ 2y, and _a_ y.

The following box shows how this principle gets translated into equations:

Objects in free fall experience only the force of gravity, so we can say more:

**Example 1:** A cliff stands 80 m above a flat plane. One cannonball is dropped, and another is fired horizontally at 120 m/s at the same time. How far from the first ball will the second ball land?

**Solution:** The first ball falls straight down, of course. Let's DRAW A DIAGRAM for the second ball while it is in flight (Figure 4-10). Note that the cannon exerts a force on the cannonball while it is in the cannon, but after the ball leaves the cannon, _the only force is gravity_.

Figure 4-10

We record the information we have. We do not know the mass of the ball, but from Section B we know we do not need it. The acceleration vector is 10 m/s2, down.

We solved the vertical problem first because we had more vertical information than horizontal information. The time Δ _t_ = 4 s was the connection between the horizontal and vertical parts. You should work through this example yourself without looking at the book.

The following example involves a _projectile_.

**Example 2:** A cannon is fired on level ground, so that the ball's initial velocity is 300 m/s and directed 30° up from the horizontal. How far from the cannon will the ball fall? (See figure 4-11.)

Figure 4-11

**Interruption:** We need to know the horizontal and vertical components of the initial velocity _v_ 1. We need to find a horizontal vector _v_ 1x and a vertical vector _v_ 1y so that their sum is the original vector _v_ 1 (see Figure 4-12). We can find the magnitudes of _v_ 1x and _v_ 1y using simple trigonometry. (You may need to review trigonometry at this point.)

Figure 4-12

**Solution** : The force diagram is the same as in Figure 4-10. The cannonball rises and then falls to the same height from which it started, so we have Δ _y_ = 0 m.

In the last line, we have divided by a factor of Δ _t_.

We have been talking about grapefruits and cannonballs so far. Objects with a more complicated shape obey the same rules, as long as we use the center of mass to talk about the position of the object. Figure 4-13 shows a baseball bat fired from a cannon. The center of mass moves in a parabola, just like the cannonball in the previous example, even though the bat is rotating. In fact this is a definition of the center of mass. If an object is set to freely rotating, the center of mass is the point which refuses to rotate. The gravitational force acts as if it were exerted only at the center of mass.

Figure 4-13

In this chapter we looked at the law of gravitation, whose grand form is

_F_ grav = _Gm_ 1 _m_ 2/ _d_ 2

For most problems near the surface of the Earth we can use simply

_F_ grav = _mg_

where _g_ = _GM_ Earth/ _R_ Earth2 = 10m/s2

When any object near the Earth's surface has only gravity acting on it (freefall), it has a downward acceleration vector of magnitude 10 m/s2. This curious result comes from the fact that the force of gravity is proportional to the mass, while the second law of motion states that the acceleration in inversely proportional to the mass.

We also explored the principle that horizontal and vertical motion are independent. This allows us to solve problems involving projectiles, that is, objects with only gravity acting on them. We will see more of this principle in the following chapter.

### Passage 2

When a massive star uses up its nuclear fuel, there is no longer enough heat to hold up its core against gravitational forces, and the core collapses. The result is an explosion, called a supernova, which leaves behind a very dense core, called a neutron star.

A neutron star is composed mainly of neutrons. It has approximately the mass of the Sun, but the radius is about 14 km, that is, 50,000 times smaller than the Sun's. The structure inside a neutron star is different from anything known on Earth, and the gravity on the surface is strong enough to crush any ordinary material. The only thing which creates a stronger gravitational field is a black hole.

Away from the surface, the tidal forces near a neutron star are nevertheless prodigious. A man falling toward a neutron star would be stretched out as he fell. He would be killed when he was about 2000 km away, and as he got closer he would be drawn as thin as a wire. Finally he would land on the surface, creating a shower of X-rays.

For these problems you may want to use the following:

**1.** What is the approximate density of a neutron star?

**A.** 2 x 1017 kg/m3

**B.** 8 x 1020 kg/m3

**C.** 1 x 1024 kg/m3

**D.** 1 x 1027 kg/m3

**2.** How does the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of a neutron star compare with that near the surface of the Sun?

**A.**   times stronger.

**B.** 50,000 times stronger.

**C.** (50,000)2 times stronger.

**D.** (50,000)3 times stronger.

**3.** The Earth is 1.5 x 1011 meters away from the Sun. If there were a planet of the same mass which was 1.5 x 1011 meters away from a neutron star, how would the neutron star's gravitational pull on that planet compare with the Sun's pull on the Earth?

**A.** It would be the same.

**B.** It would be 50,000 times stronger.

**C.** It would be (50,000)2 times stronger.

**D.** It would be 1.5 x 1011/14 times stronger.

**4.** What is the best explanation for the stretching of an object in free fall as it approaches a neutron star?

**A.** The density of the neutron star is huge.

**B.** The parts of an object which are nearer the neutron star are pulled more strongly than the parts which farther away from the star.

**C.** The strong surface gravity is due to the fact that surface gravity varies inversely as the radius.

**D.** The strong surface gravity is due to the fact that surface gravity varies inversely as the square of the radius.

## Chapter 5  
Planes and Circles

### A. Horizontal and Vertical Motion, Again

In the last chapter we solved problems with gravity as the only force. Well, gravity is a fine force indeed, but we need to understand problems in which other forces are present. That is the goal of this chapter.

In the last chapter we discussed the independence of vertical and horizontal motion for objects in freefall, but it turns out the principle works when other forces are acting as well:

This is a more useful form of _F net_ = _ma_ , the equation that we discussed in Section 3.B. An example will help illustrate how the principle in the above box is used to solve problems.

In the following example, we find a toy wagon rolling on the ground. In general, when an object is on the ground or some other surface, that surface exerts one or two forces on it: always a normal force _N_ pointing perpendicular to the surface and sometimes a frictional force _F_ fric pointing parallel to the surface. We will postpone discussing friction until Chapter 6.

**Example:** A boy pulls a red wagon (10 kg) with a constant force 20 N. The handle makes an angle 30° with the horizontal. Assume there is no friction.

a. If the wagon starts from rest, how fast is it going after 3 seconds?

b. What is the normal force acting on the wagon?

**Solution:** First we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 5-1) showing all the forces on the wagon body. The handle and the ground are the only two things which touch it. So in addition to gravity, there are the tension due to the handle and the normal force. The tension _T_ points along the handle, that is, 30° from the horizontal.

Figure 5-1

In Figure 5-2 we resolve the tension into components (recall trigonometry), so we have

Figure 5-2

The normal force and gravity do not have horizontal components, so the only horizontal force is _T_ x. Thus we write

( _F_ net)x = _ma_ x,  
 _T_ x = _ma_ x,  
 _a_ x, = _T_ x/ _m_ = 17N/10kg = 1.7 m/s2

Using this and _v_ 1 _x_ = 0 m/s and Δ _t_ = 3 s, we derive a horizontal velocity

_v_ 2x = _v_ 1x \+ _a_ xΔ _t_  
= 0 m/s + 1.7 m/s2(3s) = 4.1 m/s

which is the answer to part a.

If we consider the vertical components of force, then we can find ( _F_ net)y just by looking at the diagram, so we write

( _F_ net)y = _N_ \+ _T_ y – _F_ grav

where we use the positive sign for forces which point up; negative for down. Now the second law of motion connects this with vertical acceleration, so that

( _F_ net)y = _ma_ y

But the cart is not moving vertically, so we know that _v_ y is constant (and zero) and thus _a_ y is zero. This means ( _F_ net)y is zero, so we have

0 = _N_ \+ _T_ y – _F_ grav,  
 _N_ = _F_ grav – _T_ y  
= _mg_ – _T_ y  
= (10kg)(10m/s2) – 10N  
= 90 N.

Notice that the normal force is not the same as the gravitational force, a mistake often made by students. Why is the normal force not the same as gravity?

Note that in solving part a, we used information about forces to obtain the horizontal acceleration _a_ x and then the answer. In part b we reasoned the other way, using information about the vertical acceleration _a_ y = 0 to obtain information about the normal force. This strategy of reasoning in both directions will be useful in many problems.

### B. Inclined Planes and Force Components

The following method generally works for force problems in two dimensions:

1. DRAW A DIAGRAM.

2. Draw all the forces on the object(s) in question (see Section 3.D).

3. Decide the orientation of the axes ("horizontal" and "vertical").

4. Divide the forces into components if necessary.

5. Solve ( _F_ net)y = _ma_ y and ( _F_ net)x = _ma_ x.

For the last step, note that we often have _a_ y = 0, leading to ( _F_ net)y = 0. Also, be on the lookout for the words "constant velocity" or the equivalent, since that implies _a_ x = 0 and _a_ y = 0, a force balance.

The principle of the independence of the components of the _F_ = _ma_ equation is valid even when the axes are tilted, as the next example will show.

**Example:** A toy car of mass 40 grams is released at the top of an incline of plastic track, inclined 30° from the horizontal. The car starts from rest and travels 4 m to the floor. Assuming there is no friction, how much time does it take the car to reach the floor?

**Solution:** First we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 5-3). In addition to gravity, the track touches the car and exerts a normal force. Since the track is inclined, the normal force points not up but perpendicular to the surface. There is no frictional force.

Figure 5-3

We will call "horizontal" the direction along the track and "vertical" the direction perpendicular to the track (Figure 5-3).

Next, we divide the gravitational force into components (Figure 5-4). Note that _F_ x and _F_ y are not new forces but pieces of _F_ grav. If we add _F_ x and _F_ y together like vectors (tip-to-tail), then we get _F_ grav. It may not be obvious that the two angles shown in Figure 5-4 should both be _θ_ = 30°. Note that both angles labeled _θ_ are complementary to the angle between _F_ x and _F_ grav. On the other hand, in physics it is generally true that two small angles which look congruent are congruent(!).

Figure 5-4

Now if we look at the triangle in Figure 5-4, we can write

We care about the horizontal motion, so we write

( _F_ net)x = _ma_ x

The only horizontal force is _F_ x, so we write

_F_ x = _ma_ x

_mg_ sin _θ_ = _ma_ x

_g_ sin _θ_ = _a_ x

_a_ x = (10 m/s2)sin 30° = 5 m/s2

We have _v_ 1x = 0 m/s and Δ _x_ = 4 m, so we can find Δ _t_ by writing

### C. Circular Motion, Qualitative Description

Let's think a minute about a toy car moving along the floor and pretend the movement is frictionless. Figure 5-5 shows a top view, with the car moving to the right (see the motion marks behind the car). If we were to apply a rightward force _F_ A, by blowing the car with a portable hair dryer, for instance, this would clearly speed up the car. If we were to apply a leftward force _F_ B, this would slow it down. A force _F_ C applied (for just a moment) perpendicular to the motion would neither speed it up nor slow it down, but it would cause the car to veer from its straight path.

Figure 5-5

If we are using a hair dryer to exert _F_ C, then we can keep adjusting the direction of the force to keep it perpendicular to the motion of the car. The car will end up traveling in a circle (Figure 5-6). Given this discussion, the following box should seem reasonable.

Figure 5-6

In normal English, we do not say that the car is accelerating when it is turning. But in physics language, an object that is moving at constant speed in a circle is "accelerating toward the center of the circle", because the _velocity vector_ is changing. We call this _centripetal acceleration_ , which is Latin for "toward the center". (Parenthetically, "centrifugal" means "away from the center".) The force which provides the centripetal acceleration is the _centripetal force_.

**Example 1:** The Earth moves around the Sun. What force provides the centripetal force?

**Solution:** The gravitational force provides the centripetal force (Figure 5-7).

Figure 5-7

**Example 2:** A car goes around a curve to the left. What force provides the centripetal force?

**Solution:** This example is a bit more complicated. The driver turns her wheels to the left, so the wheels exert a force on the road to the right. By Newton's Third Law of Motion, the road exerts a force to the left on the wheels, turning the car left. In this case friction provides the centripetal force (Figure 5-8). (Think what would happen if there were no friction, for instance, if there were oil on the road.)

Figure 5-8

**Example 3:** A father is driving a car and turns to the left. There is a sack of groceries in the front passenger seat which crashes into the passenger door. The little brother Samson in the back seat asks the father why the groceries crashed into the door. The father says that was due to centrifugal force. The older sister Cadenza rolls her eyes at this, thinking about how much physics her brother will have to unlearn as he grows up. What is the correct explanation for the groceries' crashing into the door?

**Solution:** Figure 5-9 gives the real story. The groceries are going along a straight path, as we would expect according to the first law of motion. The car door is pulled into the path of the groceries. The father invents the word "centrifugal force" in order to hide his ignorance. Whenever you are tempted to explain something by centrifugal force, it is likely that you can explain it better with the ideas of first law of motion and a turning frame of reference (like the car).

Figure 5-9

### D. Circular Motion, Quantitative Description

An object moving in a circle has an acceleration which has, in general, two components: the centripetal acceleration and the tangential acceleration. The former is directed toward the center and is responsible for changing the direction of the object. The latter is responsible for changing the speed. The acceleration is given by

**Example 1:** A bombardier beetle sits on a blade of a windmill which is going counterclockwise and slowing down. The blade is at the top of its cycle. Sketch the acceleration vector.

**Solution:** In Figure 5-10, if the beetle is going left and slowing down, then the tangential acceleration must be to the right. The centripetal acceleration vector is down, and the total acceleration _a_ is shown.

Figure 5-10

**Example 2:** Use the following information to find the mass of the sun:

_G_ = 6.67 x 10–11 m3/kg s2  
 _R_ = 1.5 x 1011 m (distance from the Sun to the Earth)

**Solution:** First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM showing all the forces (Figure 5-11). Some students are tempted to draw two forces on the Earth: a gravitational and a centripetal force. But the only force is gravity, and this provides the centripetal force in this problem. This last sentence provides the clue for solving the problem. We know expressions for gravitation and for centripetal acceleration, so that we have

We use _M_ Earth on the right-hand side of the equation, because it is the Earth's acceleration we are concerned about. The Sun's acceleration is much smaller because its mass is larger. (Recall that the force the Earth exerts on the Sun is the same as that which the Sun exerts on the Earth.) Note that _M_ Earth cancels.

Figure 5-11

What expression shall we use for _v_? What is the velocity of the Earth? If the Earth travels a full circuit in a year, then velocity is simply distance per time, where the distance is the circumference of the circle. Thus we write

where _T_ is 1 year. Do not simply memorize this, but take a minute to think about why this equation is true, so it will come immediately to mind in any similar situations. Substituting this into equation (7) and doing some algebra gives

into which we can substitute the values given in the problem, along with

to yield

The importance of this example does not lie in the arithmetic. The important parts are the method of setting two expressions for the same force equal to each other and the use of equation (8).

**Example 3:** A fan spins at a frequency of 50 cycles per second, and its plastic blades are 0.4 meters long. What is the centripetal acceleration of a piece of plastic at the tip of one of the blades?

**Solution:** You should try to work this out before you read the solution.

If the fan spins at 50 cycles per second, it must undergo one cycle in one fiftieth of a second, so _T_ = 1/50 s = 0.02 s. The velocity is given by

so the acceleration is given by

**Example 4:** A space warrior must fly his spacecraft at constant speed around a spherical space station "Bad Star". Bad Star is large but not large enough to have an atmosphere or gravity worth considering. It is important for the warrior to stay close to the surface and maintain constant speed. A conventional rocket provides the thrust to maintain course, so the plume appears in the opposite direction of the desired thrust. In which direction (Figure 5-12) would we see the plume?

Figure 5-12

Stop! Think about his question and answer it before you look at the solution on the next page.

**Solution:** No one chooses B. Few people choose A. In fact, almost everyone chooses E, because they are thinking about a car driving on the surface of the Earth. But a car on the Earth's surface encounters the force of drag, both by friction and by air resistance, whereas the space warrior encounters neither. No force is required to maintain constant speed. If you chose E, it means you need to study the first law of motion again.

Okay, what is the correct way to think of this problem? The net force of the spacecraft is down, toward the center of Bad Star, because the craft is moving at constant speed in a circle. there is no gravity, no friction, no air drag, so the only force on the craft is due to the rockets. Therefore the rocket plume points in the direction of A.

Some students object that a rocket firing in the direction of A would push the craft into the Bad Star. This is the same as objecting that if the Earth pulls on the Moon, it ought to fall down. What holds up the Moon? The answer in both cases is that the centripetal force is large enough to keep the object (spacecraft or Moon) from moving away but not so large as to pull them into the ground. That is, in Figure 5-13, path 1 is the path the spacecraft takes if the warrior does not fire his rockets at all (no force). Path 2 is the path if he does not fire the rockets enough; and path 4, if he fires them too much. Path 3 is just right.

Figure 5-13

The most important concept in this chapter is the independence of horizontal and vertical motion. We saw this concept for the first time in Chapter 4. In this chapter we have used the concept to solve problems involving inclined planes and oblique forces, that is, forces which are neither horizontal nor vertical.

We also looked at circular motion. If an object is moving in a circle, its velocity vector is not constant, and the object must be accelerating. If the object is moving at constant speed, then the direction of the acceleration vector is toward the center, called centripetal acceleration, and its magnitude is _a_ cent = _v_ 2/ _r_.

### Passage

Consider an object sitting on a scale at the surface of the Earth. The scale reading is the magnitude of the normal force which the scale exerts on the object. To a first approximation, there is force balance, and the magnitude of the scale's force is the magnitude of the gravitational force:

where _G_ is Newton's constant, _M_ Earth is the mass of the Earth, and _R_ Earth is the radius of the Earth. The simple result is that the force of gravity, and the reading of the scale, is proportional to the mass:

where _g_ has the value _GM_ Earth/ _R_ Earth2 = 9.8 m/s2. We have made several idealizations, however, and if we want to calculate the scale reading, we need to be more careful.

For example, we have ignored the rotation of the Earth. Consider a man standing on a scale at the equator. Because he is moving in a circle, there is a centripetal acceleration. The result is that the scale will not give a reading equal to the force of gravity (equation [1]).

We have also assumed that the Earth is a perfect sphere. Because it is rotating, the distance from the center of the Earth to the equator is greater than the distance from center to pole by about 0.1%.

A third effect we have ignored is that the Earth has local irregularities which make it necessary to measure _g_ in the local laboratory, if we need an exact value of the effective acceleration due to gravity.

**1.** For a man standing at the equator of a rotating Earth, which expression gives the best expression of his velocity? (Let _T_ day be the time of one rotation, 1 day.)

**A.** _R_ Earth/ _T_ day

**B.** 2 _π R_ Earth/ _T_ day

**C.** _gT_ day

**D.** 2 _π gT_ day

**2.** If we know the period of the man's motion, and we want to calculate the centripetal force on him, what is the minimum number of other data that we need?

**A.** 1: the radius of the Earth.

**B.** 2: the radius of the Earth and the velocity of the man.

**C.** 2: the radius of the Earth and the mass of the man.

**D.** 3: the radius of the Earth, the velocity of the man, and the mass of the man.

**3.** Which is the best force diagram for a man standing at the equator of a rotating Earth?

**A.**

**B.**

**C.**

**D.**

**4.** If the man at the equator stood on a scale, how would the scale read compared to the scale reading for an identical man standing at the equator of a nonrotating Earth?

**A.** It would read less than on a nonrotating Earth.

**B.** It would read the same as on a nonrotating Earth.

**C.** It would read greater than on a nonrotating Earth.

**D.** It would depend on where the man is.

**5.** If two identical men stood on scales at the south pole and at the equator of an Earth identical to this one but nonrotating, how would the reading of the polar scale compare to the equatorial one?

**A.** It would be less.

**B.** It would be the same.

**C.** It would be greater.

**D.** There is not enough information to answer this question.

## Chapter 6  
Friction and Air Resistance

### A. Introduction

So far in this book, we have ignored friction in order to make problems easier and to understand the basic principles behind motion. On the other hand, there cannot be too many practical applications of such a theory without friction, since few of the surfaces in this world are frictionless, and it is difficult to go anywhere without air resistance (especially if you go by car).

_Friction_ is a force that opposes the slipping of two surfaces, so it acts parallel to the boundary between the surfaces. We generally think of friction as the force that slows things down, but that is not the best way to consider it. When you step on the accelerator of a car, what force makes the car go faster? None other than the friction between the tires and the road. What happens when you try to accelerate on ice?

There are two types of friction: _static friction_ , which is relevant when the surfaces are not slipping, and _kinetic friction_ , which is relevant when the surfaces are slipping.

### B. Static friction

Let us consider an example. Muffin the cat is trying to budge a waste-paper basket in order to see what is under it. Before she starts, the forces on the basket are those shown in Figure 6-1. She begins to push, but the basket does not budge. The force of friction has shown up and exactly balances her pushing force (Figure 6-2). When she pushes harder, the frictional force becomes larger, frustrating her effort (Figure 6-3).

Figure 6-1

Figure 6-2

There is a maximum for friction, and that is shown in Figure 6-4 as a dashed vector, labeled _F_ max. If she can manage to push harder than the theoretical maximum, then the basket will move. At that time we no longer have a problem in static friction.

Figure 6-3

Figure 6-4

There are two principles here:

Also

**Example:** Beth (45 kg) has tied a rope around her brother's waist. Vincent (20 kg) is on the slippery slope of a river bank making an angle 30° with the horizontal. The coefficient of static friction between him and the bank is 0.2.

a. If she does not pull on the rope, will he slide down into the river, which is infested with crocodiles?

b. If so, what is the smallest force she must exert parallel to the bank in order to keep him from slipping?

**Solution:** First, we need to DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 6-5). First, there is the force of gravity. The bank is touching him, so there is a normal force. There is also friction and possibly the rope. At any rate, these act along the bank, so we label them _F_ need, that is, the force needed to keep him from sliding.

Figure 6-5

In Figure 6-6 we divide gravity into components.

Figure 6-6

The "vertical" equation becomes

because if Vincent does not move, then _a_ y = 0. Thus we have

The "horizontal" equation becomes

If Vincent is being held still by friction, or by friction and his sister's rope, then we must have _a_ x = 0. Then we have

Equation (1) becomes

which is clearly insufficient. Beth must pull with a force

_F_ Beth = (100 – 34)N = 66 N

If Beth pulls with a force 66 N, then static friction provides 34 N, enough to keep Vincent from slipping down. If she wants to pull Vincent up the slope, then she must pull hard enough to exceed the static friction maximum in the other direction. That is, friction would pull _down_ the slope, and she would have to pull up the slope with a force (100 + 34)N = 134 N.

### C. Kinetic friction

Once the static friction maximum is exceeded, the surface involved in a problem begins to slip, and we have a problem involving kinetic friction.

You might have thought that, the faster an object slides, the more friction it experiences. This is _not_ true. (It is true for air resistance, but not friction.)

Also, you might have thought that there would be more friction for an object with more surface touching (see the second picture in Figure 6-7), but again, this is not true. The friction depends only on the coefficient of friction and the normal force.

Figure 6-7

**Example 1:** Brad pushes a stove (100 kg) in a straight path across the level floor at constant speed 0.2 m/s. The coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.3 for the stove and the floor. What is the force that Brad must apply?

**Solution:** First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 6-8a). The words "constant speed" and "straight path" should send bells off in our head. There is no acceleration, so the vertical equation becomes,

Equation (2) gives the friction

The horizontal equation becomes

Think about this. Brad's pushing force is equal in magnitude to the frictional force.

"But wait a minute!" some readers will cry. "Doesn't Brad have to _overcome_ the force of friction for the stove to be moving? Brad's force must be _greater_ than the frictional force!" But that is exactly not the case. If the stove is moving at _constant speed_ , then the forces must balance. If Brad exceeded the force of friction, the stove would be accelerating.

Perhaps it would help if we looked at the whole Brad/stove story. When Brad approaches the stove, the force diagram on the stove looks like Figure 6-8b. As Brad begins to push on the stove, the friction vector gets larger, as in Figure 6-8c. The moment Brad exceeds _F_ s,max, the stove budges, and the force of friction shrinks from _F_ s,max to _F_ k. Now there is a net force on the stove, and it accelerates from rest (Figure 6-8d). Once the stove is moving, it gets away (a little) from his hands, and Brad's force decreases to become _F_ k. At this point the stove has attained some constant speed, which it keeps. See Figure 6-8a, where the two horizontal vectors are equal in magnitude.

Figure 6-8a

Figure 6-8b

Figure 6-8c

Figure 6-8d

**Example 2:** A student is pushing a chalk eraser (0.1 kg) across a level desk by applying a force 0.3 Newtons at an angle directed downward, but 30° from the horizontal. The eraser is moving at constant speed 0.1 m/s across the desk (in a straight line). What is the coefficient of friction between the eraser and the desk?

**Solution:** First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 6-9). Constant velocity tells us that ( _F_ net)x and ( _F_ net)y are zero. The vertical equation becomes

The horizontal equation becomes

Thus we can calculate _μ_ k

Figure 6-9

**Example 3:** A car (1000 kg) is traveling downhill at 20 m/s in the rain. The grade of the road is 20%, which means that for every 100 meters of road, the vertical drop is 20 meters. The driver sees Bambi in the road and slams on the brakes. The coefficient of kinetic friction between the tires and the road is 0.5. How much time does it take the car to skid to a halt? (Hint: If _θ_ is the angle between the horizontal and the road, then cos _θ_ = 0.98 and sin _θ_ = 0.2. Also _g_ = 10 m/s2.)

**Solution:** Here we will merely sketch a solution. You should try to work out the details. Figure 6-10 shows the force diagram. Working out the vertical equation with ( _F_ net)y = 0 gives

_N_ = 9800 N.

Kinetic friction is then

_F_ k = 4900 N.

Working out the horizontal equation (there is a net force) gives

Using the acceleration, the initial velocity, and the final velocity _v_ 2x = 0, we obtain

Δ _t_ = 7 s.

(Bambi was unscathed, but only because he jumped off the road in time.)

Figure 6-10

### D. Stick/slip

The fact that _μ_ k is generally less than _μ_ s means that, in many situations, the friction will switch back and forth from kinetic to static. Picture pulling a potato with a rubber band, so static friction initially prevails. After the rubber band stretches enough, the potato moves and kinetic friction takes over. But then the rubber band has contracted again, so the potato stops, and static friction prevails. By this time you are pulling again. This is called _stick/slip_ , for obvious reasons.

The stick/slip phenomenon is responsible for the squeal of bus brakes. It is also responsible for the eh-eh-eh-eh-eh sound when you rub your hair after a shower or your dishes after washing. These are some very practical applications of physics.

### E. Air resistance

We have neglected air resistance thus far mainly for one reason, and that is that air resistance makes problems more difficult. Air resistance, or drag, depends on the velocity that an object is going, and not always in a simple way. Thus it is difficult to work problems without a computer.

There are a few things we can say about drag. Consider an object moving through a substance, such as air or water. It is reasonable that a larger object would experience more drag than a smaller one. We might also expect that the drag would be larger for a faster moving object. Finally it is reasonable to expect that a dense fluid would exert more drag than a "thin" fluid. It will not be a surprise, then, that the formula for drag is

_F_ drag = _CρAv_ 2

where C is a constant equal to about 0.2, _ρ_ is the density of the fluid, A is the cross-sectional area of the moving object, and v is its velocity. This equation is reasonably accurate if the fluid is "roughed up" a bit by the object's passing through. For cars driving and people walking through air and for fish swimming through water, this is a reasonable assumption.

You do not have to memorize this equation, but do know how to use it. The force is placed in the force diagram like all the other forces, except it points necessarily opposite the direction of motion.

**Example 1:** A dog Nikki (7 kg) falls five stories (3.3 meters each) down from a roof with his stomach pointing down. He is 0.2 meters tall, and 0.15 meters wide and 0.4 meters from nose to tail. The density of air is 1.29 kg/m3.

a. If we ignore air resistance, what is the terminal velocity of the dog?

b. What is the air resistance by the time the dog gets to the bottom?

c. Is air resistance a small or large effect in this problem?

**Solution:** a. First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 6-11). We are hoping that the force of air resistance is small. We have

We use the kinematic equation that does not involve Δt, so we have

b. The cross-sectional area presented by the dog is (0.4 m)(0.15 m) = 0.06 m2. It does not matter how tall Nikki is. Thus

c. Air resistance is about 10% of the dog's weight (70 N). This implies that the dog's weight is the dominant force all the way down, and we are justified in ignoring air resistance. Our answer is good with no more than about 10% error.

Nikki is a stunt dog. He was unharmed.

Figure 6-11

**Example 2:** A rubber ball (radius 2 cm, mass 5 grams) is dropped from a height of 50 meters. What is its velocity when it reaches the ground?

**Solution:** If we work out the problem as in Example 1a above, we run into trouble. Ignoring air resistance yields v2 = 32 m/s. (You should work this out.) The cross-sectional area is the area of a circle π _r_ 2, not the total surface area of a sphere. If we calculate the force due to air resistance at the bottom of flight, we obtain

whereas the weight of the ball is _F_ grav = _mg_ = 0.05 N. The calculated force _F_ air is not small at all in comparison. In fact, it is much larger than the force of gravity. Any assumption that air resistance is negligible is not valid. We need a new idea in order to solve this.

The new idea follows. If the ball has fallen so far that it has stopped accelerating then the gravity force down and the air resistance force up are balanced. Then the force diagram would look like the one in Figure 6-12. The force equation becomes

As the ball falls, its velocity increases until it begins to get close to 12 m/s. The air resistance increases until it balances the force of gravity. Force balance occurs when _v_ = 12 m/s. This velocity is called _terminal velocity_.

Figure 6-12

**Example 3:** A man (60 kg) falls from a very tall building (200 m). The cross-sectional area for his fall is 0.3 m2.

a. What equation governs the fall?

b. What is his velocity when he reaches the bottom?

Figure 6-13

**Solution:** a. First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 6-13). The force equation becomes

b. An analysis similar to the one in Example 1 shows that ignoring air resistance yields _v_ 2 = 63 m/s. If we calculate Fair, as in Example 1, we obtain 310 N, about half of the man's weight. This shows that ignoring air resistance is wrong since 310 N is not small compared to _F_ grav = 600 N. But _F_ air is not large compared to _F_ grav either. Our calculations show that air resistance is too large to be ignored, but not so large as to assure force balance. This problem is just too hard.

In this chapter we looked at friction and air resistance. Friction is a force which opposes the slipping of surfaces, and it always acts parallel to the surface. Situations involving friction fall into two categories: static and kinetic. If the surfaces are not slipping, then static friction is the force which maintains the status. We solve for the frictional force using force balance. The static friction cannot be larger than the maximum, given by _F_ s,max = _μ_ s _N_.

If the surfaces are slipping, then kinetic friction opposes the slipping. Its magnitude is given by _F_ k = _μ_ k _N_.

The MCAT does not have many problems involving air resistance. Generally you just need to know that air resistance is a retarding force that depends on the surface area, density of the medium, and velocity of the object.

### Passage 1

The Drum of Discomfort is an amusement park ride which consists of a large vertical hollow cylinder which turns on its axis. A person of mass _M_ enters the drum (inside-radius _R_ ) while the drum is still and stands against the wall. The drum begins to turn, until it achieves uniform rotation with period _T_ and the rider feels as if some force is pushing him against the wall (see figure). Then the floor drops down, so there is nothing touching the bottoms of the rider's shoes.

### Passage 2

When an object moves through a fluid, there is a drag force which retards its motion. Its magnitude is given by

where _C_ (= 0.2) is a constant, _ρ_ is the density of the fluid, _A_ is the cross-sectional area of the object normal to the flow direction, and _v_ is its velocity relative to the fluid.

Equation (1) is valid only if the fluid flow develops whirls and eddies, that is, approaching the onset of turbulence. (If the fluid is essentially undisturbed, then the drag force is actually greater than the value given in equation [1].) The extent to which a fluid is disturbed is determined by a dimensionless constant called the Reynolds number, defined by

where _l_ is the linear size of the object and _η_ is the viscosity of the fluid, a measure of its stickiness. A table of densities and viscosities is shown below.

substance | _ρ_ (kg/m3) | _η_ (kg/m s)  
---|---|---  
air | 1.29 | 1.8 x 10–5  
water | 1.0 x 103 | 1.0 x 10–3  
mercury | 1.36 x 104 | 1.6 x 10–3

If _Re_ is greater than about 100, then equation (1) for _F_ drag is fairly accurate. The Reynolds number also determines when turbulence begins. If _Re_ is greater than about 2 x 105, then the fluid develops whirls and eddies that break off from the flow in an essentially unpredictable manner, i.e., turbulence.

(Note: _g_ = 9.8 m/s2.)

**1.** For a cube 2 m by 2 m by 2 m moving through the air, what velocities would make equation (1) valid?

**A.** Any velocity less than about 10–3 m/s.

**B.** Any velocity greater than about 10–3 m/s.

**C.** Any velocity less than about 1 m/s.

**D.** Any velocity greater than about 1 m/s.

**2.** For a car 1.5 m high, 2 m wide, and 3 m long, what is the cross-sectional area _A_ appropriate for equation (1)?

**A.** 3.5 m2

**B.** 3 m2

**C.** 6 m2

**D.** 9 m2

**3.** Consider a car (1000 kg) of dimensions in the above question. What is the drag force on such a car if it is going 30 m/s?

**A.** 700 N

**B.** 9800 N

**C.** 20,000 N

**D.** 40,000 N

**4.** How fast would a car have to be going for turbulence to develop behind it?

**A.** Any velocity less than about 10–3 m/s.

**B.** Any velocity greater than about 10–3 m/s.

**C.** Any velocity less than about 1 m/s.

**D.** Any velocity greater than about 1 m/s.

**5.** For a fish (0.1 m by 0.1 m by 0.1 m) swimming at constant velocity in the ocean at 2 m/s, what thrust would it exert?

**A.** 0.01 N

**B.** 8 N

**C.** 80 N

**D.** 2 x 105 N

**6.** On Venus, rain presumably consists of sulfuric acid droplets in a carbon dioxide atmosphere. Consider a water raindrop on Earth, and a drop of equal size and mass of sulfuric acid on Venus. The acceleration due to gravity on Earth's surface is approximately the same as the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of Venus. Consider the following possibilities:

I. The chemical composition of the drop.

II. The temperature of the atmosphere.

III. The pressure of the atmosphere.

Which of the above affect(s) the terminal velocity with which rain falls?

**A.** I only.

**B.** II and III.

**C.** I and III.

**D.** I, II, and III.

### Passage 3

Most physical situations are quite complicated, involving a number of forces or interactions even in the simplest of cases. Much of the praxis of physics is breaking a problem into parts, treating some parts exactly and ignoring other parts. Once we have solved the idealized problem, we can use the solution to evaluate the appropriateness of the idealizing assumptions.

A simple example of this is the analysis of a tennis ball falling from a height at the surface of the Earth. The ball consists of many atoms, connected by chemical forces. In addition to the chemical forces, each atom is pulled by all the pieces of the Earth. The first idealization we make is that we can treat the ball as a point mass located at its center and the Earth as a point mass located at its center. Second, we ignore the gradient of the gravitational field, so that allows us to approximate the force of gravitation on the ball as _F_ grav = _mg_ , where _g_ ≈ 9.8 m/s2 is a constant.

The third effect we generally ignore is air resistance. If we ignore air resistance, we can calculate the idealized maximum velocity of the falling ball and then calculate the force of air drag. This is given by

where _C_ (= 0.2) is a constant, _ρ_ (= 1.3 kg/m3) is the density of air, _A_ is the cross-sectional area of the ball, and _v_ is its velocity relative to the air. If the air resistance is small, then we were justified in ignoring it.

If air resistance is important, it is possible that we can still do the problem. If the ball falls far enough for there to be a force balance _F_ net = 0, then we can use equation (1) to solve the problem. (Actually we can only require that _F_ net be small compared to the other forces in the problem.)

For the following problems, consider a ball of radius 0.03 m and mass 0.05 kg which is tossed upward at initial velocity 3 m/s.

**1.** If there were no air, to what idealized height would the ball travel?

**A.** 0.46 m

**B.** 0.92 m

**C.** 1.84 m

**D.** 176.4 m

**2.** What is the initial drag force on the ball?

**A.** 3 x 10–4 N

**B.** 7 x 10–3 N

**C.** 0.7 N

**D.** 50 N

**3.** If we are going to ignore air resistance, the drag force must be small compared to

**A.** the normal force.

**B.** the centripetal force.

**C.** the gravitational force.

**D.** the frictional force.

**4.** We have idealized the gravitational field as being uniform. If we remove that idealization, what happens to the force of gravity as the ball travels toward the top of its flight?

**A.** The force of gravity decreases.

**B.** The force of gravity increases.

**C.** The force of gravity decreases, then disappears at the top.

**D.** The force of gravity decreases, then increases.

**5.** In the idealized problem, the ball attains a certain maximum height and afterward attains a final velocity just before it reaches the ground. If air resistance is included,

**A.** the height is less, and the terminal velocity is less.

**B.** the height is less, but the terminal velocity is greater.

**C.** the height is greater, but the terminal velocity is less.

**D.** the height is greater, and the terminal velocity is greater.

**6.** Cats falling from large heights often survive the fall. In fact, it has been found that a cat falling from a building at very great height (e.g., ten stories) has a better chance of surviving than a cat falling from a lesser height (five stories). Which, if true, could best explain this?

**A.** The air is more dense near the ground.

**B.** The force of gravity on the cat is greater near the ground.

**C.** Cats falling for a while tend to stretch out their legs.

**D.** Greater velocity leads to a greater force of drag.

## Chapter 7  
Torques and Properties of Solids

### A. Introduction

In the first six chapters, we have talked as if all things were points or boxes which move by sliding or gliding. In this chapter we will discuss the ability of real objects to rotate, stretch, and bend. These topics are slightly more complicated than previous topics, and their study quickly moves beyond the scope of the MCAT. For this reason, we will cover only the main points and the simpler problems. Even so, you may find this chapter difficult. So work carefully, and if you do not understand everything the first time, work through the rest of the book before coming back to it.

### B. Language of Rotation

In Chapter 3 we discussed force, mass, and motion. A large force on a small mass will produce a large change in velocity in a given time.

Now let's consider a 10-kg bicycle wheel of diameter 1 meter and a 10-kg pipe of diameter 5 cm, both at rest (Figure 7-1). Now we want to set them spinning by giving them a twist. Which is more difficult to set spinning?

Figure 7-1

Even though they have the same mass, the bicycle wheel has a greater _moment of inertia_ than the pipe, and applying a twist to it will not have as great an effect as applying the same twist to the pipe. For the simple shape of a ring (or pipe) turning about a central axis, the moment of inertia is

where _M_ is the mass of the object and _R_ is the radius. Do not memorize the equation, but do remember the general rule: If two objects have the same mass, then the object with greater radius will have a greater moment of inertia and thus will be more difficult to set spinning from rest.

If an object, like a bicycle wheel, is spinning, then the _period T_ is the time it takes for one revolution. The _frequency f_ is the number of revolutions per unit time, so

which is measured in [1/s = Hertz = Hz].

A _torque_ is a twist, which can change the frequency at which an object is spinning. A large torque on an object with a small moment of inertia will produce a large change in its frequency of rotation. Note the similarity with the second law of motion.

Notice that the moment of inertia depends also on the axis about which an object is turning. We can twist a barbell about its central axis, or about a perpendicular axis (see Figure 7-2). The moment of inertia with respect to the perpendicular axis is greater than that with respect to the central axis, because of the greater radius.

Figure 7-2

### C. Torque

In order to calculate a torque, we always have a pivot P0 (where the axis is) and a force acting at another point P1. For example, in Figure 7-3, the pivot is at the crocodile's belly, and the force _F_ acts at his snout at P1.

Figure 7-3

The torque is defined by

where _τ_ is the torque, _r_ is the distance from P0 to P1, _F_ is the size of the force, and _φ_ is the angle between the direction of the force and the line P0 and P1. But is _φ_ the big angle or the little angle? Well, it turns out it doesn't matter, since we are taking the sine, and the sines of supplementary angles are the same. Recall that

Also the convention is that

counterclockwise = positive torque

clockwise = negative torque.

Up until this chapter, we have drawn force vector arrows anywhere as long as the tail of the arrow sat on the object the force acted on. In doing torque problems, we must be more careful to put the arrows in the right place.

**Example 1:** A large tarot card (the Fool) measuring 0.3 m by 0.4 m lies at the lower left in the first quadrant of the _xy_ -plane, so that one corner is at (0.4 m, 0.3 m). See Figure 7-4. There is a force of 1.5 N in the _y_ -direction located at point (0.4 m, 0.3 m). The pivot is at the origin. What is the torque?

Figure 7-4

**Solution:** We can see that the force tends to turn the card counterclockwise, so the torque is positive. We can find the radius by the Pythagorean theorem:

The angle _φ_ is shown in the two places in the diagram (corresponding angles with the parallel lines). The sine of _φ_ can be obtained by looking at the portion of the diagram shown in Figure 7-5:

Putting all this together gives us

Figure 7-5

**Example 2:** A massless meter stick is supported by a fulcrum at the mark 0.3 m (point B). A mass A of 10 kg is sitting at the 0.1-m mark (point A). A mass C of 4 kg is sitting at the 0.8-m mark (point C). Consider the forces on the ruler (Figure 7-6).

a. What is the torque due to the weight of A about point B?  
b. What is the torque due to the weight of C about point B?  
c. What is the torque due to the force of the fulcrum about point B?

Figure 7-6

**Solution:**

a. In this case, we have _r_ = 0.2 m, _F_ = _mg_ = 100 N, sin _φ_ = 1, and the torque is counterclockwise, so _τ_ = (0.2 m)(100 N)(1) = 20 Nm.

b. In this case, the torque is clockwise, so we have _τ_ = –(0.5 m)(40 N)(1) = –20 Nm.

c. In this case, _r_ = 0 m, so _τ_ = 0 Nm.

**Example 3:** A massless meter stick is hanging from the ceiling at the mark 0.3 m, point B. Mass A (10 kg) is hanging by string A (0.2 m long) connected to point A at the 0.1-m mark on the meter stick. Mass C (4 kg) is hanging by string C (0.3 m long) connected to point C at the 0.8-m mark on the meter stick. (See Figure 7-7.)

a. What is the torque due to the weight of A about point B?

b. What is the torque due to the weight of C about point B?

c. What is the torque due to the force of the fulcrum about point B?

Figure 7-7

**Solution:** This example looks exactly like the previous example; the strings are only a slight modification. If we apply the strict definition for torque (equation [3]), however, we will end up making an enormous effort, calculating _r_ A and sin _φ_ A, and so on. Thankfully, there is an easier way.

In this example, this trick is the equivalent of sliding the force up the string to the meter stick. In fact, the example is exactly equivalent to Example 2.

a. _τ_ = 20 Nm.

b. _τ_ = –20 Nm.

c. _τ_ = 0 Nm.

**Example 1, revisited solution:** We can slide the 1.5-N force down the edge of the card to the _x_ -axis. In this case we have _r_ = 0.4 m and sin _φ_ = 1, so we have

_τ_ = (0.4 m)(1.5 N)(1) = 0.6 Nm

Once we move the force to a new point, so that _φ_ = 90° (and sin _φ_ = 1), the torque is especially easy to calculate. The line segment from the pivot to the new position of the force is called the _lever arm_. In Figure 7-8, the lever arm is the line segment  .

Figure 7-8

In drawing torque diagrams, it is helpful to keep the following principles in mind:

1. Gravity acts at the center of mass.

2. A string or rope exerts only a pulling force at the point of connection.

3. When a stick or pole meets a wall or floor, the force acts at the point of contact.

a. If the surface is frictionless, then there is only a normal force.

b. If the stick is connected by a hinge, then the force is along the stick (either pushing or pulling).

c. If the stick is connected to the wall or floor, then there are two forces, one normal and one parallel to the surface.

We will use these in Section D.

### D. Equilibrium

Torques are useful in problems involving rolling and spinning, although most such problems lie outside the scope of the MCAT. Torques are also useful in solving for forces in structural problems, even if there is no motion. For these problems we use the following principle:

Equations (5a) and (5b) assure _translational equilibrium_ , and equation (5c) assures _rotational equilibrium_. The following examples illustrate methods for calculating forces in static equilibrium.

**Example 1:** Consider the pulley system shown in Figure 7-9. Mass _m_ 1 is 2 kg, the radius of pulley A is 0.15 m, the radii of pulley B are 0.3 m and 0.1 m, and the radius of pulley C is 0.05 m. What mass _m_ 2 is required for equilibrium?

Figure 7-9

**Solution:** A string has one tension throughout its length, no matter what pulleys it goes around. Thus the tension _T_ 1 = _m_ 1 _g_ , and _T_ 2 = _m_ 2 _g_. The radii of pulleys A and C are irrelevant.

For equilibrium, we can take torques about the pivot of pulley B, keeping in mind that counterclockwise is positive and clockwise is negative, so that

_τ_ net = 0  
 _τ_ 1 – _τ_ 2 = 0  
(0.3)(2 kg ҟ 10 m/s2)(1) – (0.1 m)( _m_ 2 · 10 m/s2)(1) = 0  
 _m_ 2 = 6 kg

For problems involving torque balance, the following methods often work:

1. DRAW A DIAGRAM.  
2. Label all forces acting on the system.  
3. Choose a pivot.  
4. Calculate torques and set _τ_ net = 0.  
5. Use ( _F_ net)x = 0 and ( _F_ net)y = 0, or choose another pivot.

In the following example, it will be helpful for you to work out the example as you read along.

**Example 2:** A pole of mass _m_ 1 and length _L_ sticks out perpendicularly from a wall at point A. A wire connects the end of the pole to a point B above point A, making an angle _θ_ with the pole. A lamp of mass _m_ 2 hangs from a wire at the end of the pole. (See Figure 7-10.)

a. What is the tension in the wire from B to C in terms of _m_ 1, _m_ 2, _g, L_ , and _θ_?

b. What is the vertical force exerted by the wall on the pole?

Figure 7-10

**Solution:** First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM with all the forces on the pole (Figure 7-11).

Figure 7-11

We know _m_ 1 _g_ and _m_ 2 _g_ but not _T, F_ x, and _F_ y. Let us make a chart showing the torques about A and C.

Make sure you understand why these two entries are correct. Then fill in the rest of the chart on your own. The completed chart is shown on the next page.

In the second column the entries for the torque due to _F_ x and _F_ y about A are zero, since _r_ = 0 for these entries. In the third column, the entry for the torque due to _F_ x about C is zero because sin _φ_ = 0. The torque due to _T_ about C is zero because _r_ = 0.

a. In order to find _T_ , we can take torques about point A, since that eliminates _F_ x and _F_ y. The net torque must be zero because the system is in equilibrium, so we have (taking the sum of the first column)

We solve for _T_ and divide through by _L_ to obtain

b. In order to find _F_ y, we can use one of two methods. Using torques and choosing point C as a pivot yields

On the other hand, we could add up all the vertical forces and use ( _F_ net)y = 0, so that

This was a longer solution, so using torques is clearly the way to go.

**Example 3:** A pole of length _L_ is connected to a hinge at point A on a vertical wall, making an angle _α_ with the wall. A horizontal string connects to the wall at point B and the end of the pole at point C. A box of candy of mass _m_ hangs from a string at the end of the pole. (See Figure 7-12)

a What is the tension in the horizontal string?

b. What is the magnitude of the force of the wall on the pole at point A?

Figure 7-12

**Solution:** First we DRAW A DIAGRAM with all the forces on the pole (Figure 7-13). We have the tension _T_ in the horizontal string and tension _mg_ in the vertical string. We are left with a choice for the force of the wall on the pole _F_ s: pushing or pulling? No matter, we can draw it either way, and physics will tell us later on if we have it right. Let's make the force tensile, that is, pulling.

Figure 7-13

a. We choose A for the pivot, since that choice kills the force _F_ s but keeps _T_ and _mg_. Setting the sum of the torques equal to zero gives

b. In order to find _F_ s, we set the sum of vertical forces to zero, so that

The negative sign tells us that we drew the _F_ s vector the wrong way. (Perhaps you knew this already.) The force is compressional.

### E. Solid Properties

We have also been pretending that sticks and strings and such things are absolutely rigid, but we know that solid objects do stretch and bend and sometimes break. Solids bend when you exert different forces on two sides of them. To keep things simple, we will look at how a solid cylinder reacts to forces placed on it.

Figure 7-14 shows two rods, made of the same material and having the same cross-sectional area, but the first rod L1 is longer than the second L2. If we apply the same magnitude _tensile force_ (that is, pulling) to the four ends, then we expect the rods to stretch. But the longer rod has more material to stretch than the shorter one, so the change in length Δ _L_ will be greater. On the other hand, we can even things out by taking the ratio (Δ _L_ )/ _L_ , which is called the _strain_.

Figure 7-14

Now let's consider two rods of the same length with different cross-sectional areas (Figure 7-15). Again we apply the same magnitude tensile force to the ends. The thicker rod stretches less than the thinner one. This time, to even things out, we introduce the quantity _stress_ , which is _F_ / _A_. This should remind you of pressure, since pressure is a kind of stress.

Figure 7-15

As long as the forces involved are not too large, the resulting strain is proportional to the stress placed on the rod, so that we can write

where _Y_ is the Young's modulus, having units of [N/m2]. You might think that it is easier to stretch a rod than to compress it, but it turns out not to be so (as long as you do not go too far). The shortening Δ _L_ due to a _compressive force_ (pushing) is the same as the lengthening Δ _L_ due to an equal-sized tensile force. The Young's modulus depends only on the material.

A _shear force_ is a force applied perpendicular to the surface. Figure 7-16 shows an example of four shear forces applied to a block. Note that the net force is zero and the net torque is zero. The block bends, a distance Δ _x_ , and the relationship between stress ( _F_ / _A_ ) and strain (Δ _x_ / _L_ ) is

where _S_ is the shear modulus with units [N/m2].

Figure 7-16

Shear is a bit more complicated than compression and tension. In Figure 7-17, the compression force in the trunk is nearly uniform. The shear force in the large branch to the right is composed of tension at the top of the branch and compression at the bottom of the branch, as well as pure shear. If you want to weaken the branch, the most effective place to cut is on top and the least effective place is in the middle, which is called the neutral layer.

Figure 7-17

The proportionality in equations (6) and (7) holds for a large range of forces, but things will break if you pull them too hard. Before they break, they may go soft. The regime in which equations (6) and (7) holds is called _elastic_. The point at which the constituent particles of the material begin to flow and cause the material to go soft is the _elastic limit_. (See Figure 7-18.)

Figure 7-18

In this chapter we looked at using torques in order to solve for forces in certain static structures. In problems of this type we begin by drawing a force diagram, as we have always done, but now we need to be careful to locate the force at the right place. Generally, in a given problem, there will be forces we do not know and do not need, and it will be possible to choose a pivot so that the torques of all such forces are zero. Then if we write down the torque balance equation _τ_ net = 0, we will be able to obtain the magnitude of the desired forces.

We also looked at the static properties of solids. It is helpful to think in terms of a stress (force per area) being applied to a solid, and this stress causes a strain (displacement per length). For many materials stress and strain are proportional. Just realizing this proportionality is the key to solving some problems.

### Passage

Engineers often make scale models of structures they plan to build in order to test function and stability. Sometimes, however, structures fail even when the models function, so engineers have developed extensive theory in order to determine how to build proper scale models and extrapolate reliable results from them.

At first we might assume that a model made of the same material as the intended final structure with each dimension scaled by a single factor will accurately reproduce the behavior of the final structure. That this is not so was known in antiquity by tragic observation, and it was first explained by Galileo around AD 1600. We will not present his detailed argument but will sketch some of the conclusions.

To summarize Galileo's conclusion on this point, when the linear dimensions of a structure are all increased by a factor, the load across any surface increases by the cube of that factor, whereas the strength, or the maximum force the structure can hold across any surface increases by the square of that factor. Therefore, as a structure gets larger, it tends to become unstable, more susceptible to failure.

To illustrate the point, let's consider a block of metal connected to a cylinder, which has much greater length than its diameter and is connected to the ceiling (part A in figure). The _stress_ in the cylinder is the force per area across a cross section. Each material has a threshold stress, such that stress larger than the threshold causes the material to fail. If all the linear dimensions are increased by a factor (part B in figure), then the volume of the block increases by the cube of the factor, as well as the mass and weight of the block. The cross-sectional area of the cylinder increases by the square of the factor, so the stress increases as the factor itself.

This is the simplest example of the subtlety involved in model building.

**1.** The figure below depicts a human biceps, which when flexed, has a cross-sectional area at its center of 5 x 10–3 m2 and cross-sectional area at the forearm of 5 x 10–5 m2. If the force exerted at the forearm is _F_ 0, what is the force exerted at the shoulder?

**A.** _F_ 0/100

**B.** _F_ 0

**C.** 100 _F_ 0

**D.** 104 _F_ 0

**2.** Referring to the previous question, if the stress at the center of the biceps is 105 Pa, what is the stress at the forearm?

**A.** 103 Pa

**B.** 105 Pa

**C.** 107 Pa

**D.** 109 Pa

**3.** The figure below shows two elephant statues which are the same shape, both made of plaster of paris. Statue B has twice the linear dimension of statue A. If statue A weighs 40 N, how much does statue B weigh?

**A.** 48 N

**B.** 80 N

**C.** 160 N

**D.** 320 N

**4.** In the previous question, how does the pressure (stress) exerted by the right front foot of statue B compare with the pressure exerted by the corresponding foot of statue A?

**A.** It would be the same.

**B.** It would be twice as large.

**C.** It would be four times as large.

**D.** It would be eight times as large.

**D.** 10 _W_ max

## Chapter 8  
Momentum

### A. Introduction and Definition

The 1970s saw the popularity of a certain physics toy, a toy in which five steel balls hang in a line from threads (Figure 8-1, called Newton's Cradle). If you swing the left ball to the left and let go, it swings down and hits the other four balls. Then the right ball swings up and rises to almost the height of the initial release.

Figure 8-1

Now if you think about it, this is totally amazing. There are five balls undergoing collisions, and each collision involves a rapidly changing force between two balls (Figure 8-2). You might think we would need a supercomputer to deal with the problem. The very simple outcome (one ball swinging to the right) hints that there is some very simple underlying physics as well.

The idea that emerged from experiments like this one was that moving objects contained a certain amount of "motion quality" (or "movage"), which is a constant in any situation. In Figure 8-2 the movage begins in the left ball, transfers through the three balls, and ends up in the right ball.

Figure 8-2

Can we write a formula for this "movage"? Well, it is clear that a moving Mack truck has more movage than a Tonka truck, so mass must be involved. And a sprinter has more of it than a walker, so velocity must be involved. But is it

movage = _mv_

or

movage = _mv_ 2

or what? It turns out there are two kinds of movage, and we will study them in this chapter and in Chapter 9.

One kind of movage is _momentum_.

### B. Conservation of Momentum

_Conservation_ is one of those words in physics which has a special meaning. When a physicist says that momentum is conserved, she means that momentum ("movage") has a kind of permanence, that it cannot be created from nothing nor destroyed. The formal statement is in the box:

An external force is a force on one of the objects in the system by an outside agent, while an internal force is a force between two objects in the system.

**Example 1:** A Mack truck (9000 kg) going north at 10 m/s encounters a Porsche (1000 kg) going south at 20 m/s. What is the velocity (speed and direction) of the resulting fused mass of metal?

**Solution:** We DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 8-3). Let's discuss the collision itself, shown in the middle part of Figure 8-3. There are two normal forces and two gravitational forces which are all external. These, however, are balanced. The force of the truck on the car and that of the car on the truck are internal forces.

Figure 8-3

Momentum is conserved, and we write (in one dimension)

Notice we used _v_ p = –20 m/s, since it was going south, and we chose north to be positive. We have to pay attention to signs because momentum is a vector quantity.

**Example 2:** During the collision in Section A, the external forces are the tensions in the threads and gravity, and these are balanced. The internal forces are all the complicated forces among the balls. So momentum is conserved. We do not yet know enough to show why exactly one ball jumps off the right end. Momentum would be conserved, for example, if all five balls headed to the right at one fifth the impact velocity of the left ball.

**Example 3:** Is momentum conserved while the left ball is swinging from its initial height on its way to collision? (See Figure 8-4.)

Figure 8-4

**Solution:** It certainly does not seem so, since the ball starts with zero momentum and achieves a maximum momentum just before impact. Figure 8-5 shows why momentum is not conserved. The external forces on the ball are unbalanced.

Figure 8-5

**Example 4:** Is momentum conserved for a crocodile dropped from a ladder? If not, what is the external force? Try doing this one yourself. (See Figure 8-6.)

Figure 8-6

Here is a major hint:

**Example 5:** A car (1000 kg) going north (10 m/s) collides with a truck (1500 kg) going east (20 m/s). Assume there is negligible friction at the time of the collision. What is the final speed and direction of the combined car/truck?

**Solution:** We DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 8-7).

Figure 8-7

The total momentum before the collision can be read from Figure 8-8.

From the Pythagorean theorem we find the magnitude of the total momentum _p_ tot = 3.2 × 104 kg m/s. The magnitude of the velocity is _v_ = (3.2 × 104 kg m/s)/(2500 kg) = 13 m/s. The direction we obtain from _tanφ_ = (1 × 104 kg m/s)/(3 × 104 kg m/s). Thus _φ_ = 18° north of east.

Figure 8-8

### C. External Forces and Impulse

So what happens if there is an unbalanced external force? There must be a change of momentum:

If the external forces on an object add up to _F_ net, then we can write

The change in momentum Δ _p_ is called the _impulse_. So the impulse and the net force on a system are related by

or in one dimension

Whenever you see a problem involving force and time, you should think about momentum and write this equation.

**Example:** Why is bouncing on a trampoline less painful than bouncing off a cement sidewalk?

A. The force is less because the mass of the sidewalk is greater.

B. The force is less because the area of the sidewalk is greater.

C. The force is less because the time of impact is less.

D. The force is less because the time of impact is greater.

**Solution:** Choice A reminds us of the equation _F_ net = _ma_ , so let's see if that makes any sense. If the mass of the sidewalk is large, then the sidewalk's acceleration will be small, for a given force. Or else the force the sidewalk must experience for a given acceleration is large. It's hard to see how this makes a difference.

Choice B reminds us of the definition of pressure, so let's write the equation _P_ = _F_ / _A_. There is no way to reconcile choice B with this equation, however, since greater area implies a greater force, for a given pressure.

Choices C and D remind us of equation (5) above, so we write Δ _p_ = _F_ net Δ _t_. The force would be less for greater Δ _t_ , if the impulse is constant. Can we make sense of this choice? The impulse, or change in momentum, is the same in either case, since the body goes from moving downward to moving upward, and Δ _p_ = _m_ Δ _v_. Also, because of the elasticity of the trampoline, a body is in contact with it for a longer time. So choice D makes sense.

This question is reminiscent of many problems on the MCAT, so it is helpful to learn how to think about them.

In this chapter we looked at momentum, which is a way of quantifying motion. The momentum of a system is defined by _p_ tot = _m_ 1 _v_ 1 \+ _m_ 2 _v_ 2 \+.... Momentum has a kind of permanence, so an isolated system has a constant momentum in time, and we can change the momentum of a system only by applying an unbalanced external force. This is called conservation of momentum.

In any problem involving a collision, especially if there is crunching or sticking, momentum is likely to be a key concept. In these problems the external forces are negligible if the collision is brief, and the internal forces are very complicated. The equation for conservation of momentum can quickly lead to answers.

### Passage

A rocket engine operates on the principle that hot gas is expelled backwards through a nozzle in order to produce a thrust on the ship in the opposite direction. Since momentum is conserved in this operation, we can derive the result that the effective force on the ship is

_F_ effective = _Mu_

where _M_ is the mass expulsion rate, and _u_ is the exhaust velocity relative to the ship. Thus it is important for both _M_ and _u_ to be high. The exhaust velocity varies as the square root of the ratio of the temperature of the combustion chamber and the molecular mass of the exhaust.

In conventional rocket engine design, large fuel tanks carry liquid hydrogen and oxygen, and these react by chemical combustion to yield water vapor. The water vapor, due to its high temperature, shoots out of the nozzle, and the ship is thrust forward.

In an experimental engine design, nuclear fission of uranium is used to heat a supply of hydrogen to high temperatures (around 2200 K). The hydrogen is then expelled through a nozzle at 1.0 × 104 m/s, about twice the exhaust velocity as that for conventional rockets. One major engineering problem involves the heat exchange between the hydrogen gas and the site where the nuclear reaction takes place. Engineers are improving the design so that the hydrogen is heated at a faster rate than it is in current designs.

**A.** the first law of motion.

**B.** the second law of motion.

**C.** the third law of motion.

**D.** the law of universal gravitation.

**2.** Could neon gas work instead of hydrogen in the design of the nuclear engine?

**A.** No, since neon is not a product of uranium fission.

**B.** No, since neon is an inert gas.

**C.** Yes, but the engine would not be as efficient because of exhaust velocity.

**D.** Yes, it would work approximately as well.

**3.** What, according to the passage, is a disadvantage of nuclear engines compared to conventional engines?

**A.** The molecular mass of the exhaust is too low.

**B.** The molecular mass of the exhaust is too high.

**C.** Some of the energy is lost as heat.

**D.** The mass expulsion rate is too low.

**4.** A rocket ship is going forward at 2000 m/s and fires its engines in order to speed up but not turn. If the absolute velocity of the exhaust gases is 3000 m/s going backwards, what is the exhaust velocity _u_ relative to the ship?

**A.** 1000 m/s

**B.** 2000 m/s

**C.** 3000 m/s

**D.** 5000 m/s

**5.** We can model a rocket and its exhaust with two carts sitting on a level, frictionless one-dimensional track. The large cart (rocket) has a mass 10 kg, and the small cart (exhaust gas), 0.1 kg. There is a small explosive between them. At a certain time the explosive goes off and the two carts go flying apart. The less massive cart recoils with velocity 20 m/s. The explosion is over in about 0.2 s. What is the final velocity of the larger mass?

**A.** 0.2 m/s

**B.** 1.0 m/s

## Chapter 9  
Energy

### A. Introduction

To understand politics, it is said, you need to follow the money. To understand physics, it is said, you need to follow the energy. If we understand where energy is coming from, how it flows, and where it ends up in any physical situation, then we understand a lot about the physics of the situation.

"What is energy?" you may ask. Actually energy is harder to explain than you may think. In the history of physics, the concept of energy did not suddenly arrive as a mature concept out of Newtonian theory, like Athena emerging from Zeus's head. Rather, it began as a hazy idea which grew in richness and clarity during the 1800s. In this chapter we can do no better, so we will introduce the concept slowly.

In standard English, _energy_ is defined as the capacity for performing something useful. We can obtain energy from various places and then we can use it usefully or squander it, and once it is gone, it is gone.

In physics also, energy is the capacity for doing useful things. On the other hand, energy is a thing which cannot be created from nothing or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. Following energy through its forms is what much of physics is all about.

As you can see, the physics understanding is distinct from the popular understanding, and we will want to pay attention to the differences between the two.

### B. Work

Work is a measure of the energy flowing into an object or system due to a force on it. When a force _F_ (which can be due to a pair of hands, a rope, gravity, or anything) acts on an object which moves a distance Δ _x_ , the _work_ done by the force on the object is

where _φ_ is the angle between the direction of the force _F_ and the direction of the displacement Δ _x_. The units for work are [kg m2/s2 = Nm = Joule = J].

The _total work_ done on an object is

where _F_ net is the magnitude of the net force and _φ_ is the angle between _F_ net and Δ _x_.

Keep in mind that if the force is in the same direction as the motion, then cos _φ_ = 1. If the force exactly opposes the motion, then cos _φ_ = –1. If the force acts perpendicular to the motion, then cos _φ_ = 0. You should know these angles without pausing to think about them.

**Hint:** _Whenever_ a problem on the MCAT mentions a force and a distance, you should think "WORK!" and write down the equation for work. Even if work and energy are not mentioned, it is probably a key idea for understanding at least one of the problems.

**Example 1:** A woman is pushing a cart of mass _m_ slowly at constant speed up an incline which makes an angle _θ_ with the horizontal. The cart goes from the floor level to a height _h_.

a. How much work does the woman do on the cart in terms of _m, g, h_ , and _θ_?

b. What is the total work done on the cart?

**Solution:** a. First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 9-1).

Figure 9-1

We need to find _F_ W and Δ _x_. We choose a "horizontal" and "vertical" and resolve the gravity vector into components (Figure 9-2).

Figure 9-2

First we look at the "horizontal" components. The words "constant speed" and "straight path" imply that the cart's acceleration is zero, and the net force on it is zero, so we write

From Figure 9-2 we obtain

Combining these equations gives us

We can find Δ _x_ by trigonometry. If we look at the large triangle in Figure 9-2, then we have

The vectors _F_ W and Δ _x_ point in the same direction, so cos _φ_ = 1. Thus the work done by the woman on the cart is

This is the answer to question a.

But what is this? The quantity _θ_ dropped out of the equation (!). It takes the same energy to go a long way up a shallow incline as it does to go a short way up a steep incline. In fact:

The energy a woman requires to push a cart from one point to a point which is height _h_ higher is _mgh_ , even if the path is complicated. See Figure 9-3.

Figure 9-3

b. What is the total work done? Well, since the speed and direction are constant, the acceleration is zero, and _F_ net = 0, so that

_W_ tot = 0

What? The poor woman works from dawn till dusk, and the total work done is zero? Where did the energy go? Well, if we were to figure out the work done by gravity, we would find that it comes to – _mgh_ , so the work done by gravity cancels the work done by the woman. It seems like a sad story, perhaps, but this will not be the final word on gravity (see Section D).

**Example 2:** How much work is done by the gravity of the Sun on the Earth in one day?

_G_ = 6.67 × 10–11 m3/kg s2,  
 _M_ Sun = 2 × 1030 kg,  
 _M_ Earth = 6 × 1024 kg,  
distance from Earth to Sun = 1.5 × 1011 m.

**Solution:** First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 9-4). Once we draw the diagram, the answer is clear. The vector _F_ grav is perpendicular to the displacement Δ _x_ , so we have cos _φ_ = 0 and _W_ tot = 0.

Figure 9-4

### C. Energy of Motion

So how much energy do we put into an object if we push it for a while? Let's try another simple example, this time in one dimension.

**Example:** Consider an orange, which we have smeared with a special grease so there is no friction. It is initially at rest, so _v_ 1 = 0. We push it in one direction with a force _F_ over a distance Δ _x_. What is the work done by the force, in terms of the mass _m_ and final velocity _v_ 2 of the orange?

**Solution:** We have an expression for the force given by the second law of motion:

Also we have

Since cos _φ_ = 1, we have

Notice that the factor Δ _t_ drops out.

If we push on an orange initially at rest until it is going at velocity _v_ 2, then the amount of work we have done on it is 1/2 _mv_ 22. This indicates that we can define the _kinetic energy_ , the energy of an object due solely to its motion, as

Wow! This is just the kind of expression we saw near the beginning of the Chapter 8. We have completed the circle. But now we have to find out how to use this expression.

Work and change in kinetic energy are related by the following expression.

Some examples should clarify this.

**Example 1:** What is the change in kinetic energy for the woman's cart in the previous section?

**Solution:** We calculated _W_ tot = 0, which tells us that the change in kinetic energy is zero. The cart is going the same speed at the end of the problem as at the beginning. Thus we have Δ _E_ K = 0. So this result is consistent with the above equation.

**Example 2:** What is the change in kinetic energy of the Earth in one day?

**Solution:** According to the previous section, _W_ tot = 0, and indeed the Earth's speed is constant from one day to the next. The kinetic energy change is zero. Here we are assuming a circular orbit, which is almost correct.

**Example 3:** A bullet of mass 20 grams is fired from a gun, so that its speed is 700 m/s in air. The bullet enters a tree stump and embeds 2 meters inside. What is the average force exerted by the stump on the bullet? (Ignore gravity.)

**Solution:** First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 9-5). At first this problem looks like a momentum conservation problem, because of the collision and crunching of wood. If we try to apply conservation of momentum, however, we just do not get anywhere.

Figure 9-5

The key is to notice that force and distance are both mentioned in the problem. _Immediately_ we think of energy. We know the change in kinetic energy of the bullet

Δ _E_ K = _E_ K2 – _E_ K1  
= 0 J – 1/2 (.020 kg)(700 m/s)2  
= –4.9 × 103 J.

This is also _W_ tot, and we can set _W_ tot to _F_ Δ _x_ cos _φ_ , where cos _φ_ is –1. Thus –4.9 × 103 J = _F_ (2 m)(– 1), _F_ = 2.45 × 103 N.

Sometimes, as an object moves along a path, the net force on it changes, or else the displacement changes direction. We can still consider calculating the total work on the object.

We will see examples of this in future chapters.

### D. Potential Energy and Conservative Forces

_Potential energy_ is the energy of an object due to position alone. _Gravitational potential energy_ is the energy associated with the position of an object in a gravitational field. How does this work?

Remember the woman in Section B? She pushed a cart to a new height _h_ , doing work _W_ = _mgh_. It would make sense to define gravitational potential energy as

where _m_ is the mass of the object in question, _g_ is the acceleration due to gravity, and _h_ is the height. The height is measured relative to some standard, such as sea level or street level. It does not matter what the standard is, because we are always interested in changes in height or changes in potential energy. This formula works for all situations near the surface of the Earth.

Any force with an associated potential energy is called a _potential force_ or a _conservative force_. Examples include the forces due to springs and the electrostatic force (see Chapter 14). The force the woman exerts on the cart and magnetic forces are not conservative forces.

**Example:** We are now in a position to FOLLOW THE ENERGY for the woman and the cart. It is clear that the energy ends up as potential energy. How does the energy start? Kinetic? No, because the cart is hardly moving both before and after its trip. The energy starts in her muscles, where it was stored as chemical energy. Thus the flow of energy is chemical to gravitational potential energy.

### E. Conservation of Energy

Sometimes physicists use strange words to mean normal things (They say "scalar" when they mean "number", for example.) Sometimes they use normal words to mean normal things, but they mean it a little differently; for example, force and energy. Sometimes they use normal words to mean something completely different from the standard meaning, and this leads to much confusion.

In common parlance, "conservation of energy" means frugal use of energy, a responsibility of good citizens.

In physics, "conservation of energy" means that energy, by decree of Nature, cannot be created from nothing nor destroyed, but it can flow from one form to another or from one place to another. If we calculate the total energy in a closed system at one time, the total energy some time later will be the same. Energy is conserved.

In the table are listed some of the energy forms which may appear on the MCAT.

type of energy | description  
---|---  
kinetic | bulk motion  
potential | object's position  
gravitational potential | object's position in gravity  
mechanical | MCAT word for kinetic + potential  
chemical | batteries, muscles, etc.  
electrical | moving electrons  
nuclear | energy in the nucleus, radioactivity, fission reactor  
sound | pressure waves  
light | electric, magnetic field waves  
heat | random motion of particles

The principle of energy conservation in the previous box is the Grand Statement, almost too grand to be useful in most problems. For doing problems it is better if the number of kinds of energy considered are few, like two: kinetic and potential.

Use this principle in problems in which gravity does all the work.

**Example 1:** The woman of Section B lets go of the cart at the top of the incline. The cart rolls to the bottom.

a. What is the final velocity?

b. Describe the energy flow from start to finish.

**Solution:** a. First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 9-6). We need to check all the forces. Although the normal force is nonpotential, it is perpendicular to the motion, so it does no work. The gravitational force is a potential force. We conclude that the simple version of energy conservation applies. Thus we write

Solving for _v_ 2 yields

Figure 9-6

Note that the mass has dropped out. This should remind you of the situation in which a massive object and a light object are dropped at the same time. They fall at the same rate with the same acceleration and same velocity as each other, all the way down.

b. The energy flow is chemical (woman's muscles) to potential to kinetic.

**Example 2:** A pendulum of length 0.7 meters is pulled so that its bob (0.2 kg) is 0.1 meters higher than its resting position. From that position it is let go.

a. What is its kinetic energy at the bottom of the swing?

b. What is its velocity at the bottom of the swing?

c. What is the work done by the string tension during the swing from start to the bottom?

**Solution:** a. First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 9-7).

Figure 9-7

We check the forces. The tension is perpendicular to the direction the bob is moving at every moment. This is true even though the bob is moving in an arc and the tension is changing direction during the swing. Thus tension does no work. Gravity is a potential force, so equation (6) applies and we can write

b. Now, we obtain the final velocity from

c. We have already decided that the tension does no work.

### F. Efficiency of Energy Conversion

Often we have energy in one form and we want to convert it into another form, for example, from chemical energy in gasoline to kinetic energy of a car. It may be the case that energy cannot be destroyed, but it can end up in an inconvenient form such as heat. In this case we define the _efficiency_ of energy conversion as follows:

**Example 1:** A car (800 kg) goes slowly up a hill from the base to a height of 300 meters. It uses 245 grams of fuel in the form of 2,2,4-trimethylpentane. The following overall reaction occurs in the car:

What is the efficiency of the engine? Assume no energy loss due to air resistance. Use 1 kcal = 4184 J.

**Solution:** First we calculate the energy in desired form, which is the potential energy:

Next we calculate the energy used:

The efficiency is

Figure 9-8

We can speak of efficiency in a collision as well. In a collision, kinetic energy is often converted to heat and chemical energy. If this is not the case, that is, if kinetic energy before the collision is the same as after, then the collision is called _elastic_. Otherwise it is called _inelastic_. If everything is stuck together in the end, the collision is called _completely inelastic_.

**Example 2:** Two cars collide in one dimension in a completely inelastic collision. One car is 1000 kg, initially going east at 10 m/s. The other car is 1500 kg, initially going west at 15 m/s.

a. What is the velocity of the twisted metal afterward?

b. What is the efficiency of the collision?

**Solution:** a. Did you remember that crunching or smashing generally means we must use the conservation of momentum? Let us take east to be positive (see Figure 9-9) and we write

b. Now we need to know the kinetic energy both before and after the collision.

Thus the efficiency is

Figure 9-9

### G. Power

_Power_ is the rate at which energy is produced, consumed, or transformed, that is,

**Example 1:** A car (1000 kg) traveling 55 mph has a forward cross-sectional area of about 4 m2. What is the power dissipated by air resistance? (Use 1 mph ≈ 0.45 m/s. Recall that the formula for air resistance is _F_ air = _CρAv_ 2, where _r_ , the density of air, is 1.29 kg/m3 and _C_ ≈ 0.2.)

**Solution:** First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 9-10).

Figure 9-10

We have only one formula to work with ( _P_ = Δ _E_ /Δ _t_ ), but we have neither an energy nor a time. But we have several formulas for energy, so let's try to connect it with the force given in the problem. We have

since _cosφ_ = –1. We can substitute for _F_ air. And the expression Δ _x/_ Δ _t_ reminds us of velocity, so we have

The minus sign indicates that the energy is dissipated by the force.

**Example 2:** The same car is traveling 65 mph. What is the power dissipated by air resistance?

**Solution:** _P_ = –2.6 × 104 W.

Why is there such a large difference?

### H. Pulleys

Pulleys are somewhat tricky, but with some practice, problems including pulleys become simpler. There are two underlying principles:

Let's look at some examples.

**Example 1:** A person is hanging in air by grabbing the two ends of a rope which is draped around a pulley. If the person is 60 kg, what is the tension in the rope?

**Solution:** First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 9-11) showing the forces on the man. The tension on the two sides of the rope is the same, so we can call it _T_. The person is not accelerating, so the forces add to zero, giving

Figure 9-11

**Example 2:** A rope, one end of which is connected to the ceiling, passes through a pulley and then goes up, so that an upward tension is maintained. A mass 30 kg is hung on the pulley. What is the tension in the rope? (See Figure 9-12.)

Figure 9-12

**Solution:** There are two ways to do this problem. One is to realize that this is essentially the same as Example 1, so that _T_ = 1/2 _mg_ = 150 N. (See Figure 9-13.)

Figure 9-13

The other way is to imagine pulling up on the rope 1 meter. A bit of study of the diagram will show that the mass will rise 0.5 meters, since 0.5 meters of rope will be pulled from each side of the pulley. The work done by _T_ must be the same as the work done on the mass. The work done by the rope is _W_ 1 = _F_ Δ _x_ cos _φ_ = _T_ (1 m). The work done on the mass is the change in potential energy _W_ 2 = _mg_ Δ _h_ = _mg_ (0.5 m). Thus

**Example 3:** A rope has one end connected to the ceiling. It loops through a pulley with a downward weight of 500 N, goes up to the ceiling where it loops over a second pulley and connects to a mass _m_. If everything is in equilibrium, what is _m_? (See Figure 9-14.)

Figure 9-14

**Solution:** This looks different from the previous problem, but in fact it is essentially the same. The tension _T_ which pulls up on mass _m_ is numerically the same as the tension _T_ pulling up on both sides of the first pulley. So we have

So _m_ = 25 kg

Another way to obtain the above equation is to DRAW A DIAGRAM showing the forces on both masses (Figure 9-15).

Figure 9-15

In this chapter we explored the concept of energy. Whenever you read about a force and a distance through which the force acts, you should think immediately of work _W_ = _F_ Δ _x_ cos _φ_. This will be the key to answering some of the questions, even if no numbers are involved.

If a net force acts on an object, the kinetic energy _E_ K = 1/2 _mv_ 2 of the object is changed according to _W_ tot = Δ _E_ k. The total work gives the size of the energy flow into an object. Another form of energy is gravitational potential energy given by _E_ ρ = _mgh_. It is important to keep track of the energy flow because energy is conserved. That is, energy cannot be created from nothing or destroyed, but it can be transferred from one form to another.

The rate at which energy is transformed is called power _P_ = Δ _E_ /Δ _t_.

### Passage 1

In a certain experiment, a piston chamber is used as part of a primitive engine. The apparatus consists of a pipe closed at one end with a piston at the other end. A valve in the cylinder allows fuel gases to be introduced or waste gases to be expelled.

In the operation of this engine, hydrogen and oxygen are introduced in a 2:1 ratio (in order to ensure complete combustion) at ambient temperature _T_ amb and atmospheric pressure _P_ atm. The following reaction is ignited

with a heat of reaction

Δ _H_ rea = –4.8 × 105 J/mol

The pressure rises to _P_ burn.

Next the piston slowly moves back a distance _l_ , from which the engine derives useful work. The distance _l_ is short enough that the pressure and temperature inside the chamber remain roughly constant.

The waste gases are then expelled, and the piston is restored to its original position.

The radius of the cylinder is _r_ , and the cross-sectional area is _A_. The length of the cylinder before the piston moves back is _L_ , which is much larger than _l_. The number of moles of oxygen introduced is _n_.

### Passage 2

A swiftly moving charged particle, called an incident particle, moving through a material composed of neutral atoms and molecules, such as gas or biological tissue, loses kinetic energy to the material. For instance, a massive positive particle, such as a bare nucleus, moving at a speed near that of light will ionize the atoms or molecules of the medium it is moving through. In the process, there is a drag force on the incident particle and hence a loss of energy.

The energy loss depends not on the mass of the incident particle, interestingly enough, but it does depend on its charge _z_ , as well as on the average number of electrons _Z_ per atom or molecule in the material. The following equation gives energy loss per distance traveled:

where _N_ is the number of atoms per unit volume of material,

_Z_ is the average number of electrons per atom or molecule in the material,

_z_ is the charge (number of elementary charges) of the incident particle,

_e_ is the electron charge (in Coulombs),

_m_ e is the electron mass,

### Passage 3

A large amount of energy is lost each time a car is brought to a stop by applying the brakes. The kinetic energy is converted into heat energy, which is useless in getting the car going again. For this reason, some engineers have experimented with the idea of storing energy in a flywheel when a car comes to a stop.

A flywheel is a massive ring which is free to spin about its center, like a bicycle wheel. The kinetic energy of a flywheel is given by

_E_ K = _Iω_ 2/2

where _I_ is the moment of inertia and _ω_ is the angular frequency in radians per unit time. Thus the frequency _f_ (in cycles per unit time) is _f_ = _ω_ /2 _π_. The moment of inertia is given by

_I_ = _MR_ 2

where _M_ is the mass of the flywheel and _R_ is the radius.

Ideally the kinetic energy of the car would be transferred to the flywheel as the car comes to a stop. When the driver wants to go again, the energy would be transferred back to forward kinetic motion. Unfortunately, the efficiency of the two transfers will be less than 100%, so energy will be lost to heat. This energy can, of course, be made up by conventional means, such as burning gasoline.

For the following questions, use the notation:

_M_ car is mass of the car  
 _M_ is mass of the flywheel  
 _R_ is radius of the flywheel  
 _ω_ = 2 _πf_ = angular frequency of the flywheel

**1.** Consider the whole car as a physical system in the situation in which it is braking on level ground using conventional brakes.

**A.** Since the car is slowing, there is an unbalanced external force.

**B.** Since the brake pads are growing hotter, entropy is increasing.

**C.** Since the brake pads are growing hotter, some heat is transferred to the air.

**D.** Since the situation is not spontaneous, the free energy change is greater than zero.

**2.** If the mass of the brake pads is _m_ brake, and the heat capacity is _C_ V (in J/kg K), which expression gives an approximate temperature change in the brake pads if a car going velocity _v_ slows to a stop?

**A.**

**B.**

**C.**

**D.**

**3.** The efficiency of conversion of forward kinetic energy to rotational energy is _a_. Assume the flywheel is initially nonrotating and the car is moving at velocity _v_. Then what is an expression giving the angular velocity _ω_ after the car comes to a stop?

**C.**

**D.**

**A.** Δ _mω_ 2 _R_ /2

**B.** Δ _mω_ 2 _R_

**C.** _ω_ 2 _R_ /2

**D**. _ω_ 2 _R_

**5.** The efficiency for converting forward kinetic energy to rotational energy is _a_ , and the efficiency for converting rotational energy to kinetic energy is _b_. The car is initially going velocity _v_ and the flywheel is still. The car slows to a stop by converting energy to the flywheel, and then it gains velocity again until the flywheel is still. What is the resulting speed of the car?

**A.**

**B.** _abv_

**C.** ( _ab_ )2 _v_

**D**. _av/b_

**6.** A conventional car (500 kg) rolls down a hill, such that the efficiency of conversion of potential energy to kinetic energy is 40%.

**A.** 12.6 m/s

**B.** 20 m/s

**C.** 31.6 m/s

**D.** 40 m/s

### Passage 4

People began to make roller coasters around the early 1900s. These early roller coasters were made of wood, and people learned how to construct them using the principles of physics and by a certain amount of experimentation.

Beginning in the 1980s, constructers of roller coasters began to use computers to design them. In this way they were able to create a great many designs and simulate them, thus finding a roller coaster's weakest points and determining the cost of making them fail-safe. This, and the practice of making them of steel, made the new roller coasters larger, safer, and more fun.

Nevertheless, a fair amount of knowledge about a roller coaster can be learned by applying simple physics without the aid of a computer. For the most part, the two forces acting on the car are gravity and the normal force, for we will ignore the force of friction during the ride. A force due to a motor carries the car to the top of the first hill. Finally there is a frictional force due to rubber bumpers pressing against the car which serve to stop it at the end of the ride so that other riders can get on.

The feeling a rider experiences in the car is related to the force exerted by the car's seat on his body perpendicular (normal) to the car's motion. This is expressed as a number of g's, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. For instance, if the rider (mass _m_ ) experiences a force 2 _mg_ , then he is said to experience 2g's.

Consider the figure below, a very simple roller coaster, in answering the following questions. A motor brings the car from point A to B, where it is has very little velocity at a height _H_ 1 above the ground. The slope of the first hill is an angle _θ_ from the horizontal. The loop is a circle of whose highest point is _H_ 2 above the ground. The mass of the car is _M_. The velocity of the car at point _F_ is _v_ F.

**1.** What is the kinetic energy of the car at point E?

**A.** _MgH_ 1cos _θ_

**B.** _MgH_ 1sin _θ_

**C.** _MgH_ 1

**D**. 2 _MgH_ 1

**B.** – _MgH_ 1sin _θ_

**C.** electrical to kinetic to potential

**D.** electrical to heat to potential

### Passage 5

A cannon is a device for imparting a large velocity to a mass of iron, generally for the purpose of warfare. Over the centuries, the manufacture of cannons has taken many forms, but the basic construction has remained the same.

A cylinder (or _barrel_ ) is closed at one end (the _breech_ ) and open at the other (the _muzzle_ ). An explosive (or _charge_ ) is placed in the cylinder at the breech, and a ball is placed in the cylinder on top of the charge. The explosive is ignited and the reaction produces hot gases which increase the pressure. Thus the gases push the ball along the cylinder and out the muzzle at great velocity.

Beginning in the 1500s, gunners began using large-grained explosive in order to decrease the rate of burning. Faster burning charge creates a large pressure very quickly, thus creating stress on the cannon and creating a risk of failure. The slower burning charge ensures that the pressure behind the ball stays more nearly constant as the ball travels the length of the barrel.

For the following questions, consider a cannon which is 2.3 meters long with a bore (hole) of radius 5 centimeters. Assume the pressure inside the cannon after the explosive has been set off is constant. While the ball is in the cannon, the forces due to the gases are so much greater than the force of gravity that the force of gravity can be ignored.

**1.** What additional piece of information would be sufficient to allow the calculation of the kinetic energy of the ball upon leaving the cannon?

**A.** The mass of the cannonball.

**B.** The final velocity of the cannonball.

**C.** The force the cannonball experiences in the barrel.

**D.** None of the above.

**2.** What additional piece of information would be sufficient to allow the calculation of the pressure in the barrel while the cannonball is still inside?

**A.** The temperature of the gas in the barrel.

**B.** The final velocity of the cannonball.

**A.** The rate of reaction depends on the surface area.

**B.** The rate of reaction depends on the concentration of reactants.

**D.** The activation energy is reduced for smaller-grained charge.

**A.** The entropy change during burning is zero.

**B.** The free energy change during burning is negative.

**C.** The free energy change during burning is zero.

**D.** The free energy change during burning is positive.

**5.** Which of the following best describes the energy flow in the passage?

**A.** chemical to kinetic to heat

**B.** chemical to heat to kinetic

**C.** chemical to potential to heat

**D.** chemical to potential to kinetic

**6.** For this question, assume the cannon points straight up, and assume we know the velocity of the cannonball when it leaves the muzzle of the cannon. What additional piece of information would be sufficient to allow the calculation of the height to which the cannonball would travel?

**A.** The mass of the cannonball.

**B.** The kinetic energy of the ball upon just leaving the barrel.

**C.** The force the cannonball experiences in the barrel.

**D.** No more information is needed.

## Interlude  
Solving Problems

### A. Introduction

"Yes, yes," I hear the gentle reader saying, "this physics is all very nice, but I want to know how to pass the MCAT." That is what this chapter is about.

In this chapter we will discuss the general strategy for studying for the MCAT, for reading passages, and for approaching unfamiliar questions. In general, however, the more physics you understand, the better you will do on the MCAT. The more physics problems you solve beforehand, the more questions you will answer correctly on the exam. If you concentrate on accuracy and understanding first, you will gain speed later on.

When I began to write this minichapter, I worked through a number of published MCAT practice problems, making notes of the skills and methods which proved useful. You should do the same thing. As you work through practice problems, ask yourself, how should I have approached this problem? What clues indicate that I should have used a given method? What other types of problems can be solved with this method? How should I approach similar problems?

Some questions on the MCAT are simply a matter of comprehending the material in the passage. You must find your own trouble spots regarding comprehension. Do you have trouble finding the main ideas? Practice this skill. Do you miss important details? Learn to slow down. Do you misread questions? Learn to read them more slowly. Do you spend too much time reading unnecessary information in the passage? Practice scanning the passages more quickly. No book can diagnose these problems better than yourself.

Again, the best way to study is to begin studying. The more passages you have seen, the more likely it is that you will recognize and understand the information in an MCAT passage.

### B. General Strategy

When you approach an MCAT passage, scan it quickly to note the main ideas. Underline any sentences or phrases that seem to state a main idea or further an argument. Underline any numbers that are embedded in the passage. When you read the question section you can always go back and read a portion of the passage more carefully.

When you read a question which seems puzzling,

You may find yourself saying, "This reminds me of the problem I saw with the crocodile and the toaster. In that problem energy was conserved. I wonder if energy is conserved in this problem as well." You will be surprised how often you reach the solution to a problem which initially seemed daunting.

**Example 1:** Police in Arizona found a piece of wreckage embedded in a mountain rock near a freeway. Study of the site indicated that the wreckage was not that of an airplane but of a car.

Apparently a man had connected a Jet Assisted Take Off unit (JATO) to his car. A JATO unit is a solid fuel rocket normally used for assisting in the take off of heavy planes on short runways. The man and his Chevy (2000 kg) started accelerating approximately from rest 5000 m from the crash site, quickly reaching terminal speed of 170 m/s. The car traveled in a straight path more or less, except that it became airborne for the last 2000 m and hit the cliff face 40 m above the ground, creating a crater 1 m deep in the rock.

**1.** What is the approximate force the cliff exerted on the car during the final crash? (Assume that force of collision is approximately constant.)

**A.** 3 × 104 N

**B.** 3 × 105 N

**C.** 2 × 106 N

**D.** 3 × 107 N

**2.** If the car traveling 170 m/s had crashed into a stationary 6000-kg truck and stuck, how fast would the combined vehicles be going just after the collision?

**A.** 170 m/s

**B.** 85 m/s

**C.** 57 m/s

**D.** 42 m/s

**Solution:** Does question 1 remind us of a problem we have done before? In Example 3 of Section 9.C we saw a bullet embedding in a tree stump. In that problem the mention of force and distance was the clue to write

We can draw a force diagram for the car once it encounters the cliff (Figure I-1). Here cos _φ_ = –1, since the car's displacement is in the opposite direction from the net force on it. The total work is the same as the change in kinetic energy, so that we have

The displacement of the car during the crash is 1 m, so the approximate force is 3 × 107 J/1 m = 3 × 107 N.

Figure I-1

Question 2 reminds us of problems involving collisions and hence conservation of momentum. In those problems, we drew "before and after" pictures (Figure I-2).

Conservation of momentum gives us

Figure I-2

In these two examples, we used a second important principle. That is,

Keep in mind that this is the starting point of many problems.

**Example 2:** In the mechanical flight of an airplane, lift is created by the differential air flow over the wings. For air flow along a streamline, Bernoulli's principle applies (approximately), that is,

The wing is constructed so that the air flowing over the top flows faster than the air flowing under the bottom of the wing. The implication is that the air flowing over the top has a smaller pressure than the air at the bottom of the wing. The force on a piece of surface area of the wing is given by

_F_ = _PA_ ,

so the cumulative effect is an upward force on the wing, or lift.

As the wings of the airplane slice through the air, some energy is lost to the air in the form of turbulence and heat. This energy comes from the motion of the airplane, so that the net effect is a drag due to air resistance. The drag is given (very approximately) by

_F_ drag ≈ _CρAv_ 2

where _C_ (= 0.2) is a constant, _ρ_ (= 1.3 kg/m3) is the density of air, _A_ is the cross-sectional area of the airplane as viewed from the front, and _v_ is its velocity relative to the air.

**1.** When an airplane is in steady horizontal flight, the thrust of the engines is equal to which of the following?

**A.** The weight of the airplane.

**B.** The drag force.

**C.** The sum of the magnitudes of the drag force and the weight.

**D.** The magnitude of the vector sum of the drag and the weight.

**Solution:** Does this remind us of a problem we have done before? Yes. Since there are forces mentioned, we can draw a force diagram (Figure I-3). Steady horizontal flight implies that _F_ net = 0, so the horizontal forces balance. Thus the magnitude of the thrust is equal to the drag. The MCAT passages often include extraneous information, as in this passage.

Figure I-3

Even in questions which do not involve numbers, the answer often becomes clear only when you

As you read a passage, you should be thinking of the connections among the quantities mentioned. For instance, we have noted that whenever you read about a force and a time interval, you should immediately think "momentum" and write the momentum equation Δ _p_ = _F_ Δ _t_.

**Example 3:** One of the new safety features included in cars is the inflatable airbag. In the event of a head-on collision, the airbag inflates in milliseconds. The airbag deflates as the driver or passenger presses against it.

**1.** Which of the following gives an explanation for the safety provided by an airbag?

**A.** The airbag decreases the time of collision, thus decreasing the force.

**B.** The kinetic energy of the driver is converted to potential energy of the airbag.

**C.** The increased distance of the collision of the driver decreases the force he experiences.

**D.** The decreased distance of the collision of the driver decreases the force he experiences.

**Solution:** Considering choice A, we write the equation Δ _p_ = _F_ Δ _t_ , where _F_ is the force on the driver. But the equation implies that a decrease in force corresponds to an increase in time interval, so A is wrong. Concerning choice B, the energy turns into the heat of the escaping gases. If the airbag were compressed like a spring, then choice B would be a possibility. Choices C and D remind us (because of force and distance) of the equation

_W_ = _F_ Δ _x_ cos _φ_

where _W_ would be the work of stopping the driver, _F_ the required force, and Δ _x_ the distance over which the force is applied. Decreased force implies increased distance, so D is incorrect. Indeed the airbag does increase the distance of collision.

### C. Specific Strategies

In this section we look at a few other hints that work on certain classes of problems.

Some problems involve a large number of quantities related to each other in various ways, sometimes specified in the passage and sometimes not. For such passages it is often valuable to

To draw a variable map, connect related quantities by lines that meet at a vertex. This strategy is especially good for questions which ask, "What additional information is necessary to determine...?" An example will help make this clear.

**Example 1:** A piston is fit into a long cylinder, so that the gas inside the cylinder exerts a pressure on the piston and pushes it out (Figure I-4). We can derive energy from this process. The net force on the piston is the difference between the force of the gas pushing the piston out and the force of the outside atmosphere pushing the piston in. The force is given by the product of pressure and surface area. As long as the piston moves a short distance Δ _x_ compared with the length of the cylinder, we can consider the pressure inside the cylinder to be constant.

Figure I-4

In the following, the distance the piston moves is Δ _x_ = 0.01 m. The pressure inside the chamber is 20 atm, while the ambient pressure is 1 atm.

**1.** Assuming the piston moves slowly, what additional information is necessary to determine the work done on the piston by the pressure in the cylinder?

**A.** The mass of the piston.

**B.** The volume of the cylinder.

**C.** The area of the piston.

**D.** The length of the cylinder.

**Solution:** Pressure, force, area, work, and displacement are related by the equations _W_ = _F_ Δ _x_ and _F_ = _PA_. We make a variable map connecting these quantities (Figure I-5). We can extend the variable map to include the volume and length of the cylinder, using the ideal gas equation _PV_ = _nRT_ (Figure I-6). We can place a check by Δ _x_ and _P_ to indicate that we know these quantities. According to the variable map, we also need to know force in order to determine work.

Figure I-5

Figure I-6

Concerning choices A, B, and D, these quantities do not lead to a knowledge of force. But if we know the area of the piston, then we can place a check by area. Now, according to the variable map, area and pressure will give us force, and we have the information to find work.

Problems which involve charts can be confusing until you get used to them, and you can waste time figuring out something which can be derived fairly quickly. Often problems involving charts can be solved by one of the three methods below.

Some charts have data which fit an equation, and one of the questions requires an element of the equation. In this case, you should

**Example 2:** A steel thread is hung from the ceiling. The free end has a hook on it, such that when various weights are hung from the hook, the thread stretches (Figure I-7). According to elasticity theory, the amount of strain is proportional to the amount of stress, for small values of the stress, so that

where Δ _L_ is the amount of stretching, _F_ is the force applied to both ends, _L_ is the length of the wire, _A_ is its cross-sectional area, and _Y_ is Young's modulus, a constant for a given material. The following data were obtained for a wire 1 m long of cross-sectional area 10–6 m2.

Figure I-7

Experiment | _m_ (kg) | Δ _L_ (mm)  
---|---|---  
1 | 0 | 0  
2 | 0.5 | 0.025  
3 | 2 | 0.1  
4 | 10 | 0.5

**1.** What is the value of _Y_ for steel?

**A.** 2 × 109 N/m2

**B.** 2 × 1010 N/m2

**C.** 2 × 1011 N/m2

**D.** 2 × 1012 N/m2

**Solution:** If we draw a force diagram (Figure I-8) for the weight hanging from the wire, we see that the force exerted by the weight on the wire is equal to its weight _mg_.

Figure I-8

We can add a column to the table _F_ = _mg_. Actually we only need to choose one experiment, so let's choose Experiment 4. The table looks like the following.

Experiment | _m_ (kg) | Δ _L_ (mm) | _F_ (N)  
---|---|---|---  
1 | 0 | 0 |   
2 | 0.5 | 0.025 |   
3 | 2 | 0.1 |   
4 | 10 | 0.5 | 100

Now we can substitute into the formula using _F_ = 100 N to obtain

For questions which ask for an extrapolation from a chart, it is often helpful to

**Example 3:** Consider a horizontal bar of circular cross section (radius _r_ ) and length _l_ hung between two walls. A mass _m_ is hung from the center of the bar (Figure I-9). The distance that the bar will sag Δ _x_ is given by

where _Y_ is Young's modulus, a property of the material making up the bar and _g_ is the acceleration due to gravity.

Figure I-9

The following data were obtained for a nickel bar:

**1.** What would the sag be for a 2-m horizontal circular rod (radius 10–2 m) if a 12-kg mass were hung in the middle of it?

**A.** 1.3 × 10–3 m

**B.** 8 × 10–3 m

**C.** 1.2 × 10–2 m

**D.** 1.6 × 10–2 m

**2.** What would the sag be for a 6-m horizontal circular rod (radius 10–2 m) if a 3-kg mass were hung in the middle of it?

**A.** 9 × 10–4 m

**B.** 2.7 × 10–3 m

**C.** 1.8 × 10–2 m

**D.** 8.1 × 10–2 m

**Solution:** The mistake some students make is calculating _Y_ as an intermediate step. That is not wrong, but it wastes time. For question 1, compare the set up with Experiment 4. The only difference is that the mass is three times as great. According to the equation, if the mass increases by a factor of 3, then the sag increases by a factor of 3. Thus the sag is 1.2 × 10–2 m.

For question 2, compare it to Experiment 3. The length increases by a factor of 3, but everything else remains the same. According to the equation, the sag increases by a factor of 33 = 27. Thus the new sag is 27 (3 × 10–3 m) = 8.1 × 10–2 m.

For some questions involving charts, the key is to

**Example 4:** In a certain experiment a small cannon shoots a ball (mass _m_ ) vertically into the air. Its initial velocity ( _v_ 0) is recorded, as well as its velocity after it has traveled 0.5 m vertically (Figure I-10). This is done for several masses and initial velocities (see chart).

Figure I-10

Experiment | _m_ (kg) | _v_ 0 (m/s)  
---|---|---  
1 | 1 | 4  
2 | 1 | 8  
3 | 2 | 6  
4 | 4 | 4

**1.** For which experiment does the ball have the greatest potential energy at the top of its path?

**A.** Experiment 1

**B.** Experiment 2

**C.** Experiment 3

**D.** Experiment 4

**2.** For which experiment does the ball have the greatest kinetic energy at the height of 0.5 m?

**A.** Experiment 1

**B.** Experiment 2

**C.** Experiment 3

**D.** Experiment 4

**Solution:** We ask, does this remind us of a problem we have done before? In a number of problems we have seen objects in free fall, and the guiding principle is the conservation of energy. For question 1, a ball will have a large potential energy at the top of its path if it has a large initial kinetic energy. So let's add a column to the chart containing initial kinetic energy.

Experiment | _m_ (kg) | _v_ 0 (m/s) | _E_ K1 (J)  
---|---|---|---  
1 | 1 | 4 | 8  
2 | 1 | 8 | 32  
3 | 2 | 6 | 36  
4 | 4 | 4 | 32

The answer to question 1 is C.

When the ball is at height 0.5 m, some of the initial energy has been converted to potential energy. This potential energy is _E_ P2 = _mgh_ 0 where _h_ 0 = 0.5 m. We can add two columns to the chart: the potential energy at _h_ 0 = 0.5 m and the left over kinetic energy (recall that the total energy is conserved). For instance, for Experiment 1, we have _E_ P2 = (1 kg)(10 m/s2)(0.5 m) = 5 J and _E_ K2 = (8 – 5) J = 3 J.

The answer to question 2 is B.

These methods are not exhaustive, so you should feel free to add to them as you work through problems yourself. But nothing can substitute for gaining a solid understanding of physics.

## Chapter 10  
Fluids

### A. Introduction

In studying mechanics, we have generally looked at one object and the forces on it. For most people, the difficult part of mechanics is unlearning the misconception that a moving object needs a force to maintain its motion. (Recall Example 4 in Section 5.D.)

In this chapter we study fluids. A fluid is a large number of interacting particles, so it is somewhat more complicated. The key concept here is _pressure_. In any given problem you should be thinking, "Do I know the pressure everywhere? Can I figure out the pressure where the crocodile is?" and that sort of thing. Even if pressure is not mentioned in the problem, often it is the concept which leads you to the answer. For instance, when a teenager sips a soft drink through a straw, does he pull the refreshing liquid into his mouth? As you will soon discover, the answer is no.

For the MCAT, you need to know only a few basic principles of elementary fluid mechanics. The tricky part is learning how to apply them in diverse situations. One way to do this is to look at so many examples that any new situation reminds you of something you have seen or worked before. Hence you should pay close attention to the problems and solutions at the end of the chapter.

### B. Some definitions

_Density_ is a measure of how packed a substance is. Its symbol is the Greek letter rho, _ρ_ , and it is defined by

where _m_ is the mass of a piece of fluid and _V_ is its volume. _Specific gravity_ is the ratio of the density of something to the density of water:

(This is a misnomer, by the way, since "specific gravity" has nothing to do with gravity.) The density of almost all biological tissue is approximately the same as the density of water (remember this):

_Pressure_ is like a push (that is, force), except we also consider the area over which the push is extended. If you are barefoot and step on the sidewalk, the sidewalk pushes up on you with about 1000 N. If you step on an upright tack, it pushes up on you with the same 1000 N. Why then does your face look so different when it's a tack that you stepped on? In this case, pressure is the important concept. Pressure is defined as

where _F_ is a force, and _A_ is the area over which it acts. Consider this definition carefully, so that you do not confuse force and pressure. The point of a tack has a much smaller area than the bottom of your foot, so the pressure on that point is quite large.

The units for pressure are N/m2, and these have a name:

Pressure can also be measured in pounds per square inch, or psi. The pressure of the atmosphere at sea level varies, but its average is given by

### C. Buoyant force

When an object is floating on or immersed in a fluid, such as an iceberg in water or a whale in the ocean, the fluid pushes on the object from many directions. This situation might seem too complicated to analyze mathematically, but it turns out that it is not. We can summarize the effect of the fluid in one force, the buoyant force. The following principle is called _Archimedes_ ' _principle_ , after its discoverer:

The method for solving problems involving Archimedes' principle follows:

1. DRAW A DIAGRAM, including the buoyant force.

2. Write a force equation.

3. Get rid of _m_ and _F_. (Use _m_ = _ρV, F_ = _PA_ , and of course _F_ B = _ρVg_.)

4. Solve.

**Example 1:** A bathtub duck floats in water with one third of its volume above the water line. What is its specific gravity?

**Solution:** First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM. (See Figure 10-1.)

Figure 10-1

Second, we write a force equation, which is a force balance equation, since the duck is not accelerating:

0 = _F_ B – _mg_

Next we replace _F_ B with _ρ_ H2O _V_ disp _g_ , and we replace _m_ with _ρV_ , where _ρ_ is the density of the duck, and _V_ is its volume:

Since one third of the duck is shown above the water, the displaced volume is 2 _V_ /3, and we write

Here we canceled the factors _V_ and _g_. The answer is 2/3

**Example 2:** A crown, apparently made of gold, is weighed in air, and the weight is 50 N. The crown is weighed again by hanging it from a string and submerging it in water. (See Figure 10-2.) What reading will the force meter give if the crown is true gold? (Use for the density of gold 19.3 g/cm3; and for water, 1.0 g/cm3. Also, use _g_ = 10 m/s2.)

Figure 10-2

**Solution:** First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM with all the forces on the crown. (See Figure 10-3.)

Figure 10-3

We draw the force of gravity first. Next, what is touching the crown? The fluid and the string are, so we know to draw the buoyant force and the force of tension. It is the force of tension that the meter reads. (That is what a force meter does: it provides a force and then tells you what that force is.)

We have force balance because there is no acceleration:

0 = _F_ m \+ _F_ B – _mg_

In this equation _m_ is the mass of the crown, and _mg_ is 50 N. Let's first solve for _F_ m (which we want), then replace _F_ B and _m_. We obtain

### D. Facts about pressure

We want to answer the question: Given the pressure at one point in a fluid, what is the pressure at any other point? In fact, the key intuition on many problems is understanding what the pressure is everywhere.

Let us start with the simple situation shown in Figure 10-4. Point 1 is directly above point 2 in a fluid. The pressure at point 1 is _P_ 1. What is the pressure at point 2?

Figure 10-4

Consider a vertical pipe filled with fluid and consider the body of fluid between points 1 and 2 as an object. The pipe's height is _h_ and its cross-sectional area is _A_.

There are three vertical forces: the force of gravity, the force of the pressure pushing up from below, and the force of the pressure pushing down from above. The fluid is not accelerating, so the net force is zero, and we have

We can cancel the factor _A_ :

This equation applies not only to this situation but to any situation involving two vertically separated points in a fluid. The pressure is greater at point 2 because more fluid is pressing down on top of point 2 than on top of point 1.

We can obtain pressures at other points in the fluid using a principle, discovered by Blaise Pascal: "Pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted to every portion of the fluid and the walls of the containing vessel in all directions." The language is a bit obscure, but it translates into principles 2 and 3 below.

**Example 1:** We are standing on the fifty-first story of a hotel, where each story is 4 meters high. How much less is the pressure on the fifty-first story than the pressure at the ground floor? (Use 1.2 × 10–3 g/cm3 for the density of air.)

**Solution:** This is a straightforward application of the formula:

This pressure is fairly small compared to _P_ atm, but it is enough to make your ears pop. Notice what is going on here. The people on the ground floor have to deal with not only the air column on top of us at the fifty-first floor, but also they have the air column between us and the ground floor sitting on their head.

**Example 2:** An underground cave is almost filled with water as shown in Figure 10-5. The air pressure above point S is 1 atm. The point Q is 20 m directly below point S, and T is at the same height as Q. R is 5 m vertically below S.

a. What is the pressure at point Q?

b. What is the pressure at point T against the floor?

c. What is the pressure at point T against the walls?

d. What is the pressure in the air chamber above R?

Figure 10-5

**Solution:** a. The pressure at Q is given by the formula:

b and c.

_P_ T = 3.01 × 105 Pa

d.

The pressure inside the air chamber varies slightly with height but it is approximately equal to the pressure at R.

**Example 3:** A pan contains a pool of mercury, with an inverted tube, as shown in Figure 10-6.

Point A is 38 cm above the surface of the mercury in the pan. Point B is 75 cm above the surface of the mercury in the pan. Point C is 76 cm above the surface of the mercury in the pan. The pressure of the air on the mercury in the pan is 1.01325 × 105 Pa, the density of mercury is 1.36 × 104 kg/m3, and the acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s2.

a. What is the pressure at point A?

b. What is the pressure at point B?

c. What is the pressure at point C?

Figure 10-6

**Solution:** a. When we apply the equation to point A, we obtain

b. At point B, we obtain

c. At point C, we obtain

Thus the pressure vanishes at the top of the column.

This is a simple barometer. Above the mercury column is a vacuum, or, more accurately, mercury vapor. The last calculation shows that the height of the mercury column is proportional to the outside pressure. For this reason, the height of a hypothetical mercury column is often given as units of pressure:

These are the units used in a sphygmomanometer. But the numbers reported in blood pressure measurements are the pressures in excess of atmospheric pressure, called the _gauge pressure_. For instance, the systolic pressure of a woman with blood pressure 110/60 is actually (760 + 110) torr = 870 torr (assuming 760 torr atmospheric pressure). Thus:

### E. Surface tension

The molecules in the middle of a fluid exert an attractive force on each other, called cohesion. This is what holds the fluid together. The molecules at the surface of the fluid, however, experience a cohesive force directed into the fluid. If the surface becomes bent for some reason, there is a restoring force making the surface smooth or flat. The larger the distortion, the larger the force, up to a maximum:

where _γ_ is the surface tension (a function of the fluid) and _L_ is the length of the edge of the object in contact with the fluid. This will become clearer with some examples.

**Example 1:** Water has a surface tension of 7.2 × 10–2 N/m at 25° C. A six-legged water bug stands on the surface of the water. The radius of each foot is 2 × 10–4 m. What is the maximum force on the bug due to the water? That is, what is the maximum weight the water surface tension can support?

**Solution:** In this case, _L_ is the circumference of a foot. (See Figure 10-7.) Applying the formula yields _F_ max = 6 _γ_ (2 _πr_ ) = 5 × 10–4 N, where 6 is the number of legs on the bug.

Figure 10-7

**Example 2:** A needle floats on the surface of the water as shown in Figure 10-8. Its length is _l_ = 3 cm, and its width is very small. What is the maximum force exerted on the needle by the surface tension of the water?

Figure 10-8

**Solution:** In this case, _L_ is the circumference of the dimple, that is, the length of distorted surface _around_ the needle or the length of the dashed line in Figure 10-8. Notice the similarity between Figures 10-7 and 10-8. We use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:

_L_ = 2 _l_ \+ 2 _w_ ≈ 2 _l_

since the width _w_ is very small. Thus we have

_F_ max = _γ_ (2 _l_ ) = 4.3 × 10–3 N

**Example 3:** A straight piece of wire has loops at both ends, and the two hoops fit on the arms of a U-shaped frame. A water film fills the interior of the U-shape. (See Figure 10-9.) In this case the surface tension exerts its maximum force.

If the length of the wire is _l_ and the width of the film is _w_ , what is the force of surface tension?

Figure 10-9

**Solution:** The circumference is the distance around the wire, as in the previous example. In Figure 10-9 we measure the length of the wire along the front of the page and then along the back of the page:

_F_ max = _γ_ (2 _l_ )

### F. Continuity

The dynamics of flowing fluids is more difficult than statics, but this is good news. It means the MCAT will test only some of the basic principles.

The first principle is _continuity_. Figure 10-10 shows a river, in which point 1 is in a slow, lazy flow, while point 2 is in the rapids. Why does the water flow faster at point 2? During one second the number of gallons flowing past point 1 is the same as the number flowing past point 2. (Think about it. If the water level between 1 and 2 is constant, then the inflow must equal the outflow.) The difference is that point 2 has a smaller cross-sectional area.

The rate at which a fluid passes by a point, measured in volume per time, is called the _flow rate f_. In a steady state, the flow rate is the same at each point along the flow:

Now we can relate the flow rate to the actual speed of the fluid. Think of water going through a garden hose. If we turn up the faucet, then the flow rate and the flow velocity both increase. We can also obtain a greater flow rate by increasing the cross-sectional area. We would guess (correctly) that we could write

The discussion in this section refers to any incompressible fluid, that is, liquids. It also applies to compressible fluids, like air, if the fluids are not, in fact, compressed.

### G. Viscosity and Turbulence

_Viscosity_ is a measure of the stickiness of a fluid. Molasses is stickier, for instance, than water, and water is stickier than air. A precise definition of viscosity looks like this: Say we have a floor covered with a fluid to a depth _d_. A hockey puck of area _A_ is traveling along at velocity _v_. The drag force on the hockey puck due to the stickiness of the fluid is given by

where _η_ is the viscosity in kg/ms (that is, kilograms per meter per second, not kilograms per millisecond). You should understand this equation but need not memorize it. Just remember that viscosity is stickiness.

Viscosity often calms down a flow. Consider a stream of water flowing past a rock or the flow of air past a weather vane. The flow can break off into wild swirls and chaotic patterns, called _turbulence_. Smooth flow is called _streamline_ or _laminar_. If we pull a spoon through a bowl of molasses, the molasses is mostly undisturbed (laminar flow around the spoon), whereas if we pull the spoon through a cup of tea with cream at the bottom, the tea and cream undergo turbulent motion. What's the difference? The more viscosity, the less turbulence.

An important parameter for determining the type of flow is the Reynolds number:

where _l_ is the size (in m) of the obstacle in the flow (spoon or whatever), _ρ_ is the density of the fluid (in kg/m3), _v_ is the velocity of the flow (in m/s), and _η_ is viscosity (in kg/m s).

The flow starts getting rough when _Re_ is around 40, and it is usually turbulent if _Re_ is greater than 20,000. Do not memorize this equation, but do realize that the presence of η in the denominator means that higher viscosity reduces turbulence. It should also make sense to you that _v_ is in the numerator.

**Example:** What is the Reynolds number for a spoon moving through tea with cream in it? (Use _η_ = 1.0 × 10–3 kg/ms and estimate other values.)

**Solution:** We can use information corresponding to water, so the density is 103 kg/m3, and the viscosity is 1.0 × 10–3 kg/m s. A good rate to stir tea is 0.1 m/s, and a typical spoon has size 0.03 m. Thus

### H. Bernoulli's Principle

For laminar flow there is an equation which relates conditions at one point in the flow with points downstream. Consider two points, 1 and 2, along a streamline. Point 1 is at some height _h_ 1 above a standard height, and point 2 is at height _h_ 2. (See Figure 10-11.)

Figure 10-11

Let's see if we can make sense of this equation, which can also be written

The expression _ρgh_ reminds us of _mgh_ , the difference being only a factor of Δ _V_ , that is, volume. If we multiply the above expression by Δ _V_ , then we obtain

_PΔV_ \+ _mgh_ \+ 1/2 _mv_ 2 = const

Wait! This looks like an energy conservation equation, the second and third terms being potential and kinetic energy. But what is the first term? This is a bit more difficult, but we can make this look like an expression for work. For a moving fluid, Δ _V_ can be replaced with _A_ Δ _x_ so that _P_ Δ _V_ = _PA_ Δ _x_ = _F_ Δ _x_. Thus, _P_ Δ _V_ is the work that one portion of the fluid does on another portion of the fluid as it moves along.

Bernoulli's principle is an expression of energy conservation, and that is why there are so many caveats in the statement of the principle: we are trying to make sure energy does not leak out into heat and ruin the equation.

**Example:** A large barrel of water has a hole near the bottom. The barrel is filled to a height of 4.5 meters above the bottom of the barrel, and the hole is a circle of radius 1 centimeter in the side of the barrel at a height 0.5 meters above the bottom.

a. What is the flow velocity _v_ just outside the hole?

b. What is the flow rate _f_ out of the hole?

**Solution:** a. First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM with a streamline. (See Figure 10-12).

Figure 10-12

Bernoulli's principle applies, so we have

We are looking for _v_ 3. At point 1, the pressure is atmospheric pressure _P_ atm, and at point 3, we have _P_ 3 = _P_ atm as well. Also, _h_ 1 = 4.5 m and _h_ 3 = 0.5 m.

The tricky part is realizing that _v_ 1 is very, very small. This is because continuity guarantees that _A_ 1 _v_ 1 = _A_ 3 _v_ 3, where _A_ 1 is the cross-sectional area of the barrel and _A_ 3 is the area of the hole. Thus we can set _v_ 1 to zero in the above equation:

Another way to get the same result is to realize that the pressure at point 2 must be (from Section D)

Then we can use Bernoulli's principle between points 2 and 3 and use _h_ 2 = _h_ 3 to obtain

Again, we set the very small velocity _v_ 2 to zero to obtain

b. The answer to part b we get through the definition of flow rate, so we have

In this chapter we studied fluids in static equilibrium and fluids in motion. Pressure is a unifying concept for fluids in equilibrium. Pressure is related to force by the equation _P_ = _F_ / _A_ (where the units of pressure are often Pa = N/m2). Pressure at one point in a body of fluid can be related to pressure at another point using _P_ 2 = _P_ 1 \+ _ρgh_ (for vertical separation) and Pascal's law (for horizontal separation). If we know the pressure everywhere in a situation, we can often understand the physics and answer questions about it.

The important concepts for fluids in motion are continuity and Bernoulli's principle. Continuity expresses the conservation of mass as the fluid flows, so we have the product _Av_ being a constant along a streamline. Bernoulli's principle expresses the conservation of energy along the fluid flow, so we have the sum _P_ \+ 1/2 _ρv_ 2 \+ _ρgh_ being a constant along a streamline, as long as energy is not lost to heat or other energy sinks. These two principles allow you to solve most simple problems involving flowing fluids.

### Passage 1

When we place a straw (a hollow cylindrical tube) in water, the water inside the straw rises above the surface level outside and a miniscus (curvature of the surface) forms. Consider the column of water in the straw from the height of the water outside the straw to the top of the column. (See figure, where the column is shown shaded.) Let _P_ 1 be a point in the straw at the bottom of the column and let _P_ 2 be a point inside the water column at the top.

The force due to surface tension for a maximally stretched surface is given by _F_ surf = _γL_ , where _γ_ is the coefficient of surface tension (which depends only on the substance) and _L_ is the length of the line of contact between an object and the fluid. For this problem use the following:

_ρ_ = density of water

_γ_ = surface tension of water

_r_ = radius of the straw

_h_ = height of the column

_P_ atm = atmospheric pressure

### Passage 2

Vascular plants transport water by a passive transport system using xylem, a cell tissue which forms thin, long cylinders along branches of plants. In particular, trees use this tissue to transport water against the force of gravity to great heights.

In one model (Model 1, shown in first figure below), xylem is a tube or pipe, and water is "pulled" up by reducing the pressure at the top of the column of water in the xylem. The figure shows a tube whose bottom end is in a reservoir of water. The top end is closed and has a cavity whose pressure is less than atmospheric pressure. It turns out not to be a good model for Nature.

In another model (Model 2, shown in figure below), xylem is a narrow tube which exerts a force on water by surface tension, the same force that causes water to rise in a thin straw when it is sitting in water. In this case the forces on the column of water have to be balanced, so the downward force of gravity is equal to the upward force of surface tension. The force of surface tension is the product of the coefficient of surface tension _γ_ (0.072 N/m for water) and the circumference of the cylinder.

In both models the height of the column is _h_ and the radius of the tube is _r_ , which is about 2 × 10–7 m. Use the estimate _P_ atm = 105 N/m2 for atmospheric pressure. Use 103 kg/m3 for the density of water and 10 m/s2 for the acceleration of gravity.

**B.** 10 meters

**C.** 20 meters

**D.** 200 meters

**3.** What is maximum height of a column of water in xylem in Model 2?

**B.** 36 meters

**C.** 72 meters

**D.** 144 meters

**4.** How could the maximum height be increased in Model 2?

**A.** Decrease the radius of the cylinder.

**B.** Increase the radius of the cylinder.

**C.** Increase the density of xylem.

**D.** None of the above will increase the maximum height.

Note: The tallest trees are the redwoods, which can be as high as 100 meters.

### Passage 3

When the bombardier beetle is attacked or provoked, it sprays a jet of hot liquid toward its attacker. The jet comes out of an opening at the tip of its abdomen, which it can move in order to direct the stream.

The physical mechanism for creating the hot spray consists of two chambers in the abdomen: an inner chamber which stores hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone in water solution, connected by a valve to an outer chamber which contains oxidative enzymes (peroxidase and catalase) adhered to the walls. The beetle squeezes the hydrogen peroxide and hydroquinone into the outer chamber where the following reaction takes place to form quinone (also called 1,4-benzoquinone):

The heats of formation of the various compounds are shown in the table.

species |    
---|---  
hydrogen peroxide | –45.68  
hydroquinone | –44.65  
quinone | –44.84  
water | –68.32

This reaction in the outer chamber creates a solution of the products of reaction (1) in water. This solution has enough heat and pressure to create a hot stream to shoot out of an opening (radius 0.1 mm) in the tip of the abdomen at a speed _v_ = 12 m/s.

We can model this outer chamber as a volume (reaction flask) with a nozzle. The pressure in the chamber _P_ cham is greater than the outside pressure _P_ atm, and this provides the force on the fluid in the nozzle. The nozzle has radius _r_ and cross-sectional area _A_ , and the entire chamber has volume _V_ cham. The temperature of the fluid in the chamber is _T_ cham.

**D.** The activation energy is decreased.

**2.** What is the flow rate out of the beetle's abdomen?

**A.** 4 × 10–8 cm3/s

**B.** 4 × 10–6 cm3/s

**C.** 4 × 10–4 cm3/s

**D.** 0.4 cm3/s

**3.** What is the approximate height to which the spray would travel if it were directed straight up? (Ignore air resistance.)

**A.** 0.6 meters

**B.** 1.2 meters

**C.** 7.2 meters

**D.** 14.4 meters

**4.** How does the catalyst affect the heat of reaction for reaction (1)?

**A.** The catalyst decreases the heat of reaction.

**B.** The catalyst does not affect the heat of reaction.

**C.** The catalyst increases the heat of reaction.

**D.** The catalyst may decrease or increase the heat of reaction depending on the temperature.

**5.** Which of the following expressions gives the _best_ approximation of the pressure inside the chamber?

**A.** _P_ atm \+ 1/2 _ρv_ 2, where _ρ_ is the density of the fluid.

**B.** _n_ q _RT/V_ cham, where _n_ q is the number of moles of quinone in the chamber.

**C.** _nRT/V_ cham, where _n_ is the number of moles of molecules in the chamber.

**D.** _P_ atm \+ _nRT/V_ cham, where _n_ is the number of moles of molecules in the chamber.

**6.** In reference to the model in the last paragraph, which gives the best expression for the total force on the part of the fluid in the nozzle?

**A.** ( _P_ cham – _P_ atm) _A_

**B.** ( _P_ cham \+ _P_ atm) _A_

**C.**

**D.**

**7.** Once reaction (1) takes place in the outer chamber, a scientist wants to determine whether there is enough heat to raise the temperature to the boiling point of the solution. In addition to the information given in the passage and the boiling point of the product solution, what information does she need to do the calculation?

**A.** Heat capacity of the solution.

**B.** Heat capacity of the solution and the concentration of quinone.

**C.** Heat capacity of the solution, the concentration of quinone, and the heat of reaction (1).

**D.** Heat capacity of the solution, the concentration of quinone, and volume of the outer chamber.

### Passage 4

A recent innovation in automobile safety is the airbag. In the event of a collision, an airbag in front of the driver inflates in about 0.02 seconds. As the driver's body comes to a rapid stop, the airbag provides a soft cushion, softer than the steering wheel in any case.

The essential mechanism of the airbag consists of a sealed combustion chamber containing iron(III) oxide and sodium azide, which react to form the nitrogen gas which fills the airbag:

In the same chamber is an igniter, consisting of an electric coil, zirconium and potassium hyperchlorate, which react somewhat as follows:

The main active ingredient in the airbag is the sodium azide. This ingredient is prepared using the reaction of sodium amide and nitrous oxide:

During a collision, an electric coil starts reaction (2). This provides the heat which ignites reaction (1). After 1–5 ms, the seal of the combustion chamber bursts and releases the products (see figure). A filter screen removes the solid products of reaction (1) and other trace reaction products (some possibly noxious) while passing the nitrogen gas.

The nitrogen gas fills the bag in about 20 ms, and the whole reaction (1) continues for about 50 ms. The bag is porous, so as the driver presses against it, the bag deflates. Thus, it is almost completely deflated by the time the accident is over. After that, it is hoped that the driver can walk away from the collision with no injuries worse than abrasions from the inflating bag.

**1.** What is a possible purpose for keeping the combustion chamber sealed during the first 1–5 ms of reaction?

**A.** This ensures that poisonous byproducts are prevented from entering the bag.

**B.** The concentration of reactants is kept high to speed the reaction.

**C.** The reactants are protected from water vapor, which could contaminate the reaction.

**D.** This keeps the reactants near the catalyst.

**2.** Of reactions (1), (2), and (3), which has the greatest entropy increase?

**A.** (1)

**B.** (2)

**C.** (3)

**D.** All three have zero entropy increase.

**3.** Assume that the final gas has temperature 27° C at 1 atmosphere of pressure. If 1000 liters of gas are desired, which expression gives the grams of sodium azide required?

**A.**

**B.**

**C.**

**D.**

**4.** What is the best possible purpose for having the bag deflate as the driver presses into it?

**A.** As the bag deflates, the temperature of the gas decreases to safe levels.

**B.** Allowing the gas to flow out of the bag ensures that the bag does not burst.

**C.** The bag's deflation decreases the energy of the collision.

**D.** Increasing the distance over which the deceleration occurs decreases the required force.

**5.** What is the advantage of having an airbag with larger area (as one views it from the driver seat)?

**A.** Increasing the area increases the gas flow rate.

**B.** Increasing the area decreases the gas flow rate.

**C.** Increasing the area decreases the pressure on any given body part.

**D.** Increasing the area decreases the density of the gas inside the bag.

**6.** Which of the following is the best description of the energy flow for the airbag inflation?

**A.** chemical to heat

**B.** chemical to gravitational potential.

**C.** chemical to kinetic to heat.

**D.** chemical to heat to work against the atmosphere.

**7.** Which of the following is the _least_ likely byproduct for reaction (1) referred to in Paragraph 3?

**A.** NaO2

**B.** Na

**C.** FeO

**D.** Na3N

### Passage 5

A barometer, that is, a device that measures pressure, can be constructed from a tube which is open at both ends and shaped like a U. A fluid, like mercury, is placed inside, filling the bottom portion of the U. If the height of the mercury column at one end is greater than at the other end, then the pressure above the liquid on that end is less.

A modification of a barometer can be used to measure flow speed. Consider a pipe which carries an inviscid, incompressible fluid moving a speed _v_ and pressure _P_ 1 far upstream. Barometer 1 does not interrupt the flow, so it measures _P_ 1. If Barometer 2 is placed in the flow as shown in the figure below, then the tip of the barometer forms an obstruction in the flow.

The flow just in front of the tip comes to stop at what is called a _stagnation point_. Nevertheless, we can consider the line shown in the figure, which comes to an end at the stagnation point, to be a streamline.

The figure below shows a flow with a constriction. The flow far upstream has a speed _v_ 3, pressure _P_ 3, and a cross-sectional area _A_ 3. In the constriction the flow has a velocity _v_ 4, pressure _P_ 4, and a cross-sectional area _A_ 4.

_For the following problems, let _ρ_ be the density of mercury_.

**1.** In the first figure, the heights of the left and right columns of mercury are _h_ 1 and _h_ 2, respectively. Which expression gives the reservoir pressure _P_ res?

**A.** _P_ atm – _ρg_ ( _h_ 2 – _h_ 1)

**B.** _P_ atm \+ _ρg_ ( _h_ 2 – _h_ 1)

**C.** _P_ atm – _ρg_ ( _h_ 2 \+ _h_ 1)

**D.** _P_ atm \+ _ρg_ ( _h_ 2 \+ _h_ 1)

**2.** If the pressure measured by Barometer 1 in the second figure is _P_ 1 and that measured by Barometer 2 is _P_ 2, then what is the upstream velocity of the flow?

**A.**

**B.**

**C.**

**D.**

**3.** How does the speed _v_ 4 compare with the speed _v_ 3?

**A.** The speed _v_ 4 is less than _v_ 3.

**B.** The speed _v_ 4 is the same as _v_ 3.

**C.** The speed _v_ 4 is greater than _v_ 3.

**D.** This cannot be determined from the information given.

**4.** How does the pressure _P_ 4 compare with the pressure _P_ 3?

**A.** The pressure _P_ 4 is less than _P_ 3.

**B.** The pressure _P_ 4 is the same as _P_ 3.

**C.** The pressure _P_ 4 is greater than _P_ 3.

**D.** This cannot be determined from the information given.

**5.** Suppose the fluid were replaced with an incompressible fluid that had viscosity, but _v_ 3, _P_ 3, _A_ 3, and _A_ 4 remained the same. How would the velocity, _v_ 4new, in the constriction be changed from _v_ 4?

**A.** The speed would be less than _v_ 4.

**B.** The speed would be the same as _v_ 4.

**C.** The speed would be greater than _v_ 4.

**D.** This cannot be determined from the information given.

**6.** Again, suppose the fluid were replaced with a fluid that had viscosity, but _v_ 3, _P_ 3, _A_ 3, and _A_ 4 remained the same. How would the new pressure in the constriction be changed from _P_ 4?

**A.** The new pressure would be less than _P_ 4.

**B.** The new pressure would be the same as _P_ 4.

**C.** The new pressure would be greater than _P_ 4.

**D.** This cannot be determined from the information given.

## Chapter 11  
Periodic Motion and Waves

### A. Introduction

This chapter begins the study of waves. Waves govern many of the phenomena we experience every day, such as sound and light. In this chapter we look at what these various wave phenomena have in common, their so-called "wavelike" nature. In the following two chapters we will look at sound and light separately. For these chapters it will be important to have pen and paper ready to recopy diagrams and rework problems. But it is especially important to have ready a mental pad of paper. You need to visualize the to-and-fro motion of the medium, the shape of waves, and the bending and reflecting of waves. Only in this way will the few formulas and ideas become intuitive.

### B. Springs

If you stretch a spring, the spring exerts a pull on you. The more you stretch it, the more it pulls. If you compress a spring capable of being compressed, then it exerts a push. Hooke's law states that the force is proportional to the extension or compression.

Let's be clear about the forces involved here. Figure 11-2 shows a spring attached to a wall stretched by a hand. Figure 11-3 shows all the forces involved. The force _F_ 1 is the force the spring exerts on the wall, and _F_ 2 is the force the wall exerts on the spring. These forces are equal in magnitude because of the third law of motion. The force _F_ 3 is the force the hand exerts on the spring, and _F_ 4 is the force the spring exerts on the hand. The forces _F_ 3 and _F_ 4 are equal in magnitude because of the third law of motion as well. The forces _F_ 2 and _F_ 3 add to zero because of the _second_ law of motion, because the spring is not accelerating, giving force balance. All these forces are equal in magnitude (for various reasons), but there are four forces.

Figure 11-1

Figure 11-2

Figure 11-3

In spring problems, as in many types of physics problems, it is important to follow the energy. The potential energy of a stretched or compressed spring is as follows:

This energy is the second type of potential energy we have encountered. In many problems, we can treat this potential energy like gravitational potential energy.

**Example:** One end of a horizontal spring ( _k_ = 20 N/m) is connected to a wall, and the other end is connected to a mass _m_ (0.2 kg). The spring is compressed 0.1 m from equilibrium. After it is released, how much work does the spring do in order to push the mass to the equilibrium position?

**Solution:** Our first idea is to write the work equation: _W_ = _F_ springΔ _x_ cos _φ_ = _F_ springΔ _x_ = (20 N/m 3 0.1 m) (0.1 m) = 0.2 J. But this would be WRONG. The force of the spring begins at (20 N/m) (0.1 m) = 2 N, but then it decreases as the spring moves the mass. (See Figure 11-4, showing the system at three different times.) In the work equation we assume the force is constant. What shall we do?

Figure 11-4

Let's think about the flow of energy after the release. The work done by the spring on the mass is the same as the change in kinetic energy of the mass (by energy conservation), that is,

_W_ tot = Δ _E_ K

But the kinetic energy of the mass comes from the potential energy of the spring, so we have

_W_ tot = Δ _E_ K = –Δ _E_ P

= _E_ P1 – _E_ P2

= 1/2 _kx_ 2 – 0

= 1/2 (20 N/m)(0.1 m)2 = 0.1 J

This is one of those problems in which blind plugging into the formulas is to no avail, but thinking about the energy flow is the key to success.

### C. Periodic Motion: One Oscillator

Let's think about a mass _m_ connected to a horizontal spring (resting length _l_ 0, spring constant _k_ ) which is connected to a wall. The mass is sitting on a frictionless floor (so we can ignore vertical forces). We stretch the spring to length _l_ 0 \+ _A_ and let go. What happens?

At first the spring pulls the mass back towards equilibrium. As the mass goes faster, the displacement _x_ and force _F_ spring decrease. When the spring is length _l_ 0, the mass is moving velocity – _v_ max. Because the length is _l_ 0 (and thus _x_ = 0), the restoring force and acceleration are zero. The maximum displacement occurs when _v_ = 0 and the magnitude of the spring force is very large. Figure 11-5 shows the movement at five times. Spend some time making sure you understand every entry on the table. In the first line the negative sign of the acceleration indicates the acceleration vector points left, the same as the force of the spring. This motion is called _simple harmonic motion_.

Figure 11-5

Energy changes from potential to kinetic and back again, but the total energy is conserved. We have

The maximum displacement of the mass from equilibrium is the _amplitude A_. The _period T_ is the time it takes for the system to go through one cycle, and it has units [s]. The _frequency f_ is the number of cycles a system goes through in a unit of time, and it has units [1/s = Hertz = Hz]. We have

The frequency is related to the spring constant and the mass as follows:

Let's see if this equation makes sense. We would guess that a system with a stiff spring would have a high frequency (think about it), so it makes sense that _k_ should be in the numerator. As _k_ increases, _f_ increases. Also a larger mass will decrease the frequency, so it makes sense that _m_ is in the denominator. The square root is needed to make the units agree.

Let's consider a similar set up. In a pendulum we have a bob connected to a string or a light rod, which is connected to a ceiling of some sort. In this case, the restoring force is provided not by a spring but by a component of gravity. In Figure 11-6, the solid arrows are the two forces on the bob, and the dashed arrows show the gravitational force divided into components, along the supporting rod and perpendicular to it. The restoring force is the latter

where sin _θ_ is approximately equal to _θ_ (measured in radians) for small angles. Note the similarity of this equation to equation (1). In both, the force is proportional to the displacement, so the motion is similar. The frequency of a pendulum is given by

Note that the mass of the bob _m_ does not appear in this equation, so a 10-kg mass swings on a 3-m string with the same period as a 0.1-kg mass swinging on a 3-m string. You need not memorize this equation, but you should be familiar with the fact that _m_ does not appear in it.

Figure 11-6

### D. Periodic Motion: Two Connected Oscillators

In the last section we looked at a single oscillator moving in one dimension. Figure 11-7 shows a slightly more complicated system with two similar pendulums connected by a weak spring. Let's look at some general characteristics of this system.

Figure 11-7

If one of the pendulums is set to swinging, the other pendulum hardly moves at first because the coupling is weak. Gradually, the second pendulum swings higher and higher, while the first pendulum swings less and less. Then the first pendulum comes almost to a stop while the second one swings with the original amplitude of the first. The energy of swinging has transferred from the first pendulum to the second. (See Figure 11-8.)

Now the situation is reversed from the original set up. The second pendulum now transfers energy to the first pendulum. This continues until the second one is at rest and the first is swinging. This is an example of a general principle.

Figure 11-8 shows two pendulums with a very weak spring connecting them.

Figure 11-8

Another example of resonance involves a soprano, a wine glass, and the air between them. The soprano can tap the glass to hear its natural frequency. If she sings that note very loudly, then the energy starts in one oscillator, her vocal cords, and transfers to the other oscillator, the wine glass, by the weak coupling, the air. In this case, enough energy enters the wine glass to cause it to go into a nonlinear regime, and it bursts. (See Section 7.E.)

### E. Waves, an Introduction

When you throw a rock into an otherwise calm lake, the circular ripples carry energy and momentum away from the original disturbance. These ripples are waves (Figure 11-9). When you see a ripple across a field of grain, that is not a wave, because it is the wind pushing the grain, and the grain itself does not carry any energy or momentum.

Figure 11-9

Figure 11-10 shows water waves frozen at several moments in time. The waves are moving to the right. A water skater sitting at point P goes up and down and up with period _T_ , measured in [s]. Of course, his frequency is _f_ = 1/ _T_. The _wavelength λ_ is the length from peak to peak (or trough to trough or ascending zero point to ascending zero point). The wavelength is measured in [m]. The _amplitude A_ is a measure of the size of the disturbance, measured from the equilibrium point to the high point. The units depend on the kind of wave it is and on how we measure it.

Figure 11-10

The velocity of a wave is given by

In many cases the velocity is constant, and this formula simply relates frequency and wavelength. Watch for this on the MCAT.

In a wave, if the disturbance of the medium is in the same direction as the direction of wave travel, then the wave is called _longitudinal_. Figure 11-11 shows a longitudinal wave on a spring. The small arrows show the direction of the displacement, and the large arrow shows the direction of travel.

Figure 11-11

If the disturbance of the medium is perpendicular to the direction of wave travel, then the wave is called _transverse_. Figure 11-12 shows two examples of transverse waves. Transverse waves are capable of being _polarized_ , that is, they can be confined to moving in one of two dimensions. Unpolarized transverse waves are a random mixture of the two polarizations. Longitudinal waves cannot be polarized.

Figure 11-12

The table below shows most of the examples of waves that you need to know for the MCAT.

wave | longitudinal/transverse | medium  
---|---|---  
water wave | both | water  
wave on plucked string | T | string  
sound | L | air  
earthquake | both | earth  
light | T | electric, magnetic fields

### F. Interference

When two particles come together, like two balls or two cars, they generally collide in some manner. When two waves come together, they do not collide but jumble together in a process called _interference_. It is not as complicated as it sounds. For example, consider a wave on a lake (amplitude 7 cm, wavelength 4 m) arriving from the north, such that at point A at time 12:30 (exactly) its height would be +5 cm if it were the only wave around (Figure 11-13). Now another wave (amplitude 10 cm, wavelength 6 m) arrives from the east, such that at time 12:30 its height would be –2 cm if it were the only wave around. The resulting height of the water at 12:30 at point A is (+5 + –2) cm = +3 cm. (These heights are measured relative to the equilibrium height of the water.) Three seconds later, let's say, wave 1 would have height +7 cm and wave 2, –1 cm. Then the new height, with both waves, would be (+2 + –1) cm = +1 cm.

Figure 11-13

Figure 11-14 shows another example of this, in which two wave pulses come together, one from the right and one from the left.

Figure 11-14

Figure 11-15 shows a third example of interference on water. In this example a wave train from the left encounters a wave train from the right with the same wavelength. Water skaters are sitting on the water at points A, B, and C.

Figure 11-15

The skater at point A experiences the up–down–up–down–up from the wave on the left and the up–down–up–down–up from the wave on the right. Superposition tells us that the resulting motion is added, so A experiences increased amplitude UP–DOWN–UP–DOWN–UP. This is called _constructive interference_ , when two wave forms add in such a way as to create maximal displacement of the medium. The two waves are said to be _in phase_ , and point A is called an _antinode_. Their relative phase is said to be 0°. The resulting amplitude is the sum of the individual amplitudes.

For the water skater at C, the left wave is up–down–up–down–up, and the right wave is down–up–down–up–down. By superposition we see that the resulting motion is no displacement at all. This is called _destructive interference_ , when the wave forms tend to cancel and give minimal displacement. The two waves are said to be _out of phase_ , and point C is called a _node_. Their relative phase is said to be 180°. The resulting amplitude is the difference of the individual amplitudes.

For the water skater at B, the relative phase is between 0° and 180°, and the interference is neither in phase nor out of phase but somewhere in between. The resulting amplitude is somewhere in between as well.

Figure 11-16 shows a fourth example of interference, this time with sound waves. Stereo speakers are at points 1 and 2, both producing a pure tone (sine wave) of wavelength λ in phase. Alice and Bob are listening to the speakers.

Figure 11-16

Alice is an equal distance from both speakers. Figure 11-17 shows the waves traveling from speakers to Alice. Since the waves begin in phase and travel equal distances, they arrive in phase. If only speaker 1 were making sound, the wave arriving at her ear would look like that shown in Figure 11-18. If only speaker 2 were making a sound, the wave arriving at her ear would look like that shown in the same figure. Note that these figures show displacement of air particles versus time. Figure 11-19 shows what Alice hears with both speakers. She experiences constructive interference, so she hears a sound of greater intensity than that from one speaker.

Figure 11-17

Figure 11-18

Figure 11-19

Bob, however, is further away from speaker 1 than from speaker 2 by half a wavelength. What difference does half a wavelength make? The wave arriving from speaker 1 has further to go, so when a peak is coming from speaker 2, a trough is just arriving from speaker 1. (See Figure 11-20.) Figure 11-21 shows the sound waves from the two speakers. Figure 11-22 shows what Bob hears, nothing.

Figure 11-20

Figure 11-21

Figure 11-22

Note: In real life it is difficult to hear this phenomenon fully, since the amplitudes of the two speakers are rarely exactly the same. However, architects of orchestra halls often must guard against the possibility of "dead spots", where certain notes made by the concert master's violin, for example, cannot be heard well.

Calculations of this type get complicated fairly quickly, beyond the scope of the MCAT. But you should recognize constructive and destructive interference when you see it (or hear it). In any wave phenomenon, when there are bands of strong and weak amplitude, you should suspect that constructive and destructive interference is the cause. And you should recognize this:

### G. Standing Waves

So far we have been talking of waves that are unconstrained by boundaries, or _traveling waves. Standing waves_ are waves constrained inside a cavity. The main difference is that traveling waves may have any frequency at all, whereas standing waves have only certain allowed frequencies, and there is a lowest frequency.

Think about a wave on an infinite string. There is nothing to constrain your imagination to think of waves of any wavelength. Now think about a wave on a guitar string. The fixed ends now constrain your imagination, so that the longest wavelength you can imagine would look something like that shown in Figure 11-23. How could it be any longer, with the ends forced to be at equilibrium points?

Figure 11-23

A mode of motion in which every part of the medium moves back and forth at the same frequency is called a normal mode. The example of the guitar string will help make this clear.

**Example 1:** A guitar string has a wave velocity 285 m/s, and it is 0.65 m long. What is the lowest frequency that can be played on it? (The lowest frequency corresponds to the normal mode with no nodes except at the ends.)

**Solution:** Figure 11-23 shows the normal mode for the lowest frequency.

A full wavelength looks like

So, Figure 11-23 is half a wavelength. We write

This frequency is called the _fundamental_.

**Example 2:** What is the second lowest frequency that can be excited on the same guitar string?

Solution: Figure 11-24 shows the normal mode with one node between the ends. That is, the midpoint of this string experiences destructive interference and thus no motion at all. For this mode the wavelength is λ = 0.65 m. We write

_f_ = _v/λ_  
= 440 Hz

This frequency is called the _second harmonic_ (the first harmonic being the fundamental, but that is always called the _fundamental_ ).

Figure 11-24

**Example 3:** What is the third lowest frequency that can be excited on the guitar string?

**Solution:** Figure 11-25 shows the normal mode with two nodes between the ends. The wavelength is given by

This is the _third harmonic_.

Figure 11-25

When you pluck a guitar string, you hear all these frequencies with varying amplitudes, so the guitar string is not in a normal mode but in a mixed state.

These normal modes are all sine waves on a string. Here are some general rules for drawing normal modes:

1. It is important to get the ends correct (for example, the ends of a guitar string are nodes).

2. For the fundamental there are as few nodes as possible, usually none, excluding the end points.

3. Each following harmonic adds one node (only rarely more).

In this chapter we explored springs and waves. To solve problems involving stationary springs, it is important to draw accurate force diagrams and remember the spring equation _F_ spring = _kx_. To solve problems involving moving springs, it is often more important to follow the energy flow. The potential energy of a spring stretched (or compressed) by a distance _x_ is _E_ p = _kx_ 2/2. You should practice doing this sort of problem.

Waves involve a small movement of a medium which propagates to great distances, transporting energy. Often waves have a characteristic frequency f and a wavelength _λ_ , and these are connected by the wave velocity _v_ = _fλ_. When waves come together they exhibit interference. If they interfere constructively, they create a wave with large amplitude. If they interfere destructively, they create a wave with small amplitude. Whenever you encounter bands of light and dark (light waves) or loud and soft (sound waves), it is likely that interference is part of the explanation as to why the bands formed.

Standing waves are waves trapped in a cavity. They have the distinguishing characteristic that only certain frequencies are allowed: a lowest, and a next lowest, and so on.

### Passage 1

When a guitar string is plucked, there are many frequencies of sound which are emitted. The lowest frequency is the note we associate with the string, while the mix of other frequencies gives the sound its _timbre_ , or sound quality. The lowest frequency is the _fundamental_ , while the higher frequencies make up the _harmonic series_. The next lowest frequency is the second harmonic; the next to lowest, the third harmonic, and so on. The timbre depends on the material of the string (steel or plastic or catgut), on the way it is plucked (middle or at the end), and on the sounding board.

Sometimes some of the frequencies may be suppressed, for example, by lightly holding a finger at a point along the string to force a node there. This is not the same as fretting the string, which involves holding the string all the way down to the neck in order to effectively change the length of the string.

The wave velocity is given by

where _T_ is the tension in the string, and _μ_ is the linear mass density, which is the product of material density and cross-sectional area.

For the following questions, consider an E string (frequency 660 Hz) which is made of steel. It has a mass of 0.66 grams for each meter of wire and has a circular cross section of diameter 0.33 mm. The string length when strung on a guitar is 0.65 m.

**B.** increase it by 3%

**C.** increase it by 4.5%

**D.** increase it by 6%

### Passage 2

Sometimes we are concerned with what happens when a wave in one medium encounters a sharp boundary with a second medium. If the properties of the second medium are similar to those of the first medium, the wave passes from the first medium to the second, or is _transmitted_ (see figure).

If the properties of the second medium are markedly different from the first, there is said to be an _impedance mismatch_ , and much of the wave energy is reflected (see figure), while some is transmitted.

The situation is slightly more complicated if the boundary between the two media is gradual. In this case most of the energy of a wave may be transmitted to the second medium even if there is an impedance mismatch. This occurs if the length of the transition region is large compared with the wavelength of the wave (see figure). If not, then the wave "sees" the boundary as being sharp.

In addition to being reflected and transmitted, sometimes wave energy is _absorbed_. Certain media convert wave energy into heat energy. This can happen, for instance, for a wave traveling along a rope. The rope fibers rub against each other and the energy dissipates as heat (see figure).

For the following questions, refer to the following chart, which shows the typical wavelengths of various waves.

wave | typical wavelength  
---|---  
ocean wave | 10–100 m  
swimming pool wave | 0.1 m

**C.** The sound energy is likely to be absorbed.

**D.** The frequency of the sound is likely to be changed as it enters the door.

### Passage 3

The human ear can hear sounds with frequencies from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Frequencies of sound higher than this are called ultrasound. Although they cannot be heard, they are used in the technique of ultrasound imaging, for example, to take the image of a fetus in the womb. The sound waves are reflected off the interface between the fetus and the surrounding fluid. In order for this to provide information, the wavelength of the sound has to be smaller than the object being observed. Otherwise the wave passes right around the object.

At the other end of the sound spectrum there are very low frequency sounds. These can be highly injurious to humans if they have sufficient intensity. The sounds can cause internal organs to vibrate and eventually rupture, tearing the connective tissue holding the organ in place. For this reason, there are limits in the workplace as to how intense low frequency sounds can be. For the following, use 1500 m/s for the speed of sound in biological tissue.

## Chapter 12  
Sound

### A. Introduction

_Sound_ is a longitudinal wave in some material medium, usually in air. Alternatively, we can say that sound is a wave of pressure variation, as Figure 12-1 shows.

Figure 12-1

Notice several things about the above graphs. The variations of pressure are much smaller than the barometric pressure itself, that is, the equilibrium pressure _P_ eq. In fact, the pressure variations are much exaggerated in the figure. The quantity Δ _x_ gives the displacement of an air particle from its equilibrium position to its position with the sound wave, so that a positive Δ _x_ corresponds to displacement to the right. Where Δ _x_ = 0, the pressure is a maximum or minimum, and where _P_ = _P_ eq, we have Δ _x_ a maximum or minimum. We denote the variation of the pressure from the equilibrium pressure as Δ _P_ = _P_ – _P_ eq.

There are many ways in which energy can be converted into the energy of sound; for example, an underground nuclear explosion creates pressure waves in the solid Earth. The vibrating column of air in the plaintive oboe creates pressure waves in air.

In general, sound waves travel faster in a stiff material than in a material which is not as stiff. Thus waves travel a little faster in solids than in liquids, and a lot faster in solids and liquids than in a gas. (See table.) material speed of sound

material | speed of sound  
---|---  
air | 340 m/s  
water | 1600 m/s  
steel | 16000 m/s

### B. Intensity and Pitch

The _intensity_ of a wave is a measure of the amount of energy a wave transports. If there is a stereo speaker producing music on one side of the room, then sound waves transport energy across the room. On the other side of the room we hear the sound with a certain intensity, so that a certain amount of energy per time falls on an ear. A person with bigger ears would have a proportionally greater energy per time falling on them, so a sensible definition of intensity is energy per time _per area_ :

The units are [W/m2]. (See Figure 12-2.)

Figure 12-2

The human ear can hear sounds from the barely perceptible rush of air at intensity 10–12 W/m2 to the painful roar at intensity 1 W/m2. In order to make these numbers correspond more closely to our perception of sound, we often convert intensity into decibels:

where _I_ 0 is the intensity 10–12 W/m2.

The chart shows some sample calculations.

**Example 1:** A loud argument takes place in the next room, and you hear 70 dB. How much energy lands on one ear in one second? (An ear is about 0.05 m by 0.03 m.)

**Solution:** The intensity is given by

Thus,

Figure 12-3

As you go further from a source of sound, the intensity of the sound decreases. In order to figure out how much it decreases, think of an alarm clock in the center of two concentric spheres (Figure 12-3). The alarm clock produces a certain amount of energy each second. That same amount of energy flows out of sphere A each second, and the same amount flows out of sphere B each second. Thus we have

[power going through surface A] = [power going through surface B],

_P_ A = _P_ B

If there is a woman listening at radius _A_ , the intensity she experiences is

because the surface area of the sphere is 4π _r_ A2. Similarly, a man at radius _r_ B experiences intensity

Putting this all together yields

or, in general,

Memorize the formula, but also understand the reasoning that led to the formula.

**Example 2:** Jack and Jill are in a field, and Jill is playing a violin. If the intensity of the sound Jack hears is _β_ 0 (in decibels) when he is 63.2 m away, how much louder does she sound when he is 2 m away?

**Solution:** If Jack moves from 63.2 m to 2 m, then the radius decreases by a factor of 63.2/2 = 31.6. Then equation (3) indicates that _I_ increases by a factor of (31.6)2 = 1000. Three factors of 10 is equivalent to adding 10 to _β_ three times, so _β_ = _β_ 0 \+ 30. The violin sounds 30 decibels louder.

The pitch you hear depends on the frequency of the sound wave; the lower the frequency, the lower the note. For instance, the wave in Figure 12-4, with period _T_ = 0.8 ms, corresponds to D#6. The wave in Figure 12-5, with period double the first one, corresponds to D#7, the same note one octave higher.

Figure 12-4

Figure 12-5

### C. Resonating Cavities

In the last chapter we looked at the sound produced by a plucked guitar string or a struck piano string. Now we will look at resonating pipes, like organ pipes. While the resonating cavity of a soft drink bottle or of an oboe are more complicated than the pipes in this section, the principle behind all these pipes is the same. Standing waves are set up in the cavities, and these produce sound of a particular pitch and timbre.

A _closed pipe_ is a pipe closed at one end and open at the other. If we excite the air column, the air in the pipe vibrates longitudinally. The variable _x_ gives the location along the length of the pipe, and Δ _x_ gives the tiny displacement an air particle can have. (See Figure 12-6.) The double arrow shows the air particle moving back and forth. Since its equilibrium point is in the middle, the distance from one side to the other side of the displacement is 2Δ _x_.

Figure 12-6

At the closed end, the air cannot move back and forth, while it is completely free to do so at the open end. Thus the closed end is a displacement node, and the open end is an antinode. Compare this with the vibrations in Section 11.G, which had nodes at both ends. Any graph we draw for a closed pipe must have a node on one end and an antinode on the other. The fundamental has no nodes in the middle of the pipe away from the ends (Figure 12-7).

Figure 12-7

What is shown ends up being one fourth of a wave. A full wave looks like this:

The graph shows the first fourth: from zero point to maximum. Thus the full wave is four times the length of the pipe.

**Example 1:** A boy blows across the top of a bullet casing (a cylinder closed at one end, open at the other) which is 0.03 m long. What is the frequency of the note he hears (the fundamental)? (The speed of sound is 343 m/s.)

**Solution:** The fundamental mode is shown in Figure 12-7, and the wavelength is _λ_ = 4 (0.03 m) = 0.12 m. Thus _f_ = _v_ / _λ_ = 2860 Hz. (At a different temperature the sound speed will be different.)

Some hints for drawing these diagrams appear at the end of Section 11.G. For closed pipes, each successive harmonic has one additional node.

Now try drawing the second harmonic without looking at Figure 12-8.

For the second harmonic we have drawn three fourths of a wave, so _L_ = 3/4 _λ_ , and _λ_ = 4/3 _L_. The next harmonic is shown in Figure 12-9, but try to draw it also without looking. What is _λ_? (Did you get 4/5 _L_?)

Let's go back and look at the fundamental. Note this peculiar fact: If we are thinking in terms of displacement of air particles, then the node is at the closed end and the antinode is at the open end. If we are thinking in terms of pressure variation (see the beginning of the chapter), then the closed end is the antinode and the open end is the node. Figure 12-10 shows the fundamental in both cases. The frequency we calculate comes to the same, of course. You should check this point.

Figure 12-8

Figure 12-9

Figure 12-10

Figure 12-11

An _open pipe_ is open at both ends, like an organ pipe (Figure 12-11). If we consider displacement of air particles, then both ends are antinodes. We find that we cannot draw a mode with no nodes in the middle of the pipe, since such a mode would make no sound. Thus the fundamental has one node (Figure 12-12).

Figure 12-12

If we consider pressure variation, then both ends are nodes, and we can draw a mode with no nodes in the middle. Try drawing these graphs yourself without looking. They represent the fundamental and the second and third harmonics. Draw also the graphs for the fourth harmonic.

### D. Beats

If you play the lowest two notes of a piano you may hear the notes separately, but you may also hear a beating pattern, like aaaaaaaah–oooooooo–aaaaaaaah–oooooooo–aaaaaaaah about twice a second. Try this if a piano is available.

If you have a guitar, you can hear this effect by playing an A on the fifth fret of the sixth string and an A on the fifth string open. If the two strings are slightly out of tune, you will hear a single note that gets louder and quieter, louder and quieter. This is called _beats_.

What is happening? The first two graphs of Figure 12-13 show the two notes which have similar frequency. At _t_ = 0, they are in phase, and the amplitude of the combination is large. This is shown in third graph, where their sum is shown. A little while later, however, the two waves are out of phase, and the amplitude of the sum is a minimum. So this is the origin of the loud-soft-loud sound of the two notes. The _beat period_ is shown in the third graph, and _beat frequency_ is given by

Figure 12-13

**Example:** Jessica is tuning a guitar by comparing notes to a piano that she knows is in tune. She plays an A on the piano (220 Hz) and loudly plucks the A-string. She hears a loud-soft ringing whose maxima are separated by 3 seconds.

a. What is the guitar string's current fundamental frequency?

b. Jessica tightens the string (increases the tension) of the guitar slightly, and the beat gets faster. Should she continue to tighten the string?

**Solution:** a. The beat period is 3 s, so the beat frequency is 0.33 Hz. The string may be producing 220.33 Hz or 119.67 Hz, that is, too sharp or too flat.

b. By tightening the string, Jessica increases its frequency. If the resulting frequency were closer to 220 Hz, the beat period would get longer. She should reduce the tension in the string.

### E. Doppler Shift

If you have ever been standing around where a train or car goes by, you are familiar with the eeeeeeeeeee–aaaaaaaaaah sound it makes as it passes. Why does this happen?

Figure 12-14–Figure 12-16 show this phenomenon. Figure 12-14 shows a train whistle making sound waves when it is still. The man hears these pressure waves, so that his ear records a certain frequency of pressure-maxima arrival times. In Figure 12-15, the train whistle is approaching, so the man perceives the pressure maxima coming more frequently. He perceives a higher frequency note. In Figure 12-16 the train is receding, each successive pressure maximum has a longer way to travel, and the man perceives pressure maxima less frequently.

Figure 12-14

Figure 12-15

Figure 12-16

When the emitter of a wave and the detector are moving relative to each other, the detector detects a different frequency from the one emitted—a _Doppler shift_. The frequency is higher if they are coming together and lower if they are going apart.

There is one special case that deserves note. If a wave strikes a moving object and bounces back, then there are two Doppler shifts. For example, when a police officer uses a radar device to detect the speed of an oncoming vehicle, there is one shift when the radar is intercepted by the car and another shift when the reflected signal is intercepted by the police device.

**Example:** A police officer uses sonar to determine the speed of an approaching car. (Actually police use electromagnetic waves, but that is in the next chapter.) It emits a frequency of 60 kHz. The car is approaching at 38 m/s. The Doppler shift is

where _f_ det is the detected frequency, _v_ s is the speed of the wave in the medium, _v_ det is the speed of the detector, _v_ em is the speed of the emitter, and _f_ em is the emitted frequency. The speed of sound is 343 m/s.

a. What frequency would the car detect if it could detect the sonar?

b. What frequency would the officer detect from the reflection?

**Solution:** a. The frequency that the car would pick up if it could intercept the police sonar is

where _f_ 0 = 60 kHz and _v_ car = 38 m/s. We know to choose the positive sign because we know the result must be a higher frequency. Thus,

b. The frequency that the police intercepts is given by

We choose the negative sign because, again, we know the result must be a higher frequency. Thus,

In this chapter we looked at sound as an example of waves. We especially noted resonating cavities of air which exhibit standing waves just like the waves on the guitar string in the previous chapter. The key to doing problems involving these cavities is drawing the pictures correctly.

The most important thing to remember about the Doppler shift is that the detected frequency is greater than the emitted frequency if the emitter and the detector are approaching each other, and less if they are receding.

### Section E

_Use the following information for questions 24–27:_

When the source of waves and a detector are moving with respect to each other, the frequency of the detected wave is shifted from the frequency of the emitted wave (Doppler shift). The effect of this is to increase the detected frequency when the source and detector are approaching each other and to decrease the detected frequency when they are receding from each other.

In two or three dimensions this is complicated, but in one dimension the formula is relatively simple:

where _f_ det is the detected frequency, _v_ s is the speed of the wave in the medium, _v_ det is the speed of the detector, _v_ em is the speed of the emitter, and _f_ em is the emitted frequency. Choose the sign in the numerator to reflect the direction the detector is going (negative if approaching), and choose the sign in the denominator to reflect the direction the emitter is going (positive if approaching).

**A.** 36 kHz

**B.** 48 kHz

**C.** 49 kHz

**D.** 56 kHz

### Passage 1

Bats are mammals which have acquired the ability of flight and of echolocation. Echolocation involves using vibrating membranes to direct a high frequency sound, with frequencies ranging from 12 kHz to 150 kHz. If the sound encounters a flying insect or obstacle which is larger than the wavelength of the sound, then a portion of the sound wave is reflected, and the bat detects it.

Beyond this basic framework, different species of bats use different strategies in echolocation. Some species emit a series of pulses, determining the distance to an object by the delay in return of the signal. Some emit a constant frequency, using the frequency of the returned sound to determine information about the velocity of the insect. Others use a sweep of frequencies, presumably to determine size information or directional information. Some emit a sound with a high harmonic content. Many use some combination of these strategies.

Several adaptations provide for better processing of the returned signal, including isolation of the detection apparatus from the emitting apparatus and specializations in the middle ear.

For the questions, use the following: The speed of sound is 343 m/s, and the Doppler-shifted frequency for a detector and emitter moving relative to each other is

**B.** Any frequency greater than 34 kHz.

**C.** Any frequency less than 34 Hz.

**D.** Any frequency greater than 34 Hz.

**2.** If an insect is 3 m away, and a bat emits a pulse signal, how long is the delay in the return signal?

**A.** 0.009 s

**B.** 0.017 s

**C.** 0.09 s

**D.** 0.17 s

**3.** A bat is in pursuit of an insect. The bat is flying 10 m/s to the east, and the insect is flying 10 m/s to the east. If the bat emits a constant frequency sound of 30 kHz, what frequency will he detect?

**A.** 29 kHz

**B.** 30 kHz

**C.** 31 kHz

**D.** 32 KHz

**4.** What is a possible reason for using a sound with high harmonic content?

**A.** The harmonic frequency can determine the distance to an insect.

**B.** The harmonic frequency can stun the insect.

**B.** An ability to emit a sound with frequency about the same as that of a bat.

**C.** An ability to emit a sound with frequency much higher than that of a bat.

**D.** A secretion of an obnoxious tasting chemical.

### Passage 2

It is possible to construct a device for determining the speed of moving objects using sonar. The device consists of a sound emitter and a detector. The emitter creates a sound of a single frequency. The outgoing sound reflects from a moving target and is Doppler shifted. When the incoming signal arrives at the detector, the incoming signal and outgoing signal are combined, so that the detector actually detects the beat between them. The detector is a square-amplitude detector, which is thus able to pick up the beat (see figures below).

In one experiment with the device, the emitter created an outgoing signal of 80 kHz, which was reflected from a vehicle. The received signal was 70 kHz. The two graphs above were obtained. The top figure shows the output of the detector in terms of power versus time. The bottom figure shows power as a function of frequency (Fourier analyzed function of the top figure above).

**D.** The vehicle is receding from the detector, but not necessarily directly.

### Passage 3

A certain wind chime is a hollow pipe 0.8 m long and 0.025 m in diameter, and it is suspended by a string about 0.2 m from the top, about one-fourth way down (see figure). A hammer hits the chime about one-half way down. The note that the chime plays is a D at 262 Hz.

The ends are free to vibrate, so they are antinodes. The place where the hammer strikes also vibrates, but the place where the string connects is not free to vibrate.

For the following use 343 m/s for the speed of sound in air.

**1.** What is the wavelength of the wave in the pipe which produces the 262 Hz tone?

**B.** 0.27 m

**C.** 0.4 m

**D.** 0.8 m

### Passage 4

The ear converts a series of pressure variations, that is, a sound wave, into a Fourier-analyzed signal traveling on nerves to the hearing center of the brain. In a highly idealized model of the ear, each frequency of sound wave corresponds to one neuron leading from the ear to the brain. For example, if a sound wave were to enter the ear consisting of two frequencies _f_ 1 and _f_ 2, then two neurons would be excited, one corresponding to _f_ 1 and the other to _f_ 2.

A physical ear is more complicated than this model, however, and these differences from ideal can be observed by simple experiment. For instance, if a sound wave of two very similar frequencies enters the ear, the brain hears not two frequencies but one average frequency which slowly turns on and off. The turning on and off is called _beats_ , and the beat frequency is the difference between the two frequencies:

_f_ beat = _f_ 1 – _f_ 2

Another similar example involves a sound wave of two frequencies, which are not similar but have some harmonic relationship. In this case the brain sometimes hears a third tone, a _difference tone_ , corresponding to the difference of the frequencies of the input:

_f_ 3 = _f_ 1 – _f_ 2

This seemingly unfortunate phenomenon was a boon to the listeners of early phonographs. The phonographs were not really able to reproduce the lowest frequencies in the music, corresponding to the fundamental of the notes being played, although they would reproduce the harmonics. Often the ear would reconstruct the difference tone which would be the missing fundamental, making it seem as if the phonograph reproduced sound better than it in fact did.

**1.** When waves of two frequencies combine to make one wave, this phenomenon is called

**A.** diffraction.

**B.** interference.

### Passage 5

Alice places two stereo speakers a distance _d_ apart. She sends a signal which is a sine wave of frequency _f_ , so that the speakers are producing the same pure tone in phase. The sound wave in air has a wavelength _λ_.

She enlists her friend Bob to do an experiment. Alice sits directly in front of the speakers on the line which bisects the line segment connecting the speakers (see figure) but relatively far away from the speakers. Bob starts at the same place, but he slowly moves to the right. For him the sound gets quieter as he moves right, until he can barely hear it. Then it begins to get louder again. The figure shows Bob's position: where he first can barely hear the sound. This is the set up.

In Experiment 1, Alice and Bob keep their positions, and Alice changes the frequency of the signal sent to both speakers, so that both speakers are still producing a sound in phase at the same frequency (a different frequency from the set up).

In Experiment 2, Alice changes the frequency of the second speaker slightly, but the first speaker remains at the original frequency.

The distance _d_ is large compared to the wavelength, and it is small compared to the distance Alice and Bob sit from the speakers. The distance from Bob to the left speaker is _d_ 1, and his distance to the right speaker is _d_ 2.

## Chapter 13  
Light

### A. Introduction

Light is pretty mysterious: sometimes it acts just like a wave, interfering with itself and undergoing Doppler shifts and so on, and sometimes it acts like a particle, such as when it interacts with an electron. In this chapter we will explore the wavelike properties of light and leave the particle-like behavior to Chapter 16.

So light is a wave, like sound and water ripples. But sound involves the motion of air, and water ripples involve the motion of water, but what motion happens in a light wave? Well, it turns out to be a hard question. The answer is not "this molecule" or "that substance" but rather a combination of electric and magnetic fields. When all the material is removed from a piece of space, we call that piece of space a _vacuum_ , but electric and magnetic fields are still there, and light disturbs these fields. That is why light can travel in a vacuum.

Here is another strange property of light, or perhaps it is a property of the space and time in which light travels. Its speed is the same _c_ = 3.00 x 108 m/s to every observer. Think of how strange this is. If you are driving 60 mph down the freeway, a car may pass you going 75 mph, and a car on the other side of the yellow stripe may be going 60 mph in the other direction. From the point of view _of your car_ , the first car is going 15 mph and the second is going–120 mph. This makes sense.

In the super fast space freeway, your spacecraft may be going 1.00 x 108 m/s and another spacecraft passes you going in the same direction going 2.00 x 108 m/s. A light beam passes both of you in the same direction going 3.00 x 108 m/s. From the point of view _of your spacecraft_ , it is going (not 2.00 x 108 m/s but) 3.00 x 108 m/s, and from the point of view of the other spacecraft it is going 3.00 x 108 m/s. Go figure.

The speed of light is this mysterious _c_ = 3.00 x 108 m/s only in a vacuum. In other materials the speed is a little slower.

### B. General Properties of Light

Since light acts like a wave, it has a wavelength. Light of different wavelengths goes by different names. (See Figure 13-1.)

Light waves of a very long wavelength (greater than one centimeter) are used for broadcast, so the information about television images is encoded on the light waves and broadcast to your television set, if you have one. These are called _radio waves_ or _microwaves_.

Much of the heat from an electric heater is transported by _infrared radiation_ , with wavelength on the order of 10–5 m to 10–4 m.

If light of a wavelength between 400 nm and 700 nm enters the pupil of your eye, it is likely to interact with the electrons of certain cells in the retina, producing a chemical change in the photoreceptor cells, leading to an action potential in one (or several) neurons. For this reason, light in this range is called _visible light_.

Light with shorter wavelength is _ultraviolet light_ , responsible for sun tans and melanoma.

Figure 13-1

_X-rays_ have shorter wavelength still (less than 10–9 m) and can pass through much biological tissue, but not so easily the calcium in bones. They are used in imaging. Nuclear decay produces gamma rays (see Chapter 16), which have even shorter wavelengths, and this is the most penetrating electromagnetic radiation. _Gamma rays_ are able to pass through the Earth like visible light passes through glass.

Light waves can be polarized. In fact, the light from the sky is polarized in most places, as well as light which is reflected from the hot layer of air on a desert road. You can detect the polarization using polaroid glasses. Look through the glasses at the shimmering surface of a hot road and rotate the glasses. You can see the light become dimmer and brighter.

To see what is happening, look at Figure 13-2. Beth is waving her hands up and down sending waves to Sam. The waves easily pass through the picket fence as it stands, but if the slats were horizontal, the waves would not be transmitted to Sam. Polaroid glasses allow the vertically polarized portion of light to go through but absorb the horizontally polarized portion.

Figure 13-2

### C. Reflection and Refraction

We mentioned in Section A that light traveling in a medium other than the vacuum has a speed slower than _c_. In fact it is given by

where _n_ is the _index of refraction_. The chart at right gives some values of indices of refraction (do not memorize this chart, but note that _n_ is always greater than 1).

substance | n |   
---|---|---  
vacuum | 1 |   
air | ≈ | 1  
water | ≈ | 1.3  
glass | ≈ | 1.5

When light traveling in one medium encounters a boundary to another medium, some of the light is _reflected_ and some is _transmitted_ into the second medium. If the incident light comes in at an angle, then the transmitted light is _refracted_ , or bent, from its original direction. Figure 13-3 shows the wave fronts of light waves incident on glass from air.

Figure 13-3

When working with diagrams of light waves, it is customary (and convenient) to use light rays rather than wave fronts. Rays point perpendicular to the front, and in the direction the light is going. Figure 13-4 is equivalent to Figure 13-3, using rays instead. Also, the normal to the surface (remember that "normal" means perpendicular) is shown as a dashed line.

Figure 13-4

This is the most important figure of the chapter, so take a moment to study it. Notice the following:

1. The angles are measured from the normal.

2. The reflected angle _θ_ l is the same as the incident angle _θ_ i.

3. The refracted angle _θ_ r (in glass) is smaller than the incident angle (in air). That is, the slower medium has the ray closer to the normal.

**Example 1:** A light beam encounters a piece of glass as shown (Figure 13-5). Sketch the refracted path of the beam.

Figure 13-5

**Solution:** In Figure 13-6 the normal is shown as a dashed line. The dotted line shows the path the beam would take if there were no glass. The ray bends, however, toward the normal. Now when it hits the other side of the glass, the beam bends away from the normal. The answer, then, is the solid line.

Figure 13-6

Snell's law gives the refracted angle exactly:

You will want to memorize it since it is in the MCAT study guide, but it is more important that you know how to use it.

**Example 2:** A beam of light in air strikes the surface of pure hydrogen peroxide ( _n_ = 1.414) making an angle 30° with the normal to the surface.

a. What angle does the reflected beam make with the normal?

b. What angle does the transmitted beam make with the normal?

**Solution:** a. The diagram for this problem is similar to Figure 13-4, with glass replaced by hydrogen peroxide. The reflected angle is the same as the incident angle, 30°.

b. The refracted angle is given by

_n_ airsin _θ_ r = _n_ diasin _θ_ i  
1.414 sin _θ_ r = 1.0 sin 30°  
sin _θ_ r = 0.354  
 _θ_ r = sin-1 0.354  
= 20.7°

where that last equation must be solved on a calculator.

**Example 3:** A beam of light in a piece of diamond encounters an interface with air. The beam makes a 30° angle with the normal. What is the angle of refraction? (The index of refraction for diamond is 2.42.)

**Solution:** Figure 13-7 shows the diagram for this problem. Snell's law becomes

_n_ airsin _θ_ r = _n_ diasin _θ_ i  
1.0 sin _θ_ r = 2.42 sin 30°  
sin _θ_ r = 1.21

Figure 13-7

Now we need to find an angle whose sine is 1.21. But wait a minute! There is no such thing as a sine which is greater than one. This equation has no solution. What is going on?

Figure 13-8 shows a beam of light in diamond with an angle of incidence of 20°. The refracted ray bends away from the normal. Figure 13-9 shows a beam of light in diamond making a 24.4° angle with the normal. Once the beam gets into the air, it has bent so far from the normal that it is parallel with the surface. This angle, 24.4°, is called the _critical angle_ for a diamond-air interface. It is the incident angle for which the refracted angle is 90°.

Figure 13-8

Figure 13-9

Figure 13-10 shows our situation with 30°, but the refracted beam cannot bend any further away from the normal than it did for 24°. In fact, there is no refracted ray in this case. This phenomenon is called _total internal reflection_ , because all of the light stays in the diamond and none goes into the air.

Figure 13-10

**Example 4:** In a fiber optic cable, light travels down a light pipe with very little energy loss. You may have seen these cables in toys which were popular in the 1970s, where the tips of clear thin fibers light up with different colors. The cables have a high index of refraction, so that light gets totally int0ernally reflected off the surface and thus does not leak out the sides. When it arrives at the tip, the light is transmitted into the air (Figure 13-11).

Figure 13-11

Although we have discussed reflection and refraction only in the context of light waves, all waves in fact get reflected and refracted at boundaries. Figure 13-12 shows ocean waves coming toward the shore, as seen from above. As they approach, they encounter more and more shallow water, with smaller wave speed. Thus we would guess that they would bend toward the normal, so that the wave fronts would arrive roughly parallel to the shore. Compare Figure 13-12 to Figure 13-3. The difference here is that the air–glass boundary is sharp, whereas the boundary from deep to shallow water is gradual. Notice how the waves come in to the shore the next time you are at the beach.

Figure 13-12

Also note (Figure 13-3 and Figure 13-12) that when a wave travels from one medium to another, the frequency stays the same, whereas the wavelength changes if the wave speed changes. This is easier to see with ocean waves than with waves of light. Imagine ocean waves in the deep portion of the ocean going up-down-up-down once every five seconds. If this goes on for a long time, it must be that the ocean waves arriving at shallow water go up-down-up-down once every five seconds as well. Think about it.

### D. Optics Using Lenses

Figure 13-13 shows a _converging lens_. A light ray incident on the lens bends twice, once when entering the lens (usually glass) and once when leaving it, both times bending toward the axis. You should work this out by tracing the rays in an exaggerated diagram. The lens is designed so that parallel light rays on the left converge to a point on the right. The distance from the lens to the point of convergence is the _focal length f_. Light rays from the right will also focus to a point after a distance _f_.

Figure 13-13

A _diverging lens_ has the property that parallel light rays incident from the left spread apart after going through the lens, as if they were coming from a point source a distance– _f_ from the lens. Figure 13-14 shows such a lens. For diverging lenses, the focal length is negative.

Figure 13-14

For lens problems, there are two formulas and a ray-tracing method. It is probably worth your while to learn both. The formulas are better for calculating numbers, but ray tracing is better at answering qualitative questions. The method of ray tracing will sound confusing at first, but it will become clearer as you work through the examples.

**Example 1** : A boy uses a magnifying glass (converging lens with focal length 0.03 m) to observe a bug which is 0.02 m from the lens.

a. Draw a ray diagram.

b. What is the magnification of the image?

**Solution:** Figure 13-15 shows the ray diagram.

Figure 13-15

In this example, we had to extend the rays backwards in step 4 in order to find the image. For this reason the image is _virtual_ , meaning light rays are not actually coming from the position from which they seem to come.

If the light rays pass through the point from which they seem to come, then the image is said to be _real_. We can get the magnification by first calculating the exact position of the image:

Then

The negative sign for _d_ i means the image is on the same side as the object. The positive sign for _m_ means the image is upright (not inverted).

**Example 2** : The eye contains a lens whose focal length can be adjusted. A candle (2 cm long) sits 0.1 m from the lens of the eye, and the image is focused on the retina. Assume the length of the eye from front to back is 2.5 cm.

a. What is the focal length of the lens?

b. Is the image upright or inverted?

**Solution:** We calculate the focus as follows:

Figure 13-16 shows the appropriate diagram.

Figure 13-16

We draw the horizontal line on the left of the lens in step 2. The other line, you will notice, takes the _near_ focus into account. The image is where the lines meet, inverted and very small.

Because the image is located where light rays actually converge, the image is real. Figure 13-16 is a physics diagram. In an actual eye, there are many rays which converge to a point, and none of them need to be the two which we have drawn here. See Figure 13-17 for a more realistic diagram.

Figure 13-17

**Example 3** : The diverging lens on a pair of glasses has a focal length of 3.0 m. A candle is 9.0 cm tall and 6.0 m away.

a. Where is the image of the candle when viewed through the lens?

b. What is the size of the image?

c. Is the image inverted or upright?

d. Is the image real or virtual?

**Solution:** (You should try this solution yourself before you read about it. Then work it out with the book.) Figure 13-18 shows the ray diagram.

Figure 13-18

We had to extend a ray backwards in step 2. That means the image is virtual. Also the image is upright. The location of the image can be gotten from the equation:

where the negative result indicates the image is behind the lens, which we knew from the diagram. The magnification is given by

where the positive result indicates the image is upright. That gives the magnification. The size is then (0.333) (9.0 cm) = 3.0 cm.

It is a general rule that if only one lens or mirror is involved in a problem, then the image is either both real and inverted or both virtual and upright. It will never be real and upright, for example.

### E. Optics Using Mirrors

The methods and formulas for mirrors are almost identical to those for lenses, except that a mirror has only one focus. There are three kinds of mirrors: convex, plane, and concave (Figure 13-19). For a convex mirror, incoming parallel rays diverge after reflection, so the focal length is negative. For a plane mirror, the focal length is infinity. And for a concave mirror, incoming parallel rays converge after reflection, so the focal length is positive.

Figure 13-19

For mirrors, you use the same equations, but you have to be careful, because the meaning of the sign for _d_ i is different from that for lens. A positive sign for _d_ i means that the image is on the same side of the mirror as the object, that is, in front. You use the same kinds of ray diagrams, but since there is only one focus, you use that same focus in steps 2 and 3.

**Example 1:** The passenger mirror in Larry's car is a diverging mirror with focal length 0.8 meters. A car is 10.0 meters away from the mirror.

a. Where is the image of the car?

b. What is the magnification of the image?

c. Is the image real or virtual?

d. Is the image upright or inverted?

**Solution:** Figure 13-20 shows the ray diagram.

Figure 13-20

Note that the second ray uses the same focus as the first ray. The image of the car is behind the mirror and is virtual and tiny. The exact location is given by

where the negative sign indicates the image is behind the mirror. The magnification is given by

where the positive sign indicates the image is upright. You do not need to pay attention to the sign conventions if you get the diagram right.

So why is there a warning "Objects in mirror are closer than they appear"? There are two things going on. The first is that the image is much closer to Larry than the object itself, and the second is that the image is smaller than the image Larry would see if he turned around and looked. Larry's brain does not care about where the image is and does not notice from which point the light rays appear to be diverging. Larry's brain compares the size of the image to what it knows is the size of a car in order to obtain a distance to the car. The distance thus calculated is about a factor of two too far away.

**Example 2:** Alice looks at herself in a plane mirror, standing 4 meters away.

a. Where is her image?

b. What is the magnification?

c. Is the image real or virtual?

d. Is the image upright or inverted?

**Solution:** Figure 13-21 shows a ray diagram, with which we can be a bit creative, since the focuses are an infinite distance away.

Figure 13-21

The image is 4 meters on the other side of the mirror, the magnification is 1, and the image is virtual and upright. To see this in the equations, we calculate

Also

**Example 3:** The image of a candle lies 10.0 meters behind a converging mirror (focal length 5.0 m). Where is the object?

**Solution:** Figure 13-22 shows the ray diagram. Treat the image as the object and thus the origin of light rays. The hard part of this problem (if you have to do the calculation) is remembering the sign _d_ i = –10 m. Then

Figure 13-22

### F. Dispersion

In Section C we discussed the idea that the speed of light in each substance is related to its index of refraction _n_ , and the index of refraction governs the bending of light as it crosses a boundary. Now, although this is true, it is not the whole truth.

A more complete version of the truth is that the index of refraction depends slightly on the frequency of the light. (Sometimes not so slightly, but that is another story.) The chart shows the index of refraction for glass. You can see that _n_ is _approximately_ 1.5, but not exactly. So blue light bends a little more when going from air to glass than red light. This is the principle behind the prism (Figure 13-23). The phenomenon is called _dispersion_. There are not many simple calculations we can do at this point, but you should study the diagram of the prism until it makes sense to you.

Figure 13-23

### G. Combination of Lenses

When we view an object through several lenses which are near each other, then it is possible to treat the combination of lenses as one lens.

The quantity 1/ _f_ for a lens is called the _power_ of the lens, measure in [m–1 = diopters = D]. This word power has nothing to do with the other definition of power, that is, energy per time. The point here is that the power of a combination of lenses is the sum of the power of the lenses.

**Example:** Dieter has an eye which, when the eye is at rest, focuses light to a point 0.024 m behind the lens, which is 0.001 m in front of the retina. What is the power of the corrective lens he must wear?

**Solution:** The power of Dieter's eye is _P_ eye = 1/0.024m = 41.67 D. The combination of lenses should have a focal length 0.024 m + 0.001 m = 0.025 m, so the power of the combination of the two lenses needs to be _P_ combo = 1/0.025 m = 40 D. Since _P_ combo = _P_ eye \+ _P_ correct, we have _P_ correct = –1.67 D.

### H. Ideal Lenses and Nonideal Lenses

In our discussion of lenses, we assumed that the lens was able to focus all parallel rays to a single focus. Such an assumption is called an _ideal_ - _lens_ or _thin_ - _lens_ approximation. Real lenses are not so good. The deviation from ideality is called an _aberration_.

For one thing, lenses that are very thick cannot focus light to a single point, so the image ends up distorted. If you look through a glass sphere, like a bead or a paperweight, you will notice that the image looks bent out of shape. This is called a _spherical aberration_.

In Section F we noted that different frequencies of light have slightly different indices of refraction, which can cause different colors to have different focal lengths. This is called a _chromatic aberration_.

In this chapter we looked at light as an example of waves, looking specifically at reflection, refraction, and lens effects. The properties of waves we have studied in the past three chapters include

1. interference (by superposition),

2. frequencies in standing waves,

3. beats,

4. Doppler shift,

5. reflection and refraction, and

6. dispersion.

All waves exhibit these properties, so the way we have divided them up among chapters titled "Waves", "Sound", and "Light" is somewhat artificial. Refraction is most often observed in light waves, so it is generally studied in the context of light. Likewise, beats are usually observed in sound waves and only extremely rarely in light. You should be aware that sound waves reflect and refract just like light, bending toward the normal of the interface when they pass from a fast medium to a slow one. If you visualize this principle in diagrams such as Figures 13-4 and 13-12 and practice the ray-tracing diagram, then you should do well on problems that this chapter covers.

### Passage 1

Electromagnetic radiation from an incandescent source, such as a light bulb, is unpolarized, which means that the electric field of the wave points in random directions perpendicular to wave travel. One way to produce polarized radiation involves applying an alternating voltage to a straight piece of wire to form an antenna (See figure below). Radiation is emitted from the antenna perpendicular to the wire with a polarization which is parallel to the wire.

In this diagram the small arrows show the direction of the electric field, and the large arrows show the direction of the wave.

Another way to obtain polarized radiation involves allowing unpolarized radiation to be incident on a film or material which transmits radiation of one polarization but absorbs radiation of the perpendicular polarization. Such a film is called a _polarizer_. If unpolarized light of intensity _I_ 0 is incident on a vertical polarizer, the radiation that passes through is vertically polarized with intensity 1/2 _I_ 0. The figure below shows this schematically.

If polarized radiation is incident on a polarizer, the amount of energy that is transmitted depends on the relative angle of the radiation polarization and the polarizer axis. If they are aligned, then all the radiation is transmitted. If the angles differ by _θ_ , then the intensity of the transmitted radiation is cos2 _θ_ of the original intensity.

All of the foregoing refers to ideal polarizers. All manufactured polarizers have less than ideal efficiency which comes from reflection off the two surfaces and absorption of the parallel component.

In questions 1–4, an unpolarized radiation source is incident on a series of polarizers. Without the polarizers the intensity of the source is _I_ 0. Assume the polarizers are ideal.

**1.** In the figure below, unpolarized light is incident on polarizers A and B in series. Polarizers A and B are both oriented vertically. What is the intensity of the resultant beam?

**A.** _I_ 0

**B.** _I_ 0/2

**D.** 0

**2.** In the figure below, unpolarized light is incident on polarizers A and B in series. Polarizer A is oriented vertically, while polarizer B is oriented horizontally. What is the intensity of the resultant beam?

**A.** _I_ 0

**B.** _I_ 0/2

**C.** less than _I_ 0/2 but greater than zero intensity

**D.** 0

**3.** An optically active substance is a substance which rotates the plane of polarization of a beam. The figure shows a modification of the figure in Problem 2, with an optically active substance between the polarizers. What is the intensity of the resultant beam?

**A.** _I_ 0

**B.** _I_ 0/2

**C.** It could have any intensity less than (or equal to) _I_ 0/2

**A.** He observes horizontal polarization.

**B.** He observes vertical polarization.

**C.** He observes an unpolarized beam.

**D.** He observes no radiation.

### Passage 2

The mammalian eye is designed to collect light and focus it onto the retina. The retina consists of an array of cells, each having the ability to detect light falling on its surface. Most of the refraction (and thus focusing) of incoming light rays takes place at the interface between air and the cornea. The lens does the fine tuning, changing the focal length so the image lands exactly on the retina. The tuning is necessary since the eye must be able to bring into focus light from objects as close as 0.1 m as well as light from an infinitely distant source.

_Spatial resolution_ is the ability of the eye to distinguish waves coming from different directions. For example, if a distant car is facing you at night with its headlights on, you can see two distinct headlights, since the light from the two headlights approaches your eye from two directions (see figure). If the car is far enough away, however, your eye lacks the resolution to distinguish the headlights, and you see only one light source.

Resolution is measured in degrees or radians. For instance, if your eye can just resolve two headlights which are 1.5 m apart on a car which is 1 km away, then the angular separation of the lights is approximately 1.5 m/1000 m = 1.5 x 10–3 radians. The resolution of your eye is 1.5 x 10–3 rad or 0.09 degrees (since 1 rad ≈ 57°) or 5 seconds of an arc. To a good approximation, the angular separation of two light sources (or features on any sort) is the ratio of spatial separation Δ _x_ to distance from the point of reference _L_. (See figure.) Thus the better the resolution, the smaller the resolution angle.

Ultimately the spatial resolution of any detector, including the eye, is limited by _diffraction_ , which is the spreading of waves. When waves pass through an aperture, they spread on the other side subtending an angle given by

where _θ_ diff is measured in radians, _λ_ is the wavelength of the wave involved, and _d_ is the diameter of the hole through which the waves must pass. Of course, diffraction is the physical limit of the resolution. The actual resolution of a detector may be much poorer than equation (1) would indicate if it is poorly designed. The human eye, when functioning properly, is essentially diffraction limited.

For the following problems use _c_ = 3.0 x 108 m/s. Green light has a wavelength of 520 nm in a vacuum. (1 nm = 10–9 m)

**B.** 2.3 x 10–4 m

**C.** 10–3 m

**D.** 0.023 m

**3.** In question 2, what angle is subtended by the moth in the view of the eye?

**A.** 2.3°

**B.** 4.6°

**C.** 15°

**D.** 30°

**4.** A certain eye does not focus correctly, being either near- or far-sighted. The front to back length of the eye is 0.025 m, but the focusing power of the resting eye is 35 diopters. What should be the approximate power of the appropriate corrective lens?

**A.** –5 diopters

**B.** –3 diopters

**C.** 3 diopters

**D.** 5 diopters

**5.** The cornea is made of a material which has a larger index of refraction for blue light than for red light. If the eye is focusing a beam of red light onto the retina, where would the focus for a beam of blue light fall?

**A.** In front of the retina.

**B.** On the retina.

**C.** Behind the retina.

**D.** Both in front of and behind the retina.

**6.** An engineer is working on a camera to photograph the distant landscape in foreign countries. He has designed a camera with a lens which focuses incoming light on a detector. The camera is essentially diffraction limited, but the resolution is not good enough. Which of the following could improve the resolution?

**A.** Increase the distance from the lens to the detector.

**B.** Improve the lens shape.

**C.** Change the material of the lens to be more transparent.

**D.** Increase the size of the whole camera.

**7.** A Seurat painting consists of many dots of paint about 0.002 m in diameter. If you view it from a great enough distance, the dots of color appear to blend together, and you see a coherent picture. The resolution of your diffraction-limited eye is 2 x 10–4 radians.

## Chapter 14  
Electrodynamics

### A. Introduction

Many students find electrodynamics difficult because it is the physics of things you cannot see, things no one talks about outside of physics circles. In mechanics we used words like "car" and "force" and "wave". In electrodynamics we use phrases like "electric field". What _is_ an electric field?

It's a reasonable question, but if you ask your physics teacher, it's unlikely you'll get a satisfactory answer. Well, then, is the electric field real? Well, yes, it is as real as anything, but everyday life does not bring us in direct experience with the electric field, and so it is less familiar.

The key to building an intuition about electrodynamics is visualizing these unfamiliar concepts: concepts such as charge, electric and magnetic fields, and electric potential. We can not see them directly, but we can become familiar with their properties. In this chapter there are only a few equations and concepts, but the implications are profound. There is no doubt that this is a difficult chapter, but if you spend some effort actively creating mental pictures, electrodynamics will become far less arcane.

### B. Electric Charge

A long time ago, someone noticed that when amber is rubbed with a cloth it attracts small seeds or pieces of straw. No one knew why. (Amber is a soft ochre "stone" of hardened tree sap.) Many years and many experiments later, the following story has emerged as the best explanation:

Most material on Earth is composed of three particles, called _protons, neutrons_ , and _electrons_. The protons and neutrons hold together in tight lumps, called _nuclei_. The much less massive electrons exist in a cloud around the nuclei, forming _atoms_. Sometimes the electrons hold the atoms together, forming _molecules_ and so on. The electrons are sometimes quite mobile, and this mobility results in most of the changes we observe.

But that's chemistry. That is not our story.

This is our story: Electrons have a _negative charge_ , and protons have a _positive charge_. Two charges of like sign exert a repulsive force on each other, while two charges of unlike sign exert an attractive force on each other (Figure 14-1). Most objects are neutral, that is, they have nearly the same number of protons as electrons. When our unknown predecessor rubbed the neutral amber it acquired a few extra electrons, giving it a net negative charge.

Figure 14-1

Under normal circumstances, as in physical and chemical reactions, electrons, protons, and neutrons are permanent objects. They may move around, but they do not spontaneously disappear or appear. Thus we have the following:

Clearly this is true in chemical reactions, which are just rearrangements of electrons and nuclei, but it turns out to be true even in unusual circumstances, such as the radioactive decay of nuclei or reactions of exotic particles. (See Chapter 16.)

### C. Charges and Materials

There are some materials, most of them metals, in which electrons are able to move freely from atom to atom. Such materials are called _conductors_. A material which does not conduct electrons is called either a _nonconductor_ , or an _insulator_ , or a _dielectric_ , depending on the mood of the speaker.

If we place a bunch of electrons (a negative charge) on an isolated conducting sphere (like a metal ball), the electrons repel and move away from one another. So all the charge ends up evenly distributed on the surface. (See Figure 14-2.)

Figure 14-2

If we examine the interior of a piece of the sphere, the total charge on that piece will be zero. (This has to be. If there were any excess electrons, they would repel each other and move out of the piece, until they cannot go any further.) All the excess charge is on the surface.

The same holds for positive charge. If a positive charge is placed on a conducting sphere, then the excess positive charge will spread out on the surface, with no positive excess charge in the interior. In other words, any interior piece has a total charge of zero (Figure 14-3). (Although the positive charge is caused by a _deficit_ of electrons, you will never go wrong by thinking in terms of positive charges repelling each other.)

Figure 14-3

This is a general rule: The total charge of a piece of the interior of a conductor is zero. Any excess charge lies on the surface of the conductor.

If a charged object is brought near a neutral conductor, electrons will move away or toward the charged object, depending on the object's charge. This is called _induced charge_ , since the charged object induces a charge on the neutral conductor (Figure 14-4).

Figure 14-4

We can induce a charge on a nonconductor, too. Even though charges do not move freely in it, each molecule in a nonconductor can have its electron density move to one side (Figure 14-5a).

Generally the induced charge on nonconductors is smaller than that on conductors. Instead of drawing all the polarized molecules, we generally summarize these with a picture like Figure 14-5b.

Figure 14-5a

Figure 14-5b

A _ground_ is any hug reservoir and depository of electrons. If you touch a charged object to a wire connected to ground, the charge will be neutralized where you touch it (Figure 14-6).

Figure 14-6

The following example illustrates these concepts. In the illustrations, a slight excess in the number of electrons over the number of protons is indicated by a – sign, and a deficit of electrons is indicated by a + sign.

**Example:** In a physics lab text, the following procedure is given for charging by induction a metal sphere connected to an insulating rod:

1. Rub a piece of amber with cotton cloth.

2. Bring the amber near but not touching the metal sphere.

3. Touch the other side of the sphere with your finger (which acts as a ground).

4. Remove your finger.

5. Remove the amber.

Sketch what happens to charges. (Hint: Amber tends to pick up electrons.)

**Solution:** 1. We rub amber with a cloth.

Figure 14-7a

2. We bring the amber near the sphere.

Figure 14-7b

3. We touch the other side with a finger.

Figure 14-7c

4. We remove the finger

Figure 14-7d

5. We remove the amber.

Figure 14-7e

### D. Coulomb's Law

Knowing that like charges repel (and unlike attract) is only a part of the story. We can calculate numbers as well. For this we must introduce the unit for charge

[Coulombs = C]. A Coulomb is a large amount of charge, and most laboratory situations involve the accumulation of at most 10–6 C.

Note that the distance appears in the denominator as a square, so it is called an inverse-square law, just like the law of gravitation.

**Example:** A piece of amber rubbed with a cloth acquires a negative charge on a cold day. If the amber is brought near neutral seeds, the seeds are attracted to it.

a. Show the charge distribution for the amber and the seeds.

b. Explain why the seeds are attracted to the amber.

**Solution:** Figure 14-8 shows the charge distribution, taking into account the induced charge in the seed. At first it looks as if the attractive and repulsive forces balance, giving no net force. But the distance from the amber to the left side of the seed is less than the distance to the right side. The inverse-square relationship in Coulomb's law makes the arrow on the left slightly longer than the arrow on the right, and the net force is to the left.

Figure 14-8

We have explained our predecessor's observation (Section B), that is, we have explained why a rubbed piece of amber attracts seeds and small objects.

### E. Electric Field

Coulomb's law is simple, but it is not the only way we can explain the forces which charges experience. Often in physics, there are two viewpoints which explain the same phenomena. Usually, only one eventually prevails. Sometimes it prevails because it is easier to use, and sometimes it prevails because it provides a deeper insight into the working of the universe. The electric field is an example of a deeper insight.

Again, we consider two charges, now call them _Q_ and _q,_ and assume they are positive. Fix _Q_ at some point. If we place charge _q_ nearby, it experiences a force away from _Q_. Now, using Coulomb's law, we _can_ explain this phenomenon as a repulsive force that _Q_ exerts on _q_.

Or we _can_ explain this as follows: The charge _Q_ creates a "field of arrows" around itself, directed outward and getting shorter with distance from the charge _Q_. When we place _q_ at a point, charge _q_ , being nearsighted, does not see _Q_ over there. But it does see the arrow, which tells it what force to feel (Figure 14-9).

Figure 14-9

Stop for a minute and think about this. Both viewpoints explain the observations, but they are very different perspectives. The second viewpoint introduces a new animal: a field of arrows (or _vector field_ ). Charge _Q_ creates an electric field, and the electric field tells charge _q_ what force to feel.

So why do we introduce a new viewpoint? Isn't Coulomb's law adequate for our needs? Actually, there are good reasons to talk about an independent existence of an electric field. One is that Coulomb's law is not really designed to deal with moving charges. What happens if we abruptly move charge _Q_. If _Q_ is moved to a different place, then _q_ must experience a different force. But does it feel it immediately, or is there a delay, and if so, how much of a delay?

If _d_ (in Coulomb's Law) is the actual distance between the charges, then Coulomb's Law indicates _q_ feels the change immediately.

It turns out, however, that there is a delay. The information about the change in position spreads out quickly, but not immediately (Figure 14-10 a,b,c). The easiest way to explain this is to say that a disturbance in the _electric field_ propagates outward at a finite speed—the speed of light. In fact, that's what light is: a disturbance in the electric field which propagates away from the source, which is an accelerating charge. This is worth remembering. ( _Fiat lux_.)

Figure 14-10a

Figure 14-10b

Figure 14-10c

The important concept is this: The universe is filled with arrows, that is, an electric field. Charges (some stationary and some moving) create the electric field. The electric field tells charges what force to feel.

There are three rules for the electric field which you need to know for the MCAT.

Figure 14-9 shows the electric field due to a single positive charge. A sketch of the electric field due to a single negative charge would look the same except the arrows would point toward the charge.

**Example 1:** A _dipole_ is a positive charge and an equal-magnitude negative charge separated by a distance. Sketch the electric field around a dipole.

**Solution:** Figure 14-11a shows such a sketch. Each electric field vector shown is actually the sum of two vectors. Figure 14-11b shows this explicitly for point P.

A positive charge _q_ placed at point P would experience a force to the right, while a negative charge would experience a force to the left.

Figure 14-11a

Figure 14-11b

**Example 2:** Square ABCD has sides of length 10–6 meters. Charges of _Q_ = 1.1 x 10–17 C are placed at corners B and D. (The charge of a proton is 1.6 x 10–19 C.)

a. What is the electric field at point A?

b. What force would an electron placed at point A experience?

c. If a proton were placed at point A, what would be the ratio of the magnitude of the force it would experience to that which the electron in b experiences?

**Solution:** a. First, we DRAW A DIAGRAM showing the electric fields caused by the two charges (Figure 14-12).

Figure 14-12

The magnitude of the electric field at A due to the charge at B is

Figure 14-13

This is the magnitude of the electric field due to the charge at D as well. The two electric fields add like vectors. Figure 14-13 shows this sum, in which we may use the Pythagorean theorem, so we write

This is the answer to part a.

b. We simply calculate

The force the electron at point A experiences is directed toward C, since the charge of the electron is negative.

c. The force on the proton at point A is obtained in the same way, except the direction of the force is away from C, since the sign of the proton is positive. The ratio of the magnitudes of the forces on the proton and the electron is 1.

The following example shows how important it is to have a mental picture of the charges, electric field, and forces, much more important than memorizing several equations.

Note: A water molecule is a complicated object, with three nuclei and ten electrons interacting quantum mechanically. But for many purposes (as in the following example), we can model the water molecule as a simple dipole: a molecule with a positive end and a negative end. (See Figure 14-14.)

Figure 14-14

Note also: In problems of this sort, you should ignore gravity unless the problem tells you to include it.

**Example 3:** An electric field exists in the _xy_ -plane directed in the positive y-direction with constant magnitude _E_ 0. (Use _q_ e for the elementary charge, or the charge of the proton.)

a. If a chloride ion (Cl–) is placed in the _xy_ -plane, what is the force on the ion?

b. If a water molecule is placed in the _xy_ -plane with its oxygen end pointing in the + _x_ -direction and hydrogen end pointing in the – _x_ -direction, which direction is the torque?

c. What is the direction of the net force on the water molecule?

**Solution:** a. Figure 14-15a shows the electric field.

Figure 14-15a

Figures 14-15b, c

Chloride has one more electron than it has protons, so its charge is – _q_ e. The magnitude of the force on the ion is

_F_ = _q_ e _E_ 0

The force is directed in the – _y_ -direction (Figure 14-15b).

b. For the torque on a water molecule, think of a water molecule as having a positive end and a negative end. Figure 14-15c shows the forces on the two ends, so the torque is clockwise.

c. Adding the two forces in Figure 14-15c yields zero net force.

**Example 4:** A positive charge due to a sodium ion (Na+) is at the origin. A hydrogen fluoride molecule (HF) is on the positive _x_ -axis with its hydrogen end further from the ion than its fluoride end. What direction is the net force due to the sodium ion on the hydrogen fluoride molecule?

**Solution:** First we DRAW A DIAGRAM showing the electric field (Figure 14-16).

Figure 14-16

Figure 14-17 shows the force diagram for the molecule. Notice that the force on the fluoride part of the molecule is larger than the force on the hydrogen part, because the hydrogen part is located where the electric field is smaller. The net force is in the – _x_ -direction.

Figure 14-17

Notice the difference between Example 4 and Example 3. In Example 3 the electric field is uniform, so the net force on the dipole is zero. In Example 4 the electric field is not uniform. (This is like the seeds beings attracted to the amber in Section D.)

One last note here: To draw electric field lines, simply connect the arrows of the electric field, each arrow directing your pen to the next arrow. Figure 14-18 shows an example for a dipole, and Figure 14-19 exemplifies two positive charges. This is just another way of graphically representing the same information.

### F. Electric Potential

We begin this section with an analogy.

**Analogy:** Sisyphus, of Greek legend, was condemned to move a large stone of mass _M_ to the top of a mountain (with no friction). His sister moved a similar stone up a different path to the top of the mountain. His son moved a smaller rock (mass m) to the top of the same mountain. (Figure 14-20 shows them in action.) Each carefully calculated the work required. (They calculated _W_ = _F_ Δ _x_ cos _φ_ for each piece of the journey and then added the pieces.)

a. Who did the most work?

b. Who had the greatest work per mass ratio?

Figure 14-20

**Solution:** This is a problem we have done before. For Sisyphus' task, there is a flow of energy from his muscles into another form, the gravitational potential energy of the stone. The latter is given by _MgH_ , where _H_ is the height of the mountain. But by the conservation of energy, that must be the same as the work that Sisyphus performs. By the same argument, Sisyphus' sister performs the same work _MgH_ , and his son performs work _mgH_.

If they calculate the work to mass ratio, all obtain _gH_. At the top of the mountain they could drive a stake in the ground with the title "Work/mass is 1200 J/kg," or whatever it happened to be. Each point on the mountain would have its own work/mass ratio. The work/mass ratio is independent of path because gravity is a conservative force, and it has a potential energy associated with it.

The electric force is also a conservative force.

How would we create and analogy with electric forces? Let's say a positive charge _Q_ is fixed in space. (See Figure 14-21.)

a. A honeybee carries a positive charge _q_ 1 along Path 1 from A to B.

b. Another bee carries the same amount of charge along Path 2 from A to B.

c. A third bee carries a negative charge _q_ 2 along Path 2.

Figure 14-21

Honeybees a and b perform the same amount of work. Although honeybee c performs a different amount of work, it is different only because of the different charge. The work per charge is the same in all cases. This work per charge is called _electric potential_. We could drive a stake into space at point B with the title "7 J/C to get to this point from A" or something to that effect. This is analogous to gravitational potential energy per mass or roughly analogous to height.

Thus, to every point in space we assign a number, the electric potential. In physics, point A is often set at infinity as a standard. In that case, we refer to the absolute electric potential.

Now the analogy to gravitational potential energy works only so far. For one thing, mass is always positive, while charge may be positive or negative. So Sisyphus performs a large amount of work with his large rock, and his son performs a smaller amount of work. Honeybee a performs a large amount of work, but honeybee c performs a negative amount of work, so she is able to derive work from the system.

Another difference is that the Earth's surface is two dimensional, and the third dimension, height, is equivalent to the work/mass ratio to get to that point. Each point on the Earth's surface may be labeled by a height or the work/mass ratio. On the other hand, the honeybees can fly in three dimensions, and the electric potential is in a fourth dimension that we can only imagine. Figure 14-22 is an attempt to illustrate this. The bee carries a charge of 10–8 C, and the flower has an electric potential of 600 volts. Figure 14-22a shows how it looks to us. But since it takes a lot of energy to get to the flower, the situation appears like Figure 14-22b to the bee.

Figure 14-22a

Figure 14-22b

If we want to know how much energy is required to move a rock from A to B, we don't need the exact heights of A and B above sea level. We need only the difference in height, the mass of the rock, and the acceleration due to gravity. Similarly, in most electrostatic problems, we do not care about the absolute potential; we need only the _potential difference_.

**Example 1:** A _DC battery_ is rated at 6 volts. How much energy would be required to remove an electron from the positive terminal and move it to the negative terminal? (The charge of an electron is –1.6 x 10–19 C.)

**Solution:** Note that going from a positive terminal to a negative terminal is "downhill", so Δ _V_ is negative. We apply the formula

_W_ = _q_ Δ _V_

= (–1.6 x 10–19 C)(–6 J/C)

= 1.0 x 10–18 J

We need to check the sign. Does such an action require work? Or can we derive work from it? Removing an electron from a _positive_ terminal requires work, and placing it on a _negative_ terminal requires work as well, so the positive sign in our answer is correct.

It is a good thing to know the amount of work to move a charge from one place to another, and we know how to do that now, if we know the electric potentials at the various points. But how do we calculate the potentials? In many situations, this is easier than it sounds.

Note that there is no _d_ 2 in the denominator, only _d_.

For a positive charge _q_ , such a positive potential (if _Q_ is positive) looks like a high steep mountain. (Figure 14-23). For a negative charge, it looks like a deep pit (since the energy change is negative for getting close to _Q_ ).

Figure 14-23

When we move charge _q_ from A to B, we increase its electric potential energy by the same amount as the work we have performed. The _electric potential energy_ of a group of charges is the work required to assemble the charges by moving them from an infinite distance away. So now we have an electric potential energy in addition to the gravitational potential energy.

**Example 2:** Two charges _Q_ 1 = _Q_ 2 = 1.1 x 10–8 C are 2 x 10–2 meters apart. Point A is exactly between them, and point B is 10–1 meters from both of them. How much work is required to move a charge _q_ = 10–9 C from A to B?

**Solution:** First we DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 14-24).

Figure 14-24

Let's apply the formula:

Now let's check the sign. Since the test charge is positive, we imagine the two charges _Q_ are mountains next to each other, and A is a mountain pass. Point B is further down, so the energy change is negative. No energy is required, but instead energy can be derived. Therefore the negative answer is justified.

**Example 3:** Two charges _Q_ 1 and _Q_ 2 (both 1.1 x 10–7 C and both 10–6 grams) are initially 0.01 m apart. They are released, and they go flying apart.

a. How much potential energy is in the system initially?

b. How much kinetic energy is in the system finally?

**Solution:** a. The potential energy is the work needed to assemble the system. Let's regard _Q_ 1 as fixed and move _Q_ 2 toward it from infinity (Figure 14-25).

Figure 14-25

With this viewpoint, the initial electric potential (at infinity) is zero and the final electric potential is _kQ_ 1/ _d_ , where _d_ = 0.01 m. The work done to bring _Q_ 2 to this point is

The other way to do this problem is to regard _Q_ 2 as fixed and move _Q_ 1 toward it, but of course we would get the same answer. Or we could move them both from infinity. This would be harder to calculate, but since the energy is independent of path, the answer must be the same.

b. After the particles are released, the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. Since there are no external forces and no heat generation, energy is conserved, and the final kinetic energy is 1.1 x 10–2 J.

One last note: In topographic maps of the Earth's surface, points at the same height are connected by lines and labeled according to height. We can do the analogous thing with charges by connecting points of equal potential, forming _equipotential lines_. Figure 14-26 shows such a diagram for two equal positive charges.

Figure 14-26

### G. Magnetic Fields

Electric fields are not enough to explain everything in electrodynamics. It turns out that we need to consider a second field as well, called the _magnetic field_. Both stationary and moving charges generate an electric field, but only moving charges generate a magnetic field.

Magnetic fields appear outside the wires in which there is current flowing. A _current_ is a flow of charge, that is, the quantity of charge moving past a point per unit of time. The units of current are [C/s = amperes = amps = A]. For most problems it does not matter whether we think of (negative) electrons moving left or of some positive charge moving right. In physics we generally think in terms of a positive charge moving, even though we know that it is the electrons which are moving. For this reason, if electrons are moving to the left along a wire, then we say the current is toward the right, since electrons have negative charge.

If a current is flowing in a wire, this generates a magnetic field outside the wire. This magnetic field points not toward, not away from, not along the wire, but tends to point _around_ the wire. It is strongest near the wire, of course. We can remember its direction by applying the first hand rule: Use your right hand and point the thumb in the direction of the (positive) current. Bend your fingers around so the tips are as close to your wrist as possible. The fingers tend to point in the direction of the magnetic field. Figure 14-27 shows a current flowing to the right. The small arrows show the direction of the magnetic field. Figure 14-28 shows a current coming out of the page. Again, the arrows show the magnetic field. A circle with a dot in it often denotes a vector coming out of the page, like an incoming arrow. A circle with a cross in it denotes a vector going into the page, like the feathers of a receding arrow.

Figure 14-27

Figure 14-28

Certain materials, such as iron, generate magnetic fields as well, and at first glance there do not seem to be any currents here. The reason for magnetic fields in these cases is subtle and involves the current of electrons about the nucleus. This is almost certainly beyond the scope of the MCAT.

A charge sitting still in a magnetic field experiences no force. Furthermore, a moving charge experiences a magnetic force only if its motion has a component perpendicular to the magnetic field. In that case the particle experiences a force which is perpendicular to the magnetic field and to the charge's path. Figure 14-29 shows a situation in which the magnetic field is coming out of the page and a proton is moving to the right.

Figure 14-29

The second hand rule helps you to recall the direction of the force: For a positive particle, use your right hand. Your fingers point in the direction of the magnetic field, which you can remember because the four fingers look like the field lines of a magnet. Your thumb points in the direction that the particle is going, like a hitchhiker. Your palm (which you use for pushing) points in the direction in which the particle experiences a force. For a negative particle, use your left hand.

In brief, every point in the universe has two vectors sitting on it, one being the electric field and the other being the magnetic field. Just to help you visualize it, imagine going to a field in the Northern Hemisphere on a clear day and picking a point in the air. To a close approximation, the electric field points down with a magnitude 100 N/C and the magnetic field points south (0.5 gauss, if you must know, but we have not discussed units for the magnetic field).

Now the force on a particle due to a magnetic field is always perpendicular to the displacement of the particle. For this reason magnetic forces do no work (always we have cos _φ_ = 0). If you ever encounter a question such as "How much work does the magnetic force... ?" you need read no further. The answer is zero.

### H. Electromagnetic Radiation

In Section D we discussed the fact that an accelerating charge will shake up the electric field around it. The shaking portion of the electric field breaks off and moves away through space. The phenomenon is called _electromagnetic radiation_ or _light_. The electric field is perpendicular to the wave direction, so the wave is transverse, and the orientation of the electric field gives the polarization. That is to say, if the electric field points up and down, then we say the light is vertically polarized. In Figure 14-30 a charge _Q_ on a vertical spring moves up and down and generates the wave shown. So the polarization is in the same direction that the charge shakes.

Figure 14-30

Figure 14-31

A magnetic field also goes along with the electric field. Although Figure 14-30 does not show the magnetic field, Figure 14-31 shows both fields. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the electric field and to the direction of propagation.

Of course, this is not the full story. These waves of electric and magnetic fields come out as packets, called _photons_ , generally associated with energy transitions within a crystal, molecule, or atom. We will discuss this more fully in Chapter 16.

This chapter is the most difficult of the book. In addition to visualizing the movement of electrons in various materials, you must also learn to visualize electric and magnetic fields, and an electric potential as well.

The electric field relates force to charge. Whenever you read a question involving force and charge, you will probably need to think of the electric field. You should picture arrows (vectors) filling all of space pointing away from positive charges and toward negative ones. Since the electric field is a vector field, the electric field at a point due to several charges is the vector sum of the individual electric fields at that point. The electric potential is related to energy and charge. When a question mentions energy and charge, you should immediately think of using electric potentials. The work to move a charge from point A to point B is _W_ = _q_ ( _V_ B – _V_ A). We can find the potential at point A by simply adding the potentials ( _V_ = _kQ_ / _r_ ) from the charges in the problem.

An electric field is generated by both stationary and moving charges, although we have calculated only the former. A magnetic field is generated only by moving charges and affects only moving charges. Qualitative information can be obtained by the hand rules. The MCAT will not ask for any more detailed information.

### Passage 1

The radio waves which carry information in a standard broadcast are an example of electromagnetic radiation. These waves are a disturbance, not of a material medium, but of electric and magnetic fields. When the wave is linearly polarized, the electric field points in a direction perpendicular to the propagation of the wave, although its magnitude varies, of course, in space and time. The magnetic field points in a direction perpendicular to the wave propagation and to the electric field, and the two fields propagate in phase.

The electromagnetic radiation is generated by an antenna, which is a wire or metal rod which points perpendicular to the direction of the intended wave propagation. An alternating current is generated in the antenna, whose frequency is the same as that of the radiation to be produced. The electric field of the resulting electromagnetic radiation points along the same axis as the current.

The electric field of the electromagnetic radiation encounters electrons on the receiving antenna, which is another wire or metal rod. The electric field creates a current along the receiving antenna. One way to have good transmission and reception is to have the length of the antenna be one quarter of the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave.

For the following questions, consider a situation in which a transmitting antenna points vertically, and the receiving antenna is directly to the north. The speed of light is 3 x 108 m/s.

**1.** If the alternating current in the transmitting antenna has a frequency of 107 Hz, what would be a reasonable length for an efficient antenna, according to the passage?

**A.** 7.5 m

**B.** 30 m

**C.** 60 m

**D.** 120 m

**B.** Electromagnetic to electrical to electromagnetic.

**C.** Mechanical to electromagnetic to mechanical.

**D.** Kinetic to electromagnetic to kinetic.

### Passage 2

In a certain apparatus, a long wire along the _z-_ axis carries a uniform charge on it. The resulting electric field outside the wire is directed away from the wire and has a magnitude given by

_E_ = _K/d_

where

_K_ = 30,000 Nm/C

and _d_ is the perpendicular distance from the wire to the point in question.

Charges near the wire experience forces due to the electric field. This is true of elementary particles, like electrons, as well as ions and molecules. Polar molecules have one end charged positively and the other end, negatively. The two sides of the molecule thus experience two forces.

If the electric field is great enough, the gas around the wire may undergo breakdown, that is, the molecules are ionized by the electric field. For the following questions, use for the charge on an electron

_q_ elec = –1.6 x 10–19 C

**1.** What is the sign of the charge on the wire?

**C.** 4.8 x 10–13 N away from the wire.

**D.** 1.9 x 1023 N away from the wire.

**3.** Which of the following best depicts the electric field lines?

**4.** A fluoride ion (F–) has a mass 19 times greater than a hydrogen ion (H+). If a hydrogen ion and a fluoride ion are at the same location relative to the wire, how does the magnitude of the force on the fluoride ion compare to that of the force on the hydrogen ion?

**A.** 19 times weaker.

**B.** The same magnitude.

**C.** 10 times stronger.

**D.** 19 times stronger.

**5.** If a butanol molecule (CH3CH2CH2CH2OH) is near the wire, what is its most likely orientation?

**A.** The methyl group will be near the wire.

**B.** The methyl group will be away from the wire.

**C.** The oxygen atom will be near the wire.

**D.** The oxygen atom will be away from the wire.

### Passage 3

If two parallel metal plates separated by a small gap are charged, one positively and one negatively, then there will be an electric field between the plates. If the electric field is larger than a certain threshold, then a spark may jump across the gap, partially discharging the plates. The threshold electric field depends on the type and pressure of the gas between the plates.

To see how a spark occurs, imagine a lone electron between the plates. It experiences a force and an acceleration, so it will move in the direction of the positive plate. Before it gets there, it is likely to collide with a gas particle. The average distance an electron travels before encountering a gas particle is the _mean free path_. The mean free path depends only on the number density of the gas, that is, the number of gas particles per unit volume. If the electron gains enough energy before colliding with the gas particle to ionize it, then after the collision there are more electrons to continue the process. The original electron loses much of its kinetic energy but is still available to accelerate and ionize other gas particles. (See figure.)

A lone electron thus undergoes acceleration and energy gain, followed by a collision, depositing energy into the gas particle and debris. Each collision releases several electrons, so the phenomenon grows exponentially. The process described is a run-away chain reaction. The result is a transfer of charge from one plate to the other. In addition, the discharge leaves many molecules in an excited state, which releases photons as they decay to the ground state.

For air at atmospheric pressure the threshold electric field is about

_E_ th = 3 x 106 N/C

You may also use the following:

_r_ 0 = the average atomic radius = 6 x 10–11 meters

_l_ mfp = the mean free path = 8 x 10–9 meters

**1.** If an oxygen ion (O2–) and an electron are both between the plates, which experiences the greater force?

**A.** The oxygen ion by a factor of 8.

**B.** The oxygen ion by a factor of 2.

**C.** They experience the same magnitude of force.

**D.** The electron experiences a much greater force because of its small mass.

**2.** How much force would a calcium atom experience if it were between the plates? (Assume the electric field is the threshold electric field for air.)

**A.** 0 N

**B.** 4.8 x 10–13 N

**C.** 9.6 x 10–13 N

**D.** 9.6 x 10–12 N

**3.** How would the threshold electric field change if the pressure of the gas were increased?

**A.** The threshold would decrease because the mean free path would decrease.

**B.** The threshold would decrease because the mean free path would increase.

**C.** The threshold would increase because the mean free path would decrease.

**D.** The threshold would increase because the mean free path would increase.

**4.** Sulfur hexafluoride is a dense gas which absorbs electrons. What would be the effect of replacing air with sulfur hexafluoride between the plates?

**A.** The threshold would decrease because the density would be greater.

**B.** The threshold would increase because the density would be greater.

**C.** The increased density would increase the threshold, while the lone electrons would be absorbed, increasing the threshold even more.

**D.** The lone electrons would be absorbed, increasing the threshold. (Density is not a factor.)

**5.** Which graph could be a typical graph of the electron described in paragraph 2 above?

**A.**

**B.**

**C.**

**D.**  

## Chapter 15  
Electric Circuits

#### A. Introduction

In the last chapter, we developed some intuition about electric fields and electric potentials, so in this chapter we will apply this intuition to electric circuits. A simple _electric circuit_ consists of a voltage source, wires, and resistors, so that charge flows in a closed path or circuit. This flow of charge is called a _current_. In this chapter the concepts to watch are current and electric potential, two related but distinct concepts. Whenever you see a circuit diagram, you should imagine seeing currents and potentials. By doing this as you read this chapter, you will find that this subject becomes fairly straightforward.

A voltage source (often a _DC cell or battery_ ) is a potential difference enforcer, its one job being to ensure that the potential difference between the two terminals remains constant. It does this by chemically transporting electrons from the positive terminal to the negative terminal. When the potential between the terminals becomes the rated voltage (6 volts, or whatever), the chemical reaction in the cell reaches equilibrium and the electron transport stops. The symbols for a cell are shown in Figure 15-1, where the long bar is the positive end, the end with higher potential.

Figure 15-1

A _wire_ is simply a long, long cylinder of metal. Because it is a piece of metal, however, the potential difference between any two points in it is zero. That is to say, all along its length, a wire has one potential. In our analogy with Sisyphus and the mountain (Chapter 14), a wire is like a plateau, all of it at one height. The reason for this is simple: If it were not so, that is, if one end of the wire were at a higher potential, then electrons, being free to move, would rush toward the higher potential and lower it. Perhaps a better analogy is a mountain lake which is, of course, flat. If one end were higher than the other, the water, free to move, would flow away from that end into the lower one.

For this reason also the electric field inside a piece of metal is always zero. If it were not so, then the electric field would push electrons to one side, and the shifting electrons would cancel the electric field.

At any rate, you should remember that inside a metal, the electric field is zero, and if the potential at one point in the wire is _V_ 0, then the potential all along the wire is _V_ 0.

Electric current may flow through a _resistor_ as well, but the charge does not flow freely as it does in a wire. For current to flow through a resistor, there must be a potential difference across it. A simple example of a resistor is a piece of graphite (pencil lead). Other examples include a light bulb and a toaster. The symbols for these are shown in Figure 15-2.

Figure 15-2

In order to think about circuits, it is helpful to think of an analogy. The electric current is like a current of water, and the electric potential is like the height of the water. Wires are like level streambeds (level because they have one potential). Resistors are like rocky waterfalls, and a voltage source is like a pump which pumps water from one height to another.

Let's look at the example of a 6-V battery connected to a light bulb. This is shown in Figure 15-3, and the circuit diagram is shown in Figure 15-4. The battery pumps the charge from one electric potential to another. The charge flows through a wire to the light bulb, through the light bulb, and back to the battery. The analogy is shown in Figure 15-5, in which the water flows in a circuit. Note the following very important idea: The current in the upper trough is the same as the current in the lower trough. If the current in the upper trough were larger, then more water would be going into the waterfall than coming out of it, and the waterfall would overflow. That is not what happens. Think about this scenario until it is intuitive.

Figure 15-3

Figure 15-4

Figure 15-5

Also, energy flow is not the same as water flow. The energy starts in the pump and becomes the energy of flowing water. As the water falls, however, the energy becomes heat. Similarly, the chemical energy of the battery is transformed into electrical energy and then into heat and light.

Whereas in the last chapter we were often interested in the absolute potential, in circuits we are interested only in changes in potential from one position to another. Therefore, we are free to choose a standard 0 volts, relative to which other potentials are measured. In this circuit, we can label the low end of the battery 0 volts. The other end of the battery is then 6 volts (Figure 15-6).

Figure 15-6

#### B. Ohm's Law and the Combination of Resistors

It turns out that the current through most resistors is approximately proportional to the electric potential across them.

In the next example we encounter a combination of resistors. Several resistors in a circuit are often either _in series_ or _in parallel_. Several resistors are in series if a charge coming from the source must go through each of them before going back to the source. Several resistors are in parallel if a charge may go through any of them before going back to the source.

**Example 1:** Two resistors ( _R_ 1 = 10 Ω and _R_ 2 = 20 Ω) are connected in series with a potential source (9 volts). What is the current through resistor 1?

**Solution:** First, let's DRAW A DIAGRAM of the circuit (Figure 15-7).

We label the lower wire 0 volts. There is 9-volt jump across the voltage source, so the upper wire is labeled 9 volts. We label the wire between the two resistors with the potential _V_ m. The current is the same through both resistors and the source.

The equivalent water course is shown in Figure 15-8 in which the current in the top trough is the same as the current through both waterfalls and through the bottom trough.

Figure 15-7

Figure 15-8

Do you see why?

Applying Ohm's law to the first resistor gives

9 _V_ – _V_ m = _IR_ 1

and applying Ohm's law to the second resistor gives

_V_ m – 0 = _IR_ 2

Substituting the expression for _V_ m gives

9 _V_ – _IR_ 2 = _IR_ 1

9 _V_ = _I_ ( _R_ 1 \+ _R_ 2)

_I_ = 9 _V_ /( _R_ 1 \+ _R_ 2)

= 9 _V_ /(10 Ω + 20 Ω)

= 0.3A

**Example 2:** In the circuit above, what is the potential drop across resistor 1?

**Solution:** If we apply Ohm's law to resistor 1, then we have

Δ _V_ 1 = _I_ 1 _R_ 1  
= (0.3A)(10 Ω)  
= 3V

Generally, we do not have to go through as much trouble as we did in Example 1 because there are two rules for combining resistors:

**Example 3:** In the circuit shown (Figure 15-9), we have _R_ 1 = 20 Ω, _R_ 2 = 30 Ω, and _R_ 3 = 60 Ω, and the potential source is 12 volts.

a. What is the current through resistor _R_ 2?

b. What is the current through the potential source?

Figure 15-9

**Solution:** a. First, let's label the negative terminal of the source 0 V and the positive terminal 12 V. The potential all along the left wire is 0 volts, and along the right wire is 12 volts (Figure 15-10).

This gives us the potential drop across _R_ 2:

Δ _V_ 2 = 12V  
 _I_ 2 = Δ _V_ 2/ _R_ 2  
= 12V/30  
= 0.4A

b. Note that the current splits into three parts through the resistors. To obtain the total current, we need to combine resistors to obtain an equivalent circuit (Figure 15-11):

Figure 15-10

Figure 15-11

Figure 15-12 shows the analogous water-course.

Figure 15-12

When faced with a question concerning a circuit, there is no general procedure, which always leads to an answer, but here are some things to try:

1. Label the lower end of the battery 0 V.

2. Label other wires with voltages.

3. Label the currents going through the wires.

4. Combine resistors.

5. Apply Ohm's law.

**Example 4:** Consider the circuit shown in Figure 15-13, where _R_ 1 = 1 Ω, _R_ 2 = _R_ 3 = 4 Ω, and _V_ cell = 6 V.

a. What is the current going through resistor 1?

b. How does _I_ 1 change if points A and B are connected with a wire?

Figure 15-13

**Solution:** a. First we draw in the current and voltages (Figure 15-14), but this does not seem to get anywhere, because we do not know a potential difference across resistor 1 to apply Ohm's law. (Many students make the mistake here of using 6 volts and 1 Ω in Ohm's law, but the potential difference across resistor 1 is not 6 volts.)

Figure 15-14

Figure 15-15 shows the result of combining the two parallel resistors. Figure 15-16 shows the final equivalent circuit, by combining the two resistors in Figure 15-15. The total current is (by Ohm's law, finally) 2 A. The total current is the same as the current through resistor 1 (see Figure 15-14), so the answer to part a is 2 A.

Figure 15-15

Figure 15-16

b. If we connect points A and B by a wire, then they have the same potential, and this is shown in Figure 15-17. No current flows through resistors 2 and 3, and resistor 1 has the full 6 V across it. The current through it (by Ohm's law) is 6 A.

Figure 15-17

#### C. Real DC cells and Real Wires

An ideal voltage source would maintain a given potential across its terminals regardless of the circuit. Real DC cells are not so good, and we find that any current through the cell reduces the potential across the terminals. We can model a real cell as an ideal potential source in series with a resistor, as if there were a resistor inside the cell. The potential across the ideal source is the _electromotive force_ or _emf_ , the resistance of the internal resistor is the _internal resistance R_ cell, while the actual potential difference across the whole cell is the _terminal potential_.

In the simplified circuit of Figure 15-18, the circuit outside of the cell is a represented by a single resistor and dashed lines enclose the cell. The potential jump across the ideal source is _V_ emf. The current flowing through the circuit is _I_ , so the potential drop across the internal resistor is _IR_ cell. Thus from the illustration we can give an expression for the terminal potential:

Figure 15-18

In addition to knowing this equation, you should understand the discussion that leads to it.

**Example 1:** A battery has a measured potential difference of 6.0 volts if no circuit is connected to it. When it is connected to a 10-Ω resistor, the current is 0.57 amps. What is the internal resistance of the battery?

**Solution:** First let's DRAW A DIAGRAM (Figure 15-19). We label the negative terminal of the potential source 0 volts; the other side, 6 volts. The potential drop across the external resistor (10 Ω) is given by Ohm's law:

Δ _V_ ext = _IR_ ext

= (0.57A)(10 Ω)

= 5.7V

Figure 15-19

The potential on the other side of the external resistor is 0.3 volts. The potential difference across the internal resistor is 0.3 volts, and Ohm's law gives us the resistance

_R_ int = Δ _V_ int/I

= 0.3V/0.57A

= 0.53

Another way to do this problem is to combine resistances. Notice that equation (4) does not automatically give the answer in this example, but if we draw a diagram and apply the methods of Section B, then we obtain the answer in two steps.

In addition to idealizing DC cells, we have been assuming that wires have no resistance at all. In fact, they have a small resistance that is proportional to their length and inversely proportional to their cross-sectional area. A given material has a _resistivity_ ρ, so the resistance of the wire is given by

Some resistivities are given in the table below.

substance | resistivity (Ωm)  
---|---  
silver | 1.5 X 10–8  
copper | 1.7 X 10–8  
gold | 2.4 X 10–8

You can assume wires have zero resistance unless the passage tells you otherwise.

#### D. Power

Recall that power is a measure of how quickly energy is transformed, measured in [J/s = Watts = W]. The power dissipate by a resistor is

Because of Ohm's law, we may also write

_P_ res = _I_ 2 _R_ = (Δ _V_ )2/ _R_

(It is better to remember how to derive this equation than to memorize it.) The power provided by a DC cell to a circuit is

**Example:** Light bulbs that you use around the house are designed to have 120 V across their terminals. For instance, a 120-W bulb uses 120 Watts of power when placed in a socket with a 120-V potential difference. (Actually it is a little more complicated. See Section F.) With that in mind,

a. what is the resistance of a "120-Watt" bulb?

b. What is the resistance of a "30-Watt" bulb?

c. If these two bulbs are connected in series, and plugged into a wall outlet, which bulb would be brighter (Figure 15-20)?

Figure 15-20

**Solution:** a. Figure 15-21 shows the circuit diagram for a single 120-W bulb plugged into a potential source. The equation for power is

_P_ = _I_ Δ _V_  
120W = _I_ (120V)  
 _I_ = 1A

By Ohm's law, we have

Δ _V_ = _IR_  
120V = (1A) _R_  
 _R_ = 120 Ω.

b. A similar calculation gives a resistance 480 Ω for the "30-W" bulb.

c. If we place the bulbs in series (Figure 15-22), then the current through the bulbs is the same. Since

_P_ = _I_ 2 _R_

the power is proportional to the resistance. So the 480-Ω bulb (that is, the "30-W" bulb) is brighter because the bulbs are in series. (Usually the "120-W" bulb is brighter because the bulbs are connected in parallel.)

Figure 15-21

Figure 15-22

#### E. Capacitance

A DC cell creates a potential difference between its terminals by transferring electrons from the positive to the negative terminal. As it transfers more and more electrons, the negative terminal gains a greater charge, and the terminal exerts a greater force on every additional electron the cell transfers. Thus it takes more energy to transfer each additional electron onto it. Finally, the energy cost of adding an electron is too much and the cell stops, but by that time the terminal potential has been reached (Figure 15-23).

Figure 15-23

If, however, we connect each terminal to a plate of metal (Figure 15-24), then the cell is able to transport more electrons at a low energy cost, because the additional electrons are able to spread out across the plate. Eventually the cell tries to push one more electron onto the plate but cannot, because the energy cost is too great. In this case the potential between the plates is same as before, but the difference is that more charge is able to be contained on the plates than on the terminals of the cell.

Figure 15-24

If we bring the plates near each other but not touching (Figure 15-25), even more charge is able to be transferred through the cell. An electron arriving at the negative plate feels the opposing force from the electrons, but it also feels the attractive force of the nearby positive plate, so it does not mind so much getting onto the negative plate. (That is, it can be energetically favorable.)

Such a device, which holds a charge when a potential difference is applied to it, is called a _capacitor_. In Figure 15-25, if a larger potential is applied to the plates, a proportionally larger charge will sit on them. The _capacitance_ , the capacity to hold charge, is defined by

Figure 15-25

To reiterate, the capacitance of a device depends on how it is built. The charge on it is proportional to the voltage applied to it: _Q_ = _C_ Δ _V_.

**Example:** We place two metal plates parallel to each other and 0.01 meters apart. One sheet we connect by a wire to the positive end of a 6-V DC cell; and the other, to the negative end. The two plates now have a 6-V potential difference between them. The electric field between the plates is uniform (though we will not prove it), that is, the same direction and magnitude everywhere. A dust mite has a 2 X 10–14 C charge tied around his ankle.

a. How much work is required for him to cross from the negative plate to the positive plate?

b. What force does he experience as he crosses?

c. What is the magnitude of the electric field between the plates?

**Solution:** a. First let's DRAW A DIAGRAM showing the electric field (Figure 15-26); second, a diagram showing the forces on the mite (Figure 15-27).

Figure 15-26

Figure 15-27

Moving from a negative to a positive plate is an uphill battle for the mite, so we expect the work to be positive. We write

_W_ = _q_ Δ _V_  
= (2 x 10–14 C)(6 J/C)  
= 1.2 x –13 J

b. If the electric field is uniform, then the force (Felec = _qE_ ) that the mite experiences must be constant. If he goes straight across, then we have the old work equation

_W_ = _F_ miteΔ _x_ cos _φ_

Now the mite moves at a constant velocity, so the forces are balanced and we can replace _F_ mite with _F_ elec. Also, we know cos _φ_ is 1. Thus we write

_W_ = _F_ elecΔ _x_

and

_F_ elec = _W_ /Δ _x_  
= (1.2 x 10–13J)/0.01m = 1.2 x 10–11 N

c. We obtain the electric field from _F_ elec = _qE_ , so that _E_ = 600 N/C.

It is more important to understand the pictures and the ideas than to apply the formulas in this example.

The equation we derived is worth remembering in its own right:

Remember what this equation is about. This is just our old _W_ = _FΔx_ equation in new clothing, that is, work (per charge) is force (per charge) times displacement. In fact, the assumption made in the problem is fairly accurate: The electric field between two charged parallel plates is uniform.

Now let's complicate the situation even more. A _dielectric_ is a nonconducting substance, such as plastic. Its electrons are not free to move from one atom to the next, but the electrons can slosh a little onto one side of the molecules (they are slightly polarizable). If a dielectric is placed between the plates, then the molecules in the dielectric become polarized, with electrons being pulled toward the positive plate (Figure 15-28). The result is that the DC cell can transfer still more charge from one plate to the other, since an electron arriving at the negative plate feels also the slight positive charge of the one side of the dielectric. Thus, placing the dielectric between the plates increases the capacitance.

Figure 15-28

Each material which is a nonconductor has a dielectric constant  . The capacitance of the capacitor with the dielectric in the middle is given by

The constant   is always greater than 1.

#### F. Alternating current

When a DC cell is connected in a circuit, the potential difference between the terminals stays constant. This is called _direct current_ (hence DC). In a wall outlet, things are more complicated.

In the United States, the long slit is the _ground_ , connected to the Earth itself, which is a large supply of charge. This ensures that this terminal stays at a constant potential which we call 0 volts. The short slit is "hot". Its potential, relative to ground, varies like a sine wave between +170 volts and –170 volts. The voltage goes from high to low to high about 60 times a second, that is, with frequency 60 Hz. This is called _alternating current_ , since the current in the wire is changing back and forth (Figure 15-29).

Figure 15-29

**Example:** Consider your toaster plugged into the wall. The power company pulls electrons out of the Earth and pushes them onto a wire. The resulting electric field pushes electrons on down the wire, until electrons are pushed into your toaster. Electrons are pushed out of the toaster into the wire, out of the wire into the Earth. Any one electron does not go very far, but the signal goes from the power company to your toaster. (See Figure 15-30.)

Figure 15-30

Then the power company pulls electrons out of the wire and pushes them into the Earth. The resulting electric field pulls electrons along the wire, out of your toaster. Electrons in the other wire go into the toaster and are replaced with electrons pulled from the Earth. Sixty times a second. Until your bread is toasted. Note that only one wire needs to go from the power company to your house, since the Earth itself completes the circuit.

Generally, we do not talk of the line current as being 170 volts (the maximum). Instead we talk of a kind of average (root mean square) which is _V_ rms = 120 volts for the line current. The following equations hold for alternating current:

So there are no new equations to memorize.

Things begin to get complicated when we connect alternating current to capacitors (and to other things), but that is beyond the scope of the MCAT.

In this chapter we built on the concepts of the previous chapter to study simple circuits. When you solve problems involving circuits, it is helpful to visualize the flow of charge as the flow of a fluid and the potential in the wires as a height above a standard. Each piece of wire is at one potential. Each individual resistor has a current I through it and a potential Δ _V_ across it such that Δ _V_ = _IR_ (Ohm's law). It is important to be careful when using Ohm's law. Think about the circuit first. The power dissipated by a resistor is _P_ i = _I_ iΔ _V_ i.

A capacitor is two parallel conducting plates which store charge when a potential is applied to them. The capacitance of a capacitor is its ability to hold charge _C_ = _Q/ΔV_. The capacitance is determined by the dimension and material of the capacitor and the stored charge depends on the applied potential. The electric field between the plates is given by _ΔV_ = _EΔx_ , where Δx is the separation of the plates.

### Passage 1

In a certain experiment, we place two metal plates of area _A_ parallel to each other and separated by a distance _d_ to form a capacitor.

In Experiment 1 we place two copper circular disks of radius _R_ 1 a distance _d_ 1 apart and connect them to a battery which produces a potential Δ _V_ bat. This produces a positive charge _Q_ 1 on one of the plates and an electric field _E_ 1 between the plates.

In Experiment 2 we use two copper circular disks of the same radius ( _R_ 1) and place them three times as far apart (3 _d_ 1) as in Experiment 1. Again, the two disks are connected to the opposite ends of the same battery.

In Experiment 3 we reproduce the setup in Experiment 1. Then the wires are removed from the copper plates. The copper plates are carefully separated to a new distance 2 _d_ 1.

### Passage 2

In a certain experiment, we place two metal plates of area _A_ parallel to each other and separated by a distance _d_ to form a capacitor. The copper disks are mounted on nonconducting stands in a dry room which does not allow the conduction of charge through the air. The two plates are connected with wires to the opposite ends of a DC cell. We can increase the capacitance of such a setup by inserting a nonconductor, called a dielectric in electrical engineering parlance, between the plates. In this case, the capacitance of the device is _C_ di = _κC_ vac, where _C_ vac is the capacitance of the plates with a vacuum between them, _κ_ is the dielectric constant of the nonconductor, and _C_ di is the new capacitance.

In Experiment 1 we place two copper circular disks of area _A_ 1 a distance _d_ 1 apart, thus creating a capacitor with capacitance _C_ 1. We connect the two plates to opposite terminals of a battery which produces a potential Δ _V_ bat. This produces a positive charge _Q_ 1 on one of the plates and an electric field _E_ 1 between the plates.

In Experiment 2 we reproduce the setup in Experiment 1. This time, however, the two disks are connected to the opposite ends of a battery which produces four times the potential as that in Experiment 1 (4Δ _V_ bat).

### Passage 3

The Earth itself is a relatively good conductor. The atmosphere near the surface of the Earth, the troposphere and stratosphere, is composed mainly of neutral oxygen and nitrogen molecules, and it is a fairly good insulator.

About 30 km above the surface of the Earth, the atmosphere is composed mainly of ions. These ions are created by the bombardment of cosmic rays, and the low density of gas at that height inhibits their recombining to form neutral species. This portion of the atmosphere, called the ionosphere, is a good conductor. (See figure.)

Thus, a very much simplified model of the Earth and its atmosphere consists of two conductors separated by an insulator. Furthermore, there is a net charge of –106 C on the surface of the Earth and a corresponding positive charge on the ionosphere. The potential between the Earth's surface and the ionosphere is about 9 x 105 volts. Thus the model roughly resembles a parallel-plate capacitor.

For these questions, you may consider the charge on the electron to be –1.6 x 10–19 C.

**C.**

**D.**

### Passage 4

An electrostatic precipitator is a device used in industry to remove pollution from exhaust gas. It consists of a long thin wire surrounded by a conducting cylinder, such that a potential about 5 x 104 volts is maintained between the negative wire and the positive cylinder. (See figure.)

The resulting electric field inside the cylinder varies inversely with the distance from the center wire. Neutral particles of pollution are attracted to the center wire. The electric field near the wire is strong enough (greater than about 3 x 106 N/C) to ionize air, so the pollution particles are ionized negatively. They are attracted to the outer cylinder, where they collect and are eventually removed.

A typical energy requirement for such a device is about 300 Joules for each cubic meter of gas processed.

### Passage 5

When thunderclouds form, the base of the cloud is generally about 2 km above the surface of the Earth, while the top of the cloud may extend to about 8 km above the Earth. The charge structure is quite complicated. The top of the cloud has a strong positive charge; the middle of the cloud, a strong negative charge; and the bottom of the cloud, a weaker positive charge. Meanwhile the cloud induces a positive charge on the surface of the Earth. (See figure.) The resulting potential difference between the bottom of the cloud and the ground is around 108 volts.

When lightning strikes, some of the negative charge of the cloud neutralizes the positive charge of the Earth. Approximately 4 Coulombs of negative charge pass from the ground to the cloud, forming a current of 20 kamps. This results in a huge release of energy in the form of dissociation, ionization, and excitation of molecules in air, the heating and expanding of gas, and electromagnetic radiation.

In places especially prone to lightning, it is helpful to install lightning rods. A lightning rod is a long piece of metal with one end embedded in the ground and the other end extending up higher than the surrounding buildings. The end in the air comes to a sharp point. The purpose of such a piece of metal is to conduct electrons from the Earth into the air and reduce the charge imbalance, thus reducing the probability of lightning. If lightning strikes anyway, it is more likely to strike the lightning rod than the buildings.

### Passage 6

A number of aquatic species have evolved the capability to produce sizable electric fields. For some species this helps them to detect other organisms, either predator or prey. Other species, such as the electric eel, use this capability to stun or kill a predator or prey.

The organism generates the electric field in an "electric organ" which can take up most of the body cavity. The following description refers to a hypothetical electric organ, which includes many features by which these organs operate.

Electrocytes are flattened cells (like disks) which are stacked in a series, as shown in the figure below. During the equilibrium state, the cells actively exclude sodium ions (Na+), creating a potential difference between the inside of the cell and the outside of the cell. The cell membrane is permeable to potassium ions (K+), so the interior of the cell becomes enriched with K+ ions, partially but not fully compensating for the potential difference due to the imbalance of Na+ ions. The magnitude of the potential difference between the inside and outside is of the cell is about 0.1 V.

During the activated state, the posterior side of the cells becomes permeable to sodium ions, so they rush in through the posterior face due to the potential difference. Potassium ions rush in the same direction through the anterior face of the cell. The result is a potential difference across the whole organ, which acts, in effect, as a battery. (See the figure below.) The circuit is completed in the surrounding water, as shown in the second figure below.

During the activated state, the current across the anterior and posterior faces of a cell in this hypothetical electric organ is 30 milliamps. The duration of a pulse is 2 milliseconds.

The charge on an electron is –1.6 x 10–19 C.

## Chapter 16  
Atomic and Nuclear Physics

### A. Introduction

In this chapter we break out of the tradition and viewpoint of classical physics and discuss results from quantum theory. In the 1890s, physicists began to realize that the very language of particles and positions, forces and fields was insufficient to discuss the world of the very small, of atoms and molecules. They needed a new language and a new way of thinking, and quantum physics was born.

In classical physics, which we have been studying thus far, if we wanted to talk about a particular electron in an atom, we would specify its position and velocity. Physics would tell us how that position changed in time.

In quantum physics, we do not even talk about position and velocity in this way, because it turns out these terms are impossible to define. Particles simply do not have a definite position nor velocity. Instead we talk about a particular electron in an atom by specifying the orbital it is in. Orbital it is in? An _orbital_ is a state of being for an electron. Knowing an electron's orbital means knowing its energy (generally) and knowing something about its location (often), but not its exact position.

One way to think about it is to think that electrons are tiny particles which move so fast that we do not know where they are, and the area of space they move in is an orbital. That is one way to think about it, but it's the wrong way.

It is _not_ the case that electrons have position and velocity of which we are simply ignorant. An electron truly has no exact position, existing all around the nucleus at once, although it does exist more strongly in some places than in others.

For instance, an electron in the lowest-energy orbital of a hydrogen atom exists throughout the area near the nucleus, but it exists 90% within a radius of 1.4 x 10–10 m and 10% outside of that radius. (That does not mean that it spends 10% of its time outside of 1.4 x 10–10 m. That is thinking classically again.)

### B. Basic Structure of an Atom

As was mentioned in Chapter 14, an _atom_ consists of a tiny positive charge center (10–15 m) called the _nucleus_ and a surrounding cloud of electrons (10–10 m). Atoms connect together by interactions of their electrons to form _molecules_ and _ionic solids_ , which comprise almost all of the matter around us.  
The nucleus of the atom contains _protons_ and _neutrons_. Each proton has a charge +1.6 x 10–19 C (chemists call this +1), each neutron has zero net charge, and each electron has charge –1.6 x 10–19 C (chemists call this –1).

The mass of the proton and the mass of the neutron are about the same (1.7 x 10–27 kg), and electrons are about 2000 times lighter. As you can see, kilograms are really too large a unit to use to talk of these masses, so we often use another mass unit, called the _atomic mass unit_ , or [amu] (or sometimes just u), so that

1 amu = 1.6606 x 10–27 kg

It is very nearly the mass of a proton or neutron, so we have

_m_ proton = 1.0073 amu  
 _m_ neutron = 1.0087 amu  
 _m_ electron = 0.00055 amu

The _atomic mass_ (sometimes erroneously called the atomic weight) is the mass of an atom in amu. The _mass number_ is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The mass number is approximately the atomic mass of an atom in amu, since most of the mass comes from the protons and neutrons.

Thus we can describe a nucleus by specifying the number of protons in it, or _atomic number_ , and the total number of protons and neutrons, or mass number. The atomic number also determines which element the atom makes up. The notation we use for a single atom contains all this information. For instance, we denote common helium by one of the two symbols:

(pronounced "helium four"), where the mass number is 4 and the atomic number is 2. We really do not need to specify the atomic number, since we can obtain that from the periodic table. The mass of such a nucleus is about 4 amu (actually 4.00260 amu).

Several atoms which differ in the number of neutrons but have the same number of protons are called _isotopes_ of that element, for example, 35Cl and 37Cl. The chemical properties of 35Cl and 37Cl are nearly identical, since the neutrons of the nucleus have hardly any effect on the surrounding electron cloud.

The symbol 42He may refer either to a nucleus having two protons and two neutrons or to an atom having such a nucleus. We write nuclear reactions using similar notation as that for chemical reactions, except now we are concerned with changes in the protons and neutrons in the nuclei.

**Example 1:** When a slow neutron collides with a 17O nucleus, the products include a 4He nucleus and what other nucleus?

**Solution:** The information given in the problem can be written

where we have used the symbol 10n for the neutron (do you see why?). The number of protons mentioned among the reactants is 0 + 8 = 8, of which 2 went into the 42He. The number of protons and neutrons all together among the reactants is 1 + 17 = 18, of which 4 are in 42He. Thus the final nucleus has a 6 in the lower left position and a 14 in the upper left, corresponding in the periodic table to 14C or carbon-14, so we write

When writing reactions, the sum of left superscripts for the reactants must equal the sum of left superscripts for the products. This assures that the number of heavy particles stays constant. Also, the sum of left subscripts for the reactants must equal the sum of left subscripts for the products. This assures that charge is conserved in the reaction.

There are always at least two product particles in any nuclear reaction. (Exceptions are vanishingly rare.) One of these particles is often a particle of light, called a _photon_ and symbolized by _g_.

**Example 2:** When a proton collides with a nucleus of carbon-12, generally the result is one new nucleus (if there is a reaction at all). How do we write the reaction?

**Solution:** We write the reaction as follows:

or

where we have used  H for the proton (again, do you see why?).

### C. Energy Levels and Transitions

For an isolated atom, the electrons are in various orbitals. The atom as a whole has a certain energy, depending on what orbitals are occupied by electrons. Quantum theory predicts that only certain energies are allowed for a given atom.

For instance, a hydrogen atom can have only energies corresponding to the equation

where _n_ is a positive integer. There is no such thing as an isolated hydrogen atom with energy –1.5 x 10–18 J or with energy –1.1 x 10–18 J, since they do not fit into the formula. This can be shown graphically on an energy level diagram (Figure 16-1), in which the vertical axis represents energy and the horizontal axis does not represent anything. Zero energy corresponds to the state in which the proton and electron are infinitely separated. Bringing the proton and electron together releases energy, so the energies for all the other states are negative.

Figure 16-1

Even though the atom cannot have energies between the allowed energy states shown on the diagram, the atom can jump, or make a _transition_ , from one state to another. It does this either by colliding with another atom or by absorbing or releasing a photon. The state corresponding to the lowest energy is called the _ground state_. Other states are _excited states_.

In previous chapters we discussed light in terms of a wave of disturbance of electric and magnetic fields. Quantum theory maintains that these disturbances come in little packets called photons. If there are a large number of photons, then they act like the classical field discussed in Chapter 13. At any rate, there is a connection between the frequency of the light and the energy of a photon of that light, so that

where _h_ = 6.63 x 10–34 J/Hz is a constant of nature, Planck's constant.

If a photon is emitted or absorbed by an atom, then the photon has an energy given by the difference of the energies of the atomic states. Several examples will make this more clear.

**Example 1:** A beam of laser light is incident on a sample of hydrogen gas. Most of the gas in the sample is in the _ground state_ (lowest energy state). To what frequency should the laser be tuned so that the hydrogen atoms absorb the light and end up in the second excited state?

**Solution:** The ground state corresponds to _n_ = 1, so its energy is

The second excited state must have _n_ = 3, so its energy is

The energy of the photons in the laser are (–0.24 x 10–18 J) – (–2.18 x 10–18 J) = 1.94 x 10–18 J. Thus the frequency of the photons is

Transitions are shown in an energy level diagram by arrows from one line to another. Figure 16-1 shows the transition for Example 1.

Several things can happen after an atom has absorbed a photon. It can decay back to its previous state, emitting a photon of (almost) the same energy. This process, called _scattering_ , is shown in Figure 16-2, in which the up arrow represents absorption and the down arrow, subsequent emission. Figure 16-3 shows the process differently, where absorption occurs between steps 1 and 2 and emission between steps 2 and 3.

Figure 16-2

Figure 16-3

An atom which has absorbed a photon may emit a photon of a different energy by making a transition to a new state. This is shown in Figure 16-4. The upward arrow represents the absorption of the original photon. The downward arrows represent emitted photons, so the atom emits two photons for each one it absorbs. This phenomenon, in which a substance absorbs one frequency of light and emits light of different frequencies, is called _fluorescence_.

Figure 16-4

Do not get thrown off by notation. Sometimes the ground state energy is labeled _E_ 0 and sometimes _E_ 1. Also, sometimes we say the ground state has zero energy, but sometimes zero energy corresponds to complete ionization and the ground state energy is negative. It is a matter of convention which the problem will specify. The ground state is always the lowest-energy state.

### D. Radioactivity

The nucleus is often content to spend many years undergoing no major changes. The protons and neutrons hold together, while the electrons in the electron orbitals are doing all sorts of things. Sometimes, however, the nucleus undergoes a change. If this happens spontaneously, it is called _radioactive decay_.

There are three main types of radioactive decay. Nuclei which have an especially large number of protons and neutrons will sometimes throw off a packet of two protons and two neutrons, called an _alpha particle_ ( _a_ ). Note that an alpha particle is the same as the nucleus of the common helium nucleus. This is called _alpha decay_.

**Example 1:** What is the reaction representing the alpha decay of the thorium-232?

**Solution:** The answer is

We know the atomic number of thorium (90) from the periodic table. The alpha particle is always represented by the symbol 42He. Figure 16-5 shows this decay. (Figure 16-5 shows this decay.)

Figure 16-5

Generally alpha emitters are not dangerous to biological tissue (provided you do not eat them), since the alpha particles lose energy very quickly and do not penetrate very far even in air (several centimeters). That means they generally do not get inside of you.

The second type of radioactive decay is _beta decay_. Nuclei with many neutrons, compared with protons, undergo normal beta decay ( _β_ –). In this process, a neutron decays into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino. The proton stays in the nucleus, and the electron shoots away from the nucleus. The speeding electron, often called a _beta particle_ , can be highly injurious to biological tissue, since it is able to speed through the air and penetrate into the body. Once in the body, it slows down by ionizing molecules that it passes by, which can be very dangerous if one such molecule is DNA. The antineutrino is so penetrating that it generally passes through the body and the planet without depositing any energy, so it is mostly harmless.

**Example 2:** What is the reaction for the (normal) beta decay of lithium-9?

**Solution:** On the left side of the reaction we have 39Li. On the right side we place an electron. For accounting purposes, the symbol of the electron is 0–1e. Thus we have the incomplete equation

In order to complete it, we need to make sure the upper and lower left numbers add up correctly. Also we add an antineutrino, so we write

or we can write

Figure 16-6 shows this decay schematically.

Figure 16-6

Nuclei with many protons undergo _positron decay_ ( _β_ +). In this process, a proton decays into a neutron, a positron, and a neutrino. The neutron stays in the nucleus. The positron, which is a particle just like an electron (in mass and so on) with a positive charge, shoots away from the nucleus. The positron is dangerous to biological tissue as well, and the neutrino is innocuous.

(A word about words: Radioactivity is generally divided into alpha, beta, and gamma decays (although there are some other sorts of decays as well). Beta decays are divided into beta decays and positron decays, so the wording can be a bit tricky. Sometimes writers will be careful to say "normal beta decay" and sometimes they will not. If it matters which sort of beta decay is required, assume the normal kind unless otherwise specified.)

**Example 3:** What is the reaction for the positron decay of carbon-11?

**Solution:** On the left side of the reaction we have  C. On the right side we place a positron, whose symbol is  e. Thus we have

A third type of radioactive decay is _gamma decay_. Just as the electrons of an atom may be in an excited state, the nucleus can also be in an excited quantum state. When the nucleus decays into the lower energy state, it releases a photon, called a _gamma particle_ , just as a photon is released in the electronic case. When the nucleus decays, however, the energies involved are much greater, about a million times greater, than for the electronic decays. This reaction is the most penetrating, able to penetrate many meters of lead. It can be harmless if it passes simply through the human body, or it can be quite harmful.

**Example 4:** The radioactive decay of an excited state of cobalt-60 is given by

where the asterisk indicates an excited state. In this case 60Co* decays into one excited state of 60Ni, which decays into a second excited state of 60Ni, which decays to the ground state.

We can measure the time it takes a nucleus to decay in terms of a _half-life_. This is the time it takes half the atoms in a sample to decay. The lifetime of an atom is not the same as the lifetime of, say, humans.

If we imagine a population sample of 1000 humans all born in the same year, then after 75 years we would expect about half of them (or 500) to still be alive. After another eight years, only half of those would be surviving. After another five years, it would be half again. We would expect, 150 years after the birth date, that there would probably be no survivors.

Consider now a sample of 1000 gadolinium-148 atoms, all generated at the same moment. This isotope decays by alpha emission to samarium-144 with a half-life of 75 years. After 75 years we expect about half of the original Gd-148 to remain. After another 75 years, about half of those have decayed, leaving about 250 Gd-148 atoms. After yet another 75 years, there are around 125 left. Radioactive atoms do not age and die, but at any moment they have some constant risk of decaying.

**Example 5:** The nucleus Ru-103 decays to the stable isotope Rh-103. We obtain a pure sample and measure that its radioactivity to be 1616 millicuries. After 156 days the radioactivity is down to 101 millicuries. What is the half-life of this isotope?

**Solution:** The activity of the sample is down by a factor of 1616/101 = 16, that is, down by four factors of 2. That means that four halflives must have transpired. One half-life is (156 days)/4 = 39 days.

In Example 1, the mass of a Th-232 is 232.0381 amu. The mass of Ra-228 is 228.0311 amu, and that of He-4 is 4.0026 amu. Notice that the sum of the Ra-228 and He-4 masses is less than that of Th-232. Where did the missing mass go? This mass has been converted into energy.

There is a deep connection between mass and energy which we will mention only briefly here. In this reaction, mass is converted into energy, and the amount of energy can be determined if we know the masses sufficiently well. The _mass deficit m_ def is the difference of the mass of products and the mass of reactants, and the energy of reaction is given by

where _c_ = 3.0 x 108 m/s is the speed of light. This is the famous _E_ = _mc_ 2 equation. In order to apply this equation we must be careful that the units agree.

**Example 6:** In the decay of Th-232, most of the energy of the reaction ends up in the kinetic energy of the alpha particle. After a decay,

a. how much energy (in J) does the alpha particle have?

b. How fast (approximately) is the alpha particle going?

**Solution:** a. The mass deficit in this reaction is _m_ def = (232.0381 – 228.0311 – 4.0026) amu = 0.0044 amu. We convert this to kg and multiply by _c_ 2 to obtain energy

This energy is mainly in the form of kinetic energy of the alpha particle.

b. We want to use the equation _E_ K = 1/2 _mv_ 2 to solve for _v_. We know _E_ K in Joules, so we want _m_ to be in kilograms:

Then we have

This is quite fast, about 5% of the speed of light, but not so fast that we have to resort to the full mechanics of special relativity.

In summary for this section, here is a chart of special particles and their symbols for nuclear reactions:

In this chapter we discussed the physics of the atom and nucleus: atomic structure, electronic energy levels, radioactivity, and nuclear reactions. The key to understanding many physical situations lies in understanding the energy level diagram. An atom or nucleus can exist only in certain discrete states of precise energy. When the atom or nucleus makes a transition from one state to another, a photon is absorbed or released with energy equal to the difference of the energies of the two states.

The key to understanding problems involving nuclear reactions, including radioactive decay, lies in visualizing the decay and in writing the nuclear reaction correctly. There are three types of radioactive decay, called alpha, beta, and gamma decay. These decays vary in the type of particle expelled from the nucleus and the effect that this expulsion has on the nucleus.

#### Passage 1

A hydrogen atom has energy levels given by

where _n_ is a positive integer. A state in which the electron is infinitely far from the nucleus corresponds to 0 ev. (Note: 1 ev = 1.602 x 10–19 J) The energy level diagram is shown in the figure below. An atom generally has an electron in a given energy level; however, a transition may occur if the atom absorbs or emits a photon, or particle of light.

For the following questions, consider a hydrogen atom in an excited state initially at rest. It emits a photon of energy _E_ ph which travels to the right. The hydrogen atom is now in its ground state.

The energy of a photon is given by _E_ photon = _hf_ , where _f_ is the frequency and _h_ = 4.14 x 10–15 ev s. The momentum of a photon is given by _p_ photon = _E_ / _c_ , where _c_ = 3.0 x 108 m/s, the speed of light. The mass of a hydrogen atom is _m_ H = 1.7 x 10–27 kg.

#### Passage 2

Certain toys found in cereal boxes display the phenomenon of phosphorescence. If a child exposes the toy to a bright light (for example, the Sun), then the toy will glow with a characteristic color when the child takes it into a dark closet.

The phenomenon of phosphorescence requires the interaction of light with three energy levels in an atom (or molecule). The figure below (not to scale) shows a hypothetical energy diagram in which the lowest state shown is the ground state ( _E_ = 0). When the toy is taken into the Sun, a photon causes a transition from the ground state to state 2. Almost immediately, the atom emits a photon, making a fast transition to state 1.

The atom makes a transition to the ground state only slowly. Thus when the child takes the toy into a closet, he is able to observe the phosphorescent photons from this final transition. The transition from state 1 to the ground state is said to be _forbidden_ , and it takes place by different (and thus slower) processes than the other transitions.

Let _f_ abs be the frequency of the absorbed photons, _f_ fl be the frequency of the photons emitted while the object is still in the sunlight, and _f_ ph be the frequency of the photons released in the closet. (Planck's constant is _h_ = 4.14 x 10–15 ev s.)

**1**. How does _f_ abs compare to the _f_ ph?

**A**. _f_ abs < _f_ ph

**B**. _f_ abs = _f_ ph

**C**. _f_ abs > _f_ ph

**D**. It depends on the specific atoms used in the material.

**2**. How does _f_ fl compare to the _f_ ph?

**A**. _f_ fl < _f_ ph

**B**. _f_ fl = _f_ ph

**C**. _f_ fl > _f_ ph

**D**. It depends on the specific atoms used in the material.

**3**. Which of the following gives a correct expression for _f_ ph?

**A**.

**B**.

**C**.

**D**.

**4**. After the child brings the object into the closet, which atomic state is the most populated? That is, a number of atoms have electrons in the ground state, a number in state 1, and a number in state 2. Which number is greatest?

**A**. The ground state is the most populated.

**B**. State 1 is most populated.

**C**. State 2 is most populated.

**D**. Either the ground state or state 1 is the most populated.

**D**. The Sun emits photons of one frequency, and the toy converts the photons to the desired frequency.

#### Passage 3

**Sample 1**

We observe radioactivity from a sample of 209Po (Sample 1), but the radioactivity is effectively blocked by a piece of thin (0.05 mm) gold foil. The radioactive efflux is made into a beam by placing the sample in a block of lead (Pb) with a hole which allows the particles to escape as shown in the figure below). In one experiment the beam is subjected to an electric field which points up. In another experiment the beam is subjected to a magnetic field which points down.

**Sample 2**

We obtain a pure sample of 66Ga (Sample 2), which has a radioactivity level of 1000 mCi. We observe that the radioactivity is not blocked by a piece of thin metal foil, but it is blocked by several centimeters of aluminum. After 19 hours, the level of radioactivity is down to 250 mCi.

#### Passage 4

The two dominant forces in the nucleus of an atom are the electromagnetic force, which is the repulsive force among protons, and the strong force, which is attractive among protons and neutrons. Many of the things we observe in nuclei can be explained by a balance of these two forces, combined with the Pauli principle for the particles in the nucleus. For instance, most stable nuclei have somewhat more neutrons than protons, although nonmassive stable nuclei have about the same number of neutrons as protons. Nuclear physicists say that these nuclei are in a _valley of stability_ , so that

where _N_ is the number of neutrons and _Z_ is the atomic number, and the symbol means that _N_ is greater than or approximately equal to _Z_.

When the difference _N_ – _Z_ is strongly positive, it is likely that a nucleus will decay by β– decay, in which a neutron converts into a proton, an electron, and an antineutrino (which rarely interacts with matter).

When _N_ – _Z_ is only slightly positive or even negative, then there are two likely modes of decay: β+ decay and K-capture. In β+ decay (also called positron decay), a proton is converted into a neutron, a positron, and a neutrino.

In K-capture, an electron from an orbital of the first shell (or K-shell, that is, the 1s orbital) combines with a nuclear proton to make a neutron and a neutrino. This often happens in nuclei in which positron decay is forbidden, for instance, because it is energetically unfavorable. K-capture is possible because there is some overlap of the first-shell orbital and the volume taken up by the nucleus, that is, the first-shell orbital has a nonzero amplitude at the center of the nucleus.

**1**. Which of the following represents the K-capture decay of 56Ni?

**A**. 56Ni → 56Co + e+ \+ _v_

**B**. 56Ni → 56Cu + e– \+ _v_ –

**C**. 56Ni → 56Co + e– \+ _v_ –

**D**. 56Ni → + e– → 56Co + _v_

**2**. What kind of nuclei would tend to undergo K-capture?

**A**. Nuclei with many more neutrons than protons.

**B**. Nuclei with more protons than neutrons.

**C**. Nuclei with a deficit of electrons.

**D**. Nuclei with protons in low energy orbitals.

**3**. Which of the following, if true, would explain why L-capture, the interaction of a nucleus with a second-shell electron, is extremely rare?

**A**. The second shell has greater energy than the first shell.

**B**. The second shell has a vanishing amplitude in the nucleus.

**C**. The second-shell electrons are easily removed from the atom.

**D**. The second-shell electrons cannot be converted to positrons.

**4**. When an atom undergoes K-capture, several photons are often observed in the vicinity of the event. Which is the best explanation for this?

**A**. The neutrino ionizes the surrounding atoms.

**B**. The neutron decays into particles which ionize surrounding atoms.

**C**. Electrons in outer shells make transitions to lower shells.

**D**. The positron interacts with an electron.

**5**. What happens to the difference _N_ – _Z_ during normal beta decay?

**A**. decreases by 2

**B**. decreases by 1

**C**. increases by 1

**D**. increases by 2

**6**. What happens to _N_ – _Z_ during alpha decay?

**A**. decreases by 4

**B**. decreases by 2

**C**. stays the same

**D**. increases by 4

#### Passage 5

One strategy in the fight against cancer involves the interaction of neutrons with a particular isotope of boron, called boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). In BNCT, boron-10 is introduced into tumor cells, and the area is irradiated with slow neutrons. The interaction of a boron-10 nucleus and a neutron results in the production of an alpha particle with 2.3 Mev of kinetic energy.

A charged particle with large kinetic energy will lose that energy as it ionizes molecules that it passes by. In this case the alpha particles disrupt the DNA (among other molecules) of the tumor cells, effectively destroying cancerous tissue.

There are several problems with this method. It is important not to use a neutron flux so high that neutrons react substantially with oxygen and hydrogen in normal tissue, producing gamma rays. This sets an upper limit on the flux of neutrons and thus a lower limit on the necessary concentration of 10B in tumor cells.

It has proven difficult to concentrate 10B in tumor cells. One idea involves attaching boron to certain monoclonal antibodies which would recognize antigens on cancer cells. Another idea involves attaching boron to nucleosides, which tend to be taken up by dividing cells.

Another problem is finding a significant source of slow neutrons. Nuclear reactors are few, expensive, and relatively immobile. The isotope 252Cf has been suggested as a source of neutrons. Although its main channel of decay is alpha, with a 2.6-year half-ife, a significant fraction of it spontaneously fissions, yielding neutrons. Thus 252Cf can be taken to the site where it is needed. The neutrons from the fission can be moderated and directed to the area to be irradiated.

**1**. In paragraph 1, when a slow neutron encounters a 10B nucleus, what particle is created, in addition to the alpha particle?

**A**. a proton

**B**. a neutron

**C**. 4 He

**D**. 7 Li

**2**. Why do the neutrons used in irradiation not cause significant ionization and thus radiation damage of normal tissue?

**A**. The neutrons do not contain any orbitals.

**B**. The neutrons get captured before they have a chance to ionize anything.

**C**. The neutrons have overall zero charge.

**D**. The neutrons are not an elementary particle.

**3**. Paragraph 3 alludes to nuclear reactions which may be dangerous to normal tissue. Which of the following is a possibility, according to this paragraph?

**A**. 16O + 1n → 13C + 4He

**B**. 16O + 1n → 17O + γ

**C**. 16O + 1n → 17F + γ

**D**. 1H + 1n → 2He + γ

**4**. What is the immediate decay product for the alpha decay of 252Cf?

**A**. 252Es

**B**. 252Bk

**C**. 256Fm

**D**. 248Cm

**5**. A sample of 252Cf is shipped to a hospital, and 7.8 years later there are 0.01 moles of 252Cf left. How much was shipped to the hospital in the first place?

**A**. 0.01 moles

**B**. 0.03 moles

**C**. 0.04 moles

**D**. 0.08 moles

**6**. Which reaction shows an example of the spontaneous fission mentioned in the last paragraph?

**A**. 252Cf → 250Cf + 1n + 1n

**B**. 252O → 149Ce + 100Zr + 1n + 1n +1n

**C**. 252O + 1n → 150Ce + 100Zr + 1n + 1n + 1n

**D**. 252Cf + 1n → 250Bk + 1H + 1n + 1n

**7**. Why is it dangerous to have too large a neutron flux?

**A**. The neutrons will ionize molecules in biological tissue.

**B**. The neutrons will convert hydrogen and oxygen to other elements.

**C**. The neutrons will react with hydrogen and oxygen to produce ionizing radiation.

**D**. The neutrons will react with boron in normal cells, not just tumor cells.

#### Passage 6

The first method of imaging the interior of the human body came with the discovery of X-rays in 1895. A major advance in image resolution came with computerized axial tomography (CAT), a method of imaging which combines Xray images from numerous axial viewpoints.

A new method is positron emission tomography (PET). PET allows us to obtain very precise tomographic information of a specialized nature. For instance, we can obtain information about cells which are metabolizing a large amount of glucose. In this method, an analog of glucose, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, or FDG, is introduced into a person's bloodstream. The analog is incorporated into the cells along with normal glucose by the same carriers. Hexokinase converts FDG into FDG-6-phosphate, but its metabolism stops at that point, and the fluorine may be detected.

The key to this procedure is using the isotope 18F in FDG, since 18F is unstable to positron decay (half-life 110 minutes). In the production of this isotope, a cyclotron accelerates deuterons (2H) toward a target of 20Ne and H2. A deuteron and a neon nucleus collide to form 18F, which chemically reacts with the hydrogen gas to form hydrogen fluoride (H 18F). This is used in the synthesis of FDG.

The cells which are metabolizing a large amount of glucose will have a high concentration of FDG tagged with 18F. When a 18F nucleus emits a positron, the positron travels several millimeters before slowing to a stop. It then reacts with an electron to form two photons, which are emitted 180° apart. These photons are detected by a ring of detectors circling the person's body. Thus the original site of the decay can be reconstructed.

Another use of PET involves the incorporation of the isotope 15O (half-life 122 seconds) into water. This can be accomplished by bombarding a target of 14N with protons from a cyclotron. The water (with 15O) is introduced into the bloodstream. Detailed information can be obtained as to what capillaries are open or closed and therefore what areas of the brain are active.

**1**. Where does the kinetic energy of the positron go as it comes to a stop?

**A**. sound

**B**. ionization

**C**. gravitational potential energy

**D**. nuclear energy

**2**. In paragraph 3, when a deuteron collides with the 20Ne, what particle is produced in addition to the 18F nucleus?

**B**. a proton

**C**. a neutron

**D**. an alpha particle

**3**. What does the 18F nucleus become after positron decay?

**A**. 17O

**B**. 18O

**C**. 18Ne

**D**. 19Ne

**4**. What is a possible problem of using glucose tagged with 15O?

**A**. Glucose with 15O would not be transported into the cells.

**B**. Glucose with 15O would be a poison to biological functioning.

**C**. The half-life of 15O might be too short to record its incorporation into cells.

**D**. The isotope 15O would not positron decay when incorporated into a carbon compound.

**5**. If a sample of 15O is to have an activity of 10 mCi at a time 8 minutes after it is created and injected into the body, what must its activity be at the time it is synthesized?

**A**. 60 mCi

**B**. 80 mCi

**B**. A proton.

**C**. A neutron.

**D**. An alpha particle.

## Chapter 1 Solutions

1. A.

We start with the information 1.1x10–12 g. Unit analysis takes us to the answer:

Here we estimate (1.1)/6 to be about 0.2, which is close enough to give us an answer. Remember, all you need is an answer. You do not need to calculate a second digit.

2. B.

The question again is, "How much?" We have information in mL, and we want it in mg. Thus we write

Here we estimated 4 times 8 = 30. This is close enough to yield the answer B.

3. C.

Here we start with 1 molecule H2O. Then we can convert to mol and g:

4. C.

We can guess that the amount of time required is proportional to the temperature change desired, so let's start with that. Next, we want to cancel the units °C, so we add a factor of 4.2x103J/kg°C, giving

We want to cancel kg, so we can just place a factor of 10 kg in the numerator, giving

To cancel J, we can use the J from the power the resistor dissipates 2 W = 2 J/s. Thus

At this point we rejoice, because we have seconds in the numerator. Now we cut everything down to one digit and quickly multiply. This gives

This is close to choice C.

Does this method always work? Clearly you cannot answer every conceivable question by looking at units. But it is surprising how many questions can be answered this way, specifically any question in which all the formulas involved are simple proportionalities without unitless proportionality constants.

5. B.

We know this involves the ideal gas equation, but how do we start a unit analysis? Since we know we want to end up with K in the numerator, we can just place it there at the outset:

Now we cancel L and atm, giving

We can cancel mol if we think of a connection between mol and the 16 g Ar, so that we write

In the second step above, we multiplied numerator and denominator by 100. In the third step we calculated 2 _·_ 40/8 = 10. Most calculations go pretty quickly if you look for these shortcuts. Our answer is close enough for us to realize the correct answer is B.

6. B.

If the diameter of a circle increases by a factor of 4, the radius increases by a factor of 4 also. (If you do not believe this, try it with a few numbers.) The circumference increases by a factor of 4 as well.

7. C.

Clearly the area increases, but since the radius is squared in the formula, the area increases by a factor of 42 = 16. The _π_ in the formula does not make any difference.

8. D.

This time there is an _r_ 3 in the formula, so the volume increases by a factor of 43 = 64.

9. B.

If the volume of a sphere decreases by a factor of 27, then its radius must decrease by a factor of 3, since 33 = 27. If the radius decreases by a factor of 3, then the diameter decreases by a factor of 3 as well. Again, you should try this method with some numbers if it does not make sense to you.

10. C.

If the radius increases by 30%, that is the same as increasing by a factor of 1.3, since (1 + 30/100) = 1.3. If the radius increases by a factor of 1.3, then the area increases by a factor of 1.32 = 1.69. An increase by such a factor is an increase by 69%, so the answer is C. Keep in mind that you need to know how to manipulate numbers like this quickly.

11. B.

Since _l_ is in the numerator, _T_ increases if _l_ does. If _l_ increases by a factor of 4, then T increases by a factor of

12. B  
A problem like this is easier if we solve for _l_ , giving

A decrease by 20% in the period is equivalent to multiplying the period by (1 – 20/100) = 0.8. If the period is multiplied by 0.8, then the length is multiplied by 0.82 = 0.64. We can rewrite 0.64 = (1 – 36/100). Thus the length decreases by 36%.

13. B.

Since _g_ is in the denominator, a decrease in _g_ results in an increase in _T_. If _g_ decreases by a factor of 6, then _T_ increases by a factor of

Of course, you do not have to work out the square root. A glance at the answers indicates that B is correct.

14. B.

Since _m_ is in the numerator, an increase in _m_ will increase _T_. This results in a decrease in frequency _f_. Since _m_ changes by a factor of 4, the period changes by a factor of

The frequency changes by a factor of 2, so the answer is B. This approach is the most straightforward way to do the problem. Any time spent calculating the value of _k_ is wasted time.

15. A.

First, if the period is larger for mass P, then mass P must be larger. Next, for there to be a change of 36 in the period, there must be a change of 1296 inside the square root. Thus the answer is A.

16. C.

Since we have (1 + 50/100) = 1.5, the period is multiplied by 1.5. Thus the frequency is multiplied by (1.5)–1 = 0.67. We rewrite 0.67 = (1 – 33/100), so the frequency decreases by 33%.

17. D.

If _s_ increases by a factor of 9, then _V_ increases by a factor of 81. Do not let the 1/3 in the formula throw you off. If it did, try the problem with numbers to see why the 1/3 does not matter.

18. B.

This is a simple proportionality.

19. C.

In this case, both _s_ and _h_ increase by a factor of 3. The increase in _s_ causes _V_ to increase by a factor of 9, and another factor of 3 comes from the _h_.

#### Passage 1

1. C.

The separation of the plates is unchanged, so the electric field increases by a factor of 9.

2. B.

According to the first equation, the electric field and the plate separation are inversely related, so an increase in _d_ results in a decrease in _E_ , so that B is the answer. If this is unclear, solve for _E_ in the first equation.

3. B.

For this question we need to remember that a helium nucleus has two protons (its atomic number on the periodic table), so the bare helium nucleus has twice the charge of a proton. Thus the force on it is twice as great.

4. B.

If the separation of the plates increases by a factor of 2, then the electric field decreases by a factor of 2. And the force on the proton decreases by a factor of 2.

5. A.

The voltage _V_ and electric field _E_ are proportional, so A is correct. For C to be correct, the equation would need to be _V_ = _Ed_ \+ _V_ 0.

#### Passage 2

1. D.

Since _r_ is in the denominator, if _r_ decreases, then the force increases. If _r_ changes by a factor of 2, then the force changes by a factor of 22 = 4.

2. B.

The distance _r_ is multiplied by 1.25. Thus _F_ is multiplied by 1.25–2 = (5/4)–2 = (4/5)2 = 0.82 = 0.64 = (1 – 36/100). The force decreases by 36%.

3. C.

Concerning choice A, a factor of 4 in both _q_ 1 and _q_ 2 will result in a factor of 16 in _F_ , so this choice is incorrect. If _F_ is to stay the same, and _q_ 2 increases, then the distance _r_ must increase, so choice B is incorrect. A factor of 4 in _q_ 2 is equivalent to a factor of 2 in _r_ , since 22 = 4. Another way to see this is to solve for _r_ , which you should do if this discussion was unclear.

4. D.

If the charge on one ball increases by a factor of 4 (from 2 C to 8 C), then the force must increase by a factor of 4.

5. C.

We can eliminate A and B immediately, since _F_ decreases as _r_ increases. We can eliminate D, since _F_ does not have a linear relationship with _r_ (that would look like _F_ = _kr_ \+ _c_ ). As _r_ approaches 0, the force becomes infinite, so C is a good choice. Also, as _r_ becomes large, _F_ approaches 0 but never reaches it.

6. B.

If both balls acquire a charge _q_ , then the force between them is given by

which is equivalent to _F_ = _ar_ 2, a quadratic equation. Thus the answer is B.

#### Passage 3

1. B.

In order to determine _n_ , we need two experiments where everything stays the same except for the area, so that we can investigate the results of a change in area. As for choice A, the object changes and the area does not, so that is out. In choice B, area changes from 1.5 to 3.0 cm2, and nothing else changes, so B is correct. Choice C is incorrect because the velocity is the only thing that changes. In choice D, both _A_ and _v_ change, so we would not be able to tell how much change in _F_ is due to _A_ and how much is due to _v_.

2. D.

In the previous solution, we realized that experiments 4 and 6 have the property that all the input variables stay the same except for velocity _v_ , which increases by a factor of 4. The force increases by a factor of 16, which means that _p_ must be 2. That is, if _p_ is 2, then an increase by a factor of 4 in _v_ results in an increase by a factor of 42 in the force.

3. B.

In choice A, experiments 1 and 2 both use a cork ball. For choice C, many input variables are altered between experiments 1 and 6, so it is impossible to isolate the effect of object density. As for choice D, experiments 4 and 6 both use a steel ball. Choice B involves two experiments in which only the density of the object changes.

4. A.

As for choice A, experiments 1 and 2 could be used to determine _p_ , since the velocity changes and nothing else does. Once _p_ is determined, _k_ can be determined by substituting in values from either experiment 1 or 2. Thus experiments 1 and 2 are sufficient. We can exclude choices B and C (not minimum sets). As for choice D, there is not enough information to obtain _p_ or _k_.

#### Passage 4

1. B.

If _v_ increases by a factor of 2, then the required energy increases by a factor of 22 = 4.

2. C.

If Julie increases her speed by 20%, then she multiplies her speed by 1.2. Thus the required energy is multiplied by (1.2)2 = 1.44, which is an increase of 44%.

3. B.

Comparing Scott's car to Laura's, all the linear dimensions are increased by a factor of 2 (see figure). The cross-sectional area _A_ is width times height ( _A_ = _hw_ ), so if both _h_ and _w_ increase by a factor of 2, then _A_ increases by a factor of 4. Thus the required energy increases by a factor of 4. The increase in length does not matter.

4. C.

Julie increases her speed by a factor of 55/50 = 1.1, so the energy increases by a factor of 1.12 = 1.21. This is an increase of 21%.

5. C  
The easiest way to do this is to solve for D, giving

If _A_ is reduced by 20%, then _A_ is multiplied by 0.8. According to the above equation, _D_ is multiplied by (0.8)–1 = 1.25, representing an increase by 25%.

## Chapter 2 Solutions

1. C.

The mass of the mobile unit does not change just because we transport it to a different place.

2. A.

We add the fly's velocity to the car's velocity in order to obtain its total velocity relative to the ground. We move the fly velocity vector so that its tail coincides with the tip of the car velocity vector. The resulting total is just west of north (see diagram). In the choices, only choice A shows the correct total vector. The choice does not show the fly vector already moved. You must do that.

3. B.

From the diagram of the previous solution, we can see that the answer must be slightly larger than 2 m/s and certainly not so large as 2.3 m/s, so B is correct. To do the numbers, we use the Pythagorean theorem:

4. A.

First we move the horizontal vector, so its tail is on the tip of the top vector. Then we move the bottom vector, so its tail is on the tip of the horizontal vector. The resulting sum is the arrow from the first tail to the last tip (see diagram).

5. C.

Again we sequentially place the tail of one vector on the tip of the previous one. The resulting sum is zero (see diagram). We could see this in the diagram anyway, since the arrows seem to cancel out each other.

6. A.

They exert the largest net force when they pull the same direction (see figure), giving the total 7000 N. They exert the smallest net force when they are directly opposed to each other, giving 1000 N. Therefore it is not possible for the net force to be 500 N. If this is unclear, try drawing a few vector diagrams to get a total of 500 N.

7. B.

If they pull at right angles, then we need to apply the Pythagorean theorem (see figure):

8. A.

Since she starts from rest, her initial velocity is zero.

9. A.

Again, she ends at rest.

10. B.

The net displacement is Δ _s_ = 27 km = 27,000 m. The total time is Δ _t_ = 75 min = 4500 s. Thus the average velocity is _v_ avg = Δ _s_ /Δ _t_ = 6 m/s.

11. D.

During these 9 s, she was accelerating uniformly, so we can write the equation:

_v_ 2 – _v_ 1 = _a_ Δ _t_

_v_ 2 = _v_ 1 \+ _a_ Δ _t_

= 0 m/s + (2.5 m/s2)(9s)

= 22.5 m/s

12. B.

Since the car is accelerating uniformly, we can write _a_ = Δ _v_ /Δ _t_ = (30 m/s – 5 m/s)/10 s = 2.5 m/s2.

13. C.

Since the car is accelerating uniformly, we can write _v_ avg = 1/2 ( _v_ 1 \+ _v_ 2) = 17.5 m/s.

14. C.

We can write the equation

15. B.

We want a formula which relates distance, velocity, and time, so we write

Now Δ _x_ is the same, while we want _v_ to increase by a factor of 3. To do this we need Δ _t_ to decrease by a factor of 3. You could probably do this without writing down the formula. Other problems will not be so simple.

16. A.

We want to know change of velocity Δ _v_ , while we know acceleration _a_ = 0.3 m/s2, the time interval Δ _t_ = 3 s, and the initial velocity _v_ 1 = 1.5 m/s. We need the definition of acceleration:

So we did not need the value of _v_ 1 at all. The key to many problems is making an inventory of what we know and what we want.

17. B.

We know Δ _y_ = –10 m, _a_ = –10 m/s2 (approximately), _v_ 1 = 0 m/s (because it is dropped). We want Δ _t_. Thus we have

18. B.

If we want _v_ 2, we use the equation:

19. B.

We know _v_ 1 = 20 m/s, _a_ = 1.2 m/s2, and Δ _t_ = 5 s. Thus Δ _x_ = _v_ 1Δ _t_ \+ 1/2 _a_ (Δ _t_ )2 = 115 m.

20. C.

We know _a_ = –0.1 m/s2, _v_ 2 = 0 m/s (because it comes to a stop), and Δ _t_ = 5 s. We use the following equation:

_v_ 2 – _v_ 1 = _a_ Δ _t_

_v_ 1 = _v_ 2 – _a_ Δ _t_

_v_ 1 = (0 m/s) – (–0.1 m/s2)(5s)

= 0.5 m/s

21. B.

We know _v_ 1 = 0.2 m/s and _a_ = –0.05 m/s2. If we want to know how long it takes to stop, we add the datum _v_ 2 = 0 m/s. Thus we have

22. A.

We still use _v_ 1 = 0.2 m/s and _a_ = –0.05 m/s2, but now we have Δ _t_ = 6 s. The net displacement is obtained from

It is important to pay attention to signs in this problem, translating "up" into positive and "decelerating" into negative. Also note that the ball travels further than 0.3 m, going 0.4 m up the slope before heading back. The net displacement is the difference between final position and initial position.

23. C.

Here we have _v_ 1 = – 5 m/s, Δ _t_ = 10 s, and _v_ 2 = 10 m/s. We can obtain acceleration from its definition: _a_ = ( _v_ 2 – _v_ 1)/Δt = 1.5 m/s2.

24. A.

We obtain the net displacement from Δ _x_ = 1/2( _v_ 1 \+ _v_ 2) Δ _t_ = 25 m.

25. C.

We want an equation which relates _v_ , Δ _x_ , and Δ _t_. This is _v_ = Δ _x_ /Δ _t_. If _v_ increases by a factor of 3, then Δ _t_ must decrease by a factor of 3, so the answer is C.

26. A.

Here we know that _v_ 1 = 25 m/s, _x_ 1 = 3000 km, _a_ = 0.02 m/s2, and Δ _t_ = 500 s. We want _x_ 2. We know that Δ _x_ = _x_ 2 – _x_ 1, so we can calculate

Thus _x_ 2 = 3015 km. Remember to be careful with the units.

27. B.

We calculate Δ _x_ = 1/2 ( _v_ 1 \+ _v_ 2)Δ _t_ = 4.4 m.

28. B.

We want an equation involving velocity and time and possibly acceleration. Let's look at the equation

Here _a_ is constant and Δ _t_ increases by a factor of 3. Thus Δ _v_ increases by a factor of 3 as well, giving B as an answer. Another way to see this is to rewrite the equation:

so an increase in Δ _t_ yields an increase in _v_.

29. C.

The figure in the problem shows a car which starts from rest, speeds up to a cruising speed which it maintains, then slows to a stop. Let's keep this in mind.

The figure above shows _v_ versus _t_ , and we want to pick the best graph for _x_ versus _t_. From point A to point B, there is no area under the graph, so the displacement is zero, and all the choices show this. From B to C, there is an increasing amount of area under the curve, eliminating choices B and D which show a jump in _x_ versus _t_. From C to D, there is area under the curve, so Δ _x_ is positive for every interval Δ _t_. This means _x_ is increasing, which is shown only in choice C. After E, the velocity goes to zero, and Δ _x_ goes to zero. This means that no more increments get added to x. _But this does not mean_ that _x_ returns to the _x_ -axis (as in choice A).

30. B.

Between A and B, the instantaneous slope is zero (see figure). Between points B and C, the instantaneous slope jumps to a constant value, eliminating A and C as choices. Between C and D, the instantaneous slope is zero, so the acceleration jumps back down to zero, so B is correct. Between points D and E, the acceleration is negative.

31. B.

The following figure is _x_ versus _t_. We can obtain _v_ versus _t_ by looking at the instantaneous slope at various times. This gives the points shown in the second figure.

To obtain the acceleration, we need to take the instantaneous slope at various points in the second figure, but clearly the slope is always positive (and probably constant).

32. A.

The net displacement is Δ _x_ = _x_ 2 – _x_ 1, the difference between final and initial position. But in this case _x_ 1 and _x_ 2 are the same, so the net displacement is zero.

33. C.

In words, we can say that the velocity starts large and decreases to a stop. Then it increases again. Just this description alone might lead us to recognize C as the answer.

The figure shows how successive areas under the curve _v_ versus _t_ result in successive increases in the curve _x_ versus _t_. Note that the fact that _v_ is always positive translates into the fact that _x_ is always increasing.

We can also work this problem by taking the choices and working backward, taking instantaneous slopes, in order to find which would produce the given _v_ versus _t_.

34. B.

Taking instantaneous slopes of _v_ versus _t_ gives an acceleration which is constant and negative until the cusp. Then it is constant and positive. This is shown in choice B.

35. B.

The net change in velocity Δ _v_ = _v_ 2 – _v_ 1 is simply zero, since the velocity starts and ends with the same value.

36. A.

The car is backing up at the beginning of the problem, so the velocity is negative. The only choice to show this is A. The flat portion in the center of choice A is when the car is stopped. The later flat portion shows the constant velocity while going forward.

37. C.

The car accelerates exactly twice: while it slows to a stop going backward (positive acceleration) and while it speeds from a stop going forward (positive acceleration). When the car is cruising at constant velocity, the acceleration is zero, so C is the correct choice. By the way, choice B shows a sketch of _x_ versus _t_.

#### Passage 1

1. A.

The initial velocity is just that at the beginning of the experiment.

2. B.

The average velocity is _v_ avg = Δ _x_ /Δt. The net displacement is Δ _x_ = 1.35 m – 1.35 m = 0 m.

3. D.

This question consists entirely of words, but let us write an equation anyway. Uniform acceleration means _a_ is constant, and _a_ = Δ _v_ /Δ _t_. Thus Δ _v_ and Δ _t_ are in a constant ratio. If one of the choices expresses this fact, then that would be the solution. (If not, we will have to think some more, perhaps find another equation.) D is the correct answer.

4. D.

We apply the definition of acceleration:

5. A.

Since acceleration is positive, the vector points in the forward direction (according to the sign convention of the passage).

6. B.

For any 0.5-s interval in the chart, the acceleration (Δ _v_ /Δ _t_ ) is a constant 1.2 m/s2, even for the intervals near _t_ = 1.5 s, where the velocity is zero. Thus B is the best answer.

#### Passage 2

1. B.

We apply the formula Δ _x_ = _v_ 1Δ _t_ \+ 1/2 _a_ (Δ _t_ )2 = (0 m/s)(4 s) + 1/2 (10 m/s2)(4 s)2 = 80 m.

2. B.

The equation which involves change in velocity Δ _v_ and time is the definition of acceleration:

_g_ = Δ _v_ /Δ _t_

Δ _v_ = _g_ Δ _t_

Δ _v_ = _g_ ( _t_ 2 – _t_ 1)

3. C.

Since velocity starts at zero, we can eliminate D. The instantaneous slope for the graph of _v_ versus _t_ must be a constant _g_ = 9.8 m/s2. The graph to which this applies is C.

4. B.

Let's be clear about this by writing an equation. The equation involving Δ _v_ is the definition of acceleration (see solution to problem 2 above). Thus Δ _v_ = _g_ Δ _t_. The acceleration _g_ is constant, and Δ _t_ is the same for the two situations (both have Δ _t_ = 1 s). Thus Δ _v_ is the same. The velocity increases at a constant rate throughout the fall.

5. A.

We can calculate the height at the four clock readings:

Δ _x_ ( _t_ = 1s) = _v_ 1Δ _t_ \+ 1/2 _a_ Δ _t_ 2

= (0 m/s)(1 s) + 1/2 (10 m/s2)(1 s)2

= 5 m

Δ _x_ ( _t_ = 2 s) = 20 m

Δ _x_ ( _t_ = 3 s) = 45 m

Δ _x_ ( _t_ = 4 s) = 80 m

Thus from 1 to 2 s, the object falls 15 m, while from 3 to 4 s, the object falls 35 m. This confirms our intuition that the distance fallen is greater for the later time interval. Notice the difference between this problem and the previous one.

6. D.

We use the equation involving Δ _x_ , Δ _t_ , and the acceleration (since we know its value):

Δ _x_ = _v_ 1Δ _t_ \+ 1/2 _g_ Δ _t_ 2

We have _v_ 1 = 0 m/s, so we write

Δ _x_ = 1/2 _g_ Δ _t_ 2

If the time interval Δ _t_ increases by a factor of 3, what happens to Δ _x_? Apparently it increases by a factor of 9.

7. C.

Choice A is nonsense. Choice B is a true statement, but it cannot be an adequate explanation for the fact, since the lead and iron balls fall at the same rate, and the force of gravity is presumably different on those two balls as well. Choice C is a good candidate, since the passage mentions air resistance as a caveat. Choice D is irrelevant.

## Chapter 3 Solutions

1. D.

From the first law of motion, a force balance on an object implies it has constant velocity. From this we conclude that the force of gravity and the drag force due to the air are _exactly balanced_.

2. D.

Since there is only one force, there must be a net force on the object; there is no way for forces to be balanced. From the first law of motion, we conclude that the object is not undergoing uniform motion, so it is speeding up, slowing down, or changing direction. But none of the choices can be definitely concluded.

3. C.

Since the car is not undergoing uniform motion (it is slowing), it has a net force on it. In fact, the net force points in the opposite direction the car is going.

4. C.

Since the object is moving with uniform motion, the forces on the object must be balanced. Since there are exactly two forces, the only way for them to be balanced is that they be of equal magnitude in opposite directions, which is choice C. If you chose B, think of the example of the paratrooper falling in question 1, in which the downward force of gravity is balanced by the upward force of the air drag.

5. B.

In case 1, we move the tail of _F_ B to the tip of _F_ A (see figure). The sum, _F_ net, is drawn from the first tail to the last tip, giving a magnitude of 700 N. So choice B is correct. The same method for case 2 yields a magnitude 100 N. For case 3, we need to apply the Pythagorean theorem to obtain a magnitude 500 N.

6. A.

(This was a review problem.) We calculate _a_ = (3.5 m/s – 1.5 m/s)/3 s = 0.67 m/s2.

7. A.

We calculate _F_ net = _ma_ = (60 kg) (0.67 m/s2) = 40 N.

8. C.

We calculate _a_ = (20 m/s – 0 m/s)/(12 s) = 1.67 m/s2.

9. A.

We calculate (from Chapter 2) Δ _x_ = 1/2 (0 m/s + 20 m/s) (12 s) = 120 m.

10. C.

The magnitude of the net force is given by _F_ net = _ma_ = 167 N.

11. C.

The vertical forces, which are balanced, are gravity (down) and the normal force of the ground (up). The one horizontal force accelerates the tiger, and it is due to the ground pushing forward. This may seem strange, but it is a result of the third law of motion. The tiger pushes the ground backward. There is then an equal force of the ground on the tiger pushing forward, even though there is no "active" agent creating the force. But it has to be the ground pushing the tiger forward, since that is the only thing touching him. Certainly he does not push himself forward (what would that even mean?).

12. B.

We want an equation which connects force, acceleration, and mass. This is _F_ = _ma_. Since we are looking for the change in acceleration, we can write this equation _a_ = _F_ / _m_. If the mass decreases by a factor of 2, then the acceleration increases by a factor of 2.

13. C.

As in question 12, we write _a_ = _F_ / _m_. If _F_ increases by a factor of 3 and _m_ increases by a factor of 3, then _a_ remains the same.

14. A.

We draw a diagram (see figure). We cannot calculate the acceleration using the methods of the previous chapter, but we can find a net force. In one dimension, we can call east positive, so _F_ net = 0.0015 N – 0.0010 N = 0.0005 N. Thus we can find acceleration _a_ = _F_ net/ _m_ = 0.0005 N/0.0005 kg = 1 m/s2.

15. B.

We draw a diagram (see figure). We can obtain the net force by applying the Pythagorean theorem. The net force is 13000 N. From this we obtain the magnitude of the acceleration _a_ = _F_ net/ _m_ = 26 m/s2.

16. C.

We draw a diagram (see figure). We include the vertical forces of gravity and the normal force, which add to zero (that is, balance each other). There is nothing touching the truck except the ground (the girl has already let go), but there must be another force because the truck is changing velocity. This force is the drag force, pointing backward. (There is no forward force.) We want to know the magnitude of the drag force, since this is also the net force. We obtain the acceleration _a_ = (0 m/s – 15 m/s)/5 s = –3 m/s2. Thus, in magnitude, the net force is _F_ net = _ma_ = 12 N.

17. B.

We draw a diagram showing the forces on the mass (see figure). There is the force of gravity and the tension in the string, which pulls up. The net force (with down as positive) is _F_ net = (0.8 kg) (10 m/s2) – 6 N = 2 N. The sign indicates the net force is down. Now we can calculate the acceleration _a_ = _F_ net/ _m_ = 2 N/0.8 kg = 2.5 m/s2.

18. B.

We draw a diagram showing the forces on the woman. Since she is traveling at constant velocity, the net force on her is zero, and the forces are balanced. Thus the force of the floor against the woman's feet has the same magnitude as the force of gravity on her. This is just the first law of motion. If you chose C, then you need to study the first law of motion again.

19. B.

We can calculate an estimate of acceleration _a_ = Δ _v_ /Δ _t_ = (1 m/s)/(7 s) = 1/7 m/s2. Thus the total mass is given by _m_ = _F_ net/ _a_ = 900/(1/7) kg = 6300 kg. The mass of the rocket case is then (6300 – 3300) kg = 3000 kg. This is close to B.

20. C.

We need an equation which connects time and mass (which differs from A to B). We also have information about _F, v_ 1, and _d_. We can use _F_ = _ma_ and _d_ = _v_ 1Δ _t_ \+ 1/2 _a_ (Δ _t_ )2. Combining these, we obtain

So if _m_ increases by a factor of 4, then time increases by a factor of

21. A.

First we draw a diagram (see figure). The vertical forces balance. The net horizontal force is _F_ net = 105 N – 30 N – 70 N = 5 N. The net force is forward, so the car is speeding up.

22. C.

The force which accelerates the car must be a force of some agent acting on the car, so that fact narrows the choices to C and D. The acceleration is horizontal, so the net force must be horizontal, therefore C is correct. The car exerts a force on the road, so that (third law) the road exerts a force on the car.

23. B.

The gravitational force acts on the stove, pulling it toward the Earth. The answer is B.

24. D.

The paired force is the gravitational force of the stove on the Earth, that is, arrow D.

25. A.

Forces A and B represent the normal force and gravitational force on the stove. If these were not balanced, the stove would not undergo uniform motion (first law), so A is correct. Choice B is not a true statement. Choice C is not even a correct statement of the second law of motion, which states that the acceleration is proportional to _net_ force. Choice D concerns two forces which act on different objects.

26. D.

Forces A and C are paired. Force A is the upward contact force of ground on the table, and force C is the downward contact force of the table on the ground.

27. C.

There is certainly gravity, and there is an upward force from the road to balance it. There must be another force, because the car has an acceleration vector pointing backwards, hence the frictional force. The correct choice is C. There is no force pushing the car forward. It continues going forward for a while because that is what cars do, by the first law of motion. The force diagram is shown in the solution for problem 3.

28. B.

Gravity acts, of course. What else is touching the arrow? Nothing, so B is correct. (See figure.)

29. B.

The Sun's gravity acts on Mars. What else touches the planet? Nothing, so B is correct. The Sun's gravity changes the course of Mars, which would be a straight line away from the solar system, into the circular orbit. (See figure.)

#### Passage 1

1. D.

Choices A and B are irrelevant, and comparisons, such as those in choice C, are meaningless if the units do not match. The correct choice is D. From the table we can see that equal jumps of time (for example, 0.2 s to 0.4 s) result in equal jumps of velocity (0.1 m/s to 0.2 m/s). This is consistent with the statement that Δ _v_ /Δ _t_ is a constant, or that acceleration is constant.

2. B.

It seems as if acceleration would be a useful quantity to calculate, so let's choose the interval from _t_ = 0.0 to 0.2 s, obtaining _a_ = Δ _v_ /Δ _t_ = (0.1 m/s – 0.0 m/s) / (0.2 s – 0.0 s) = 0.5 m/s2. Now we can look at the interval from _t_ = 0.0 s to 0.9 s. We want to find Δ _x_ , and we have Δ _t_ = 0.9 s, _v_ 1 = 0.0 m/s, and _a_ = 0.5 m/s2. From this we calculate Δ _x_ = 1/2 _a_ (Δ _t_ )2 ≈ 0.20 m.

3. B.

Gravity certainly acts on _m_. The only thing touching mass _m_ is the string, so B is correct. (See figure.)

4. B.

The things touching mass _M_ are the table and the string. It is true that the tension in the string is, in some sense, caused by mass _m_ , but _M_ does not know or care what the other end of the string is connected to. It only cares that there is a force due to a string which is directed to the right.

5. C.

By definition, we have _v_ avg = Δ _x_ /Δ _t_ = (0.09 m – 0.0 m)/(0.06 s – 0.0 s) = 0.15 m/s.

6. C.

Only the table and the string are touching mass _M_ , but the string has no tension in it, so the answer is C.

#### Passage 2

1. A.

We have encountered two ways of calculating acceleration: We can get the acceleration over an interval by calculating _a_ = Δ _v_ /Δ _t_. Or we can obtain acceleration from _a_ = _F_ net/ _M_. Since we do not want acceleration over an interval (like 0 to 90 s) but at an instant ( _t_ = 0 s), we will use the second approach, if possible. We draw a force diagram (see figure). The net force is given by _F_ net = _F_ thrust – _Mg_ = 2.86 X 107 N – (2.0 X 106 kg) (10 m/s2) = 8.6 X 106 N. Thus we obtain acceleration _a_ = _F_ net/ _M_ = 4.3 m/s2.

2. A.

The passage states that 3400 kg of fuel are burned each second, and that this rate is fairly constant. The remaining mass after 300 s is 2.0 x 106 kg – (300 s) (3400 kg/s) = 1.0 x 106 kg.

3. C.

Choice A is not even a true statement. Choice B is a true statement, but _v_ increasing with time indicates only that the ship is speeding up, hence having positive acceleration. The ratio of Δ _v_ to Δ _t_ is the acceleration, so if this ratio is increasing, the acceleration is increasing. Choice C is correct. The ratio Δ _x_ to Δ _v_ does not have any obvious meaning.

4. C.

According to the passage, the mass of the ship decreases as it burns its fuel. In addition, there is reason to assume the force is constant, since the rate of fuel burning is approximately constant. The connection of force, mass, and acceleration is _a_ = _F_ net/ _M_ , so if _M_ decreases, then _a_ increases. Thus C is correct.

5. B.

In order for the shuttle to accelerate, there must be a force on it by some agent. The third-law-pair force must be a force of the shuttle on that agent. This narrows the choices to A and C. Since there is little air in space, A is ruled out. The shuttle pushes off from the exhaust, and that is what creates the force which accelerates it forward, according to the third law of motion. (See figure.)

## Chapter 4 Solutions

1. B.

The fact that the stars revolve about their combined center of mass is irrelevant for calculating the force of gravity between them. That depends only on their masses and the distance between their centers. Since we have _F_ grav = G _m_ 1 _m_ 2/ _d_ 2, if one of the masses decreases by a factor of 2, then _F_ grav decreases by a factor of 2.

2. A.

The factor of _d_ 2 in the denominator indicates that if _d_ increases by a factor of 2, then _F_ grav decreases by a factor of 22 = 4.

3. B.

If _m_ 1 decreases by a factor of 2, and _m_ 2 increases by a factor of 5, then _F_ grav changes by a factor of 5/2.

4. B.

I hope this one did not fool you. The mass of an object does not change just because you transport it somewhere.

5. A.

Objects in free fall on the Moon have a constant acceleration due to gravity 1.6 m/s2 for the same reason that free-fall objects have _a_ = 9.8 m/s2 here on Earth. This comes from setting _F_ net = _ma_ equal to _F_ grav = _mg_ , so that _a_ = _g_. In this case, we have

_a_ = –1.6 m/s2

_v_ 1 = 0 m/s

Δ _y_ = –2 m

Δ _t_ = ?

Δ _y_ = _v_ 1Δ _t_ \+ 1/2 _a_ Δ _t_ 2

–2 m = 1/2 (–1.6 m/s2)Δ _t_ 2

Δ _t_ 2 = 2.5 s2

We only need to work as far as Δ _t_ 2 in order to eliminate choices B, C, and D.

6. C.

The weight of the block on the Moon is an exact analogy to its weight on Earth: _F_ grav = _mg_ Moon = 20 N.

7. D.

On Earth (or on any planetary body), we get the acceleration due to gravity on the surface by assuming that gravity is the only force acting on an object. So we set _F_ net = _ma_ equal to _F_ grav = _Gm_ planet _m_ / _r_ 2, where _r_ is the radius of the planet:

See Example 2 in Section A. Now if the radius of the planet were multiplied by 0.5, then the acceleration due to gravity would be _divided_ by (0.5)2, giving us 40 m/s2. (We expect an increase, since the acceleration increases if radius decreases.) But the mass of Mars is 0.1 of Earth's mass, so a factor of 0.1 in the numerator brings the acceleration down to 4 m/s2.

8. A.

This time the relevant equation is

where _d_ is the distance from the Sun to that planet. The mass of Mars is 0.1 times that of Earth, so that is a factor of 0.1. Another factor comes from the distance from the Sun to Mars, which is 1.5 times greater, so we _divide_ by (1.5)2, yielding about 0.04.

9. D.

The equation we need for this problem and the next is

where _d_ is the distance between the Earth and the Moon. If _d_ decreases by a factor of 3, then _F_ grav increases by a factor of 32 = 9.

10. A.

The Earth's gravitational pull on the Moon is the same as the Moon's on the Earth. That's the third law of motion. (Why does the Moon in its orbit move so much more than the Earth, then?)

11. C.

In problem 7, we worked out the surface acceleration due to gravity of a planet. Since we are looking for radius, we can solve for it, so we have

If the new planet has the same mass as Earth, but a larger acceleration due to gravity, then the radius must be smaller. And if _a_ changes by a factor of  , then _r_ changes by a factor of 3, so the answer is B. (We don't need to know   to figure out which choice is right.)

12. B.

We want to relate acceleration and time, so we want an equation that involves these quantities. (We have seen enough of these problems to realize _v_ 1 = 0.) We can use

If _g_ increases by a factor of 3, then Δ _t_ decreases by a factor of  .

13. A.

Since weight is the force of gravity on an object, and there are no massive planetary bodies around, the weight is zero.

14. B.

The acceleration is _a_ = (0 m/s – 0.5 m/s)/(4 s) = –0.125 m/s2. (This was a review question.)

15. B.

Once we have the acceleration, we can calculate a mass _m_ = _F_ / _a_ = (0.08 N)/(0.125 m/s2) = 0.64 kg.

16. A.

Certainly there is the force of gravity, down. There is nothing else touching the can opener, so gravity is the only force. Since there is no horizontal force, there is constant horizontal motion. But horizontal motion _does not_ imply a horizontal force (see the first law of motion).

17. B.

Since we have a force diagram, we next need to inventory the information relevant to the vertical motion. We have _a_ y = –10 m/s2 and Δ _t_ = 2 s. Because the opener is traveling _horizontally_ when it leaves Barbara's hand, we have _v_ 1y = 0 m/s. Since we want to know Δ _y_ , we use the equation Δ _y_ = _v_ 1yΔ _t_ \+ 1/2 _a_ y (Δ _t_ )2 = 20 m.

18. A.

Since we are looking for Δ _x_ , we now inventory the horizontal information. We have _a_ x = 0 m/s2 and _v_ 1x = 1.5 m/s. Thus we have Δ _x_ = _v_ 1xΔ _t_ \+ 1/2 _a_ x (Δ _t_ )2 = 3 m.

19. C.

The problem asks for _v_ 2y, so we write _v_ 2y = _v_ 1y \+ _a_ yΔ _t_ = –20 m/s. Since only positive choices are listed, we choose the magnitude 20 m/s.

20. B.

We can calculate _v_ 2x = _v_ 1x \+ _a_ xΔ _t_ = 1.5 m/s. Of course, we don't really have to do a calculation, since we know that the horizontal velocity is constant as long as there are no horizontal forces on the opener.

21. B.

As the ball just leaves the table, it is going 1.5 m/s horizontally, so _v_ 1x = 1.5 m/s.

22. A.

Since the initial velocity is horizontal, we have _v_ 1y = 0 m/s.

23. A.

We draw a diagram including all the forces (see figure). Since nothing is touching the ball, gravity is the only force. Thus _F_ grav = _mg_ = (0.2 kg) (10 m/s2) = 2 N.

24. C.

Since the ball simply drops the height of the table, we have Δ _y_ = –1.25 m (choosing "up" to be positive).

25. B.

For horizontal information, we have _a_ x = 0 m/s2 and _v_ 1x = 1.5 m/s, which is not enough to obtain Δ _t_. For vertical information, we have

Δ _y_ = –1.25 m

_a_ y = –10 m/s2

_v_ 1y = 0 m/s

We can calculate

Δ _y_ = _v_ 1yΔ _t_ \+ 1/2 _a_ yΔ _t_ 2

Δ _t_ 2 = 2Δ _y_ / _a_ y

Δ _t_ 2 = 0.25 s2

We do not really need to take the square root to figure out the answer. If choice A is right, then (Δ _t_ )2 = (0.26 s)2 ≈ 0.12 s2 (wrong). If choice B is right, then (Δ _t_ )2 = (0.5 s)2 = 0.25 s2. (Do not feel the need to work every arithmetic problem to its end.)

26. A.

There is no horizontal force on the ball.

27. A.

We want Δ _x_. Since we now have Δ _t_ , we have enough information to calculate

Δ _x_ = _v_ 1xΔ _t_ \+ 1/2 _a_ xΔ _t_ 2

Δ _x_ = 0.76 m

28. A.

Since gravitational force is given by _F_ grav = _mg_ , and since Barbara's coins have four times the mass of Alice's coins, the force on them is four times as large.

29. B.

The acceleration of Alice's coins is a constant 9.8 m/s2 down, as is the acceleration of Barbara's.

30. B.

The vertical acceleration _a_ y is the same for both coins, and the initial vertical velocity _v_ 1y is the same for both coins. The vertical displacement for the fall is certainly the same, so in the equation Δ _y_ = _v_ 1yΔ _t_ \+ 1/2 _a_ y (Δ _t_ )2, all the parameters are the same. This question combines the two ideas in this chapter, namely, for _freely falling bodies_ near the surface of the Earth the vertical acceleration is 9.8 m/s2 down, and for _all bodies_ vertical motion is independent of horizontal motion.

31. A.

Both coins have the same vertical velocity. In addition, Barbara's coins retain their horizontal velocity.

32. C.

First, let's draw a diagram showing all the forces on the wagon body.

The handle and the ground are touching the wagon, so we include the tension force of the handle _T_ and the upward force of the ground _N_. The problem mentions friction, so we include that as well. There are four forces on the wagon. We can redraw the force of the handle as the sum of two components, as shown in the second figure.

We calculate _T_ x as follows:

_T_ x/ _T_ = cos 30°

_T_ x = _T_ cos 30°

33. B.

We calculate _T_ y as follows:

_T_ y/ _T_ = sin 30°

_T_ y = _T_ sin 30°

34. A.

The gravitational force is vertical, so its horizontal component is zero.

35. D.

The vertical component of the gravitational force is the magnitude of the force, which is _F_ grav = _mg_.

36. A.

We don't have enough information to add up the force vectors, but we don't need to. The problem states the wagon is nonaccelerating (velocity is a constant 2 m/s), so _a_ = 0 m/s2 and _F_ net = 0 N.

37. C.

Gravity is acting on the bale, of course. The rope exerts a tension force. The force diagram is shown. Note that the bale is _not_ in free fall.

38. B.

If "up" is positive, then the net force is given by _F_ net = 4000 N – (500 kg) (10 m/s2) = –1000 N. We have used a negative sign for gravity since it points down.

39. B.

We can calculate the acceleration _a_ = _F_ net/ _m_ = 1000 N/500 kg = 2 m/s2.

40. C.

On Earth, the hammer lands first because of air resistance, but if there is no air, then they have the same acceleration (about 1.6 m/s2). Concerning choice D, of course they do not fly off, but they move along with the Moon in the same way that the grapefruit moves along with the ship. See the example in the text. This is the same way that a passenger moves along with a swiftly moving train.

41. B.

There is the force of gravity, down, and the normal force, up. The only thing touching the ball is the floor, which can cause only a normal force and possibly a frictional force. Since the problem states there is no friction, choice B is correct. Concerning choice C, there is nothing pushing the ball to the right, since it simply retains its initial motion. Choice D adds in a leftward force, presumably of friction, which the problem says is not there.

42. D.

If, as the problem states, the ball is going to the right at 0.3 m/s at time _t_ = 0 s, then without any horizontal forces, it will continue to go 0.3 m/s forever. The problem is idealized, but without any information about a horizontal force, there is no way to calculate a horizontal acceleration or a horizontal change in velocity.

#### Passage 1

1. D.

For the student running along the roof, he starts from rest ( _v_ 1 = 0 m/s) and ends up running _v_ 2 = 5 m/s. We have Δ _x_ = 5 m, and we want Δ _t_. We use Δ _x_ = 1/2 ( _v_ 1 \+ _v_ 2)Δ _t_ to obtain Δ _t_ = 2 s.

2. B.

The acceleration on the roof is one problem; the falling is another. For Δ _t_ , we need the vertical information:

Δ _y_ = –7.2 m

_a_ y = –10 m/s2

_v_ 1y = 0 m/s

Δ _t_ = ?

We use the equation

Δ _y_ = _v_ 1yΔ _t_ \+ 1/2 _a_ yΔ _t_ 2

to obtain (Δ _t_ )2 = 1.44 s2. We can eliminate choice A, and choice C is too large, so B is right.

3. B.

We know gravity pulls down and the roof pushes up, and these forces add to zero. In addition, there must be a force accelerating the student forward (to the right). Surprisingly, it is the roof which exerts the force forward. His feet push backwards on the roof, and the roof (by the third law of motion) pushes forward on him.

4. A.

We know gravity pulls down. Since nothing else touches the student, there is no other force.

5. D.

Since the student's fall takes Δ _t_ = 1.2 s, the horizontal displacement is Δ _x_ = _v_ 1xΔ _t_ \+ 1/2 _a_ x(Δ _t_ )2 = 6 m.

6. B.

All during the fall the student has the same horizontal velocity 5 m/s.

#### Passage 2

1. A.

We estimate density as follows:

Here we have estimated _π_ = 3. Next we estimate 1.43 = 1.4 _·_ 1.4 _·_ 1.4 = 2 _·_ 1.4 = 3, so we have

The arithmetic is spelled out so that you can see how you can do a lot of fast estimating and still get a reasonable answer. Even on questions which involve much less arithmetic, you should always be looking for shortcuts.

2. C.

The acceleration due to gravity is given by

where _M_ is the mass of the body, and _r_ is the radius. The passage states that _M_ for a neutron star is the same as _M_ for the Sun, but _r_ is 50,000 times smaller. That means _a_ g is greater by a factor of (50,000)2.

3. A.

The force due to gravity is

where _G_ is the gravitational constant. Considering the two situations in the problem, we know the mass of the neutron star is the same as the mass of the Sun. The mass of the two planets is the same. The distance _d_ is the same for the two situations. The force of gravity does not depend on the size of the bodies but on the distance from center to center.

4. B.

Choice A is not relevant to the things which happen 2000 km away from the neutron star. Concerning choices C and D, the surface gravity of the neutron star is also irrelevant. Choice B correctly states that the force of gravity between near things is greater than between far things. This difference is enough to pull a body apart.

## Chapter 5 Solutions

1. C.

The force diagram should include gravity, pointing down. Nothing else is touching the orange, except the problem mentions that wind exerts a horizontal force, so we add that. The force diagram is shown.

2. C.

The only vertical force is due to gravity, so _F_ y = _F_ grav = _mg_ = 30 N.

3. C.

At the top of the orange's path we have _v_ 2y = 0 m/s. Since this is vertical information, let's see what other vertical information we have. We have _a_ y = –10 m/s2 and _v_ 1y = 5 m/s. We want Δ _t_ , so we write _v_ 2y = _v_ 1y \+ _a_ yΔ _t_ and obtain Δ _t_ = 0.5 s.

4. B.

We want _a_ x. The horizontal information we have is _v_ 1x = 0 and _F_ x = 6 N. We don't have enough information for the equations of Chapter 2, but we can use _a_ x = _F_ x/ _m_ = (6 N)/(3 kg) = 2 m/s2.

5. B.

Since we know _a_ x, _v_ 1x, and Δ _t_ , we can find _v_ 2x = _v_ 1x \+ _a_ xΔ _t_ = 0 + (2 m/s2)(0.5 s) = 1 m/s.

6. B.

First we draw a force diagram. This problem has those key words "at constant velocity", which means there is a force balance on the shoe. The horizontal forces are equal in magnitude so that their vector sum is zero, so B is correct. If you chose C, then go back and read the section on the first law of motion.

7. C.

First we draw a force diagram (see figure). In addition to gravity, we have two forces, normal and tension, due to two things touching the crate. There is no friction. The gravitational force vector can be separated into two components (see figure).

From trigonometry we know

This gives us choice C.

8. B.

We get this from the same diagrams shown in the solution for 7.

9. C.

If we take the sum of all the perpendicular forces (in the text we called them "vertical"), we obtain _N_ – _G_ = ( _F_ net)y. The negative sign denotes the "downward" direction of _G_. But the crate is moving at a constant velocity, which tells us that the acceleration is zero, and the net force is zero. Thus _N_ – _G_ = 0, giving choice C.

10. A.

As we noted, the net force is zero because of the information we have on the acceleration.

11. B.

This time we take the sum of parallel forces ("horizontal"), and we obtain _T_ – _G_ || = ( _F_ net)x = 0. Again, we know the horizontal component of the net force is zero because the crate is moving at constant velocity. Thus the answer is B.

12. B.

There are two things touching the sled: the ground and the stick. So, in addition to gravity pointing down, we draw the normal force pointing up and the force due to the stick pointing down/right. There is no friction (which would act to the left). So B is the correct answer (see figure).

13. A.

We use the following diagram to obtain the vertical component of the stick's force.

Using trigonometry, we obtain

14. B.

Using the same diagram as in solution 13, we obtain _F_ y/ _F_ stick = cos30°, and _F_ y = 17 N.

15. D.

In order to obtain the normal force, we need to consider all the vertical forces. We can obtain the vertical component of the net force by looking at the force diagram, so we write

( _F_ net)y = _N_ – _mg_ – _F_ y

Here we have used _F_ grav = _mg_ and have chosen "up" to be positive. But we know that the sled is not moving up or down, so the vertical acceleration _a_ y is zero. And from second law of motion, we know that ( _F_ net)y = _ma_ y = 0. The above equation becomes

0 = _N_ – _mg_ – _F_ y

_N_ = _mg_ \+ _F_ y

= (5 kg)(10 m/s2) + 17 N

= 67 N

16. B.

In the last problem, we talked about the vertical component of the net force being zero. We can tell from the force diagram that there is a net force, however, and this net force is the horizontal component _F_ x.

17. C.

The acceleration of the sled is given by _a_ x = ( _F_ net)x/ _m_ = 2.0 m/s2

18. D.

The books are following a straight path. By turning the wheel, the driver pulls her car door into the path of the books, giving the impression that the books have a force on them.

19. B.

The direction of the velocity vector is always changing but not its magnitude. At the moment shown in the diagram, the velocity vector is pointing in the direction of the stopper's motion, that is, B.

20. A.

The tangential acceleration is zero, since the speed is constant. However, because the stopper is moving in a circle, the velocity vector is changing direction, and the acceleration vector points toward the center of the circle.

21. A.

Since the acceleration vector   points toward the center, we can conclude that the net force   points toward the center as well.

22. B.

The centripetal force is provided by the string, which is a force of tension.

23. B.

If the string were to break, then there would no longer be a force to affect the velocity vector. The velocity vector would be constant (first law of motion), so B is correct.

24. A.

Because the car moves in a circle, we know there is a centripetal acceleration and a centripetal force. This narrows the choices to A and C. There is no reason to assume there is a force acting forward on the car, especially since the tangential acceleration is zero (because of the car's constant speed). Hence A is correct. If you chose C, perhaps you were thinking that motion in the forward direction implies there must be a force in the forward direction. Not so.

25. C.

The acceleration is given by _a_ cent = _v_ 2/ _r_ = (3 m/s)2/(4 m) = 2.25 m/s2.

26. C.

Once we know the acceleration of the car, we necessarily know the net force on the car: _F_ net = _ma_ = (1200 kg)(2.25 m/s2) = 2700 N.

27. C.

To see that the centripetal force is due to friction, consider what would happen if there were no friction between the tires and the road. The car would simply slide straight forward into the other lane.

28. A.

Gravity and the normal force add to zero. We know there is a net force toward the center of the wheel, because the beetle is moving in a circle, so this narrows our choices to A and C. Choice C includes a force in the forward direction, but since the wheel is rotating at constant speed, there is no tangential acceleration and no reason to assume there is a tangential force.

29. C.

The acceleration can be calculated _a_ = _v_ 2/ _r_ = (2 m/s)2/(0.5 m) = 8 m/s2.

30. B.

Once there is no longer a centripetal force, there is no longer a centripetal acceleration. According to the first law of motion, the velocity vector would be constant.

31. B.

We draw a diagram, including the three forces on the crate. We choose "horizontal" and "vertical" to be parallel and perpendicular to the surface, respectively, and we divide gravity into components (see figure).

Since the normal force is "vertical", let us consider the vertical component of _F_ net = _a_. From the diagram we obtain

( _F_ net)y = _N_ – _Mg_ cos _α_

But we know that _a_ y = 0, because the crate is not moving up or down. This implies ( _F_ net)y = 0, and we have

0 = _N_ – _Mg_ cos _α_

_N_ = _Mg_ cos _α_

32. D.

If we consider the "horizontal" component of _F_ net = _Ma_ , then we can obtain from the diagram

( _F_ net)x = _T_ – _Mg_ sin _α_

where we have taken the positive direction to be up the incline. The acceleration is

33. A.

The force inward is due to friction between the runner's shoes and the track. It may seem surprising that there is not a force forward, since the runner is actively running. There is a horizontal acceleration, and thus net force, only at the beginning of the race when the runner is accelerating. When she is going at a constant speed, she expends effort pushing down with the foot in contact with the track and moving it back fast enough.

34. C.

The net force is given by _F_ net = _ma_ , and the only acceleration is centripetal, so we have _a_ = _a_ cent = _v_ 2/ _r_.

35. B.

The frequency is the number of revolutions per unit of time. Each revolution represents a trip of length 2 _πR_. So the velocity is the total distance per time, that is, _v_ = 2 _πRf_. If _f_ is doubled, then _v_ is doubled.

36. C.

On the other hand the centripetal acceleration is _a_ cent = _v_ 2/ _r_ , so _a_ cent is increased by a factor of 4.

37. B.

The person experiences a centripetal acceleration because he is moving in a circle, and he experiences a tangential acceleration because he is speeding up.

The tangential acceleration is in the same direction he is going. It would point the opposite way if he were slowing down. Adding the two vectors together gives the result B (see figure).

38. A.

In one second the centrifuge sample undergoes 50 revolutions, and each revolution is the circumference 2 _πr_ = 2 _π_ (0.1 m). Thus in one second the sample travels 50 (0.2π m), giving a velocity 10π m/s.

39. B.

If there is no gravity, then there is no net force, and Jupiter follows a straight line at constant speed, maintaining the same velocity vector as it had when the gravity was cut off.

#### Passage

1. B.

Each day the man travels a distance given by the circumference of the Earth _C_ = 2 _πR_ Earth.

2. C.

In order to calculate the centripetal force _F_ cent = _ma_ cent, we need the mass of the man and the centripetal acceleration. We can find the centripetal acceleration _a_ cent = _v_ 2/ _R_ Earth if we know his velocity and the radius of the Earth. It seems that D is the correct answer. The problem with choice D is that we can calculate the velocity once we know the period and radius (as in the previous problem).

3. D.

Since the man is traveling in a circle at constant speed, his acceleration vector points toward the center of rotation, and so does the net force vector. For this to be so, the magnitude of the gravitational force must be greater than the magnitude of the force of the ground.

4. A.

The gravitational force for the two men is the same. Since the scale reading on a rotating Earth is less than the gravitational force, the correct answer is A.

5. C.

According to Newton's law of gravitation, if the distance in the denominator is less, then the gravitational force is greater.

## Chapter 6 Solutions

1. B.

We draw a diagram with all the forces. The two things touching the block are the ground, which contributes the normal force and friction, and the rope, which contributes tension. We also include gravity. We can read the horizontal component of the tension from the diagram.

2. D.

Since the normal force is vertical, we add all the vertical forces to obtain ( _F_ net)y, so that

( _F_ net)y = _N_ \+ _T_ y – _mg_

But ( _F_ net)y is _ma_ y, and the vertical acceleration is zero because the block is not changing its velocity up and down. Thus ( _F_ net)y = 0, and

0 = _N_ \+ _T_ y – _mg_

_N_ = _mg_ – _T_ y

= _mg_ – _T_ sin _α_

3. C.

Our first thought for this question is the definition, _F_ fr = _μ_ k _N_ , but none of the answers corresponds to this, since _N_ is not _mg_. Choices C and D mention the tension _T_ , so let's look at the force diagram again. The problem states that the block's velocity is constant, implying _a_ x = 0. Thus we must have ( _F_ net)x = 0.

We can also get an expression for ( _F_ net)x from the diagram:

( _F_ net)y = _T_ x – _F_ fr

0 = _T_ x – _F_ fr

_F_ fr = _T_ x = _T_ cos _α_

4. B.

Since the surfaces are not slipping, the friction is static friction.

5. C.

We draw a diagram showing all the forces.

Since only the steel is touching the copper block, the only forces besides gravity are the normal force and friction. We choose axes which are tilted compared to the level ground, and divide the gravitational force into two components. In order to find the normal force, we look at the "vertical" forces, so we write

( _F_ net)y = _N_ – _G_ y

But ( _F_ net)y is zero, since _a_ y is zero. So we have

0 = _N_ – _G_ y

_N_ = _G_ y

= _mg_ cos30°

= (2 kg)(10 m/s2)(0.87)

= 17 N

We do not really need to do the last few calculations. Since we know cos30° is somewhat less than 1, we know that the normal force is somewhat less than _mg_ = 20 N.

6. A.

Since the block is not moving, it is not accelerating, and _F_ net = 0.

7. B.

Since there is force balance on the block, we must have ( _F_ net)x = 0. But from the diagram we know that ( _F_ net)x = _F_ fr – _G_ x, so that we have

0 = ( _F_ net)x

= _F_ fr – _G_ x

_F_ fr = _G_ x

= _mg_ sin30°

= (2 kg)(10 m/s2)(1/2)

= 10 N

8. A.

By definition, we have _μ_ = _F_ fr/ _N_ = (10 N)/(17 N) = 0.58.

9. B.

First we draw a diagram with all the forces.

The wall and the pencil touch the card. The problem states that the pencil exerts a horizontal force (see diagram), and the wall exerts a normal force and a frictional force. The normal force is perpendicular to the surface and the frictional force parallel to it, even if the surface is vertical. The gravitational force is simply _F_ grav = _mg_ = (0.004 kg) (10 m/s2) = 0.04 N.

10. D.

Since we are assuming the card is not moving, the acceleration _a_ x is zero, and we have ( _F_ net)x = 0. But ( _F_ net)x = _F_ pencil – _N_ , so the normal force is equal in magnitude to _F_ pencil, which is given in the problem.

11. B.

Force balance allows us to conclude that the frictional force is equal to the gravitational force (as in question 10).

12. A.

The friction in this problem is static friction. We know this friction must be less than the quantity _μ_ s _N_ in order for the friction to be sufficient to keep the surfaces from slipping. Since we have _μ_ s _N_ = (0.2) (0.4 N) = 0.08 N, and _F_ fr is less than this, there is no slipping.

13. D.

First we draw a diagram including all the forces.

The man is pushing to the right, and the ground exerts a normal force and a frictional force. Since the washer is not moving, its acceleration is zero, and we have force balance. From the diagram we can see that the normal force and the gravitational force add to zero, so their magnitudes must be equal. Thus we have _N_ = _F_ grav = 1000 N.

14. B.

Force balance tells us that the man's force and the frictional force are equal in magnitude, so _F_ fr = 700 N. Did you calculate _F_ fr = _μ_ s _N_ = 800 N? Remember, this is the calculation for the _maximum_ static friction. The actual static friction force can have any magnitude from zero up to this maximum.

15. C.

The man would have to exert a force in excess of the maximum possible friction, that is,

( _F_ stat)max = _μ_ s _N_  
= (0.8)(1000 N)  
= 800 N.

16. B.

We have gravity, pointing down. The road exerts a force normal to its surface. Also, there is a force of friction. Since the car is going uphill with its brakes applied and tires skidding, the kinetic friction force is parallel to the surface and downhill. The force diagram is shown.

Did you choose D? If so, go back and read about the first law of motion. Meditate on it for about fifteen minutes.

17. C.

The components of gravity are shown in the diagram below.

We calculate _G_ x as follows:

_G_ x/ _G_ = sin _θ_  
 _G_ x = _G_ sin _θ_  
 _G_ x = _mg_ sin _θ_

18. B.

We can obtain the net vertical force from the diagram, so we have

( _F_ net)y = _N_ – _G_ y

But the car is not moving up or down, so _a_ y = 0 and ( _F_ net)y = 0, so we have

0 = _N_ – _G_ y,  
 _N_ = _G_ y  
= _G_ cos _θ_  
= _mg_ sin _θ_.

19. C.

We cannot obtain the force of friction from the force diagram because we do not have a force balance and do not have any information about the acceleration. But we can calculate _F_ k = _μ_ k _N_.

20. C.

The net force is the same as the sum of all the horizontal components of the forces, so

( _F_ net)x = _F_ fr \+ _G_ x

= _μ_ k _N_ \+ _mg_ sin _θ_

where we have taken "downhill" to be positive.

21. A.

Because the car is turning at constant speed, we know the net force points toward the center of the turn. There is no force in the direction the car is going because the car is neither speeding up nor slowing down. The force diagram is shown, in which we view the car from the rear and the turn is to the left.

22. C.

Friction supplies the centripetal force. (The turn would be impossible if the surface were frictionless.) Since the tires are not slipping on the road, the appropriate friction is static.

23. C.

The acceleration is centripetal acceleration given by _a_ cent = _v_ 2/ _r_ = (8 m/s)2/10 m = 6.4 m/s2.

24. D.

From the force diagram we can see that the normal force and gravity balance, so that _N_ = 10,000 N.

25. A.

If we know the acceleration, we can calculate the net force _F_ net = _ma_ = 6400 N.

26. A.

Remember that the expression _μ_ s _N_ gives the maximum force of static friction. If any more friction is required by a situation, then surfaces begin to slip. In this case, this would mean the car goes into a skid. But _μ_ s _N_ = (0.9) (10,000 N) = 9000 N, which is large enough. Thus the car will not go into a skid.

#### Passage 1

1. A.

We draw a force diagram including the force of gravity.

The only thing touching the rider once the floor drops is the side of the drum, which exerts a normal force that ends up being toward the axis of rotation. It also exerts a frictional force, which is up (balancing gravity). For uniform circular motion, we know the net force must be toward the center of rotation, so we can see that this force diagram is complete.

2. A.

From the diagram we can see that the normal force provides the centripetal force.

3. A.

Because the motion is uniform circular rotation, the acceleration vector points toward the center of rotation.

4. C.

The rider traverses the circumference of the circle (2 _πR_ ) during each period of time _T_. Thus his speed is 2 _πR_ / _T_.

5. A.

The upward force must balance the gravitational force, so the magnitude of the upward force must be _Mg_ as well.

6. D.

The force of friction (which is the upward force in the previous question) must be less than the maximum possible static friction ( _F_ s)max = _μ_ s _N_ :

_Mg_ < _μ_ s _N_

But _N_ is the centripetal force, so we substitute _N_ = _Mv_ 2/ _R_ to obtain

Dividing both sides by _M_ and multiplying by _R_ / _v_ 2 gives

Translating this into words gives choice D.

#### Passage 2

1. B.

According to the passage, equation (1) is valid as long as the Reynolds number is greater than about 100, so, using equation (2), we have

2. B.

The diagram shows the car, modeled by a block shape.

The arrow shows the direction the car would go, so the shaded face is the cross section we are interested in. The area is _A_ = (1.5 m) (2 m) = 3 m2. The length of the car does not matter.

3. A.

We apply equation (1) to obtain

4. D.

For turbulence we need the Reynolds number to be greater than about 2 x 105, so we have

This is just an estimate, so choice D is about right.

5. B.

We apply equation (1) again, so we have _F_ drag = (0.2) (103 kg/m3) (0.01 m2) (2 m/s)2 = 8 N.

6. B.

We draw a force diagram for the drop at terminal velocity.

The two forces are equal in magnitude, so we can write

Let's compare this terminal velocity for the two situations, on Earth and on Venus. The question states that _M_ , the mass of the drop is the same, _g_ is the same, _A_ is the same, and _C_ is a constant. The density of the respective atmospheres is different, however. Looking at the choices, we exclude I. The density of the atmosphere depends on temperature and pressure, so choice B is correct.

#### Passage 3

1. A.

If there is no air, then the only force is the force of gravity:

( _F_ net)y = _F_ grav

But the force of gravity is _mg_ , and the acceleration is given by

_ma_ y = _mg_

_a_ y = _g_

So, if we call "up" positive, then _a_ y = –10 m/s2, and _v_ 1y = 3 m/s. Also, to obtain the height, we write

2. B.

We calculate the drag _F_ drag = (0.2) (1.3 kg/m3) (μ(0.03 m)2) (3 m/s)2 = 7 x 10–3 N.

3. C.

According to the passage, the air resistance must be small compared to the other forces in the situation, but this is just the force of gravity.

4. A.

As the ball travels away from the center of the Earth, the force of gravity decreases slightly, since

_F_ grav = _Gm_ 1 _m_ 2/ _r_ 2

5. A.

If air resistance is included, there is an initial force down while the ball is going up, so the maximum height is less. The ball loses energy to air resistance, so its speed just before hitting the ground will be less than in the idealized problem.

6. C.

Even if the density of air changed appreciably (it does not), it would not help cats survive a greater fall. This holds for choice B as well. Regarding choice C, if cats stretch their legs, then this increases their cross-sectional area, which would decrease their terminal velocity, so is a viable possibility for an answer. Regarding D, the statement is true, but the fact would not help a cat to have a lesser terminal velocity from a greater fall.

## Chapter 7 Solutions

1. A.

We consider the fixed point to be the origin, and we add the angles _φ_ A and _φ_ B to the diagram of the meter stick (see figure).

For force _A_ , the value of _φ_ is 90°. Thus torque is

τ = _rF_ sin _φ_  
= (0.5 m)(10 N) sin90°  
= 5 Nm.

The torque is clockwise, so the sign is negative.

2. B.

For force _B_ , the value of _φ_ is 150°, but when we calculate torques we can always use the smaller angle 30° (see figure). The torque is

τ = _rF_ sin _φ_  
= (1.0 m)(5 N) sin30°  
= 2.5 Nm.

The torque is counterclockwise, so the sign is positive.

3. B.

For force _C_ , the angle _φ_ is 0°, so sin _φ_ = 0, and the torque is zero. We can see this from the diagram, in which force _C_ does not tend to produce any rotation about the fixed point.

4. A.

The radius vector is shown in the diagram.

We calculate torque

τ = _rF_ sin _φ_  
= (0.4 m)(20 N)1  
= 8 Nm.

The torque is clockwise, so its sign is negative.

5. C.

There are two ways to calculate the torque of force _B_ about the pivot (see diagram).

The more difficult way leaves _B_ in the lower right corner. In the easier way we can move _B_. Since _B_ points down, we can slide it directly up (maintaining its direction) to the upper right corner. Now we have _r_ = 0.3 m and sin _φ_ = 1, so that _τ_ = (0.3) (10 N) = 3 Nm. The sign is negative because the torque is clockwise.

6. B.

The torque is zero since sin _φ_ is zero. Another way to see this is to note that force C would slide right through the pivot, so its torque must be zero. (See figure.)

7. A.

We draw a diagram (see figure) showing the forces on the meter stick.

The net torque on the meter stick about the fulcrum must be zero. Since the torque due to the force of the fulcrum is zero, we have

_τ_ net = 0  
– _F_ 1 _r_ 1 \+ _F_ 2 _r_ 2 = 0  
–(6 kg)(10 m/s2)(0.2 m) + _m_ 2(10 m/s2)(0.5 m) = 0  
 _m_ 2 = 2.4 kg

8. C.

We draw a diagram (see figure) showing all the forces on the rope. Since the weight of the book acts at point B, the torque is zero (because _r_ = 0 m).

9. A.

The force is perpendicular to the line connecting B and A, so _φ_ = 90°. We have

_τ_ = –(1.5 m)(4 kg _·_ 10 m/s2)1  
= –60 Nm.

10. C.

The tension due to the person pulling the rope acts at the point B, so the torque due to this tension is zero (since _r_ = 0 m).

11. D.

The easiest way to do this problem is to take torques about point A and to apply torque balance. The torque due to the horizontal rope is zero, and we have

_τ_ net = 0  
= –(1.5 m)(40 N) + _τ_ 2,  
 _τ_ 2 = 60 Nm.

This makes sense, because the torque due to the weight of the book about A should be balanced by the torque of the tension _T_ about A.

A more difficult way to do the problem is to calculate _T_ using force balance ( _F_ net)y = 0 and obtaining _T_ = 80 N. Then apply the definition of torque.

12. A.

We draw a diagram (see figure) showing all the forces on the seesaw itself.

Since there is a torque balance about the fulcrum, we may write

_F_ 1(2 m) – _F_ 2( _y_ ) = 0,  
(30 kg _·_ 10 m/s2)(2 m) – (40 kg _·_ 10 m/s2)( _y_ ) = 0,  
 _y_ = 1.5 m.

Now _y_ = 1.5 m represents the distance from the fulcrum to Scott's seat. Thus he sits 0.5 m from the end.

13. A.

We draw a diagram showing all the forces on the meter stick (see figure).

If we take torques about the fulcrum, then the fulcrum force will not have a torque. Torque balance becomes

( _m ·_ 10 m/s2)(0.3 m) – (0.6 kg _·_ 10 m/s2)(0.2 m) = 0 _m_ = 0.4 kg

14. D.

We draw a diagram showing all the forces which contribute to torques about the axis of pulley B (see figure).

The torque due to the weight of mass _m_ is

_τ_ = ( _L_ )( _mg_ )1

15. C.

We can take torques about the axis of pulley B. In both cases we have sin _φ_ = 1, and torque balance yields

( _d_ /2)( _Mg_ )1 – ( _L_ )( _mg_ )1 = 0  
 _M_ = 2 _mL_ / _d_

16. C.

We draw a diagram showing all the forces on the forearm (see figure).

The torque due to the weight of mass A is

_τ_ A = (0.4 m)(1.5 kg _·_ 10 m/s2)1  
= 6 Nm.

17. B.

The torque due to the weight of the arm is

_τ_ arm = (0.2 m)(2 kg _·_ 10 m/s2)1  
= 4 Nm.

18. C.

Torque balance about the elbow yields the following equation:

–(0.4 kg)(1.5 kg _·_ 10 m/s2) –  
(0.2 m)(2 kg _·_ 10 m/s2) +  
(0.02 m) _F_ biceps = 0

_F_ biceps = 500 N.

19. C.

We draw a diagram showing all the forces on the two rods (see figure).

We do not know if the forces are to the left or right, but the equation will tell us later on if our choices were right. If we take torques about A, then torques due to _F_ Ax, _F_ Ay, and _F_ By are zero. Torque balance becomes

_dF_ Bxsin90° – _lT_ sin90° = 0,  
 _dF_ Bx – _lT_ = 0,  
 _dF_ Bx – _lmg_ = 0,  
 _F_ Bx = _lmg_ / _d_.

The positive sign tells us that our choice was correct, that is, that _F_ Bx points to the right.

20. A.

If we take torques about B, then torques due to _F_ Ay, _F_ Bx, and _F_ By are zero. We can calculate the torque due to the tension in the wire easily by sliding the force down the string to the point shown in the figure.

The torque is – _lT_ , so that the torque balance is

_–dF_ Axsin90° – _lT_ sin90° = 0,  
 _–dF_ Ax – _lmg_ = 0,  
 _F_ Ax = – _lmg/d_.

The negative sign tells us that the direction of _F_ Ax is to the left.

21. D.

The sum of the vertical forces must be zero, so we have

_F_ Ax \+ _F_ Bx – _mg_ = 0,  
 _F_ Ax \+ _F_ Bx = _mg_.

And this makes sense, because the wall is providing the upward force which adds to the one downward force of gravity of the brick.

22. D.

We draw a diagram showing all the forces on the rod (see figure).

We can use the Pythagorean theorem to obtain the length of the wire. The torque due to the tension in the wire about point A is given by

Thus the ratio _τ_ / _T_ is given by dividing both sides by _T_ , so we have

23. C.

We do not know _F_ x and _F_ y, so we can obtain an equation without them if we take torques about point A. Torque balance becomes

24. C.

If we take torques about point B, then _F_ x and _T_ do not appear in the equation, so torque balance becomes

25. D.

This time we eliminate _F_ y and _T_ from the torque balance by taking torques about point C. The torque due to _F_ x is (1 m) _F_ x, since _φ_ = 90°. We can get the torques due to _F_ 1grav and _F_ 2 grav by sliding the forces upwards, that it, opposite the direction the vectors point (see figure).

Then we can write the torques at sight, and torque balance becomes

26. B.

We draw a diagram with all the forces on the leg (see figure).

If we take torques about point B, we eliminate _F_ body, _T_ , and _m_ 2 _g_ from the torque balance, leaving just _m_ 1 and the mass of the leg, so we write

(0.6 m)(10 kg _·_ 10 m/s2) – (0.9 m)( _m_ 1 _·_ 10 m/s2) = 0 _m_ 1 = 6.67 kg

27. B.

To obtain an equation with just _m_ 1 and _m_ 2, we can take torques about the center of mass of the leg, so torque balance becomes

– (0.3 m)( _m_ 1 _·_ 10 m/s2) + (0.6 m)( _m_ 2 _·_ 10 m/s2) = 0

Dividing by 10 m/s2 and solving yields

–0.3 m + 0.6 _m_ 2 = 0

_m_ 2/ _m_ 1 = 1/2

We could obtain the same result by figuring out _m_ 2 = 3.33 kg with the same method used in the previous problem.

28. C.

The tension exerted by the body must be equal in magnitude to the one other horizontal force, the tension due to the weight of the 8-kg mass. We write

– _F_ body \+ _T_ = 0,  
 _F_ body = _T_  
=(8 kg)(10 m/s2)  
= 80 N.

29. D.

The equation we need is the proportionality between stress ( _F_ / _A_ ) and strain (Δ _l_ / _l_ ). For this problem, we do not need to put the proportionality constant in the right place, but the equation is

If _F, A_ , and _Y_ stay the same, and we increase _l_ by a factor of 3, then Δ _l_ increases by a factor of 3.

30. B.

Stress is defined as

stress = _F_ / _A_

so if _F_ and _A_ stay the same, then the stress does not change.

31. A.

The circumference is _C_ = 2π _r_ , so if the circumference increases by a factor of 4, then the radius increases by a factor of 4. (See discussion in Chapter 1 if this is unclear.) Then the cross-sectional area increases by a factor of 42 = 16. Referring to the equation in solution 29, if area increases by a factor of 16, then Δ _l_ decreases by a factor of 16.

32. A.

The cross-sectional area increases by a factor of 16 (see previous problem), so the stress (force/area) decreases by a factor of 16.

33. A.

Both the length and the area are increased, the length by a factor of 4, and the area by a factor of 16. The equation in solution 29 indicates Δ _l_ decreases by a factor of 4.

34. B.

The torque due to the force on the rod is given by

_τ_ 1 = _rF_ sin90°,  
 _F_ = _τ_ 1/ _r_  
= 4 Nm/0.05 m  
= 80 N.

35. B.

Since nothing is moving, we must have static equilibrium, and therefore torque balance. The figure shows the torques acting on the axle, and since there are two they must be balanced. This implies that _τ_ 2 and _τ_ 1 are equal in magnitude.

#### Passage

1. B.

Don't let the information in the problem distract you from the fact that there must be a force balance on the muscle, since the muscle is not accelerating. Thus the magnitudes of _F_ forearm and _F_ shoulder are the same.

2. C.

Stress, force, and area are related by the equation

_σ_ = _F_ / _A_

The force exerted at the center of the biceps is the same as the force exerted at the forearm (force balance, see previous question), and the area is 100 times smaller. Thus the stress at the forearm is 100 times larger. (You may have done this problem by an intermediate step by calculating that force to be 500 N.)

3. D.

Statue B has 8 times the volume of statue A. Since _m_ = _ρV_ , statue B has 8 times the mass. Since weight _w_ = _mg_ , statue B has 8 times the weight as well.

4. B.

Stress is force/area. The force (weight) increases by a factor of 8, and the area increases by a factor of 4, so the stress increases by a factor of 8/4 = 2. Also, see the last sentence of the fourth paragraph.

5. C.

The passage indicates that the breaking point is related to the threshold stress for the material in the cable. Stress is force per area. Increasing the length does not change the force of the load (the lantern weight) or the cross-sectional area, so the breaking weight would be the same.

## Chapter 8 Solutions

1. A.

The fact that the carts stick together is our clue that this is a conservation-of-momentum problem. Let's draw a diagram (see figure) of the system before and after the collision.

Before the collision, we calculate the total momentum as follows:

_P_ before = (1 kg)(0.2 m/s) + (2 kg)(–0.7 m/s) = –1.2 kgm/s

where the negative sign indicates the momentum vector points left. The question asks only for the magnitude.

2. A.

The external forces, which are gravity and the normal force, are balanced, so momentum is conserved. Thus we can set the momentum before the collision equal to the momentum after the collision, so that

_P_ before = _P_ afeter

–1.2 kgm/s = (3kg) _v_ f

_v_ f = –0.4 m/s

where the negative sign indicates the velocity vector points left.

3. B.

The sticking together provides the clue that this is a conservation-of-momentum problem. We draw a diagram showing the system before and after the collision (see figure).

The total momentum before the collision is given by

_P_ before = (1 kg)(0.5 m/s) + (2 kg)(–0.2 m/s) + (3kg) (–0.4 m/s)

= –1.1 kgm/s

4. A.

The collision of A and B does not affect the momentum of the system, so the answer is the same as the answer for problem 3.

5. B.

In this problem we set the initial momentum equal to the final momentum after all the collisions have occurred, so the final velocity is given by

_P_ before = _P_ afeter

–1.1 kgm/s = (6kg) _v_ f

_v_ f = –0.183 m/s

6. C.

If the track were not level, gravity and the normal force would not be balanced, and there would be a component of gravity accelerating the carts. Thus the momentum of this system would not be conserved. Of course, if the system included the Earth, then the momentum would be conserved, but then there would not be enough information to do the problem.

7. A.

We draw a diagram of the system before and after the explosion (see figure). The momentum before the string is cut is just 0 kg m/s, since neither of the carts is moving. Since the external forces are balanced, the final momentum is also zero.

8. D.

While the string is cut, there are no unbalanced external forces, so we can set the momentum before to the momentum after the cutting, so we write

_P_ before = _P_ afeter

0 = (3kg)(–0.2 m/s) + (3kg) _v_ f

_v_ f = 0.3 m/s

9. B.

Since Michael and Carol stick together, we think this is a problem in conservation of momentum. During the tiny time of their collision, momentum is approximately conserved. (Gravity is an unbalanced force, but it operates in the vertical direction only, and we are ignoring that direction because the change in momentum due to gravity is so small.) Thus we draw a diagram of the system before and after the collision. See figure below.

Before the collision, Michael's momentum is (60 kg) (0.5 m/s) = 30 kg m/s pointing north, and Carol's momentum is (40 kg) (1.0 m/s) = 40 kg m/s pointing west. The total momentum before the collision given by a vector diagram (see figure below).

By the Pythagorean theorem, the magnitude of the momentum is 50 kg m/s pointing in the northwest direction. Since momentum is conserved, this is the same as the momentum after the collision.

10. B.

The final velocity must be _v_ f = _P_ tot/ _m_ tot = (50 kg m/s)/100 kg = 0.5 m/s.

11. A.

Before the collision, the total momentum of the system is 0 kg m/s, since the rifle and bullet are not moving. Momentum is conserved in the explosion, so the total momentum after the explosion is 0 kg m/s, as well. The momenta of the moving rifle and the moving bullet are in opposite directions, so they add to zero.

12. A.

If we draw a diagram,

we can write the conservation-of-momentum equation:

_P_ before = _P_ afeter

0 kgm/s = (0.010 kg)(300 m/s) + (4kg) _v_ recoil

_v_ recoil = –0.75 m/s

13. C.

Since the problem mentions force and time, we think immediately of momentum. The external force of 3 N imparts to cart A the momentum given by

Here we have explicitly worked out the units. Recall that _F_ Δ _t_ gives the change of momentum, but since cart A starts at zero momentum, the momentum of cart A after the force has acted is 6 kg m/s.

14. B.

For the collision, there is no unbalanced external force, and we can apply the equation for conservation of momentum:

_P_ before = _P_ afeter

6 kgm/s = (5 kg + 10 kg) _v_ t

_v_ t = 0.4 m/s

15. D.

Concerning choice A, gravity acts only vertically. Choice B is ambiguous, referring either to the car's force on the road or the road's force on the car. In neither case is there a force on the books pulling them forward — the brakes do not come into it, they don't touch the books — so B is not correct. Concerning choice C, momentum is not a force (it does not even have the same units). A force is a push or pull on an object due to something. So D is correct.

What is going on? If you missed this problem, you need to work on your understanding of the first law of motion. The car and the books are traveling along with forces balanced at the beginning of the problem. When the driver applies the brakes, the wheels push forward on the road. The road pushes backward on the car (third law of motion), and it is the backward force that slows the car. The books, not having a backward force, continue in uniform motion until the seat they are on is pulled out from under them.

16. A.

Since momentum is conserved during the collision, the change in momentum is zero.

17. A.

Let's draw a diagram showing the system of two asteroids before and after the collision (see figure).

The total momentum before the collision must be determined by adding the individual momenta as vectors. This is shown in the momentum diagram (see figure). Thus we obtain the total momentum of the system before the collision to have the magnitude 13 kg m/s (from the Pythagorean theorem).

The final velocity can be determined from momentum conservation:

_P_ before = _P_ afeter

13 kgm/s = (4 kg + 1.25 kg) _v_ t

_v_ t = 2.5 m/s

18. B.

We draw a diagram (see figure).

We do not know which direction cart B is going after the collision, but if we draw the vector going to the right, the equation will tell us in which direction B moves. Momentum is conserved, so we write

_P_ before = _P_ afeter

(1 kg)(7 m/s) + (3 kg)(–3 m/s) =  
(1 kg)(–3 m/s) + (3 kg) _v_ t

_v_ t = 0.33 m/s

19. D.

An impulse is a change in momentum. If the ball is initially going in the positive direction, after the bounce it is going in a negative direction. We calculate Δ _p_ = _p_ 2 – _p_ 1 = (0.3 kg) (7 m/s) – (0.3 kg) (–5 m/s) = 3.6 kg m/s.

20. B.

A force and a time reminds us of momentum. The change in momentum is given by Δ _p_ = _F_ Δ _t_ = 50 kg m/s. Since the object is initially at rest, this must be the magnitude of its final momentum. But when we look at the choices, we realize that we do not know the direction of the force and therefore the direction of the final momentum. Thus B is correct.

21. A.

When the first ball hits the floor, it has a momentum vector pointing down. After the bounce, its momentum vector points up. The impulse imparted by the floor is shown in the first figure. (Recall that _p_ after = _p_ before \+ Δ _p_.)

The second ball hits the floor with the same momentum as the first. After the impact, its momentum vector is zero. The impulse imparted by the floor is shown. From these diagrams, we can see that choice A is correct.

22. B.

We know there is the force of gravity and a force due to the rod, since the rod is the only thing touching it. Therefore A is incorrect (excludes rod) and C is incorrect (includes force from a surface). We need to draw a diagram (see figure) to see if the force due to the rod is tension only or also to the right. Gravity acts downward.

The net force is a centripetal force, since the bob is traveling in a circle at constant speed at the moment the bob is at the bottom. Therefore the force of the pendulum is up. Did you say there was a force to the right? If you did, you have not learned about the first law of motion. Just because an object is moving to the right does not mean there is a force in that direction.

23. C.

Impulse is change in momentum. If the head is initially at rest, and ends up going backwards at the velocity of the fist, then the impulse it receives is given by

Δ _p_ = 0 – ( _m_ head)( _v_ fist)

= – _m_ head _v_ fist.

The impulse is the same in either case, so choices A and B are incorrect. Choice C mentions force and time, so we think to write

Δ _p_ = _F_ Δ _t_.

Riding the punch has the effect of increasing the time of contact with the fist and thus decreasing the magnitude of force of the fist on the face, so choice C is a possibility. Choice D is not relevant. This question is not really a very good one, but it is typical of some of the questions on the MCAT.

24. B.

Clearly the momentum of the apple is not conserved, since it goes from zero velocity to a finite velocity of impact, so A and D are wrong. If we consider the apple and Earth as a system, we can draw the force diagram shown. In this system the force of Earth's gravity on the apple is an _internal_ force (rather that an external one). We have simply defined our system large enough to include all the forces. The momentum of this system is conserved, so B is the answer. This reasoning shows the flaw in choice C: If gravity is an internal force, momentum may be conserved if there are no unbalanced external forces.

#### Passage

1. C.

Both the second and third laws of motion concern unbalanced forces. But the third law of motion states that, if the ship exerts a force on the gas, then the gas exerts an equal and oppositely directed force on the ship, so C is correct.

2. C.

Choice A is a true statement: Neon is not a product of uranium fission, but neither is hydrogen. The passage says that hydrogen is heated and then expelled. This is different from conventional rockets in which the products of the reaction themselves are expelled. Choice B is a true statement but also irrelevant, because the hydrogen does not react chemically in this process either. Concerning choice C, let's think of exhaust velocity. It is related to temperature and molecular mass of the exhaust gas. Since neon is more massive, the exhaust velocity will be less, and the thrust will be less. Choice C is correct.

3. D.

According to the passage, the hydrogen can not be heated fast enough. This would result in a low mass expulsion rate.

4. D.

It helps to visualize this problem if we draw a diagram (see figure).

From the figure we can see that, relative to the ship, the gases are going 5000 m/s.

5. A.

Let's draw a diagram of the system.

We can do this by momentum conservation:

_P_ before = _P_ afeter

0 = (0.1 kg)(–20 m/s) + (10 kg) _v_ t

_v_ t = 0.2 m/s

6. B.

This problem asks about force, and since a time is given in the problem, we immediately think to write

Δ _p_ = _F_ net Δ _t_.

We know how to calculate the impulse Δ _p_ of the ship during the explosion, Δ _p_ = (10 kg)(0.2 m/s) – 0 = 2 kg m/s. Thus _F_ = (2 kg m/s)/0.2 s = 10 N.

## Chapter 9 Solutions

1. C.

The force diagram is shown. The direction of travel is shown by a dashed vector, to distinguish it from forces. We have _W_ rope = (30 N) (10 m) cos 30° = 260 J.

2. A.

The normal force and the direction of travel are perpendicular, so cos _φ_ = 0.

3. B.

The gravitational force and the direction of travel are perpendicular, so cos _φ_ = 0.

4. A.

The words "constant velocity" tell us that the net force is zero. Thus the total work is zero.

5. B.

The friction does negative work on the sled. The only other work is from the rope (question 1), that is, 260 N. Since the total work is 0 J, the friction must do –260 J.

6. B.

The box is not sitting on a surface, so there is no normal force. The man is certainly pushing up. Is he pushing forward? There is no reason to think so, since the box is moving at constant speed in a straight line.

7. A.

The force of the man is perpendicular to the direction of the box's motion, so cos _φ_ = 0. What is going on here? The reason our intuition is poor is that the man does a fair amount of microscopic work inside his striated muscles in order to maintain a force. Such muscles are extremely inefficient. That energy ends up as heat, which radiates from his body.

8. A.

We have _p_ = _mv_ = (4 kg) (3 m/s) = 12 kg m/s.

9. C.

We have _E_ K = 1/2 _mv_ 2 = 1/2 (4 kg) (3 m/s)2 = 18 J.

10. C.

A force diagram is shown, although we do not need it in this case. We deduce there must be a frictional force since the net force is zero. The horse is pulling in the same direction as the direction of travel so cos _φ_ = 1. Also Δ _x_ is _v_ Δ _t_.

11. B.

The gravitational force is perpendicular to the direction of travel, so cos _φ_ = 0.

12. D.

We have _v_ 1, _F_ and Δ _t_ , which do not combine in any way to make energy. If we had the mass of the cart we could obtain the acceleration from _F_ , then the final velocity, and then the energy. If we had the distance traversed, we could use _W_ tot = _F_ Δ _x_. But we do not have those things.

13. B.

Gravity and the normal force are balanced vertical forces. Since the car is slowing down, which is accelerating backwards, there must be a net force backwards, and this is provided by friction (or braking). If you thought there had to be a force pulling it forwards, then you forgot that the car would tend to keep going forward in the absence of any forces (first law of motion). The force diagram is shown below.

14. A.

Change in energy is always final minus initial. Thus we have _E_ K2 – _E_ K1 = 0 J – 1/2 (1000 kg)(20 m/s)2 = – 2 x 105 J.

15. A.

The only force doing work is the road, so the work done by the road is the total work. But this is the same as the change in kinetic energy.

16. D.

In this case the direction of travel is in the opposite direction of the road's force, so cos _φ_ = –1. Thus _W_ = _F_ Δ _x_ cos _φ_ yields 8000 N.

17. C.

This is one of the cases in which the simple statement of the conservation of energy holds. The only force acting on the cat is gravity. (See figure.)

We set

_E_ K1 \+ _E_ P1 = _E_ K2 \+ _E_ P2,  
0 + _mgH_ = _E_ K2 \+ 0,  
 _E_ K2 = (4 kg)(10 m/s2)(3 m)  
= 120 J.

18. C.

Use _E_ K = 1/2 _mv_ 2, but just estimate the square root.

19. C.

As in problem 17, we obtain _E_ K2 = _mgH_. If _H_ were doubled, then _E_ K2 would double.

20. A.

Setting now _E_ K2 to 1/2 _mv_ 2 2, we obtain 1/2 _mv_ 2 2 = _mgH_. Notice that _m_ cancels, and this yields

This looks more complicated than the variable relationships we have seen, but it is not. If _H_ increases by a factor of 2, then   increases by a factor of 2 which is 1.41. But an increase by a factor of 1.41 is the same as increasing by 41%. If this is unclear, think of increasing a number by 41%. That means taking 41% of a number and adding it to the original number. That is the same as multiplying by 1.41.

21. A.

Momentum is always conserved as long as there is no unbalanced external force. The external forces here are gravity and the normal force, which are balanced. The internal forces are the forces that the carts exert on each other. Choices B and D are equivalent, so neither can be the answer. In fact, the collision is not elastic. It is not completely inelastic because the carts do not stick together.

22. A.

Using conservation of momentum gives

_p_ 1 = _p_ 2,  
 _m_ A _v_ 1A \+ _m_ B _v_ 1B = _m_ A _v_ 2A \+ _m_ B _v_ 2B,  
(1 kg)(0.5 m/s) = (2 kg) _v_ 2B,  
 _v_ 2B = 0.25 m/s.

23. C.

The initial kinetic energy is _E_ K1 = 1/2 _m_ A _v_ 1A 2 = 0.125 J. The final kinetic energy is _E_ K2 = 1/2 _m_ B _v_ 2B2 = 0.0625 J. The ratio is 0.5.

24. B.

The efficiency is defined in this problem as ratio of energy expended due to air resistance to energy consumed. The energy expended due to air resistance is _W_ air = _F_ air _D_ cos _φ_ , where cos _φ_ is 1 because the road is level. The total energy consumed is simply _n_ Δ _H_ rxn.

25. D.

The problem makes no mention of how efficiency depends on speed. On the other hand, the energy expended to overcome air resistance will increase as the square of the velocity. In many situations the efficiency is defined as the ratio of useful work to input energy, the rest of the energy wasted as heat. This problem is different in that the efficiency is defined as the ratio of energy consumed by a given drag to input energy.

26. C.

The answer is not A or B, because the car has as much kinetic energy before as after, since it goes at one speed, and as much potential energy before as after, since it travels on level ground. The energy starts as chemical energy, so D is incorrect.

27. D.

The amount of energy expended is Δ _E_ = _P_ Δ _t_ , by definition. This is equal to the increase of the potential energy of the box. The energy does not go anywhere else: not into heat because the transfer is 100% efficient and not into kinetic energy because the box moves slowly and at constant speed. Setting _P_ Δ _t_ equal to _mgH_ yields _H_ = 40 m. Note the 30° angle had nothing to do with the answer.

28. A.

See the answer to problem 27.

29. A.

In this case the power is 120 Watts. This gives an energy expenditure of (120 W) (60 s) = 7200 J. The energy which becomes potential energy is 720 J because of the 10% efficiency. If this is set equal to _mgH_ , then _H_ = 1.8 m.

30. A.

If the current and the potential difference were both doubled, then the power would increase by a factor of 4. If the energy expended is the same in Δ _E_ = _P_ Δ _t_ , then Δ _t_ decreases by a factor of 4.

31. D.

The first method of doing pulley problems involves drawing a force diagram for the bottom pulley, as shown. This gives the force equation _T_ \+ _T_ – _mg_ = 0, so that _T_ = 1/2 _mg_.

The second method involves imagining that the end of the rope is pulled 1 meter. That means that 1 meter of rope goes over the upper pulley, and 0.5 meters of rope are taken from either side of the lower pulley. The angle _α_ has no part in this problem. The work done by the pulling is the work done pulling the mass, so _T_ (1 m) = _mg_ (0.5 m) and _T_ = 1/2 _mg_.

32. A.

The force diagrams are shown. Clearly the second tension is double the first tension.

33. C.

Many students are tempted to choose 300 N, thinking that the two weights add. The force diagram below shows that the tension in either string is 150 N. The right string exerts 150 N on the force meter, the left string exerts 150 N on the force meter, and the force meter records 150 N.

34. B.

The first method is the easier method for this pulley problem. The force diagram for the lower pulley is shown. Thus _T_ \+ _T_ \+ _T_ – _mg_ = 0, so that _T_ = 1/3 _mg_.

35. B.

Using _E_ K = 1/2 _mv_ 2 gives us _v_ = 8 m/s.

36. C.

Whenever we see force and distance, we think of energy and the equation _W_ = _F_ Δ _x_ cos _φ_. In this case, cos _φ_ = 1, so that _F_ = 130 N. The force is the force that the track, through friction, exerts on his feet.

37. A.

After the cannonball leaves the cannon, there is nothing touching it besides air, and we are ignoring air resistance. If you chose B, then you need to review the first law of motion.

38. C.

We use _E_ K1 = 1/2 _mv_ 2.

39. A.

We use _E_ P2 = _mgh_.

40. C.

The only force acting on the cannonball is gravity, so the simple statement of the conservation of energy holds in this case, and we write

41. C.

Since the kinetic energy is decreasing, I is false. Since the potential energy is increasing, II is false. The sum is conserved, because gravity is the only force acting on the ball, so the simple statement of the conservation of energy holds.

42. C.

The momentum is large and directed up at the beginning, but it goes to zero by the end. The unbalanced force is gravity.

43. B.

Gravity is the only force on the ball in flight, and it does work on the ball, so A is false. The energy starts as kinetic and ends as potential, so B is true. C is false. The force of the hand ceases to play a role after the ball leaves the touch of the hand, so D is false.

44. A.

Here we have enough information to apply the definition, _E_ K = 1/2 _mv_ 2 = 1/2 (2.005 kg) (1.5 m/s)2 = 2.25 Joules. It is safe to round 2.005 to 2.

45. C.

In this question we are talking about part 1 of the event: a collision involving hot wood and partially combusted organic compounds, that is, energy lost as heat. This resembles a car collision, so conservation of momentum is the relevant concept. We write

46. B.

In this question we are talking of part 2 of the event. The forces on the block (with bullet) are gravity and the tension of the strings. But the tension is always perpendicular to the direction of travel, so the tension forces do no work, and the simple statement of the conservation of energy applies:

47. C.

Certainly the energy starts as kinetic, so the answer is A or C. But during part 1, there is no change in the potential energy of anything, so A is incorrect. Most of the kinetic energy of the bullet goes into heat, some goes into kinetic energy of the block, and a little stays as kinetic energy of the bullet.

48. A.

The block is moving at first, and by the time it stops, its height is greater. So the energy goes from kinetic to potential.

49. A.

Since the speed is constant, the kinetic energy is constant and therefore conserved. The potential energy is not constant but increases. Option III sounds attractive, but the cart as a system is not isolated, since the winch does work on it, and so its energy is not conserved. The proper statement for the conservation of energy in this problem is this: The potential energy increase of the cart is given by the work done by the winch. Remember to follow the energy flow.

50. B.

This is the correct, although contrived, answer. It is correct because the forces are, in fact, balanced and the momentum stays constant throughout the problem. It is contrived because this information does not allow you to calculate anything of use.

51. A.

The net force on the cart is zero, so _W_ tot = _F_ netΔ _x_ cos _φ_ is zero. Remember that the total work is a measure of the energy that goes into the _kinetic energy_ of the cart. In this problem, winch energy goes into potential energy of the cart. A is true. B and C are false because kinetic energy, being constant, plays no role. Both the winch and gravity do work, so D is false.

52. B.

53. B.

We could do these problems by drawing forces, taking components, obtaining accelerations, and finally velocities. Conservation of energy gives us the answer much more quickly. The only two forces on the rocks are gravity and the normal force, so the simple statement of the conservation of energy applies. We write

_E_ K1 \+ _E_ P1 = _E_ K2 \+ _E_ P2,  
 _mgh_ 1= 1/2 _mv_ 22,  
 _v_ 22 = 2 _gh_ 1,

Notice that the angle _α_ or _β_ never appears at all, and the mass of the rock _m_ or _M_ cancels in the second step above. The only thing that matters, counterintuitively, is the height from which the rocks fall.

54. B.

This problem is more difficult. Our intuition comes from Section 4.C. The reason that two rocks, one more massive than the other, take the same time to fall is that at each point along the path their accelerations are the same, their velocities are the same, and they take the same time to fall. The same is true in this problem. Once we determine that the acceleration of rock M is the same as rock m then they must take the same time to slide down. We can see that their accelerations are the same in the force diagrams below.

The horizontal components _F_ net = _ma_ for the respective diagrams is

_Mg_ sin _α_ = _Ma_ x, _mg_ sin _α_ = _ma_ x,

_g_ sin _α_ = _a_ x, _g_ sin _α_ = _a_ x

In the above cases the accelerations are the same because the factor _m_ cancels. This situation is the same as the case with falling masses (Section 4.C).

55. C.

The analysis in the previous problem should convince you that if the angle is greater, then the acceleration is greater, and the time of fall is less. Even if we do not think through the analysis, we can consider the extremes of a very small _α_ , which would make the rock take a long time to slide, versus a large _β_ (steep slope), which would be almost free fall. Thus the time is shorter.

56. C.

The energy required to get from A to B is given by the work done against air resistance. The work done by the air is _W_ air = _F_ airΔ _x_ , where Δ _x_ is the distance between the cities, which is a constant. Thus we have _W_ air = _CρAv_ 2Δ _x_ , and if _v_ is doubled, then _W_ air is increased by a factor of 4.

57. C.

An increase from 50 to 55 mph is an increase of 10%, that is, a factor of 1.1. Since _W_ air varies as v2, _W_ air must increse by a factor of 1.12 = 1.21, which is an increase by 21%.

58. D.

Power is given by _P_ = _F_ air _v_ = _CρAv_ 3, so an increase by a factor of 2 in velocity yields an increase by a factor of 23 = 8 in power.

#### Passage 1

1. B.

It is true that there are more particles on the left side of the reaction, but that would tend to make the pressure go down, not up, so A is false. The pressure goes up because the temperature goes up, so B seems a good choice. Spontaneous reactions can have either an increase or a decrease in pressure, so C is incorrect. D is incorrect for the same reason.

2. C.

The amount of work done is _W_ = _F_ Δ _x_ cos _φ_ = ( _P_ burn _A_ )( _l_ )(1) = _P_ burn _Al_. The quantity Δ _H_ rxn is given in Joules per mole of reactants going across the reaction equation, that is, per mole of O2. Thus the amount of energy used is _n_ Δ _H_ rxn.

3. B.

The first answer we think of is number ratio, since the coefficients in a reaction refer to the number of atoms/molecules/formula units or whatever. But that is not a choice. Mass ratio is wrong, so A is excluded. For ideal gases, volume ratio is proportional to number ratio, and since the reactants are gases, B is a good choice. C is nonsense. D is irrelevant since the reactants are at the same temperature.

4. D.

One of the reactants would be in excess. The heat of reaction is unchanged, so A is false. The combustion would still ignite, so B is out. The answer is C or D. If any of the intermediates in the reaction were stable compounds, then some of those compounds could end up in the waste gas. But the reaction of hydrogen with water is clean, and the waste gas would contain only leftover hydrogen or oxygen.

5. A.

If the reaction were performed isothermally, then the number of gas particles would be less after the reaction than before the reaction. Since pressure at a given volume and temperature is proportional to the number of gas particles by the ideal gas law, the pressure would decrease.

6. A.

When the gases are introduced in the chamber, the ideal gas law is _P_ atm _AL_ = _n_ tot _RT_ amb, where _n_ tot is the number of total moles of both gases. Only one third of those molecules are oxygen, so A is correct.

7. A.

We have assumed that the piston movement is small and the pressure stays about the same. If the piston movement were larger, the increase in volume would decrease the pressure. The gas in the chamber is doing work against the piston, so the internal energy of the gas must decrease. The temperature must decrease as well.

#### Passage 2

1. D.

If the collision is isolated, then there are no external forces and momentum is conserved, so I is true. The word "elastic" implies that kinetic energy is conserved, so II is true. The total energy is always conserved in an isolated collision, so III is true. Thus the answer is D.

2. C.

The equation looks complicated, but it does not look as forbidding if we break it down. Consider the left-hand side. There is an energy and a distance, which reminds us of force, from the equation _W_ = _F_ Δ _x_ cos _φ_. The quantity energy divided by distance has the units of force.

3. D.

On the right-hand side of the equation, everything is constant except _N, Z_ , and _z_. In this question we are comparing 3H and 3He, so the only difference is _z_. That is, 3H has _z_ = 1 and 3He has _z_ = 2. Since _z_ is doubled, 3He must lose 4 times as much energy per unit distance.

4. B.

The only difference in the two nuclei is the mass, which plays no role in equation (1).

5. C.

Since both gases are at STP, the ideal gas equation guarantees that the two gases have the same number of moles per unit volume, hence _N_ is the same. Neon has 10 electrons per gas particle, and helium has 2 per particle. So neon has a _Z_ which is 5 times larger and removes 5 times as much energy per unit distance.

#### Passage 3

1. C.

The slowing of the car implies the momentum is decreasing, but an unbalanced external force does not necessarily nullify the conservation of energy, just the conservation of momentum, so A is false. The conservation of energy takes entropy into account if heat is included in the accounting of the energy of the system, so B is false. If heat is transferred to the air, that is, out of the system, then energy is not conserved for that system, and C is true. Option D makes little sense.

2. D.

The energy of motion is turned into heat, so the equation is

3. C.

The initial kinetic energy of the car is 1/2 _M_ car _v_ 2, of which 1/2 _aM_ car _v_ 2 actually gets transferred to the flywheel. Thus we write

4. B.

We have learned that the force on a mass Δ _m_ moving in a circle of radius _R_ is Δ _mv_ 2/ _R_. We also know that the velocity _v_ = 2 _πR_ / _T_ , where _T_ is the period, that is, _T_ = 1/ _f_. Putting all this together with ω = 2 _πf_ given in the passage yields _F_ = Δ _m_ ω2 _R_.

5. A.

The car initially has kinetic energy 1/2 _M_ car _v_ 2. Of this, only energy 1/2 _aM_ car _v_ 2 is placed into the flywheel. And of this, only energy 1/2 _abM_ car _v_ 2 is transferred back into kinetic energy, which is 1/2 _M_ car _v_ 2. Thus

6. B.

The change in potential energy is Δ _E_ P = _mg_ Δ _h_. We multiply this by 0.40 before setting it equal to 1/2 _mv_ 2 Thus, using Δ _h_ = 50 meters,

#### Passage 4

1. C.

When the car goes from point C to point D, the only forces acting on it are gravity and the normal force. The normal force does no work, so we can use the simple statement of the conservation of energy. The initial kinetic energy is very small, so

_E_ P2 \+ _E_ K2 = _E_ P1 \+ _E_ K1,  
 _E_ K2 = _MgH_ 1.

2. C.

In order to obtain the velocity, we use the above equation and set kinetic energy to 1/2 _Mv_ 2.

3. C.

The situation is the same for the car going from point C to F as it is in going from C to E. The only forces ever operating are gravity and the normal force, so the simple statement of energy conservation works:

4. A.

The normal force never does work. This is because its direction is normal to not only the surface but to the motion of the object as well.

5. D.

Gravity, certainly, is acting down. The only thing touching the car is the tracks, which provide a normal force, down. Thus gravity and the normal force together provide the centripetal force. So if we are counting forces, there are two. If you chose C, you need to review the section about the first law of motion.

6. D.

This is analogous to the books in the car in Section 5.D, which get "pulled" toward the door when the car turns. No such thing happens, of course. The books are going in a straight path and the car's door turns into their path. In this case, the blood would be going along a straight path, but the body is pulled by a centripetal force (from gravity and the normal force) away from the blood.

7. C.

A glance at the answers shows expression which look like centripetal force and gravity. The force diagram is shown.

Gravity and the normal force add to make the net force, which is centripetal and leads to the acceleration of the car. On the one hand we can write _F_ net = _N_ \+ _Mg_. On the other we write _F_ net = _Mα_ cent. Thus

This is close. Now we need to remember that the radius of the circle _R_ is half the diameter, which is _H_ 2, so the answer is C.

8. C.

The friction on the tracks plays no role in our current analysis and plays only a small role in reality. Since A is not a likely answer, let's look at the others. The bumpers are used to stop the car at the end of the ride, and they rely on friction. If the coefficient of friction is reduced, this could be disastrous. The cars are stopped by rubbing past the bumpers, so the friction is kinetic. By reducing the mass, the park operators reduce the amount of force necessary to negatively accelerate the cars to a stop.

9. A.

The energy in the motor certainly starts out as electrical. If the bumpers dissipate the energy, then the energy ends up as heat. In the ride itself, energy is sloshed back and forth from kinetic to potential.

#### Passage 5

1. C.

The definition of kinetic energy involves mass and velocity, and we know neither, so A and B are not right. Choice C mentions force, and there is a connection between force and energy, the equation _W_ = _F_ Δ _x_ cos _φ_. Does this equation apply in this case? The change in kinetic energy is given by the total work done on an object, that is _F_ netΔ _x_ cos _φ_ , so the equation does apply. The quantity Δ _x_ is the length of the barrel, and we have cos _φ_ = 1.

2. C.

Pressure and temperature go together in the ideal gas equation, and though we may have the volume of the "reaction flask", we do not have the number of moles, so A is not the answer. It seems difficult to connect velocity with pressure, so let us look for a better answer than B. Pressure and force together remind us of the definition of pressure _P_ = _F_ / _A_. Since we have the cross-sectional area of the cannon, this is a connection between force and pressure. C is the answer.

3. A.

The rate of reaction does depend on surface area, concentration, and temperature, but grain size affects only the surface area. So A is the answer. Only a catalyst could reduce the activation energy.

4. B.

Since the reaction is irreversible, the entropy change is positive, so A is false. The reaction is spontaneous, so the free energy change must be negative.

5. B.

The energy starts as chemical energy and turns to heat after burning. The whole point of a cannon is to convert energy to kinetic energy of the ball. Note that the conversion of heat to kinetic energy is inefficient. Among the choices given, however, B is the best answer.

6. D.

This is like a problem we have done before. Because of the following calculation:

_E_ K1 \+ _E_ P1 = _E_ K2 \+ _E_ P2,  
1/2 _mv_ 2 = _mgh_ ,  
 _h_ = _v_ 2/2 _g_

we see that we do not need anything besides the ball velocity upon leaving the cannon.

## Chapter 10 Solutions

1. C.

A diagram of a human head is shown.

The area over which the force is acting down is the top of the head _πr_ 2 = _π_ (0.1 m)2. We multiply this by atmospheric pressure, which we approximate as 105 N/m2. This is a force in Newtons. If _m_ is the number of kilograms we are seeking, then this force is _mg_. Thus _m_ = [π (0.1)2 105/10] kg = 310 kg.

2. C.

We draw a force diagram as shown.

The second step is to write a force equation. Because the cork is not accelerating, we can write _F_ B – _mg_ = 0. Let _m_ and _V_ be the mass and volume of the cork. We replace _m_ with _ρV_. We replace _F_ B with _ρ_ water _V_ disp _g_ , but _V_ disp is 3 _V_ /4, according to the problem. We cancel _g_ and _V_ to obtain _ρ_ / _ρ_ water = 3/4.

3. B.

The force diagram is same as that for the previous problem. The force equation is again _F_ B – _mg_ = 0. In this problem _V_ disp is 0.9 _V_. Solving, we obtain _ρ_ / _ρ_ water = 0.9.

4. D.

The force diagram is the same as that in the previous problems. In this problem, we want an equation which includes the volumes in and out of the fluid. Again we have _F_ B = _mg_ , but we call the displaced volume _V_ in, and the total volume of iron we call _V_ in \+ _V_ out, so we have

_F_ B = _mg_

_ρ_ Hg _V_ in _g_ = _ρ_ Fe( _V_ in \+ _V_ out) _g_

( _ρ_ Hg – _ρ_ Fe) _V_ in = _ρ_ Fe _V_ out

_V_ out/ _V_ in = ( _ρ_ Hg – _ρ_ Fe)/ _ρ_ Fe = _ρ_ Hg/ _ρ_ Fe – 1

5. C.

The buoyancy force is _F_ B = _ρ_ air _V_ disp _g_ , but _V_ disp is the volume of the man _m_ / _ρ_ man. Thus _F_ B = ( _ρ_ air/ _ρ_ man) _mg_ = 1.2 x 10–3 (686 N) = 0.8 N.

6. D.

This is a simple application of the ideal gas law _PV_ = _nRT_. (Did you recognize _R_ in the answer choices?) The quantity _n_ / _V_ , which is _P_ / _RT_ , is the number of moles per volume, that is, number of moles per liter, if _P_ is in atm, _R_ is in L atm/K mol. If we multiply by the atomic mass 4 grams/mole, we obtain density. There is a factor of 1000 to convert liters to cm3. Note that temperature _T_ must be measured in Kelvins, and 27° C is 300 K.

7. D.

First, we draw a force diagram, as shown.

We assume the balloon is not accelerating, so we write

_F_ B – _m_ He _g_ – _Mg_ = 0.

We replace _F_ B and _m_ He and cancel the factor _g_ , so we have

_ρ_ air _Vg_ – _ρ_ He _Vg_ – _Mg_ = 0,  
( _ρ_ air – _ρ_ He) _V_ – _M_ = 0,  
 _V_ = _M_ /( _ρ_ air – _ρ_ He)

8. D.

We apply the formula

_P_ = _P_ atm \+ _ρgh_  
= (1.0 x 105 \+ 103 _·_ 10 _·_ 5) Pa  
= 1.5 x 105 Pa.

9. A.

The gauge pressure is defined as

_P_ – _P_ atm = _ρgh_ = 5 x 104 Pa.

10. A.

11. A.

The questions here are a bit confusing, so let us think about what the muscles which expand the lungs do. During normal breathing conditions, the pressure inside your lungs is similar to the pressure outside, so these forces balance. To breathe in, you exert a small force to expand the push out the chest (and pull down the diaphragm). A force diagram for the chest is shown, where _P_ in is the pressure of gas inside the lung, and _P_ out is the pressure of fluid outside your lung.

Underwater, however, the force _P_ out is greater than _P_ in by an additional _ρgh_. Thus for question 10, we would say that the pressure the lungs are expanding against is the difference _P_ out – _P_ in. The best answer is

A. If you chose C, you were thinking along the right track, but it is not the total outside pressure that makes breathing difficult; it is the net pressure, that is, the difference in pressure.

The force _F_ lung must balance the two pressure forces, so the force is most nearly the product of the gauge pressure and the area of the chest. The best answer is A.

12. D.

The pressure at the top of the column on the right side is simply the atmospheric pressure _P_ atm. Pascal's law states that the pressure at point Q is the same (see figure).

If we apply hydrostatic equilibrium to the points Q and S (at the top of the column at the left), we obtain

_P_ Q = _P_ S \+ _ρ_ Hg _g_ ( _h_ 1 – _h_ 2),  
 _P_ S = _P_ atm – _ρ_ Hg _g_ ( _h_ 1 – _h_ 2).

13. A.

This is a simple application of Pascal's law.

14. A.

Since the pressures are the same _P_ 1 = _P_ 2, we can substitute an expression for force _P_ = _F_ / _A_. Thus _F_ 1/ _A_ 1 = _F_ 2/ _A_ 2, and _F_ 1 = ( _A_ 1/ _A_ 2) _F_ 2.

15. B.

The long way to do this is to realize that a change of volume on one side of the press is the same as a change of volume on the other side of the press. If the piston on the right moves Δ _x_ 1 and the load moves Δ _x_ 2, then

Δ _V_ = _A_ 1Δ _x_ 1 = _A_ 2Δ _x_ 2.

But

_W_ 1 = _F_ 1Δ _x_ 1 = _PA_ 1Δ _x_ 1 = _P_ Δ _V,_

and

_W_ 2 = _F_ 2Δ _x_ 2 = _PA_ 2Δ _x_ 2 = _P_ Δ _V._

The short way to see this is to realize that the flow of energy is from the piston doing the work on the fluid to the fluid doing work on the load, increasing its potential energy. We assume no energy is lost to friction, so we must have _W_ 1 = _W_ 2.

16. B.

This is an application of hydrostatic equilibrium. The pressure at the top of the column is zero, and the pressure at the bottom of both flasks is _ρ_ Hg _gh_.

17. A.

Hydrostatic equilibrium allows us to write

_P_ res = _P_ atm \+ _ρ_ fluid _g_ ( _h_ 2 – _h_ 1),

which becomes

_P_ res – _P_ atm = _ρ_ fluid _g_ ( _h_ 2 – _h_ 1).

The left side is constant. On the right side, if _ρ_ fluid increases, then _h_ 2 – _h_ 1 decreases.

18. B.

Compare this problem with the needle in Example 2 of Section E. The circumference about the needle turned out to be twice the length of the needle. Here we have bent the needle into a rectangle, so the length _L_ that goes into _F_ max = γ _L_ will be _L_ = 2( _l_ \+ _w_ \+ _l_ \+ _w_ ). This is not like a rectangular bug foot (see Example 1 of Section E) in the water. The circumference for the thread has to go all around the outside as well as all around the inside.

19. A.

The relevant length for the wire circle is _L_ wire = 2(2 _πr_ ), just like Example 2 in Section E. The coin's relevant length is 2 _πr_ , just like Example 1.

20. B.

Since water is incompressible, the flow rate must be constant along the flow.

21. A.

If the flow rate is 0.06 m3/s, and the area of the pipe at B is _π_ (0.03 m)2, then the flow velocity is _v_ = _f_ / _A_ = 21 m/s.

22. D.

Certainly one expression for the velocity at point B is _f_ / _πr_ B2, but that is not any of the choices. But the velocity at point B is related to the velocity at point A as well. Since we know _f_ A = _f_ B, we can write _v_ A _πr_ A2 = _v_ B _πr_ B2. From this we get choice D.

23. A.

The area of contact is the area of the side of the piston, that is, 2 _πrl_. The distance between the sliding surfaces is Δ _r_ , so the viscosity equation gives choice A.

24. B.

Work is force times distance times cos _φ_. We can draw a force diagram. There are four forces we are concerned with, since we are ignoring gravity. The problem mentions the viscous force. There are pressure forces for the two faces of the piston. In addition, the shaft is attached to the piston, and it is by moving the shaft that the piston does useful work. We are interested in the work done by the atmospheric pressure. The force is _P_ atm _A_ = _P_ atm _πr_ 2. The distance the piston moves is _v_ Δ _t_ , so that B is the correct answer.

25. C.

The quantity _f_ gives the revolutions per second. Each revolution represents a distance 2 _πR_ , that is, the circumference. Thus the velocity is 2 _πRf_. If this question confused you, go over it several times. This is a common calculation that could save you some day.

26. A.

Torque is force times radius times sin _φ_. The torque of the rod must balance the retarding torque due to the viscous force. The viscous force is _F_ vis = _ηAv_ / _d,_ and the relevant radius is _R_. Because the force is perpendicular to the radius vector, we have sin _φ_ = 1. Thus the retarding torque is _τ_ = _RηAv_ / _d_ , and this is also the torque of the rod.

27. B.

Increasing the flow rate increases the likelihood of turbulence, so A is incorrect. Making the joints smooth does not seem to do anything at first glance, but perhaps this would remove obstacles that would create turbulence, so B is a possibility. Reynolds number says nothing about temperature, so C is also incorrect. Increasing the radius of the pipe increases the likelihood of turbulence, so D is incorrect, and the answer must be B.

28. B.

We can consider a streamline which goes from the reservoir (pressure _P_ res, _v_ = 0) to the nozzle (pressure _P_ atm, velocity desired). Since gravity plays no role, the _ρgh_ terms drop out. Bernoulli's equation gives

29. A.

We can consider a streamline which goes from the reservoir to the top of fountain (pressure _P_ atm and _v_ = 0), so that Bernoulli's equation gives

30. B.

The viscosity depends only on the substance and not on the situation, so A is incorrect. The water does develop turbulence, and this would disqualify the flow from Bernoulli's principle, so B is a possibility. C is irrelevant, as well as D, so B is correct. The energy of the flow goes into turbulence and eventually into heat.

31. C.

This is similar to an example worked in the text. The fact that the hose goes over the top of the tank does not change the application of Bernoulli's principle. A streamline can be said to go from the top of the tank (pressure _P_ atm, _v_ = 0) through the hose to the other end (pressure _P_ atm, velocity desired). Bernoulli's equation becomes

32. B.

This is a question about hydrostatic equilibrium, so _P_ bottom = _P_ atm \+ _ρg_ ( _h_ 3 – _h_ 1).

33. B.

Looking at the answers, we see that the question writer intends for us to apply Bernoulli's equation. A streamline goes from the reservoir (pressure _P_ res, velocity 0) to the pipe 2 with no gravity gradient, so Bernoulli's equation becomes _P_ res \+ 0 = _P_ atm \+ 1/2 _ρv_ 22, so B is correct.

34. B.

Relating the velocity _v_ 1 to velocity _v_ 2 is a matter of continuity. The flow _f_ has to be the same all along the flow, so _A_ 1 _v_ 1 = _A_ 2 _v_ 2. Thus B is correct.

35. C.

Again we can apply Bernoulli's principle. The answer choices do not refer to _v_ 2, so let us take for the two points, a point in the reservoir and a point in the constricted pipe, and see where that leads. If nowhere, then we can try again:

_P_ res \+ 1/2 _ρ_ (0)2 = _P_ 1 \+ 1/2 _ρv_ 12  
 _P_ 1 = _P_ res – 1/2 _ρv_ 12

36. A.

First we draw a diagram. In addition to gravity, there are two forces on the necklace due to the two things touching it: the water (buoyant force) and the string (tension). The reading on the force meter is the magnitude of the tension.

We write the force equation

_T_ \+ _F_ B – _mg_ = 0,  
 _T_ = _mg_ – _F_ B  
= _mg_ – _ρ_ H2O _Vg_  
= ( _m_ – _ρ_ H2O _V_ ) _g_  
= (50.0 – 4.82)kg/1000 _·_ 9.8m/s2  
= 0.44 N.

We would have gotten the right answer by estimating _g_ to be 10 m/s2.

37. D.

This problem is similar to other problems we have done. In order to achieve force balance, the sink must exert a force _mg_ – _ρ_ water _V_ disp _g_. The problem gives all the information except _V_ disp. The capacity of the cup is not the same as the volume the cup displaces when it is under water.

38. C.

Even if the pump draws a perfect vacuum, the column will not rise above 10 m. Consider the situation shown, which turns out to be impossible.

The pressure at the top of the column is _P_ top, and we write

_P_ atm = _P_ top \+ _ρ_ beverage _gh_ ,  
 _P_ top = 105 Pa – (103 kg/m3)(10 m/s2)(12 m)  
= –2 x 104 Pa.

This is impossible. Even the best pump can draw at best zero pressure, never a negative pressure. The water column would fall, so that the top of the column would have zero pressure and the evacuated space above it would also have zero pressure.

39. B.

We can obtain the height of the water column by setting _P_ top to 0. Thus, _P_ atm = _P_ top \+ _ρgh_ becomes _h_ = _P_ atm/ _ρg_. Using a different straw clearly has no effect, but decreasing Δ will increase _h_.

40. C.

We have to careful of units in this problem. Pressure is the connection between gas data and information about force. We do not need _PV_ = _nRT_ , because we already know _P_ = 2 atm. In order to calculate force, however, we need Pascals, so _P_ is approximately 2 x 105 Pa. Using _F_ = _PA_ , where _A_ = 0.01 m2 (the area of one face), we obtain that _F_ is approximately 2000 N.

41. A.

We draw a diagram as shown below.

This reminds us of a Bernoulli question (especially with the explicit "ignore viscosity"), and we can draw a streamline as shown. The pressures at points 1 and 2 are both _P_ atm. The velocity at point 1 is essentially 0. If the top of the ocean is the standard height, then the height of point 2 is –1 m. Bernoulli's equation becomes

42. A.

If we know the flow velocity, we can obtain the flow rate from _f_ = _Av_ = (.01 m)2 (4.5 m/s).

43. A.

Since the problem asks for force, we draw a force diagram.

The pressure of the water can be obtained by hydrostatic equilibrium: _P_ water = _P_ atm \+ _ρgh_ , where _h_ is 1 m.

Thus, since the finger is not accelerating, we write

_P_ water _A_ – _P_ atm _A_ – _F_ boy = 0,  
 _F_ boy = ( _P_ water – _P_ atm) _A_  
= _ρghA_  
= (103 kg/m3)(10 m/s2)(1 m)(0.001 m)2  
= 1 N.

44. A.

This is similar to problem 36. There we learned that a force meter provides a force, and the reading tells us what the force is. A force diagram is shown.

Since the hammer is not accelerating, the force equation is _F_ meter \+ _F_ B – _m_ h _g_ = 0. We know _m_ h _g_ = (0.79 kg) (10 m/s2) = 7.9 N. The displaced volume is simply the volume of the hammer, that is, _mρ_ steel = 100 cm3, so that _F_ B = _ρ_ water _V_ disp _g_ = 1 N (by the time the units are straightened). Thus _F_ meter is (7.9 – 1) N = 6.9 N.

45. C.

The force diagram for the water is shown in the same diagram. We have not discussed the force that the hammer exerts on the fluid, but by Newton's third law of motion, its magnitude must be the same 1 N we calculated in the previous problem. Recall that a scale provides a force, and the reading tells the magnitude of the force provided. Since the water is not accelerating, the force equation is _F_ scale – _F_ B – _m_ w _g_ = 0. Thus _F_ scale = 50 N + 1 N = 51 N.

#### Passage 1

1. A.

Well, points _P_ 1 and _P_ 2 are in the water, and _P_ 2 is above _P_ 1, so the pressure at _P_ 1 should be greater by _ρgh_. It is confusing, though, since the pressure at _P_ 1 must be _P_ atm. The air just above _P_ 2 must have pressure _P_ atm. Usually the pressure on one side of a boundary between two substances is the same as the pressure on the other side, but this is not true if the boundary is curved, as when a meniscus forms.

2. C.

Certainly there are pressure forces, but these balance (both are _F_ = _P_ atm _πr_ 2). The surface tension pulls the column up, balancing the force of gravity.

3. C.

The pressure at the top of the column is given by _F_ = _PA_ = _P_ atm _πr_ 2. We use the air pressure since it is the air that exerts the downward force on the column.

4. C.

The force due to gravity is _F_ grav = _mg_ = _ρVg_ = _ρπr_ 2 _hg_.

5. C.

The length of the line of contact is the circumference of the straw, so _L_ = 2 _πr_.

6. B.

The force diagram for the column of water is shown.

Since nothing is accelerating, the force equation becomes the following:

_P_ atm _A_ \+ _F_ surf – _P_ atm _A_ – _mg_ = 0,  
 _F_ surf = _mg_ ,  
2 _πr_ γ = _πr_ 2 _hρg_ ,  
 _h_ = 2γ/ _rρg_.

From this we see that height _h_ increases proportionally as _r_ decreases.

#### Passage 2

1. B.

In this model a maximum height is obtained by setting the pressure at the top of the column to zero. Thus, _P_ bottom = _P_ top \+ _ρgh_ becomes _P_ atm = 0 + _ρgh_. Thus _h_ = _P_ atm/ _ρg_ = 105 Pa / (103 kg/m3) (10 m/s2) = 10 m.

2. D.

According to this equation, the height _h_ depends only on the atmospheric pressure, the density of the fluid, and the acceleration due to gravity.

3. C.

The passage mentions that the surface tension and the gravitational force must add to zero. Thus, 2 _πrγ_ – _ρπr 2hg_ = 0 (as in the previous passage). This becomes

4. A.

In this model the height is inversely proportional to the radius.

#### Passage 3

1. D.

The main difference between the inner and outer chambers is the presence of enzymes in the outer chamber. Enzymes are catalysts which reduce the activation energy. Choice A may play a role, but a smaller one.

2. D.

We apply the formula _f_ = _Av_ = _π_ (0.01 cm)2 (1200 cm/s) = 0.4 cm3/s, where we have done the necessary unit conversions.

3. C.

Any object, whether it be a cannon ball or a drop of beetle spray, accelerates down at 10 m/s2 if gravity is the only force acting on it at the surface of Earth. The initial velocity is 12 m/s up, and the final velocity is 0 m/s. We can obtain the distance traveled by

An alternate solution involves using energy conservation: _E_ P1 \+ _E_ K1 = _E_ P2 \+ _E_ K2. A third solution could involve Bernoulli's equation, using the points just outside the abdomen and the top of flight for the spray.

4. B.

A catalyst affects activation energy but has no effect on the heat of reaction.

5. A.

Choice A reminds us of Bernoulli's principle, which might give an estimate of the pressure inside the outer chamber, even if some energy is dissipated as heat. Indeed there is no reason to assume the flow is not turbulent and not viscous. But if Bernoulli's principle applies, then A is a good estimate. Choices B, C and D definitely remind us of an ideal gas, but the passage clearly stated that the spray is a liquid, so these choices are definitely incorrect.

6. A.

The connection between force and pressure is _F_ = _PA_ , so the answer is A or B. The pressure inside the chamber is pushing in the opposite direction as the atmospheric pressure outside the chamber, so A is correct.

7. B.

The table in the passage allows us to calculate the heat released per mole of quinone produced. We need to know the concentration of quinone to know how much heat per quantity of solution is produced. Thus A is incorrect: not enough information. Once we know the heat available per quantity of solution, then we can use the heat capacity to get the temperature change. B is correct. As for choice C, the heat of reaction is necessary but it is derivable from information in the passage. As for choice D, the volume of the chamber is unnecessary information, since the question is about intensive properties of the solution and not about extensive properties. That is, the question is not about how much stuff there is, but about quantities that do not depend on volume (such as temperature).

#### Passage 4

1. B.

Option A seems good, except it is the purpose of the _filter screen_ to filter out byproducts, so this is not a likely possibility. The rupture film would certainly keep in the reactants, increasing the concentration and speeding the reaction. B is a likely possibility. The rupture film does keep the reactants dry, but that is important during the days and years before the accident, not the 1–5 ms during the reaction, so C is incorrect. There is no catalyst involved, so D is incorrect.

2. A.

In the absence of other information about entropy, it is reasonable to assume that the reaction which produces the most gas has the largest entropy increase. At a given temperature gases tend to have much more entropy than liquids and solids.

3. B.

Using _PV_ = _nRT_ , we note that 1000 / (0.0821) (300) is the number of moles of gas we desire. Multiplying by 6/9 (because of the reaction coefficients) yields the number of moles of sodium azide required. Multiplying by the molar mass (65 grams/mol) yields the number of grams required.

4. D.

Having the bag deflate will not affect the temperature appreciably, so A is incorrect. There are a number of ways to ensure that a bag will not burst (safety valve, and so on) that are better than having it deflate, so B is incorrect. The energy of collision or, rather, the work that must be done on the driver to stop him is a constant (equal to the negative of his kinetic energy before the collision), so C is incorrect. The language of choice D reminds us of _W_ tot = _F_ Δ _x_. And, indeed, the presence of an airbag increases the distance over which the decelerating force acts: not all at once at the steering wheel, but "gradually" over 0.3 meters. This decreases the force and reduces grievous bodily harm.

5. C.

It is not clear how a larger area of the bag could affect the flow rate. A larger area of the nozzle could increase the flow rate, but the question is asking about the airbag, so A and B are incorrect. Option C reminds us of the formula _P_ = _F_ / _A_. If _A_ is increased, and _F_ is the same, then pressure is reduced, hence the cushioning effect. Thus C is correct. D makes a correct statement, but does not lend advantage to the driver, so it is incorrect.

6. D.

Option A, chemical to heat, misses the point. If this were a reaction that generated a lot of heat that then dissipated, then A would be a possibility. The point of energy release in an airbag is that the airbag is actually inflated. So A is incorrect, as well as B. Option C seems like a possibility, since the bag seems to gain kinetic energy, which might later be turned to heat. Option D is a better description; however, since the true energy flow involves pushing back the atmosphere and not in moving the bag (which has little mass).

7. A.

All the options are reasonable byproducts except A, which involves Na or O in bizarre valence states.

#### Passage 5

1. B.

In the figure shown,

the pressure at point Q is the same as the pressure at point S, the reservoir pressure (Pascal's law). Hydrostatic equilibrium dictates that _P_ Q = _P_ atm \+ _ρg_ ( _h_ 2 – _h_ 1).

2. D.

The pressure all along the flow is the same, except for the tiny region where Barometer 2 disturbs the flow. Thus the pressure measured by Barometer 1 is the same as the upstream pressure. If we take the streamline shown in the figure, then upstream we have pressure _P_ 1 and desired velocity _v_ , and at the point in front of the barometer we have pressure _P_ 2 and _v_ = 0. Bernoulli's equation becomes

3. C.

Since the flow must go through a smaller area, the velocity must increase to maintain the same flow rate _f_ = _Av_.

4. A.

Bernoulli's equation (neglecting the gravity terms) is

If _v_ 4 is greater than _v_ 3, then _P_ 4 is less than _P_ 3. But do not rely on the equation; remember that for flow along a streamline, the pressure increases when the velocity decreases.

5. B.

If the fluid is incompressible, then _f_ = _A_ 3 _v_ 3 = _A_ 4 _v_ 4new, regardless of viscosity. Thus _v_ 4new is the same as _v_ 4.

6. A.

Bernoulli's equation can no longer be used to obtain pressure, but perhaps we can figure out the answer by figuring out where the equation breaks down. The equation is a statement of energy conservation. If viscosity is added, then viscosity converts some energy into heat. Thus, we have

Comparing this with the equation in problem 4 above, we see that in this equation _P_ 4 must be smaller (the 1/2 _ρv_ 42 term is the same; see previous problem). The key to this problem is remembering that Bernoulli's equation is about energy. Viscosity robs the flow energy, creating heat, thus reducing pressure from the prediction given by the Bernoulli equation.

## Chapter 11 Solutions

1. D.

If we draw a force diagram for the mass (shown below), then we see that the gravitational force and the spring force add to zero, so they must be equal in magnitude (second law of motion). The magnitude of the force is _F_ grav = (0.8 kg) (10 m/s2) = 8.0 N. We use the spring equation to calculate _x_ = _F_ spring/ _k_ = (8.0 N)/(2.5 N/m) = 3.2 m. Since the spring is being stretched, we add that to the resting length 0.15 m, for a total 3.35 m.

2. A.

Before we started pulling, the forces due to spring and gravity were balanced. Then we increased the spring force. The _increase_ in spring force is given by Δ _F_ spring = _k_ Δ _x_ = (2.5 N/m) (0.10 m) = 0.25 N. Another way to get the same result is to realize the new extension _x_ is 3.2 m + 0.1 m, so the force exerted by the spring is _F_ spring = (2.5 N/m) (3.3 m) = 8.25 N up. The force of gravity is 8.0 N down, for a net force 0.25 N up. (See figure.)

3. D.

We can draw a force diagram for the mass (shown below). (There are two forces not shown: the force of gravity and the normal force of the table, which sum to zero.) The spring provides the centripetal force, so we can write _F_ spring = _mv_ 2/ _R_. Solving for _v_ gives _v_ = 2 m/s. One revolution is the equivalent of the circumference _C_ = 2 _πR_ ≈ 12 m. Thus the time it takes is _C_ / _v_ ≈ (12 m)/(2 m/s) = 6 s, which is closest to D.

4. B.

The extension _x_ is given by _x_ = _F_ spring/ _k_ = (10 N)/(50 N/m) = 0.2 m. Since the radius of the circle of revolution is 2 m and since the spring is pulling, the resting length of the spring must be 1.8 m.

5. A.

We simply use _E_ K = 1/2 _kx_ 2 = (0.5) (50 N/m) (0.2 m)2 = 1 J. Of course, on the real MCAT, the answer to a problem would not depend on the answer to a previous problem.

6. A.

The figure below shows a force diagram for the bob. The net force must be either up or down or zero. The velocity vector is changing direction, so the acceleration cannot be zero, and in fact, there must be a centripetal component to the acceleration. These two facts together imply the acceleration is up.

7. A.

Thus also the net force is up. Questions 6 and 7 are the same because of the second law of motion.

8. C.

If you try to work out the forces involved, things get tangled pretty quickly. This is a conservation of energy problem, and energy is converted from potential to kinetic, so we write

_E_ K1 \+ _E_ P1 = _E_ K2 \+ _E_ P2

0 + 1/2 _kx_ 2 = 1/2 _mv_ 2 \+ 0

1/2 _kx_ 2 = 1/2 _mv_ 2

The displacement of the spring is increased by a factor of 4 in our experiment, so the initial stored energy is increased by a factor of 16. The velocity must increase by a factor of 4, and _v_ 2 = 4 _v_ 1.

9. B.

Again, this is a conservation of energy problem. This time the displacement is the same in both experiments, so the stored energy is the same at the beginning of the experiment, and the kinetic energy is the same at the end of the experiment. The larger mass does not affect the final kinetic energy but its velocity would be less.

10. C.

The energy begins as gravitational potential energy. Just before the ball hits the spring, it has its maximum kinetic energy. The energy is then converted to spring potential energy.

11. C.

The change in gravitational energy is – _mgL_. The change in spring potential energy is 1/2 _kx_ 2. These should add to zero, since energy is conserved (there is no change from begin point to end point in kinetic energy):

12. C.

The period is the time for one oscillation. If 20 oscillations take 60.0 s, then one oscillation takes 3 s.

13. A.

The frequency is the number of oscillations per unit time, so _f_ = 1/ _T_.

14. A.

Clearly the choices intend for us to use frequency information (not _F_ spring = _kx_ ). The equation is

15. A.

The amplitude is the size of the displacement _from the equilibrium position_. The mass travels 0.15 m to the left of equilibrium and 0.15 m to the right of equilibrium in one oscillation. So the amplitude is 0.15 m.

16. B.

The relationship between frequency and spring constant is given by

If _k_ increases then _f_ increases. If _k_ increases by a factor of 2, then _f_ increases by a factor of  , that is, 1.41. Increasing by a factor of 1.41 is the same as increasing by 41%.

17. D.

There is no relationship between amplitude and spring constant. Any amplitude may be chosen for the oscillation.

18. B.

In an oscillating system, the energy is going back and forth between two or more forms (so A is incorrect). It cannot dissipate as heat, so D is incorrect. Gravitational potential energy plays no role in the problem, so C is also incorrect. Indeed, spring potential and kinetic are the two forms of energy.

19. A.

Remember that whenever there is a collision involving sticking or crunching or what-have-you, momentum is likely to be the only conserved quantity. During the brief moment of the collision, the spring does not do anything, so the potential energy does not come into play. And the kinetic energy before the collision turns into heat (mostly). Momentum is conserved because there are no external forces during the collision: gravity is balanced with the normal force, and the spring is not compressed and hence exerts as yet no force.

20. B.

Momentum is not conserved, the external force being the spring which acts on mass B. Although kinetic energy is clearly not conserved, the sum of kinetic and potential is.

21. B.

We need to use conservation of momentum (the clue is that the collision involves sticking), so that if the initial velocity is _v_ 0, then we write

22. A.

If we try to think of forces, we will get confused, because the spring force keeps changing. Again this is an energy problem, in which the kinetic energy (after the collision) gets completely converted to potential energy:

1/2 ( _m_ A \+ _m_ B) _v_ 2 = 1/2 _kx_ 2  
1/2 (0.5 kg)(0.2 m/s)2 = 1/2 (50 N/m) _x_ 2  
 _x_ = 0.02 m

23. A.

The acceleration is the greatest when the net force is the greatest, that is, when the spring is compressed or extended. The net force is to the right when the spring is extended. Some readers confuse acceleration with velocity (or speed) and think that the block must be moving when the acceleration is great. This is not so.

24. D.

During the collision, most of the initial kinetic energy gets dissipated as heat. The choices involving chemical energy would also be possibilities (since the tearing and grasping of Velcro is chemical), but any answer must also involve heat, so D is the best answer. The question is a little vague on purpose, since some MCAT questions are like that.

25. B.

These are the two conditions for resonance to occur. A strong coupling will generally not allow energy to build up.

26. C.

The wavelength is the distance from peak to peak.

27. A.

The period is 2 s, so the frequency is _f_ = 1/ _T_ = 0.5 Hz.

28. A.

The velocity is given by _v_ = _λf_ = (4 m) (0.5 Hz) = 2 m/s.

29. A.

The amplitude is from equilibrium point to peak.

30. D.

This is a question about geometry only. If the diameter of a circle increases by a factor of 4, how does the area change? We know _A_ = _πr_ 2. If the diameter increases by a factor of 4, the radius increases by a factor of 4, and the area increases by a factor of 16. If this seems counterintuitive, see Section 1.D.

31. A.

The passage stated that _μ_ = _ρA_. Thus if the diameter is decreased by a factor of 2, then the radius is decreased by a factor of 2, the area is decreased by a factor of 4, and the linear density is decreased by a factor of 4.

32. C.

We want to increase the wave velocity by a factor of 1.3. Since _v_ 2 = _T_ / _μ_ , we want to increase _T_ by (1.3)2 = 1.69, that is, we want to increase _T_ by 69%.

33. B.

Since we want to keep _v_ the same and _T_ the same, we therefore (since _v_ 2 = _T_ /μ) want to keep _μ_ the same. Thus we have

_μ_ = const,

_ρA_ = const,

_ρπr_ 2 = const.

The density _ρ_ is to decrease by a factor of 4, so the radius increases by a factor of 2, and the diameter increases by a factor of 2. Thus it is 0.8 mm.

34. A.

The two waves, if superposed, would add to zero at every point.

35. D.

The question does not say whether the wave arrives in phase or out of phase or in between. The duck's oscillation could be as little as 1 m (out of phase) or as much as 7 m (in phase).

36. A.

Since the midpoint is the same distance from both speakers, and the speakers produce waves that are in phase, the waves must arrive at the midpoint in phase. If this explanation is unclear, visualize the following. Two crests are emitted by the speakers at the same time. They travel at the same velocity toward the center, and they arrive at the same time. Accordingly, the center is an antinode.

37. C.

The distance from the microphone to speaker 1 is 1.3 m, and its distance to speaker 2 is 0.7 m. We are interested in the _difference_ in phase, which is the difference in distance, relative to wavelength. We calculate

If this were a whole number, then we would have an antinode. If it were a half-odd integer (0.5, 1.5, 2.5, etc.), then we would have a node.

38. B.

As in the previous problem, we calculate

We have a node.

39. C.

If the waves are out of phase, the combination has its minimum amplitude of (0.5 – 0.3) Pa = 0.2 Pa. If the waves are in phase, the combination has its maximum amplitude 0.8 Pa.

40. C.

The fundamental is shown in the first figure below, while the first harmonic is shown in the next figure. We can read from the figures that _λ_ 1 = 4 m, and _λ_ 2 = 2 m.

41. A.

Since the frequency is inversely related to the wavelength (from _v_ = _λf_ ), the ratio _f_ 1/ _f_ 2 is 1/2. We could also write

42. C.

The third harmonic is shown in the figure above. One the one hand, we can read the wavelength from the figure. If this is not clear, we can also write that there are 3/2 wavelengths contained in the 2 m, so that we write

3 _λ_ /2 = _L_

_λ_ = 2 _L_ /3

_λ_ = 4m/3

43. B The fourth harmonic is shown. We can see there are two wavelengths in the 2 m, so that we write

2 _λ_ = _L_

_λ_ = _L_ /2

_λ_ = 1 m

44. B.

The fundamental does not have a node at the midpoint, but the second harmonic does, so this is the lowest frequency that can make a sound. Its frequency is given by

_f_ = _v_ / _λ_

= (3 x 104 m/s)/2m

= 1.5 x 104 Hz

45. C.

The third harmonic is the first mode with a node at the "third" point, so the frequency is given by

_f_ = _v_ / _λ_

= (3 x 104 m/s)/1.333m

= 2.25 x 104 Hz

#### Passage 1

1. C.

Our first thought is to use the information about linear density, but there is no way to find the tension in the string. What other formula do we have for wave velocity? Well, _v_ = _λf_ , and we know _f_ = 660 Hz. We can get the wavelength just by knowing that the note 660 Hz refers to the fundamental. The fundamental has a wavelength _λ_ = 2 (0.65 m) = 1.3 m.

2. A.

For the D string we can use _λ_ = 1.3 m, so that _f_ = _v_ / _λ_ = 294 Hz. We do not have to do the calculation. If we look at the choices, we see only one choice less than 382.

3. C.

The fourth harmonic (see the figure in problem 40) has a wavelength _λ_ = 1/2 (0.65 m) = 0.325 m, yielding _f_ = _v_ / _λ_ = 1175 Hz.

4. C.

The first node occurs one fourth of the way from the neck end. Since the neck is a node as well, there must be a node at the midpoint and three fourths of the way down. This corresponds to a wavelength 0.325 m, as in problem 3 (above).

5. A.

The sixth harmonic has five nodes (not including the ends). This is shown in the figure. The wavelength is _λ_ = 1/3 (0.65 m) = 0.22 m.

6. D.

Increasing the frequency by 3% is the same as increasing it by a factor of 1.03, which means increasing the wave velocity (recall _v_ = _λf_ , and _λ_ does not change) by a factor of 1.03. Now _T_ = v2 _μ_ , and _μ_ does not change, which means _T_ is increased by a factor of (1.03)2 ≈ 1.06, which is an increase of 6%.

#### Passage 2

1. B.

Choice A is true but does not do a good job of explaining anything. Choice B refers to the transition from deep to shallow water, which happens over length scales very long compared to the 10-m ocean waves. The pool waves hit the sharp boundary of the side of the pool and are reflected. Choices C and D are true but irrelevant.

2. D.

As waves, the energy is initially both kinetic and potential, which the MCAT refers to as mechanical. Choices A and B do not express what happens when a wave breaks, and the mechanical energy goes into another form. There are no chemical changes, so C is incorrect. Choice D is reasonable. The source of friction is the sandy beach.

3. A.

According to the second paragraph, a wave has its best chance of being transmitted if it has short wavelength.

4. D.

Choice A is incorrect, since we certainly do not want to convert light energy to anything else. Choice B is incorrect, since the situation more closely resembles paragraphs 1 and 2, the coating providing a gradual transition. Visible light waves have a small wavelength, so a thin coating would suffice. This would decrease the reflectivity.

5. C.

Choice A is incorrect, since the point is that the snow is _not_ reflecting sound, resulting in your not hearing it. Choice B would be a good explanation, if the coat of snow were thick compared with the wavelength of sound (paragraph 2). This is not the case. It must be the case that the snow absorbs the sound energy, turning it to heat.

6. B  
Choice A is incorrect, because the transition from air to wood is abrupt. Choice B seems likely. There is nothing to indicate C is correct. Choice D is definitely incorrect, since the frequency of a wave stays constant as it travels from place to place. There is nothing in the passage indicating a change of frequency.

#### Passage 3

1. D.

We apply _v_ = _λf_ , using the speed of sound in air.

2. D.

According to the first paragraph, the wavelength must be smaller than the observed object. A wavelength of 10–3 m corresponds to a frequency of about 1.5 x 106 Hz in biological tissue, where we use _v_ = 1500 m/s.

3. A.

The lowest frequency is 20 Hz, so _T_ = _1_ / _f_ = 1/(20 Hz) = 0.05 s.

4. D.

The two real choices are B and D. Since there is tearing and rupturing involved, there must be chemical bonds broken, so D is it.

5. D.

Frequency is not directly connected to intensity. Amplitude and intensity are connected, but amplitude is not mentioned among the choices.

6. D.

Choices A and B are irrelevant. Concerning choice C, the problem is not energy reflecting off the organ but being absorbed by it. This is an example of resonance, and there must be a weak coupling between two oscillators: the sound is one and the oscillating organ is the other.

7. D.

The equation here is given by

## Chapter 12 Solutions

1. C.

We simply apply the formula _β_ = 10 log10 [(10–6 W/m2)/(10–12 W/m2)] = 10 log10 [106] = 10 (6) = 60 decibels.

2. A.

In Section B we discussed how intensity varies as the inverse square of the distance from the point source of sound. If distance increases by a factor of 3, then intensity decreases by a factor of 32 = 9.

3. A.

The 40 W goes out in all directions. If you stand 6 m away from the sound, then you can imagine a ball around the speaker of radius 6 m. The total surface area of that ball is 4 _πr_ 2. (If you have forgotten this formula, then take a minute to memorize it.) Since intensity is power per area, we can write

We estimated _π_ ≈ 3 and 3 x 36 ≈ 100. Look for these shortcuts.

4. B.

The intensity _I_ is _proportional_ to the power, so an increase by a factor of 10 in power leads to an increase by a factor of 10 in intensity. But _β_ is related to the _logarithm_ of intensity. An increase by a factor of 10 leads to an addition of 10 to _β_. You can also work this out by using the formula, and plugging any number you want in for area (like 1 m2). But it is better to think it through as we have done here.

5. C.

Since the problem said the sound was barely perceptible, that means that the intensity at Betsy's ear was _I_ 0 = 10–12 W/m2. Since the mosquito was 1 m away, we can imagine a ball 1 m in radius around the mosquito (see figure).

If 10–12 W emerges from each area 1 m2, then for this ball, with area 4 _π_ (1 m)2, the power must be

This is the power produced by one mosquito. To obtain the energy produced in 100 s, we write

Δ _E_ = _P_ Δ _t_  
= (1.3 x 10–11 J/s)(100 s)  
= 1.3 x 10–9 W

6. D.

In the last problem we determined that the power produced by one mosquito was 1.3 x 10–11 W. To power a 10-W bulb, we would need (10 W)/(1.3 x 10–11 W) ≈ 10/10–11 = 1012.

7. B.

If a mosquito were 10 m away (instead of 1 m), then the intensity of the sound would be 102 = 100 times less. Thus there would have to be 100 mosquitoes in order to be barely perceptible.

8. B.

Moving from 30 to 3 m away decreases the distance by a factor of 10, and this increases the intensity by a factor of 100 (two factors of 10), and this adds 10 to _β_ twice, so _β_ = (20 + 10 + 10) decibels. You can work this problem by explicitly using the formula, but that is more difficult.

9. D.

If we consider the displacement of air particles, then the closed end is a node and the open end is an antinode. The fundamental wave form is shown in the figure. The 1.5 m shows merely a quarter of a full wave, so the wavelength is 6 m.

10. A.

Thus the frequency is _f_ = _v_ / _λ_ = (343 m/s)/(6 m) = 60 Hz.

11. B.

The second harmonic has one more node than the fundamental, and it is shown in the figure. What is shown is only three quarters of a wavelength. We can write (3/4) _λ_ = 1.5 m to obtain _λ_ = 2 m.

12. A.

The fifth harmonic has four more nodes than the fundamental. This is shown in the figure. There are 2 1/4 = 9/4 wave forms present, so we may write (9/4) _λ_ = 1.5 m to obtain _λ_ = 2/3 m.

13. A.

The wavelength _λ_ is still 6 m for the fundamental, since the length of the tube does not change, and we apply _f_ = _v_ / _λ_.

14. D.

If we consider the displacement of air particles, then both ends are antinodes, and we need at least one node in the pipe, even for the fundamental. This is shown in the figure. This is half a wave, so the wavelength is 0.2 m, since the pipe length is 0.1 m.

15. C.

Thus the frequency of the fundamental is _f_ = _v_ / _λ_ = (343 m/s)/(0.2 m) = 1700 Hz.

16. B.

The fourth harmonic has three more nodes than the fundamental, for a total of four nodes. The ends are still antinodes. This is shown in the figure. There are two wavelengths packed in the 0.1 m, so _λ_ = 0.05 m.

17. B.

Sound speed and frequency are related by _f_ = _v_ / _λ_ , where _λ_ is constant since it is simply twice the length of the organ pipe. If sound speed is 2% slower, then _v_ decreases by a factor of 0.98, and _f_ decreases by a factor of 0.98. Thus _f_ decreases by 2%.

18. A.

The beat frequency in this case is _f_ beat = 29.1 Hz – 27.5 Hz = 1.6 Hz. Thus the period is _T_ = 1/ _f_ = 0.6 s.

19. D.

The problem states that the beat frequency is twice a second, or 2 Hz. This means that the E string frequency differs from true 660 Hz by 2 Hz. Thus it could be 658 Hz or 662 Hz.

20. D.

Choices A, B, and C look really tempting, since sound needs to come into it somehow. We know, however, that the energy starts in the strings and ends up as sound. Choice D describes sound in another way. After all, sound is a wave, which is a "sloshing back and forth" of kinetic and potential energy. Thus, D is the answer, the first medium being the guitar string and the second medium being air.

21. C.

Choice A is tempting since the mini-passage is about beats, but we hear beats only at the end of the procedure. For choice B, interference is the addition of two waves in the same medium, which is what happens when waves from both strings combine, but that is not the excitation of the C4 string. Choice C is when energy gets transferred from one oscillator to another of similar frequency by a weak coupling, so C is the answer. Choice D, dispersion, is the spreading of waves due to the dependence of wave speed on frequency (which we have not discussed).

22. A.

The beat frequency between the notes is _f_ beat = _f_ 2 – _f_ 1 = (784.87 – 783.99) Hz = 0.88 Hz.

23. B.

The figure shows the fundamental and the third harmonic for the C4 string. The fundamental frequency is given by _f_ 1 = _v_ /(2 _L_ ). The frequency of the third harmonic is given by _f_ 3 = _v_ /(2/3 _L_ ) = 3 _f_ 1. Thus to get the frequency of the fundamental, we need to divide 784.87 Hz by 3.

24. D.

The emitter is moving, and we choose the minus sign in the denominator because we want the answer to be greater than 420 Hz. Thus we have

25. C.

This time the detector is moving, and we choose the positive sign in the numerator to obtain an answer greater than 420 Hz (again they are approaching). Thus

26. B.

Again the emitter is moving, but this time we choose the positive sign:

27. D.

If the car were to hear the frequency, the frequency it would hear is given by

Now if it were to re-emit this frequency, the frequency detected by the police detector would be

This is the equivalent of sending a signal and having it reflect from a moving target. There are two Doppler shifts.

#### Passage 1

1. B.

According to paragraph 1, the wavelength must be shorter than the target insect. Thus the frequency must be greater than _f_ = _v_ / _l_ insect = 34300 Hz = 34.3 kHz.

2. B.

The sound pulse must travel from the bat to the insect, be reflected, and travel back again, for a total of 6 m. The time required is Δ _t_ = Δ _x_ / _v_ = 0.017 s.

3. B.

Since the insect and the bat are moving in the same direction at the same speed, there is no Doppler shift, and the detected frequency is simply 30 kHz. If you want to make sure, you can work this problem like problem 27 above.

4. C.

Higher harmonic content refers to higher frequencies being present in addition to the fundamental. These higher harmonic frequencies thus have shorter wavelength. This would not really aid in distance measurement, so choice A is incorrect. Stunning the insect? Choice B is also incorrect. There is a sentence in paragraph 1 which indicates that C is plausible, since shorter wavelengths are more likely to be reflected if the wavelength of the fundamental is too large. If the harmonics are Doppler shifted, then so is the fundamental, so choice D is incorrect.

5. D.

If the tree could detect a frequency, it would detect

If it re-emitted this frequency, then the bat would detect a frequency given by

There are two Doppler shifts.

You do not need to do the calculation to obtain the answer. Given the fact that the bat and the tree approach each other, the frequency must be increased, so D is the only possible answer.

The bat does not hear frequencies which are too far from those it sends out. Choice D is definitely not right, but it is interesting to think why. Why is such an adaptation completely useless?

#### Passage 2

1. A.

Use _λ_ = _v_ / _f_.

2. B.

We use _f_ beat = _f_ 1 – _f_ 2 = 80 kHz – 70 kHz = 10 kHz.

3. D.

In the upper figure we see the beat, so _T_ refers to the beat period, which is 1/ _f_ beat. The reason that the power never reaches zero is that the outgoing wave has a larger amplitude than the incoming wave.

4. A.

Maxima correspond to times when the two waves are in phase.

5. D.

Because the detected frequency is lower, the vehicle is receding, but there is no way to know from the passage whether it is doing so directly away or at an angle. The Doppler effect happens in three dimensions, and we have discussed only the one dimension parallel to the motion (which is the important one).

#### Passage 3

1. C.

You may have been tempted to choose D, but the question asks for the wavelength of the wave _in the pipe_ , not the wavelength of the wave in the air, so we cannot use 343 m/s. The passage describes the vibration as having antinodes at the midpoint and ends and a node at the one-quarter point. This is shown in the figure. One wavelength corresponds to the length of the pipe.

2. A.

We use _f_ = _v_ / _λ_.

3. C.

The waves in the pipe are analogous to waves on a string, and the hammer blow is a transverse blow. Sound waves in air must be longitudinal.

4. B.

We need to introduce at least one more node. If we introduce another node between the end and the place where the string attaches, that forces us to include three more nodes. The second fundamental is shown in the figure above. Three waves fit in 0.8 m, so the wavelength is 0.27 m.

#### Passage 4

1. B.

This is the definition of interference. Diffraction is the spreading of waves. Beats is a particular phenomenon which occurs when waves of similar frequency interfere. Difference tones have to do with the way the ear processes sound.

2. C.

The passage says that a note of average frequency turns on and off. Thus the perceived frequency is (30.87 Hz + 32.70 Hz)/2 = 31.79 Hz.

3. B.

This question asks for the beat frequency (times per second), so _f_ beat = 32.70 Hz – 30.87 Hz = 1.83 Hz.

4. C.

Choices A, B, and C all share the property that the difference is the desired frequency 110 Hz, but choice D is excluded. Choices A and B include frequencies lower than 110 Hz, which cannot possibly be harmonics, so A and B are incorrect.

5. B.

The pressure in the room does not change markedly from the equilibrium pressure. Sound is tiny variations of pressure. If the vertical axis were marked Δ _P_ = _P_ – _P_ eq, then an answer like A would be appropriate.

6. C.

According to paragraph 3, sound of two frequencies _f_ 1 and _f_ 2 enter the ear. Choice A is definitely wrong, especially with a wavelength drawn onto the graph. For that the horizontal axis must be a space coordinate like _x_. Choice B might show a portion of the power spectrum after some processing, but the frequency _f_ 1 – _f_ 2 does not enter the ear. The ear constructs the difference tone later. Choice C is correct. Choice D might have been correct if time were the horizontal coordinate.

#### Passage 5

1. B.

Since Alice is an equal distance from the speakers, and the speakers are emitting sound waves in phase, wave crests arrive at her location in phase. Thus she is at an antinode. Bob has moved to a position of relative silence, which must be a node.

2. C.

The waves arrive out of phase where Bob is sitting, because the wave from the left speaker takes a bit longer to arrive. When a crest from the right speaker is arriving, the corresponding crest from the left is still in transit. By the time it arrives, a trough is arriving from the right speaker.

3. D.

The sum of the two distances is not significant and cannot be derived from the information.

4. D.

The key here is that, for Bob, the waves arrive out of phase. When crest is coming from the left speaker, trough comes from the right. The difference is half a wavelength.

5. C.

Alice is positioned equidistant from the speakers, so for her the waves will still be in phase, so A and D are incorrect. Bob's location at a node depends on the wavelength of the sound, which we change when we change the frequency.

6. C.

Experiment 2 is the prescription for creating beats.

## Chapter 13 Solutions

1. C.

As the light beam goes from the glass to the air, it bends away from the normal (so the refracted beam makes a larger angle with the normal than the incident beam), and this eliminates A and B. As it passes into the glass it bends toward the normal.

2. C.

The dashed line shows the normal, and at the first interface the light bends toward the normal, which is down. At the second interface (normal is dashed line), the light bends away from the normal, which is down.

3. C.

As the light beam passes into the glass, the incident angle is 0°, so the transmitted ray is still horizontal. Passing into the air, the light bends down, away from the normal. At the interface with glass, the beam bends toward the normal, back to horizontal. Thus the answer is C. To see that the beam is indeed exactly horizontal, you need to work out Snell's law.

4. B.

At the first interface, from air to glass, the beam bends toward the normal (A and D are incorrect), and at the second interface, the beam bends away from the normal (C is incorrect).

5. A.

At the interface to air, the beam bends away from the normal, which is a radius, shown dashed. At the interface to glass, the beam bends toward the normal, which is again up.

6. C.

Snell's law becomes

7. A.

The reflected angle has the same magnitude as the incident angle.

8. C.

For the critical angle, we must have the refracted angle be 90°:

9. D.

The equation for critical angle becomes (setting θr = 90°)

Since sine cannot be greater than 1, there is no critical angle. There is a critical angle, and total internal reflection, only for light beams traveling from a slow medium encountering a fast one.

10. B.

The frequency of light is the same, although the wave speed, and thus wavelength, changes.

11. D.

In this case the incident angle is 60°, since the problem states that the angle with the horizontal is 30°. Thus,

If the refracted angle is 30°, then the ray makes an angle with the surface which is 60°.

12. A.

The frequency of the beam does not change as it goes from air to a salt crystal, but the wave speed does, so we have _λ_ = _v_ light/ _f_. Thus _λ_ = _c_ / _nf_. Since _n_ increases by a factor of 1.7, the wavelength must decrease by a factor of 1.7, so the answer is A.

13. B.

The figure shows the ray diagram. From this we can see the answer is B. If you want to use equations, you can write

where the negative sign indicates the image is on the same side as the object.

14. B.

From the diagram we observe the image is upright and virtual, since the rays must be extended to intersect.

15. D.

The magnification can be read from the diagram, or we can write

16. C.

The figure shows the ray diagram, from which we see the image is inverted and real.

17. C.

Since the index of refraction depends on the frequency, and the focal length depends on the refraction of the beam in the lens, dispersion causes the focal length to depend on frequency.

18. B.

The figure shows the ray diagram. From it we can read the position of the image close enough to realize that B is the answer. The equation is

19. B.

The magnification is given by

The candle image has a height

20. C.

We can get the focal length from the following equation:

21. B.

The magnification is given by

where the negative sign indicates the image is inverted.

22. D.

The figure shows the ray diagram for the candle 6 m from the mirror. From the diagram we can see that the image is about 12 m behind the mirror. The equation becomes

where the negative sign indicates the image is behind the mirror.

23. C.

We can read this from the diagram, or we can calculate _m_ = – _d_ i/ _d_ o = – (–12 m)/(6 m) = 2.

24. C.

From the diagram we see the image is in the same position as the object but inverted. If we wanted to do the calculation, we would write

25. C.

From the diagram we see the image is inverted and real.

26. C.

If the object is an infinite distance away, then the focus is on the focal plane, 12 m in front of the mirror. To see this in the equation, we write

27. C.

Conversely to the previous problem, light rays that start at the focus end up parallel.

28. A.

29. A.

30. B.

These answers can be read from the ray diagram (see figure).

31. B.

The figure shows the ray diagram.

32. B.

We calculate the focal length as follows:

where the positive sign indicates the mirror is converging.

33. C.

The magnification is given by _m_ = – _d_ i/ _d_ o = –(–4 m)/(2 m) = 2.

34. C.

We use the equation

35. B.

The first lens has a power _P_ 1 = 1/ _f_ = 1/2 D. We want a combination with total power _P_ tot = 1/ _f_ tot = 1/3 D. Thus _P_ 2 = _P_ tot – _P_ 1 = – 1/6 D.

36. B.

The focal length is 1/3 m, so the lens is a converging lens.

37. D.

The power of the combination is the sum of the powers.

#### Passage 1

1. B.

The light emerging from the first (left) polarizer has half the intensity of the original source, since the horizontal component has been taken out of it. All of the resulting light passes through the second (right) polarizer, since it is already vertically polarized. Thus the final beam has half the intensity of the original.

2. D.

The light emerging from the first polarizer has half the intensity of the original source, and it is vertically polarized. The second polarizer cuts out the vertical component and passes the horizontal component, so the resulting intensity is zero.

3. C.

Again, the light emerging from the first polarizer is vertically polarized and has intensity 1/2 _I_ 0. After it goes through the optically active substance, it may have _any_ orientation, since that information is not given in the problem. If the beam ends up horizontally polarized, then the resulting intensity is 1/2 _I_ 0. If it ends up vertically polarized, then the intensity is zero. If the more probable situation arises that the beam is somewhere between these two extremes, still polarized but at some oblique angle, then the resultant intensity is between 0 and 1/2 _I_ 0.

4. C.

Since the light is absorbed, the energy turns to heat.

5. D.

The passage states (paragraph 1) that radiation is emitted perpendicular to the wire. For the antenna in question 5, most of the radiation is emitted east, west, up, down, and so on, but none is emitted north and south.

#### Passage 2

1. C.

This is an application of the equation _f_ = _c_ / _λ_ = (3 x 108 m/s)/(520 x 10–9 m) = 5.8 x 1014 Hz.

2. C.

The figure shows the ray diagram for this problem. The diagram is not too much help in this problem, so we calculate

Since the magnification is –0.1, the size of the image is (0.1) (0.01 m) = 10–3 m and inverted.

3. A.

The subtended angle can be calculated from information in the third paragraph, that is, the ratio of the spatial separation of the top and bottom of the moth to the distance from the moth to the eye. Thus the angle is 0.01 m/0.25 m = 0.04 radians, which is about 2.3°.

4. D.

The desired power of the combination of corrective lens plus eye lens is 1/0.025 m = 40 D. Since _P_ combo = _P_ eye \+ _P_ correct, we must have _P_ correct = 5 D.

5. A.

The figure shows the red light focused on the retina. This lens refracts the blue light more than red light and hence focuses blue rays in front of the red focus. The figure exaggerates the case.

6. D.

According to the passage, if the camera is diffraction limited, then the resolution depends on the size of the lens (that is, light gathering hole) and the wavelength of the light used. Choices A, B, and C address neither of these issues. Increasing the size of the entire camera would increase the size of the lens, which would increase the resolution, by decreasing the resolution angle.

7. B.

Trying to determine if two dots are separate or blurred is analogous to trying to distinguish two headlights, so the information is in paragraph 3. The resolution of the eye is the ratio of dot separation to standing distance, so we write

2 x 10–4 = 0.002m/ _D_

_D_ = 10 m.

You must stand 10 m away.

8. A.

The best resolution we can hope for is diffraction limited, for which θdiff = θ/ _d_ = (520 x 10–9 m)/(2.4 m) = 2 x 10–7 rad. We have used green light as being representative of visible light.

9. C.

UV light has a shorter wavelength than visible light, so the diffraction angle θdiff = θ/ _d_ would decrease, giving a better resolution, assuming the apparatus is diffraction limited.

10. D.

Concerning choice A, a larger pupil does allow in more light, but this does not explain a decrease in resolution. For choice B, the opposite is true: a larger pupil allows more directional information to enter the eye, which should improve resolution if there were not another factor present. For choice C, both cats and humans contend with chromatic aberration (see question 5). The large lens introduces spherical aberration, so D is correct.

## Chapter 14 Solutions

#### Sections A–D

1. A.

For a repulsive force to exist, the balls must have like charge.

2. D.

At first it seems as if III can be definitely concluded. Then we remember that a charged object can attract a neutral object if it induces a charge, so D is the correct answer.

3. A.

By Coulomb's law, as the distance increases by a factor of 4, the force decreases by a factor of 42.

4. D.

Both charges increase by a factor of 2. Both contribute an increase of a factor of 2 to the force.

5. B.

By Coulomb's law, the force exerted by one charge on the other has the same magnitude as the force the other exerts on the first. This is an example of Newton's third law.

6. B.

This can be obtained by process of elimination. In choice A, the positive charges are concentrated in an area. Their mutual repulsion would cause them to move apart, so choice A is out. In choices C and D, the charges in the middle would be repelled by the charged ball and move to the left. So choices C and D are out.

7. B.

The positive charges will repel each other and, being free to move, will move as far apart as possible. Thus they will end up distributed as in choice B.

8. D.

The positive charges will repel each other, but not being free to move, they will remain where they are placed. The correct answer is D.

9. D.

First let's draw a diagram with all the forces. If _Q_ and – _Q_ are 2 x 10–6 m apart, then _q_ is 10–6 m from _Q_.

The force to the right due to charge _Q_ is _F_ elec = _kQq_ / _d_ 2 = 10–5 N, where we have used _d_ = 10–6 m. The force due to the charge – _Q_ is also to the right and has the same magnitude. The forces add to yield 2 x 10–5 N.

10. C.

First let's draw a diagram with all the forces.

The magnitude of the force in the – _x_ -direction is given by Coulomb's law, so that _F_ 1 = 3 x 10–5 N. Likewise _F_ 2 = 4 x 10–5 N. We obtain the total force by the Pythagorean theorem, _F_ tot = 5 x 10–5 N.

11. A.

First let's draw a diagram with all the forces on charge _q_.

The forces add to zero.

12. A.

The sodium ion Na+ is positively charged and attracts the oxygen atom. Oxygen is slightly negative because it is more electronegative than the hydrogen atoms to which it is attached.

13. C.

First, we draw a diagram.

The water molecule can be modeled as having a positive end and a negative end, so that is how we will draw it. The sodium ion exerts a force on each end, as shown. The repulsive force is greater than the attractive force because the positive end is nearer the sodium ion, and Coulomb's law states that the force varies as the inverse square of the distance.

14. A.

First we draw a diagram, showing the electric field from the various charges. ( The vector _E_ 1, is due to charge _Q_ 1 at _x_ = –10–3 m.)

Note that because point P is closer to the negative charge, the vector to the left is longer. The sum will be to the left, so the answer is A.

If we want to calculate the numbers, we calculate the magnitude

Likewise we calculate the magnitude

Subtracting these yields the result A.

15. D.

First we draw a diagram, showing the electric field from the various charges.

Both electric field vectors point toward the negative charge, and both vectors have a magnitude

Since there are two vectors of equal magnitude, the result is D.

16. A.

First we draw a diagram, showing the electric field from the various charges.

Note that the electric fields are of the same magnitude and point in the opposite direction, so the total electric field at that point is zero.

17. A.

First we draw electric field vectors into the diagram.

The horizontal components add to zero, and the vertical components are both up, away from the charges. Thus the answer is A.

18. B.

First we draw electric field vectors into the diagram.

The electric fields due to charges B and C add to zero, so the total electric field at point D is down.

19. A.

The electric fields due to the various charges add to zero.

20. B.

First we draw a diagram, showing the electric field from the various charges.

We read the direction from the diagram.

21. D.

Since _F_ = _qE_ , and the charge _q_ for an electron is negative, _F_ is the in opposite direction from _E_.

22. A.

The positively charged top plate will create a downward electric field, and a negatively charged bottom plate will create a downward field as well. Choice B will create an upward field, and choices C and D will not create electric fields at all.

23. B.

The force diagram for the ball is shown.

Force balance yields _F_ elec – _mg_ = 0. What do we use for _F_ elec? We do not have data for Coulomb's law, but we do have an electric field. Thus we write _QE_ – _mg_ = 0, where _Q_ is the charge on the ball. We obtain _Q_ = –2.25 x 10–6 C for the ball, where we have used _E_ = 400 N/C, and we have taken up to be positive. In order to check the sign on the charge, we realize that the electric force must be up. If the electric field is down, then a positive charge would experience a downward force. So the charge must be negative, so the electric force will balance gravity.

24. A.

We apply the formula _F_ = _q_ proton _E_ = (1.6 x 10–19 C) (4 x 104 N/C) = 6.4 x 10–15 N.

25. C.

The relevant equation is _F_ = _QE_. Since _E_ is constant, and _Q_ is twice as large for the alpha particle (helium has two protons and two neutrons), the force is twice as large.

26. D.

We need to relate acceleration to data in the problem. Let's start with _F_ = _ma_ , or

_a_ = _F/m_

where _F_ is the force on the proton (or electron), and _m_ is the mass of the proton (or electron). The force is given by _F_ = _qE_ , in both cases, so

_a_ = _qE/m_

The electron has a charge of opposite sign, _E_ is constant, and _m_ is 2000 times smaller. Therefore, the acceleration of the electron is of opposite direction and 2000 times greater.

27. C.

The positive end of the water molecule would experience a force in the same direction as the electric field, that is, up. The negative end of the molecule would experience a force in the opposite direction of the electric field, that is, down. The energy would be minimized, therefore, if the hydrogen end pointed up and the oxygen end down, so C is the answer.

28. A.

Note that this is not the orientation derived in problem 27. Let's draw a diagram showing the forces, and drawing the water molecule as a dipole. The forces cancel. (This is not like those problems in which one arrow is longer than the other, because the electric field here is uniform.)

29. C.

From the above diagram, we see that the molecule tends to be compressed.

30. B  
The clue here is the combination of energy and charge, so the equation to use is _W_ = _q_ Δ _V_. Although the problem specifies that the path is straight across, the energy is path independent, so we do not need that information. Thus

_W_ = _q_ ( _V_ D – _V_ A) = (10–14 C)(1000 V – 1000 V) = 0 J.

31. D

Again we use

_W_ = _q_ Δ _V_ = _q_ ( _V_ C – _V_ A)

= (–1.6 x 10–19 C)(–1000 J/C – 1000 J/C)

= 3.2 x 10–16 J

Let's check the sign. Moving a positive particle from 1000 V to –1000 V is downhill, so moving an electron is uphill, that is, an increase in energy.

32. D.

Whenever we see a problem about work or energy with charges, we know to write _W_ = _Q_ Δ _V_. Let's consider the charge _q_ 1 to be fixed and move charge _q_ 2 from initial distance _r_ i to final distance _r_ f (see figure).

Then, we have

Note that we get the same answer if we consider _q_ 2 fixed and move _q_ 1.

33. A.

Whenever we see a problem about work or energy with charges, we know to write _W_ = _Q_ Δ _V_. The charge we want to transfer is _Q_ = 10–10 C. Thus we have _W_ = (10–10 C) (–10,000 V – 10,000 V) = –2 x 10–6 J.

A positive charge going from 10,000 V to – 10,000 V is going downhill, so the negative sign is correct.

34. A.

Whenever we see a problem about work or energy with charges, we know to write _W_ = _Q_ Δ _V_. If we try to apply _W_ = _F_ Δ _x_ cos _φ_ , we are dead in the water, because, as the charge moves, _F_ changes. In this case the charge _q_ starts at point A, where the potential due to _Q_ is _V_ A = _kQ_ / _r_ 1 = 2 x 104 V, where we use _r_ 1 = 5 m. It moves to point B, which is _r_ 2 = 1 m away from _Q_ , so _V_ B = _kQ_ / _r_ 2 = 105 V. The work required is

_W_ = _q_ Δ _V_

= (–10–6 C)(–105 J/C – 2 x 104 J/C)

= –0.08 J

Does the sign make sense? Since we are moving a negative charge nearer a positive one, we expect that the energy required be negative.

35. A.

Whenever we see a problem about work or energy with charges, we know to write _W_ = _Q_ Δ _V_. If we try to apply _W_ = _F_ Δ _x_ cos _φ_ , we are lost. The potential at the starting point A is _V_ A = _kQ_ / _r_ 1, where _r_ 1 is 2 m. The potential at the ending point B is _V_ B = _kQ_ / _r_ 2, where _r_ 2 is 2 m. Thus the potential at the two points is the same, and no energy is required. This is the equivalent of moving a rock from one point 50 m above sea level to another point 50 m above sea level. You may move the rock uphill and downhill, but the total work required is zero, because you pull as much energy out of the rock as you put into it.

36. A.

Whenever we see a problem about work or energy with charges, we know to write _W_ = _Q_ Δ _V_. In this case, _Q_ is the charge of the electron, and Δ _V_ is the voltage rating of the dry cell.

37. A.

If we work out the electric potential at points A and B, we obtain

where _r_ 1 = 2 m and _r_ 2 = 4 m. But the calculation for _V_ B involves the same numbers, except that _r_ 1 = 2 m and _r_ 2 = 4 m. So _V_ B = _V_ A, and the potential difference is zero volts.

38. B.

The electric potential at point C is given by

since _r_ 3 = _r_ 4 = 5 m. (Use the Pythagorean theorem.)

39. B.

Its acceleration is given by force divided by mass, and the force is an inverse-square law with respect to distance. The force decreases as _q_ moves away from _Q_ , for the force decreases forever, never reaching zero.

40. C.

Since the acceleration is always positive (that is, away from charge Q), the velocity will increase forever. (There is no friction force in the problem to slow it down.) This narrows the answer to C or D. To distinguish between these possibilities we need an energy argument. The energy of the system starts as electrical potential energy, and is given by _E_ elec = _kQq_ / _r_ , where _r_ is their initial distance. (Recall that the electrical potential energy is the energy required to bring a system together from charges starting at infinity.) After the charge _Q_ has moved very far away, the energy of the system is all kinetic: 1/2 _mv_ 2. But since _E_ K can never be greater than _kQq_ / _r_ , there is a limit on the size of _v_. (See the figure for a sketch of _v_ versus _t_.)

41. B.

The energy starts as kinetic and ends as electrical potential. In order for there to be heat, there must be a large number of particles in random motion. Heat is not an appropriate concept with just two particles.

42. A.

The energy is conserved, so there is no energy entering or exiting. Furthermore, there is no heat generation or such nonsense, so the initial kinetic energy (1/2 _mv_ 2) is entirely converted to electrical potential energy. Thus if _v_ is increased by a factor of 4, then the initial kinetic energy is increased by a factor of 16, as is the final electrostatic energy.

43. A.

We derived the expression for the electric potential energy in Example 4 of Section F. (Note: The denominator is _r_ , not _r_ 2. This is not Coulomb's law, which is about force. This is an equation about energy.) If we set the expression for the initial kinetic energy equal to the final electrostatic energy, we obtain

Clearly _v_ and _r_ are inversely related, so if _v_ increases by a factor of 4, then _r_ decreases by a factor of 16.

44. D.

Using the right hand, point the thumb up, so that the fingers curl counterclockwise when viewed from the top. At point P the magnetic field is into the page.

45. B.

If the current is up, then the electrons (being negative) must be flowing down.

46. D.

The external force pulls the wire, so the electrons move in the same direction as the magnetic field. Thus there is no magnetic force on the electrons.

47. C.

Using the left hand, point the fingers down the page and the thumb toward you. The palm faces left, the direction of the magnetic force.

48. C.

Since the proton is speeding up, there is work being done on it, so it cannot be a magnetic force speeding it up. The acceleration of the proton is to the right, so the force is to the right. The electric field must be to the right as well.

49. C.

There is a force on the proton up the page. If it is an electric force, then the electric field points up the page. If it is a magnetic force, then the force would be provided by a magnetic field pointing into the page.

50. B.

If a proton is placed at point A, it experiences no magnetic force (it is not moving). But it will feel the attraction toward the electrons, down the page. This indicates that the direction of the electric field is down (toward the electrons). It does not matter that the electrons are moving.

51. A.

The tricky part here is realizing that if the electron beam moves to the right, then the current points to the left. Using the right hand with the thumb pointing left (or the left hand with the thumb pointing right, either one), the fingers curl in the direction into the page at point A.

52. D.

We use the left hand (because electrons are negative) to figure out the direction of the magnetic force. The fingers point down and the thumb to the right. The palm faces out of the page, so that is the direction of the magnetic force. We are told that the electric force opposes it, so it must be into the page. If the electric field points out of the page, then its force on an electron is into the page (because the electron is negative).

53. A.

No matter what point along the wire loop we choose, if we apply the right hand rule, we obtain a magnetic field pointing out of the page.

54. B.

Using the right hand, point the fingers out of the page and the thumb up. The palm faces to the right, so the answer is B. Choices C and D are definitely out anyway, because a magnetic force cannot speed up or slow down a particle (that is, it does no work).

#### Passage 1

1. A.

The frequency of the radiation is the same as the frequency of the alternating current, 107 Hz. The wavelength of the radiation is _λ_ = _c_ / _f_ = (3 x 108 m/s)/(107 Hz) = 30 m. For a quarter-wave antenna (see paragraph 3), the length would be 7.5 m.

2. D.

According to the passage, the electric field "points along the same axis as the current" that produces it. Since the antenna is vertical, the current it carries is vertical, so the electric field is vertical as well.

3. B.

The magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction of propagation (north/south) and to the electric field (up/down). So the magnetic field must point east/west.

4. B.

The electric field points up and down, so the force on the electrons in the antenna is up and down as well. The electrons should be free to move in this direction if an alternating current is to be set up. Thus the antenna should be vertical.

5. B.

When you think of an electric field, you should immediately think of force on a charge. Choice B is correct in that the force creates the current. (Choice C is incorrect because the electrons are not bound to individual atoms.)

6. A.

The energy starts as electrical.

#### Passage 2

1. A.

Since the electric field is directed away from the wire, this indicates that the charge on the wire is positive.

2. B.

At a distance 0.01 m from the wire, the electric field is _E_ = (3 x 104 Nm/C)/(0.01 m) = 3 x 106 N/C. To obtain force, we calculate _F_ = _q_ elec _E_ = 4.8 x 10–13 N. Since the electric field is directed away from the wire, the force on the electron is toward the wire.

3. D.

The electric field lines point in the same direction that the field points, that is, away from the wire.

4. B.

The force of a charged particle in an electric field is simply _F_ = _QE_. The charge on the fluoride ion is due to an extra electron, so it is –1.6 x 10–19 C. The charge on the hydrogen ion is 1.6 x 10–19 C. Thus the force on the fluoride is the same in magnitude and opposite in direction.

5. C.

In an butanol molecule, the oxygen atom is the most electronegative atom, so it is negatively charged relative to the rest of the molecule. Since the electric field points away from the wire, the negative oxygen experiences a force toward the wire.

#### Passage 3

1. B.

The force on a charged particle in an electric field is _F_ = _QE_ , so the oxygen ion (O2–) experiences twice the force.

2. A.

A calcium atom has no charge, so the force on it would be zero.

3. C.

Increasing the pressure would put the gas particles closer to each other, so an electron could not travel as far before colliding with a particle. Thus the mean free path would decrease. If the electron is not able to travel as far, then the energy it gains is less. (The kinetic energy it gains is about _F_ elec _l_ mfp, from the standard formula for work.) Thus the electron is not likely to create a spark. A greater electric field is required, so the threshold is higher.

4. D.

The mass density does not have anything to do with this phenomenon, so choices A, B, and C are out. It is true that an electron absorber will inhibit the phenomenon like killing a baby in its crib.

5. C.

This graph shows the constant acceleration (due to the constant force) of the electron in the parts of the graph which have a small positive slope. The rapid decreases in velocity are the times of collision where the electron loses energy.

## Chapter 15 Solutions

1. C.

The electric current is the amount of charge going by a point in the circuit per unit time. In a flow of water, the analogous parameter is the amount (volume) of water going past a point per unit of time, the volume flow rate. Note that the current is the same for resistors in series, and the volume flow rate is constant along a flow (if there is no branching), which is not true of flow velocity.

2. D.

Height gives a measure of the energy per mass required to place water at that point, just as electric potential is a measure of the energy per charge required to place a charge at that point.

3. C.

A battery pumps charge from one electric potential to another.

4. C.

A pool is a large supply of water from which you can take or to which you can add water without disturbing it. A ground is a large supply of charge.

5. A.

We can label the circuit diagram with currents and voltages. Clearly, the current which flows through resistor 2 is the current which flows through the entire circuit. To obtain this current, we can combine resistors. Since they are in series, we simply add in order to obtain the equivalent circuit shown below.

The current, from Ohm's law, is _I_ = (18 V)/(90 Ω) = 0.2 A. If you chose C, then you probably tried to apply Ohm's law by substituting in 18 V for the potential drop across the resistor. But the potential drop is not nearly so large, as is shown in the first diagram of this solution. We need to consider the entire circuit to obtain the current in any one place. This is like water in a pipe, in that the current at one point is affected by conditions (such as a partial blockage) both upstream and downstream.

6. B.

See the above explanation.

7. C.

In the circuit diagram we label voltages and currents. The current splits into two unequal pieces. The current through resister 1 is given by Ohm's law: _I_ 1 = 6 V/1 Ω = 6 A. The current through resister 2 is _I_ 2 = 6 V/2 Ω = 3 A. Of course, this is not surprising, since we would expect that the lesser resistance would have the greater current if the voltage drops are equal.

8. B.

See above explanation.

9. D.

We label the voltages and currents in the circuit diagram, beginning with 0 volts at the short end of cell 1. Because of the jump of _V_ 1 = 6 V, we label the wire on the other side 6 volts. The short end of the cell 2 is 6 V, so a jump of 9 V means the wire on the other side is 15 V. Thus the potential drop across the resistor is 15 V. Ohm's law gives us _I_ = 15 V/60 Ω = 0.25 A.

10. B.

Since the bulbs are in series, the current through them is the same.

11. C.

We label voltages and currents in the circuit diagram. We can read off that the potential difference between C and D is 18 V.

12. D.

In this case, Ohm's law is Δ _V_ i = _IR_ i, since _I_ is constant. The light bulb with the higher resistance has a proportionally higher potential drop.

13. C.

To obtain the total current, we draw an equivalent circuit, combining the voltage sources and the two resistor light bulbs (see figure). Ohm's law yields 0.4 A.

14. C.

For this question, we can simply apply Ohm's law to obtain Δ _V_ 1 = _I_ 1 _R_ 1 = (2 A) (4 Ω) = 8 V.

15. B.

Since resistors 1 and 2 are in series, the current going through them must be the same.

16. B.

Since the current through resistor 2 is 2 amps, the voltage drop across it is _I_ 2 _R_ 2 = 4 V. If we label point A to be 0 V, then a jump of 4 V will bring us to point B.

17. B.

We can label the circuit diagram with voltages and currents, but this does not give us the answer immediately because we do not know the potential drop across resistor 1. (If you chose D, you should pay attention to this point.) First let's combine resistors 2 and 3, as shown in the equivalent circuit below. The resulting resistance is given by

(If you chose C, you forgot to take the final reciprocal.) We combine the resistors in series to obtain the equivalent circuit shown. The total current is 6 amps, which is also the current through resistor 1.

18. B.

Since resistors 2 and 3 are in parallel, the voltage drop across both of them are the same.

19. A.

The resulting new circuit is shown in the diagram. The potential drop across resistor 2 is the full 36 V. Thus the voltage increases when A and B are connected.

20. D.

The resulting new circuit is shown in the diagram. But what is this? Definitely a problem. We have shorted the circuit. Do not try this at home.

21. A.

On the circuit diagram, we label the potentials. The current splits into three pieces. By Ohm's law we can calculate the current through light bulb 2, _I_ 2 = (6 V)/(20 Ω) = 0.3 A. From this we can get power, _P_ 2 = _I_ 2 Δ _V_ 2 = 1.8 Watts = 1.8 J/s. In 10 seconds, 18 Joules are dissipated.

22. C.

23. C.

If the connection through light bulb 1 were interrupted, then we obtain the circuit shown. The electric potential across light bulb 2 is the same 6 V that it was before, so it burns in the same way.

Question 23 is essentially the same question. The 6-V potential across light bulb 3 does not change if current through light bulb 2 is interrupted.

24. D.

The short is made clear in the resulting circuit diagram. If you tried this in real life the battery would get very hot while a large current surged through the wire connection.

25. A.

We draw potentials and currents on the circuit diagram, but we know neither the potential drop nor the current for resistor 1. We can obtain this current, however, by combining resistors. Since the resistors are in series, we obtain _I_ = 12 V/6 Ω = 2 A. Thus the current through resistor 1 is 2 A, and the potential difference across it is _I R_ 1 = 4 V. Thus the power dissipated is _P_ 2 = _I_ 2Δ _V_ 2 = 8 Watts.

26. D.

From the circuit diagram (Problem 25) we can see that the sum of the potential drops across the resistors must be 12 V. We could obtain another relationship, since the current through both resistors is the same. Thus

but this does not correspond to any of the choices.

27. A.

We draw in potentials and currents in the circuit diagram. Introducing a resistor at point C would split the potential drop across light bulb 3, decreasing the power _P_ 3 = (Δ _V_ 3)2/ _R_ 3, so choice D is out. Decreasing the emf of the battery would decrease the power of resistor 3, so C is out. If we hold the potential drop across light bulb 3 constant, then a decrease in the resistance will increase the power since, again, _P_ 3 = (Δ _V_ 3)2/ _R_ 3. So A is correct.

28. C.

The power dissipated (that is, the energy per unit time) is constant. If the question had asked, "What is the energy dissipated look like as a function of time?", then D would have been the answer. B might have been the answer if the source were alternating current.

29. B.

Since current can no longer go through the wire with light bulb 1, light bulb 2 extinguishes. Choices A and C are eliminated. Does light bulb 3 burn brighter? The potential drop across light bulb 3 is not a function of what happens in the upper wire. The potential across it remains 6 V. Its current does not change, and the power it dissipates does not change.

30. D.

We draw a new circuit with A and B connected. In this new circuit, light bulb 2 has the full 6 volts across it, so it burns brighter.

31. C.

In order to obtain the total current, we need the total resistance of the circuit. Lights 1 and 2 are in parallel, so we can combine their resistances to obtain 1 Ω. The resulting equivalent circuit is shown above. The last two resistors can be combined to obtain 3 Ω as shown below. The total current is 4 amps.

32. D.

It is difficult to know how the potential across light 1 compares with the potential across light 3. On the other hand, the whole current through the potential source goes through light 3 and splits in half before going through lights 1 and 2. (Later it recombines and returns.) Since the power dissipated is _P_ res = _I_ 2 _R_ and resistance is the same for lights 1 and 3, the fact that light 3 has twice the current means it dissipates 4 times the power.

33. C.

The resulting circuit diagram is shown. The new wire ensures that the potential on both sides of lights 1 and 2 is zero. So these lights extinguish. On the other hand, light 3 gets the full 12 volts, so it burns brighter.

34. D.

See the diagram above.

35. C.

The new circuit diagram is shown. The new wire ensures that the potential on both sides of light 3 is zero, so it goes out. Lights 1 and 2 are brighter.

36. A.

We apply the equation for resistors in parallel:

37. D.

Voltage does not flow. The question makes as much sense as asking what height is flowing in a river.

38. A.

The potential drop across resistor 2 is 6 volts, so the current through it is _I_ 2 = 0.03 A, and the power dissipated by it is _P_ 2 = 0.18 Watts. In 600 s, it dissipates _E_ = _P_ 2Δ _t_ = 108 Joules.

39. C.

The circuit diagram is simply that shown above. Since the power is given by _P_ = _I_ Δ _V_ , we obtain the current from _I_ = 300 W/120 V = 2.5 A. The resistance is 120 V/2.5 A = 48 Ω.

40. B.

Combining the power equation with Ohm's law yields _P_ = (Δ _V_ )2/ _R_ , where Δ _V_ = 120 V is a constant. To increase power, we want to decrease the resistance. A longer wire will increase resistance, while a thicker wire will decrease it, since _R_ = _ρl_ / _A_.

41. C.

In the previous problem we mentioned _P_ = (Δ _V_ )2/ _R_ , where Δ _V_ = 120 V is a constant. If we graph _P_ versus _R_ , we obtain something like C.

42. A.

Ignoring the unfamiliar symbol and the dashed lines around the battery, we see that this is just a circuit with two resistors in series. We can combine the resistors into one with resistance _R_ T = _R_ \+ _R_ int (see figure). Ohm's law yields the result, which we can estimate by _I_ = 6 V/0.6 Ω = 10 A.

43. B.

Since _R_ int is added to the external resistance of the circuit, we can ignore it if the external resistance is large (see the above solution). If the external resistance is large, then the current is small, so either II or III would allow us to ignore the internal resistance.

44. C.

The formal solution to the problem involves writing down Ohm's law for this circuit and then solving for 1/ _I_ :

1/ _I_ is not proportional to _R_ , but this equation has the familiar _y_ = _mx_ \+ _b_ form, with positive slope and positive _y_ -intercept. Let's say you did not think of that. We know that as resistance R increases, the current _I_ decreases, which means 1/ _I_ must increase, so that eliminates A and B. In choice D, there is a resistance where 1/ _I_ is zero, and the current is infinite. But you cannot obtain that from this circuit, so choice D is out.

#### Passage 1

1. C.

There is an electric field _E_ 1 between the plates, and the force on a charged particle is given by _F_ elec = _QE_ 1. Since a helium nucleus has twice the charge of a proton, the force on it is double.

2. A.

In Experiment 2 the increase in distance results in a decrease in capacitance by a factor of 3 (see equation). Since Δ _V_ is the same in Experiment 2, the charge ( _Q_ = _C_ Δ _V_ ) decreases by a factor of 3.

3. A.

The electric field is simply given by _E_ = Δ _V_ / _d_ , so an increase in _d_ by a factor of 3 results in a decrease in the electric field by a factor of 3.

4. B.

Once the wires are removed from the plates, no more charge may be transferred, so the charge must stay the same. This is a situation in which the question becomes easy if we visualize the charges and think about the experiment. The question is difficult or intractable if we rely on rote memorization of equations.

5. C.

The capacitance is decreased by a factor of 2 since the distance is increased by a factor of 2. The charge is still _Q_ 1 since there is no way for it to change. Thus the potential between the plates _must_ change. The only equation we have relating voltage and charge is Δ _V_ = _Q_ / _C_ , so Δ _V_ increases by a factor of 2.

#### Passage 2

1. A.

We have changed the potential across the plates, but we have not changed the capacitor itself. Thus its capacitance does not change. (Capacitance depends only on the capacitor itself, not on the applied potential.)

2. D.

The capacitance does not change, so the charge must increase by a factor of 4, since we have _Q_ = _C_ Δ _V_.

3. D.

The electric field is _E_ = Δ _V_ / _d_ , so the electric field increases by a factor of 4.

4. B.

After the wires are removed, no charge can be transferred from one plate to the other. The dielectric is a nonconductor.

5. A.

The charge _Q_ is constant, but the capacitance increases by a factor of 9. Thus the potential Δ _V_ = _Q_ / _C_ decreases by a factor of 9.

#### Passage 3

1. A.

Capacitance is defined as charge per potential. Both are given in the passage.

2. B.

The formula Δ _V_ = _E_ Δ _x_ works here, where Δ _x_ is the separation between the Earth's surface and the ionosphere. The Earth and the ionosphere are like a parallel-plate capacitor which has been bent into a sphere.

3. A.

The work required is given by _W_ = _q_ Δ _V_ = (–1.6 x 10–19 C) (9 x 105 J/C) = –1.4 x 10–13 J. But we are unsure about the sign. The Earth has a negative charge, so taking an electron away from it is easy: a downhill ride, so to speak. Thus the change in potential energy is negative.

4. D.

The electric field points away from a positive charge and toward a negative one. Thus it points toward the Earth and away from the ionosphere. The other two pictures are reminiscent of the Earth's magnetic field.

5. A.

Since the passage said that the potential difference between the ionosphere and the Earth's surface is 9 x 105 volts, we can exclude C and D. For a proton, going from the surface to the ionosphere is uphill, that is, going to greater potential energy away from the Earth's negative charge. Therefore A is the correct answer.

#### Passage 4

1. A.

A sodium ion (Na+) is positively charged, and the negatively charged central wire will attract it.

2. A.

It does not matter what kind of molecule this is. The only thing that matters is its neutral charge. The passage states that it will be attracted to the wire.

3. D.

Since this question is about energy and charges, our guess is that we will use _W_ = _q_ Δ _V_ somewhere. A fluoride ion near the negative wire has high potential energy, so it gains kinetic energy as it moves away from the wire. The change in potential energy is _q_ Δ _V_ = (–1.6 x 10–19 C) (5 x 104 J/C) = –8 x 10–15 J. (Recall: a fluoride ion has one extra electron, so its charge is the same as an electron.) The increase in kinetic energy is thus 8 x 10–15 J, since energy is being conserved. Now some energy may be lost to heat, and so on, so this is actually the maximum energy available.

4. B.

The main formula we have for capacitance is _C_ = _Q_ /Δ _V_ , which may tempt you to think that an increase in potential would lead to a decrease in capacitance, but this is not so. The capacitance of a device is fixed by the construction of that device, and the amount of stored charge goes up proportionally as the potential. An increase in potential would result in an increase in the charge on the wire _Q_ wire, but the capacitance remains the same.

5. C.

The only thing we can do with the new piece of information is to combine it with the information in the third paragraph, to obtain the power usage of _P_ = (300 J/m3) (100 m3/s) = 3 x 104 Watts. The question asks for current, and the only connection we know of between power and current is potential difference. Aha! _I_ = _P_ /Δ _V_ = (3 x 104 J/s)/(5 x 104 J/C) = 0.8 C/s.

6. D.

The electric field lines point away from the positive charge and toward the negative charge.

7. D.

The attraction of neutral particles to a charged wire is like a charged comb attracting neutral pieces of paper. Choice A does not refer to charges at all. Choice B involves two charged particles, and choice C involves two neutral species. Choice D refers to a charged and a neutral species, just like the wire and the pollutants. A charge is induced on the pollutants, and the resulting net force is attractive (see chapter text).

#### Passage 5

1. B.

We have several formulas involving electric field: _E_ = _kQ_ / _r_ 2 for a point charge, _E_ = Δ _V_ /Δ _x_ , and _F_ = _qE_. We are not given the charge of the cloud in the passage (and even if we were, it would be difficult to get _E_ from it), nor are we given a force on a charge. But we are told the potential Δ _V_ between the cloud and the Earth and the distance Δ _x_ between them. Thus _E_ = (108 J/C)/(2 x 103 m) = 5 x 104 N/C. (To get the units, recall J = Nm.)

2. A.

The main formula with resistance in it is Ohm's law. Do we have enough information? Yes, the current is given in the second paragraph _I_ = 20 kamps. We can write _R_ = Δ _V_ / _I_ = (108 V)/(2 x 104 A) = 5 x 103 Ω.

3. B.

Let's go through the passage scanning for information that could go together to get an energy estimate. The first piece of information is 2 km, but that is not helpful. (If a single object moved 2 km under the influence of a constant force, we could obtain its energy _W_ = _F_ Δ _x_ cos _φ_ , but there is no information about force.) Next we are given the potential between cloud and ground, and we could get an energy if we knew an amount of charge that was transferred. But we are given that in the next paragraph. Thus _W_ = _q_ Δ _V_ = (4 C) (108 J/C) = 4 x 108 J. (This represents the work done on the charge by the electric field.)

4. A.

This is easy if we remember that current is the rate at which charge moves, _I_ = _Q_ /Δ _t_. Thus Δ _t_ = _Q_ / _I_ = (4 C)/(2 x 104 C/s) = 2 x 10–4 s.

5. B.

Since the electric field points away from a positive charge, it will point away from the positive lightning rod, especially away from the very positively charged tip.

6. B.

Visible light results from the electrical transition of electrons in atoms and molecules. Dissociation of molecules may produce some light, but excitation of molecules is a better answer. (Ionization and recombination would have been another good answer, if it had been a choice.) Heating and expansion of air is lower on the energy scale, producing merely thunder.

#### Passage 6

1. C.

According to the third paragraph, the positive sodium ions are transported to the outside of the cell. The outside of the cell acquires a positive charge and a higher potential. So C is the correct choice. The diffusion of potassium ions lessens the effect, but the qualitative picture is the same.

2. A.

The cells are stacked in series. Thus the current through all the cells is the same, and the total current is simply 30 milliamps. Remember, the currents add up if the components of the current are in parallel. The voltages add up in series.

3. C.

We know the current during the activated state is 30 mA. Current is the rate at which charge is transferred, so if the time for the activated state is 2 ms, then the charge transferred is _I_ Δ _t_ = (30 x 10–3 C/s) (2 x 10–3 s) = 6 x 10–5 C.

4. B.

The electric field points away from positive charges and toward negative charges. So where are the charges during the activated state? A glance at Figures 1 and 3 shows that the fish pushes positive charges from its tail to its head, so a positive charge collects at the head of the fish, and a negative charge at its tail. Thus the answer is B.

5. D.

To obtain the magnetic field, we need to consider the current. The main current during the activated state is along the fish from tail to head. The right-hand rule applied to this implies a magnetic field circling the body in the direction shown in choice D. The secondary currents outside the fish in the fourth figure reinforce this magnetic field. On problems like this one, if you are in doubt, choose one typical point and apply the right-hand rule. For instance, choose the point under the fishes belly. If the magnetic field there is to the right, choose A; up, B; left, C; or into the page, D.

6. D.

Sea water has the charge carriers which make it more conductive. You knew this.

## Chapter 16 Solutions

1. D.

The force on the proton is given by _F_ = _qE_. This gives us the acceleration from _a_ = _F_ / _m_ , and since we are given the initial velocity _v_ 1 = 0 m/s, the final velocity is given by _v_ 2 = _v_ 1 \+ _a_ Δ _t_ = ( _qE_ / _m_ ) Δ _t_ = (1.6 x 10–19 C)(1.6 x 102 N/C)(10–4 s)/(1.7 x 10–27 kg) = 1.5 x 106 m/s. (Notice how easy it is to do the arithmetic if the variables are manipulated first and the numbers substituted afterwards.)

2. C.

The force on a particle is simply _F_ = _qE_ 0. The charge on the deuteron (one proton and one neutron) is the opposite of the charge on the electron. Thus the forces on the two are the same in magnitude.

3. A.

The symbol 20F– represents an ion with a nucleus of 9 protons (hence F) and 11 neutrons (hence mass number 20) and 10 electrons outside the nucleus (hence the overall charge). For this problem, the overall charge is all that is needed. Since _F_ = _qE_ 0, the magnitudes of the forces are the same.

4. A.

The magnitude of the acceleration is given by _a_ = _F_ / _m_ = _qE_ 0/ _m_. The electric field is constant, of course. The charges of the proton and the electron are equal in magnitude and are opposite in sign. The proton is 2000 times more massive, so its acceleration is 2000 times smaller.

5. C.

We have _a_ = _qE_ 0/ _m_ from Problem 4. Now 1H has one half the charge of 4He (decreasing the acceleration by a factor of 2) and one fourth the mass (increasing the acceleration by a factor of 4). The result is an increase by a factor of 2, as expressed in answer C.

6. B.

The nuclei have the same charge (both have one proton). The forces on both are the same.

7. D.

If we write the atomic numbers explicitly, we obtain

The subscripts already add to 92, so adding a proton (11H) on the right would ruin the sum. On the other hand, the superscripts add to 235 on the left and to 233 on the right. If we add two neutrons to the right (10n + 10n), then the sum becomes correct.

8. B.

The reactants are  . Thus the superscripts must add to 6, so C is not the answer. The subscripts must add to 4, so A and D are eliminated.

9. C.

The left side of the reaction is represented by

so the superscripts add to 16 and the subscripts add to 8. This eliminates A and B (recall that _·_ represents no protons and no neutrons). The problem with choice D is that 23Li cannot exist, since the mass number (total number of protons and neutrons) must be greater than the atomic number (number of protons).

10. C.

The energy of the transition is the same as the energy of the photon _E_ ph = _hf_ = _h_ ( _c_ / _λ_ ) = 1.3 x 10–18 J. Therefore the new energy level differs from the ground state (0 J) by 1.3 x 10–18 J. Is it positive or negative? Since the ground state represents the lowest energy, the excited state must be +1.3 x 10–18 J.

11. D.

There are three possible transitions, as shown in the figure below. Thus D is the answer. In order to get the frequencies listed, we calculate _f_ 1 = (1 ev – 0 ev)/(4.14 x 10–15 ev s) = 2.4 x 1014 Hz, and cetera.

12. D.

The six possible transitions are shown in the figure below.

13. B.

The lower limit for visible light is 4.0 x 1014 Hz, which corresponds to _E_ photon = _hf_ = (4.14 x 10–15 ev s) (4.0 x 1014 Hz) = 1.7 ev, and the upper limit corresponds to _E_ photon = (4.14 x 10–15 ev s) (7.5 x 1014 Hz) = 3.1 ev. The only transition to fall in these limits is from –2.5 ev to 0 ev.

14. C.

The young scientist calculates a photon energy _E_ photon = _hf_ = (4.14 x 10–15 ev s) (4.8 x 1014 Hz) = 2.0 ev. Since this is a transition from the ground state, it must be a transition from –5 ev (the ground state) to –3 ev (an excited state).

15. B.

The energy of transition is the same as the energy of the photon _E_ ph = _hf_ = (4.14 x 10–15 ev s) (2.01 x 1014 Hz) = 0.83 ev. Thus the excited state is 0.83 ev above the ground state at –5.37 ev. So the energy level is at –4.54 ev.

16. B.

The wavelength is given by _λ_ = _c_ / _f_.

17. C.

The frequency given in the choices corresponds to _E_ transition/ _h_. If a photon has any energy greater than this, then 5.37 ev of the energy will liberate the electron from the atom, and the rest of the energy will go into the kinetic energy of the electron.

18. B.

We write the nuclear reaction

The subscript of the daughter nucleus must be 27, and the superscript must be 55. Thus the daughter is  .

19. D.

We write the nuclear reaction

The subscript of the parent nucleus is 90, and the superscript is 226. Thus the parent is  .

20. C.

We write the nuclear reaction

Thus the daughter is  .

21. C.

If we add in the subscripts and add notation to the beta particles, we obtain

**A.**

**B.**

**C.**

**D.**

Choice B does not have heavy hydrogen as a product, and choices A and D do not satisfy the criteria that the sub- and super-scripts have the same sum on both sides.

22. A.

Recall that the symbol for the neutron is n or 10n 10n. The only reaction which satisfies the criteria is A.

23. C.

Eight thousand years is five halflives. If we multiply 1 gram by 1/2 five times, we obtain (1/2)5 g = 1/32 g = 3.1 x 10–2 grams.

24. C.

A decrease in radioactivity from 300 to 20 mCi is a decrease of about a factor of 16, that is, four factors of 2. Four halflives corresponds to 57.2 days, which is close to C. The formal way to do this problem is to write

25. C.

A glance at the answers indicates we need get only an estimate. We want to know how much uranium we need to obtain 1012 J. The amount of mass that needs to be converted each second is given by

26. A.

We calculate

_m_ def = 4 (1.00783 amu) – 4.00260 amu

27. A.

The reaction we seek is

We calculate

_m_ def = (7.01601 + 1.00783 – 2 (4.00260)) amu

28. C.

The original 8Be must have more mass than the final products in order for the reaction to occur. The mass deficit is converted into the kinetic energy of the resulting products.

29. C.

This is a simple application of _E_ = _mc_ 2.

30. B.

Choices C and D are nonsensical. Choice A is possible, but in fact the principle of mass-energy conservation is completely general. The energy of a reaction must be in the form of mass before the reaction occurs. It is, however, quite small for chemical reactions, about a million (106) times smaller than for nuclear reactions.

#### Passage 1

1. B.

We see from the energy level diagram that the smallest energy from ground state to excited state is from _n_ = 1 to _n_ = 2. The difference in energy is

_E_ photon = (–3.4 – –13.6) ev

2. D.

By definition, ionization energy is the amount of energy required to remove an electron from an atom (or molecule) in its ground state. The energy level diagram shows this to be 13.6 ev.

3. A.

The photon energy corresponds to the difference between the two energy states. Certainly B and C are incorrect. It is not the case that we must merely have enough energy to reach the next rung of the ladder. We have to hit it exactly. Compare this with problem 17, where we wanted to ionize the atom. In that case we can hit the atom with a photon of greater energy because the excess goes into kinetic energy. We have no way of soaking up the extra energy in this case.

4. C.

Both momentum and energy are conserved because there are no external forces in this scenario. Energy is converted from one form to another: from the energy of an excited state to photon energy and (much less) kinetic energy of the recoiling atom.

5. D.

We want the longest wavelength, which means the smallest frequency (since _f_ = _c_ / _λ_ ), which means the smallest energy (since _E_ = _hf_ ). If we look at the energy level diagram for the differences between levels, we see there is a transition corresponding to a largest energy, but the energy difference can get as small as you like (at the upper end of the diagram).

#### Passage 2

1. C.

The energy level diagram makes clear that the largest transition is the transition of absorption, from the ground state to the highest energy level. Thus those photons have the most energy and the highest frequency.

2. D.

On the other hand, nothing in the passage indicates that the energy difference between levels 1 and 2 should be less than (or greater than) the energy difference between level 1 and the ground state.

3. A.

The question refers to the transition from state 1 ( _E_ 1) to the ground state ( _E_ = 0), so the frequency is _f_ = ( _E_ 1 – 0)/ _h_.

4. D.

Clearly state 2 is not very populated, since transitions out of state 2 to state 1 (or to the ground state) occur very quickly. Otherwise, the passage is silent on this issue, so D is the answer.

5. A.

The Sun emits photons of all sorts of frequencies; that is what makes the colors of the rainbow. And many photons make it through the atmosphere.

#### Passage 3

1. A.

The text mentioned that alpha radiation is not very penetrating, able to be blocked even by several centimeters of air. Beta and gamma radiation are more penetrating. Because this radiation is blocked by a single sheet of gold, it must be alpha radiation, so the product must be 205Pb.

2. C.

The only information we need here is that the alpha particles are positive. In an electric field which points up, they will experience a force up.

3. C.

We need only know that the alpha particles are positive. Applying the right hand rule for magnetic force indicates a force to the left as viewed from the top.

4. B.

Since the radiation is blocked by several centimeters of aluminum, it is not gamma radiation. But it is not alpha radiation, since a sheet of metal foil fails to block it. Is it normal beta radiation or positron radiation? The information from the magnetic field indicates the particles are positive. Thus the decay is positron decay.

5. A.

After 19 hours, the radioactivity of the sample decreases by a factor of 4, that is, two halflives. Its half-life is 9.5 hours, which is what the question asks for.

6. D.

Each 9.5 hours sees a decrease by a factor of 2 in radioactivity. Therefore, the sample will never have zero radioactivity. (However, there must be a last atom to decay, so the answer "indefinitely" is better than "forever".)

#### Passage 4

1. D.

Choice A represents the positron decay, which is forbidden for subtle quantum reasons. Choice B represents normal beta decay, which does not happen for this nucleus. Choice C does not have balanced subscripts. Choice D fits the description in the question.

2. B.

According to the passage, K-capture happens under the same conditions which promote positron decay, that is, proton-rich nuclei. That is to say, nuclei with more protons than neutrons have a negative _N_ – _Z_.

3. B.

According to the passage, the possibility of electron capture is nonzero only if there is some overlap of the electron wavefunction and the nucleus, so if the orbital has vanishing amplitude near the nucleus, the probability of capture is small.

4. C.

Choice A is incorrect because the neutrino hardly interacts with matter (see paragraph 2). The whole point of K-capture is to turn one of the many protons into a neutron, so the neutron is not likely to change back, and choice B is incorrect. Since K-capture pulls an electron from the innermost shell, that orbital is empty and can be filled by another electron from outer shells. This is accomplished by emitting photons, so choice C is a possibility. There is no positron created, so choice D is incorrect.

5. A.

During normal beta decay, a neutron goes away (N decreases by 1) and a proton appears in its place ( _Z_ increases by 1). The net effect is _N_ – _Z_ decreases by 2.

6. C.

During alpha decay, both _N_ and _Z_ decrease by 2, so _N_ – _Z_ stays the same.

#### Passage 5

1. D.

We write the reaction

The only choice for the missing particle that satisfies the criteria that the superscripts and subscripts add up is

2. C.

Choice A is nonsensical. Choice B misses the point, since the question asks _why_ these neutrons do not tend to ionize the tissue. The passage indicates (paragraph 2) that a charged particle with large energy is ideal for ionizing tissue, so a neutron with no charge and little energy will do little harm. Choice C is a likely possibility. Choice D is excluded since neutrons are an elementary particle.

3. B.

Choices C and D do not have the superscripts and subscripts balanced. Choice A does not satisfy the description in the passage, in that there is no gamma ray in the products.

4. D.

The reaction is

5. D.

The 7.8 years represents 3 halflives, so the original sample decreased by a factor of 2 three times. The original sample must have been 0.08 moles.

6. B.

Choice A is spontaneous neutron drip, not fission. Choice B is correct. Choice C is nearly correct, except the reaction is not spontaneous. For a reaction to be spontaneous there can be only the one reactant. Choice D is excluded for the same reason.

7. C.

This is a paraphrase of the second sentence of paragraph 3.

#### Passage 6

1. B.

Most of the energy goes into the ionization of molecules. The energy comes from nuclear energy.

2. D.

We write the reaction

The particle which balances the superscripts and subscripts is 42He, which is an alpha particle.

3. B.

We write the reaction

The nucleus which balances the superscripts and subscripts is

4. C.

Glucose marked with 15O would react chemically (almost exactly) the same as glucose with 16O, so choices A and B are incorrect. The chemical environment of the nucleus hardly affects its decay, which is entirely due to nuclear physics, so D is out. In fact, a halflife of 128 seconds is very short. Just for your information, the other problem is that the glucose gets completely metabolized before there is a chance to detect its presence. The FDG tends to build up in the cell since it cannot be metabolized as easily.

5. D.

The 8 minutes is about 4 halflives, so the activity must have decreased by a factor of 2 four times. Its initial activity was 160 mCi.

6. A.

We write the reaction

This equation seems to be already balanced. The only particle which can be placed in the products without disturbing the balance is a gamma particle.
