MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for us. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.
There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any control system, however well designed, including the possibility of human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Management must make judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of any specific control measure. The design of a control system also is based in part upon assumptions and judgments made by management about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that a control will be effective under all potential future conditions. As a result, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting can provide no more than reasonable assurance with respect to the fair presentation of financial statements and the processes under which they were prepared.
Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP follows this Report.
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Loews Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 9, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company's change in its method of accounting for measurement of credit losses on financial instruments in 2020.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Loews Corporation
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (a) 2 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 9, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for measurement of credit losses on financial instruments in 2020.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves - Property & Casualty - Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements.
Critical Audit Matter Description
The estimation of property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expense reserves (“P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves”), including those claims that are incurred but not reported, requires significant judgment. Estimating P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves is subject to a high degree of variability as it involves complex estimates that are generally derived using a variety of actuarial estimation techniques and numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain. Modest changes in judgments and assumptions can materially impact the valuation of these liabilities, particularly for claims with longer-tailed exposures such as workers’ compensation, general liability and professional liability claims.
Given the significant judgments made by management in estimating P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, auditing P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our actuarial specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves included the following, among others:
• We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the determination of P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, including those controls related to the estimation of and management’s review of P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.
• We tested the underlying data, including historical claims, that served as the basis for the actuarial analyses, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimates were accurate and complete.
• With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:
o We developed a range of independent estimates of P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and compared our estimates to the recorded reserves.
o We compared our prior year estimates of expected incurred losses to actual experience during the most recent year to identify potential bias in the Company’s determination of P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Future policy benefit reserves - Long Term Care - Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The estimation of long term care future policy benefit reserves (“LTC future policy benefit reserves”) requires significant judgment in the selection of key assumptions, including morbidity, persistency (inclusive of mortality), discount rate and future premium rate increases.
A gross premium valuation (“GPV”) is performed annually to assess the adequacy of the LTC future policy benefit reserves. The actuarial assumptions underlying the recorded LTC future policy benefit reserves are “locked-in” absent an indicated premium deficiency. If the GPV indicates the recorded LTC future policy benefit reserves are not adequate (i.e. a premium deficiency exists), the assumptions are “unlocked” and the LTC future policy benefit reserves are increased to eliminate the premium deficiency.
Estimating future experience for long term care policies is subject to significant estimation risk as the required projection period spans several decades. Morbidity and persistency experience can be volatile while discount rates and premium rate increases can be difficult to predict. Modest changes in each of these assumptions can materially impact the valuation of these liabilities.
Given the significant judgments made by management in estimating LTC future policy benefit reserves, auditing LTC future policy benefit reserves required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our actuarial specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to LTC future policy benefit reserves included the following, among others:
• We tested the effectiveness of controls related to the determination of LTC future policy benefit reserves, including those controls related to the estimation of and management’s review of LTC future policy benefit reserves.
• We tested the underlying data, including demographic and historical claims data, that served as the basis for the actuarial analyses, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimates were accurate and complete.
• With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:
o We independently recalculated a sample of LTC future policy benefit reserves and compared our estimates to the recorded reserves.
o We evaluated the key assumptions applied in the GPV analysis, including comparing those assumptions to the Company’s historical experience, underlying portfolio yield and market data.
o We assessed the Company’s projection of future cash flows to evaluate the reasonableness of the 2020 charge related to unlocking LTC future policy benefit reserves to recognize a premium deficiency as a result of the most recently completed GPV.
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets- Refer to Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The evaluation of offshore drilling equipment, specifically drilling rigs, for impairment occurs whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
When the Company determines that the carrying value of a drilling rig may not be recoverable, an undiscounted probability-weighted cash flow analysis is prepared to determine if there is a potential impairment. If the carrying value of a drilling rig is not recoverable, the carrying value is reduced to its fair value determined using a discounted probability-weighted cash flow analysis. These analyses utilize certain assumptions for each drilling rig under evaluation and consider multiple probability-weighted utilization and dayrate scenarios. The Company’s development of the dayrate assumption involves significant judgment relative to the current and expected market for the drilling rigs and expectations of future oil and gas prices.
Given the significant judgments made by management to identify indicators of impairment and to prepare probability-weighted cash flow analyses to determine if potential impairments exist and to measure fair value, auditing these impairment analyses required a high degree of auditor judgment, including the involvement of fair value specialists, and increased extent of effort related to evaluating indicators of impairment, including the utilization and dayrate assumptions used in the probability-weighted cash flow analyses.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to (i) the identification of indicators of impairment and (ii) the evaluation of the Company’s probability-weighted cash flow analyses for those drilling rigs with factors that indicated potential impairment included the following, among others:
• We evaluated the Company’s identification of impairment indicators by:
o Corroborating information used to identify impairment indicators through independent inquiries of offshore drilling marketing and operations personnel and by performing an independent assessment of potential indicators of impairment utilizing the individual drilling rig history, asset class history for dayrates, backlog and potential drilling rig opportunities.
o Considering industry and analysts reports and the impact of macroeconomic factors, such as future oil and gas prices, on the Company’s process for identifying indicators of impairment.
o Comparing the timing of impairments recorded by the Company with the timing of impairments recorded by the Company’s peers.
• With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the Company’s probability-weighted cash flow analyses for those drilling rigs with factors that had indicators of potential impairment by:
o Evaluating the reasonableness of the utilization and dayrate assumptions utilized in the Company’s probability-weighted cash flow analyses by evaluating potential drilling rig opportunities and considering industry reports and data.
o Comparing the assumptions used in the Company’s previous probability-weighted cash flow analyses to the assumptions used in the current probability-weighted cash flow analyses to assess for management bias.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of presentation − Loews Corporation is a holding company. Its consolidated subsidiaries are engaged in the following lines of business: commercial property and casualty insurance (CNA Financial Corporation (“CNA”), an 89.6% owned subsidiary); transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids (Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipelines”), a wholly owned subsidiary); the operation of a chain of hotels (Loews Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels & Co”), a wholly owned subsidiary); and the manufacture of rigid plastic packaging solutions (Altium Packaging LLC (“Altium Packaging”), a 99% owned subsidiary). Unless the context otherwise requires, the term “Company” as used herein means Loews Corporation including its consolidated subsidiaries, the term “Net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation” as used herein means Net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation shareholders and the term “subsidiaries” means Loews Corporation’s consolidated subsidiaries.
In the second quarter of 2020, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”) was deconsolidated from the Company’s consolidated financial statements. See Note 2 for further discussion.
Principles of consolidation - The Consolidated Financial Statements include all subsidiaries and intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in associated companies in which the Company generally has an interest of 20% to 50%.
Accounting estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Investments - The Company classifies its fixed maturity securities as either available-for-sale or trading, and as such, they are carried at fair value. Short term investments are carried at fair value. Changes in fair value of trading securities are reported within Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in fair value related to available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of Other comprehensive income.
The cost of fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, which are included in Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amortization of premium and accretion of discount for fixed maturity securities takes into consideration call and maturity dates that produce the lowest yield.
For asset-backed securities included in fixed maturity securities, the Company recognizes income using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments predominantly using the retrospective method.
To the extent that unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities supporting long term care products and structured settlements not funded by annuities would result in a premium deficiency if those gains were realized, a related increase in Insurance reserves is recorded, net of tax and noncontrolling interests, as a reduction of net unrealized gains through Other comprehensive income (“Shadow Adjustments”). Shadow Adjustments increased $515 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) and $1.0 billion (after tax and noncontrolling interests) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, net unrealized gains on investments included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) were correspondingly reduced by Shadow Adjustments of $2.5 billion (after tax and noncontrolling interests) and $2.0 billion (after tax and noncontrolling interests).
Equity securities are carried at fair value. CNA’s non-redeemable preferred stock investments contain characteristics of debt securities, are priced similarly to bonds and are held primarily for income generation through periodic dividends. While recognition of gains and losses on these securities is not discretionary, CNA does not consider the changes in fair value of non-redeemable preferred stock to be reflective of its primary operations. As such, the changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded through Investment gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company owns certain common stock with the intention of holding the securities primarily for market appreciation and as such, the changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded through Net investment income (loss).
The Company’s carrying value of investments in limited partnerships is its share of the net asset value of each partnership, as determined by the general partner. Certain partnerships for which results are not available on a timely basis are reported on a lag, primarily three months or less. These investments are accounted for under the equity method and changes in net asset values are recorded within Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Mortgage loans are commercial in nature, are carried at unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized fees and an allowance for expected credit losses, and are recorded once funded. The allowance for expected credit losses on mortgage loans is developed by assessing the credit quality of pools of mortgage loans in good standing using debt service coverage ratios (“DSCR”) and loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios. The DSCR compares a property’s net operating income to its debt service payments, including principal and interest. The LTV ratio compares the current unpaid principal balance of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan. The pools developed to measure the credit loss allowance use increments of DSCR and LTV to draw distinctions between risk levels. CNA applies expected credit loss rates by pool to the outstanding receivable balances. Changes in the allowance for mortgage loans are presented as a component of Investment gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Mortgage loans are included in Other invested assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Prior to 2020, mortgage loans were evaluated on an individual loan basis considering the collection experience of each loan and other credit quality indicators such as DSCR and the credit-worthiness of the borrower or tenants of credit tenant loan properties. Mortgage loans were considered to be impaired and a loss incurred when it was probable that contractual principal and interest payments would not be collected and any impairment losses were recognized as a direct write-down of amortized cost. Interest income from mortgage loans is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective yield method.
Investments in derivative securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported as a component of Investment gains (losses), Net investment income or Other comprehensive income (loss), depending on their hedge designation. A derivative is typically defined as an instrument whose value is “derived” from an underlying instrument, index or rate, has a notional amount, requires little or no initial investment and can be net settled. Derivatives include the following types of investments: interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, put and call options, warrants, futures, forwards, commitments to purchase securities, credit default swaps and combinations of the foregoing. Derivatives embedded within non-derivative instruments (such as call options embedded in convertible bonds) must be split from the host instrument when the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host instrument.
An available-for-sale security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its cost adjusted for accretion, amortization and allowance for credit losses. When a security is impaired, it is evaluated to determine whether CNA intends to sell the security before recovery of amortized cost or whether a credit loss exists. Losses on securities that CNA intends to sell are recognized as impairment losses within Investment gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. If a credit loss exists, an allowance is established and the corresponding amount is recognized as an impairment loss within Investment gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allowance for credit losses related to available-for-sale fixed maturity securities is the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. In subsequent periods, the allowance is reviewed, with any changes in the allowance presented as a component of Investment gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the difference between the amortized cost basis, net of the allowance, and the fair value, are recognized in Other comprehensive income.
Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether an impairment loss has occurred for a security. CNA follows a consistent and systematic process for determining and recording an impairment loss, including the evaluation of securities in an unrealized loss position and securities with an allowance for credit losses on at least a quarterly basis.
CNA’s assessment of whether an impairment loss has occurred incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information. A credit loss exists if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis. Significant assumptions enter into these cash flow projections including delinquency rates, probable risk of default, loss severity upon a default, over collateralization and interest coverage triggers and credit support from lower level tranches. CNA considers all available evidence when determining whether an investment requires a credit loss write-down or allowance to be recorded. Examples of such evidence may include the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, whether the issuer is current with interest and principal payments, credit ratings on the security or changes in ratings over time, general market conditions and industry, sector or other specific factors and whether it is likely that CNA will recover its amortized cost through the collection of cash flows.
Prior to 2020, CNA’s assessment of whether an impairment loss occurred also incorporated both quantitative and qualitative information. Fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position that CNA intended to sell, or it more likely than not would be required to sell before recovery of amortized cost, were considered to be impaired and the entire difference between the amortized cost basis and fair value of the security was recognized as an impairment loss in earnings as a direct write-down of amortized cost. The remaining fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position were evaluated to determine if a credit loss existed. If a credit loss was determined to exist, the credit loss was recognized in earnings as a direct write-down of amortized cost.
Credit losses - The allowances for credit losses on fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, reinsurance receivables, insurance receivables and trade receivables are valuation accounts that are reported as a reduction of a financial asset’s cost basis and are measured on a pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The allowance is estimated using relevant available information from both internal and external sources. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses and adjustments may be made to reflect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for additional factors that come to the Company’s attention. This could include significant shifts in counterparty financial strength ratings, aging of past due receivables, amounts sent to collection agencies, or other underlying portfolio changes. Current and forecast economic conditions are considered, using a variety of economic metrics and forecast indices. The sensitivity of expected credit losses relative to changes to the forecast of economic conditions can vary by financial asset class. A reasonable and supportable forecast period is up to 24 months from the balance sheet date. After the forecast period, the Company reverts to historical credit experience. Collateral arrangements such as letters of credit and amounts held in beneficiary trusts to mitigate credit risk are considered in the estimate of the net amount expected to be collected. Amounts are written off against the allowance when determined to be uncollectible. Prior to 2020, the allowance for doubtful accounts for reinsurance, insurance and trade receivables was measured using an incurred loss methodology.
A policy election has been made to present accrued interest balances separately from the amortized cost basis of assets, and a practical expedient has been elected to exclude the accrued interest from the tabular disclosures for mortgage loans and available-for-sale securities. An election has been made not to estimate an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables. The accrual of interest income is discontinued and the asset is placed on nonaccrual status within 90 days of the interest becoming delinquent. Interest accrued but not received for assets on nonaccrual status is reversed through Net investment income. Interest received for assets that are on nonaccrual status is recognized as payment is received. The asset is returned to accrual status when the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, and future payments are expected. Interest receivables are presented in Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
Joint venture investments -Loews Hotels & Co has interests in operating joint ventures related to hotel properties over which it exercises significant influence, but does not have control over them. Loews Hotels & Co uses the equity method of accounting for these investments. Loews Hotels & Co’s investment in these entities was $299 million and $356 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and is reported in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Equity income (loss) for these investments was $(73) million, $69 million and $73 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and is reported in Operating expenses and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These equity method investments are reviewed for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.
Hedging - The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses (both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. When it is determined that a derivative for which hedge accounting has been designated is not (or ceases to be) highly effective, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. See Note 3 for additional information on the Company’s use of derivatives.
Securities lending activities - The Company lends securities for the purpose of enhancing income or to finance positions to unrelated parties who have been designated as primary dealers by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Borrowers of these securities must deposit and maintain collateral with the Company of no less than 100% of the fair value of the securities loaned. United States of America (“U.S.”) Government securities and cash are accepted as collateral. The Company maintains effective control over loaned securities and, therefore, continues to report such securities as investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Securities lending is typically done on a matched-book basis where the collateral is invested to substantially match the term of the loan. This matching of terms tends to limit risk. In accordance with the Company’s lending agreements, securities on loan are returned immediately to the Company upon notice. Collateral is not reflected as an asset of the Company. There was no collateral held at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Revenue recognition - Premiums on property and casualty insurance contracts are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured and are principally earned ratably over the term of the policies. Premiums on long term care contracts are earned ratably over the policy year in which they are due. The reserve for unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired terms of coverage.
Property and casualty contracts that are retrospectively rated or subject to audit premiums contain provisions that result in an adjustment to the initial policy premium depending on the contract provisions. These provisions stipulate the adjustment due to loss experience of the insured during the coverage period, or changes in the level of exposure to insurance risk. For such contracts, CNA estimates the amount of ultimate premiums that it may earn upon completion of the coverage period and recognizes either an asset or a liability for the difference between the initial policy premium and the estimated ultimate premium. CNA either adjusts such estimated ultimate premium amounts during the course of the coverage period based on actual results to date or by conducting premium audits after the policy has expired to determine the final exposure to insured risks. The resulting adjustment is recorded as either a reduction of or an increase to the earned premiums for the period.
Insurance receivables include balances due currently or in the future, including amounts due from insureds related to paid losses under high deductible policies, and are presented at unpaid balances, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2020, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $33 million for insurance receivables has been established using a loss rate methodology to determine expected credit losses for insurance receivables. This methodology uses CNA’s historical annual credit losses relative to gross premium written to develop a range of credit loss rates for each dollar of gross written premium underwritten. The expected credit loss for amounts due from insureds under high deductible and retrospectively rated policies is calculated on a pool basis, informed by historical default rate data obtained from major rating agencies. Changes in the allowance are presented as a component of Other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amounts are considered past due based on policy payment terms. Insurance receivables and any related allowance are written off after collection efforts are exhausted or a negotiated settlement is reached.
CNA’s non-insurance warranty revenues are primarily generated from separately-priced service contracts that provide mechanical breakdown and other coverages to vehicle or consumer goods owners, which generally provide coverage from one month to ten years. For warranty products where CNA acts as the principal in the transaction, Non-insurance warranty revenue is reported on a gross basis, with amounts paid by customers reported as Non-insurance warranty revenue and commissions paid to agents reported as Non-insurance warranty expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, CNA provides warranty administration services for dealer and manufacturer warranty products. Non-insurance revenues are recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with CNA’s customers are satisfied, which is generally over time as obligations are fulfilled. CNA recognizes non-insurance warranty revenue over the service period in proportion to the actuarially determined expected claims emergence pattern. Customers pay in full at the inception of the warranty contract. The liability for unearned warranty revenue, reported as Deferred non-insurance warranty revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents the unearned portion of revenue in advance of CNA’s performance, including amounts which are refundable upon cancellation.
Contract costs to obtain or fulfill non-insurance warranty contracts with customers are deferred and recorded as Deferred non-insurance warranty acquisition expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These costs are expected to be recoverable over the term of the contract and are amortized in the same manner the related revenue is recognized. CNA evaluates deferred costs for recoverability including consideration of anticipated investment income. Adjustments to deferred costs, if necessary, are recorded in the current period results of operations.
Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling revenues primarily result from providing a drilling rig and the crew and supplies necessary to operate the rig, mobilizing and demobilizing the rig to and from the drill site and performing rig preparation activities and/or modifications required for the contract. Consideration received for performing these activities may consist of dayrate drilling revenue, mobilization and demobilization revenue, contract preparation revenue and reimbursement revenue for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services and other services requested by the customer. Diamond Offshore accounts for these integrated services provided within its drilling contracts as a single performance obligation satisfied over time and comprised of a series of distinct time increments in which drilling services are provided. The total transaction price is determined for each individual contract by estimating both fixed and variable consideration expected to be earned over the term of the contract. The standard contract term ranges from two to 60 months.
Boardwalk Pipelines primarily earns revenues by providing transportation and storage services for natural gas and natural gas liquids and hydrocarbons (referred to together as “NGLs”) on a firm and interruptible basis and provides interruptible natural gas parking and lending services. The majority of Boardwalk Pipelines’ operating subsidiaries are subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulations and certain revenues collected, under certain circumstances, may be subject to possible refunds to its customers. An estimated refund liability is recorded considering regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and estimated total exposure. The majority of Boardwalk Pipelines’ revenues are from firm service contracts which are accounted for as a single promise to stand ready each month of the contract term to provide the committed capacity for either transportation or storage services. The transaction price is comprised of a fixed fee based on the capacity reserved plus a usage fee paid on the volume of commodity transported or injected and withdrawn from storage. Both the fixed and the usage fees are allocated to the single performance obligation of providing transportation or storage service and recognized over time as control is passed to the customer. These service contracts can range in term from one to 20 years and are invoiced monthly.
Loews Hotels & Co provides lodging and related goods and services as well as management and marketing services. Lodging and related revenues are recognized as the guest takes possession of the goods or receives the services. Management and marketing services revenues are recognized as the services are provided and billed on a monthly basis. In addition, Loews Hotels & Co recognizes revenue for the reimbursement of payroll and other expenses as they are incurred on behalf of the owners of joint venture and managed hotel properties.
Altium Packaging is a packaging solutions provider and manufacturer in North America, serving a diverse customer base in the pharmaceutical, dairy, household chemicals, food/nutraceuticals, industrial/specialty chemicals, water and beverage/juice segments. Altium Packaging recognizes revenue when obligations under the terms of a contract with a customer have been satisfied. This occurs at the time control is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon delivery or completion of the manufacturing process.
Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves - Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, except reserves for structured settlements not associated with asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&EP”), workers’ compensation lifetime claims and long term care claims, are not discounted and are based on (i) case basis estimates for losses reported on direct business, adjusted in the aggregate for ultimate loss expectations; (ii) estimates of incurred but not reported losses; (iii) estimates of losses on assumed reinsurance; (iv) estimates of future expenses to be incurred in the settlement of claims; (v) estimates of salvage and subrogation recoveries and (vi) estimates of amounts due from insureds related to losses under high deductible policies. Management considers current conditions and trends as well as past CNA and industry experience in establishing these estimates. The effects of inflation, which can be significant, are implicitly considered in the reserving process and are part of the recorded reserve balance. Ceded claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reported as a component of Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are presented net of anticipated amounts due from insureds related to losses under deductible policies of $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. A significant portion of these amounts are supported by collateral. CNA also has an allowance for uncollectible deductible amounts, which is presented as a component of the allowance for doubtful accounts included in Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Structured settlements have been negotiated for certain property and casualty insurance claims. Structured settlements are agreements to provide fixed periodic payments to claimants. CNA’s obligations for structured settlements not funded by annuities are included in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and are discounted at a weighted average interest rate of 6.5% and 7.1% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the discounted reserves for unfunded structured settlements were $520 million and $497 million, net of discount of $657 million and $724 million. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the amount of interest recognized on the discounted reserves of unfunded structured settlements was $35 million, $36 million and $40 million. This interest accretion is presented as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations but is excluded from the disclosure of prior year loss reserve development.
Workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves are calculated using mortality assumptions determined through statutory regulation and economic factors. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves are discounted at a 3.5% interest rate. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the discounted reserves for workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves were $258 million and $293 million, net of discount of $113 million and $135 million. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the amount of interest accretion recognized on the discounted reserves of workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves was $15 million, $21 million and $16 million. This interest accretion is presented as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but is excluded from the Company’s disclosure of prior year loss reserve development.
Long term care claim reserves for policyholders that are currently receiving benefits are calculated using mortality and morbidity assumptions based on CNA and industry experience. These long term care claim reserves are discounted at a weighted average interest rate of 5.8% and 5.9% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, such discounted reserves totaled $2.7 billion, net of discounts of $439 million and $462 million.
Future policy benefit reserves - Future policy benefit reserves represent the active life reserves related to CNA’s long term care policies for policyholders that are not currently receiving benefits and are computed using the net level premium method, which incorporates actuarial assumptions as to morbidity, persistency, inclusive of mortality, discount rate, future premium rate adjustments and expenses. Expense assumptions primarily relate to claim adjudication. These assumptions are locked in over the life of the policy; however if a premium deficiency emerges, the assumptions are unlocked, and the future policy benefit reserves are increased. The September 30, 2020 gross premium valuation (“GPV”) indicated a premium deficiency of $74 million and future policy benefit reserves at that date were increased accordingly. As a result, the long term care active life reserves carried as of September 30, 2020 represent management’s best estimate assumptions at that date with no margin for adverse deviation. Long term care active life reserves are discounted at a weighted average interest rate of 5.4% and 5.7% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
In circumstances where the cash flow projections supporting future policy benefit reserves are expected to result in profits being recognized in early future years followed by losses in later future years, the future policy benefit reserves are increased in the future profitable years by an amount necessary to offset losses that are projected to be recognized in later future years. The amount of the additional future policy benefit reserves recorded in each period is determined by applying the ratio of the present value of future losses divided by the present value of future profits from the most recently completed GPV to long term care core income in that period.
Insurance-related assessments - Liabilities for insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated and when the event obligating the entity to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the liability balances were $82 million and $84 million.
Reinsurance - Reinsurance accounting allows for contractual cash flows to be reflected as premiums and losses. To qualify for reinsurance accounting, reinsurance agreements must include risk transfer. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity.
Reinsurance receivables related to paid losses are presented at unpaid balances. Reinsurance receivables related to unpaid losses are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefit reserves. Reinsurance receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cost of reinsurance is primarily accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies or over the reinsurance contract period. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary liability of CNA.
As of December 31, 2020, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $21 million for reinsurance receivables has been established which relates to both amounts already billed on ceded paid losses as well as ceded reserves that will be billed when losses are paid in the future. For assessing expected credit losses, CNA separates reinsurance receivables into two pools: voluntary reinsurance receivables and involuntary receivables related to mandatory pools. CNA has not recorded an allowance for involuntary pools as there is no perceived credit risk. The principal credit quality indicator used in the valuation of the allowance on voluntary reinsurance receivables is the financial strength rating of the reinsurer sourced from major rating agencies. If the reinsurer is unrated, an internal financial strength rating is assigned based on CNA’s historical loss experience and the assessment of reinsurance counterparty risk profile, which generally corresponds with a B rating. Reinsurer financial strength ratings are updated and reviewed on an annual basis or sooner if CNA becomes aware of significant changes related to a reinsurer. The allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables is estimated on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer financial strength rating and solvency, industry experience and current and forecast economic conditions. Because billed receivables generally approximate 5% or less of total reinsurance receivables, the age of the reinsurance receivables related to paid losses is not a significant input into the allowance analysis. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables are presented as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Amounts are considered past due based on the reinsurance contract terms. Reinsurance receivables related to paid losses and any related allowance are written off after collection efforts have been exhausted or a negotiated settlement is reached with the reinsurer. Reinsurance receivables from insolvent insurers related to paid losses are written off when the settlement due from the estate can be reasonably estimated. At the time reinsurance receivables related to paid losses are written off, any required adjustment to reinsurance receivables related to unpaid losses is recorded as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
A loss portfolio transfer is a retroactive reinsurance contract. If the cumulative claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses ceded under a loss portfolio transfer exceed the consideration paid, the resulting gain from such excess is deferred and amortized into earnings in future periods in proportion to actual recoveries under the loss portfolio transfer. In any period in which there is a revised estimate of claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses and the loss portfolio transfer is in a gain position, the deferred gain is recalculated as if the revised estimate was available at the inception date of the loss portfolio transfer and the change in the deferred gain is recognized in earnings.
Deferred acquisition costs - Deferrable acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting and policy issuance costs which are incremental direct costs of successful contract acquisitions. Acquisition costs related to property and casualty business are deferred and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs are presented net of ceding commissions and other ceded acquisition costs.
CNA evaluates deferred acquisition costs for recoverability. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs. Adjustments, if necessary, are recorded in current period results of operations.
Policyholder dividends - Policyholder dividends are paid to participating policyholders within the workers’ compensation and surety lines of business. Net written premiums for participating dividend policies were approximately 1% of total net written premiums for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Dividends to policyholders are accrued according to CNA’s best estimate of the amount to be paid in accordance with contractual provisions and applicable state laws. Dividends to policyholders are presented as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Goodwill and other intangible assets - Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets of acquired entities. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when certain triggering events require additional tests. Subsequent reversal of a goodwill impairment charge is not permitted.
Other intangible assets are reported within Other assets. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Indefinite-lived other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or when certain triggering events require such tests. See Note 7 for additional information on the Company’s goodwill and other intangible assets.
Property, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of properties. Leaseholds and leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the terms of the related leases (including optional renewal periods, where appropriate) or the estimated lives of improvements, if less than the lease term.
The principal service lives used in computing provisions for depreciation are as follows:
Impairment of long-lived assets -Long-lived and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets and intangibles with finite lives, under certain circumstances, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential to the Company are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
Income taxes − The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated tax return. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates and other provisions of the tax law. The effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes may not be realized.
The Company recognizes uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. See Note 10 for additional information on the provision for income taxes.
Pension and postretirement benefits - The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit plans in Other assets or Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in funded status related to prior service costs and credits and actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the year in which the changes occur through Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company measures its benefit plan assets and obligations at December 31. Annual service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service costs and credits and amortization of actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Stock-based compensation - Loews Corporation records compensation expense upon issuance, modification or cancellation of all share-based payment awards granted, primarily on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally three to four years. Stock Appreciation Rights (“SARs”) are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive. These assumptions include the term that the awards are expected to be outstanding, an estimate of the volatility of the underlying stock price, applicable risk-free interest rates and the dividend yield of Loews Corporation’s stock. Restricted Stock Units are valued using the grant-date fair value of Loews Corporation’s stock.
Net income per share - Basic net income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of Loews Corporation common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue Loews Corporation common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 0.1 million potential shares attributable to issuances and exercises under the Loews Corporation 2016 Incentive Compensation plan and the prior plan were excluded in the calculation of diluted net income per share because the effect would have been antidilutive due to the net loss position of the Company. In addition, there were 0.2 million shares attributable to employee stock-based compensation awards excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share because the effect would have been antidilutive. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, 0.7 million and 0.9 million potential shares attributable to issuances and exercises under the Loews Corporation 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan and the prior plan were included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no shares attributable to employee stock-based compensation awards excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share because the effect would have been antidilutive.
Foreign currency - Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in Shareholders’ equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The Company’s foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each reporting date and income statement accounts are translated at the average exchange rates during the reporting period. There were foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of $12 million, $(3) million and $0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Regulatory accounting - The majority of Boardwalk Pipelines’ operating subsidiaries are regulated by FERC. Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (“Texas Gas”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipelines, applies regulatory accounting to certain assets for GAAP purposes, which records certain assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which independent third party regulators establish rates. Gulf South Pipeline Company, LLC (“Gulf South”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipelines, has implemented fuel trackers, for which regulatory accounting is applied. Accordingly, the value of fuel received from customers paying the maximum tariff rate and the related value of fuel used in transportation are recorded to a regulatory asset or liability depending on whether Gulf South uses more fuel than it collects from customers or collects more fuel than it uses. Other than as described for Texas Gas and the fuel trackers for Gulf South, regulatory accounting is not applicable to Boardwalk Pipelines’ other FERC regulated entities or operations.
Supplementary cash flow information - Cash payments made for interest on long term debt, net of capitalized interest, amounted to $463 million, $560 million and $558 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Cash payments for federal, foreign, state and local income taxes amounted to $20 million, $190 million and $101 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Investing activities include $63 million of previously accrued capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2020 and exclude $17 million and $15 million of accrued capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Accounting changes - In June of 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” The updated accounting guidance requires changes to the recognition of credit losses on financial instruments not accounted for at fair value through net income. For financial assets measured at cost, the expected credit loss model requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses over the life of the asset and presentation of the asset at the net amount expected to be collected. This new guidance applies to mortgage loan investments, reinsurance and insurance receivables and other financing and trade receivables. For available-for-sale fixed maturity securities carried at fair value, estimated credit losses will continue to be measured at the present value of expected cash flows, however, the other than temporary impairment (“OTTI”) concept has been eliminated. Under the previous guidance, estimated credit impairments resulted in a write down of amortized cost. Under the new guidance, estimated credit losses are recognized through an allowance and reversals of the allowance are permitted if the estimate of credit losses declines. For available-for-sale fixed maturity securities where there is an intent to sell, impairment will continue to result in a write down of amortized cost.
On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the updated guidance using a modified retrospective method with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to beginning Retained earnings. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the previous accounting guidance. A prospective transition approach is required for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities that were purchased with credit deterioration (“PCD assets”) or have recognized an OTTI write down prior to the effective date. The cumulative effect of the accounting change resulted in a $5 million decrease in Retained earnings, after tax and noncontrolling interests.
The allowance for doubtful accounts for reinsurance, insurance and trade receivables was unchanged as a result of adopting the new guidance. At adoption, an allowance for credit losses of $6 million was established for available-for-sale fixed maturity securities that were PCD assets, with a corresponding increase to amortized cost, resulting in no adjustment to the carrying value of the securities.
See the accounting policy discussion within this note as well as Notes 3 and 16 for additional information on credit losses.
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASU 2016-02”). The updated guidance required lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for most operating leases. The Company has elected to apply an exemption for short term leases whereby leases with initial lease terms of one year or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. At adoption, the cumulative effect adjustment increased Other assets and Other liabilities by $642 million reflecting operating lease right of use assets, lease liabilities and the derecognition of deferred rent related primarily to lease agreements for office space and machinery and equipment. See Note 9 for additional information on leases.
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”). The core principle of the accounting guidance is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard excluded from its scope the accounting for insurance contracts, financial instruments and certain other agreements that are subject to other guidance in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which limited the impact of this change in accounting for the Company. The Company adopted the updated accounting guidance using the modified retrospective method, with a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance sheet. At adoption, the cumulative effect adjustment decreased beginning Retained earnings by $62 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests), resulted in a deferred tax asset of $23 million and increased Deferred non-insurance warranty acquisition expenses by approximately $1.9 billion and Deferred non-insurance warranty revenue by approximately $2.0 billion.
On January 1, 2018 the Company adopted ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“ASU 2016-01”). The guidance primarily changed the model for equity securities by requiring changes in the fair value of equity securities to be recognized through the income statement. Prior period amounts were not adjusted and continued to be reported in accordance with the previous accounting guidance. Upon adoption of the updated accounting guidance the Company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $25 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) as an increase to beginning Retained earnings.
On January 1, 2018 the Company adopted ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.” The updated guidance amended the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The Company adopted this updated guidance using the modified retrospective approach with a cumulative effect adjustment of $9 million (after noncontrolling interests) as a decrease to beginning Retained earnings with an offset to a deferred income tax liability.
On January 1, 2018 the Company early adopted ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income” (“ASU 2018-02”). The updated accounting guidance allowed a reclassification from AOCI to Retained earnings for certain tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The impact of the change resulted in a $3 million (after noncontrolling interests) increase in Retained earnings and a corresponding decrease in AOCI. The decrease in AOCI is comprised of a $130 million (after noncontrolling interests) decrease in pension liability and a $127 million (after noncontrolling interests) increase in unrealized gains (losses) on investments.
Recently issued ASUs - In August of 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12, “Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts.” The updated accounting guidance requires changes to the measurement and disclosure of long-duration contracts. The guidance requires entities to update annually cash flow assumptions, including morbidity and persistency, and update quarterly discount rate assumptions using an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument yield. The effect of changes in cash flow assumptions will be recorded in Net income and the effect of changes in discount rate assumptions will be recorded in Other comprehensive income (“OCI”). This guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. The Company may elect to apply the guidance using either a modified retrospective transition method or a full retrospective transition method. The guidance requires restatement of prior periods presented. The Company plans to use the modified retrospective transition method at adoption and is currently evaluating the effect the updated guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements, including increased disclosure requirements. The annual updating of cash flow assumptions is expected to increase income statement volatility. While the requirements of the new guidance represent a material change from existing accounting guidance, the underlying economics of the business and related cash flows will be unchanged.
Note 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures and Deconsolidation
Diamond Offshore
On April 26, 2020 (the “Filing Date”), Diamond Offshore and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Chapter 11 Filing”). As a result of Diamond Offshore’s Chapter 11 Filing and applicable U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, effective as of the Filing Date, Loews Corporation no longer controlled Diamond Offshore for accounting purposes. Therefore, Diamond Offshore was deconsolidated from its consolidated financial statements effective as of the Filing Date. See Note 20 for Diamond Offshore’s revenues and expenses through the Filing Date.
Through the Filing Date, Diamond Offshore’s results were included in Loews Corporation’s consolidated financial statements and Loews Corporation recognized in its earnings its proportionate share of Diamond Offshore’s losses through such date. The deconsolidation resulted in the recognition of a loss of $1.2 billion ($957 million after tax) during the year ended December 31, 2020, which is reported within Investment gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. This loss represents the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value, which was immaterial, of Loews Corporation’s investment in equity securities of Diamond Offshore as of the Filing Date.
Boardwalk Pipelines
On June 29, 2018, Boardwalk GP, LP (“General Partner”), the general partner of Boardwalk Pipelines and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Loews Corporation, elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the issued and outstanding common units representing limited partnership interests in Boardwalk Pipelines not already owned by the General Partner or its affiliates pursuant to Section 15.1(b) of Boardwalk Pipelines’ Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (“Limited Partnership Agreement”) for a cash purchase price, determined in accordance with the Limited Partnership Agreement, of $12.06 per unit, or approximately $1.5 billion, in the aggregate. The purchase price of the common units was lower than the carrying value of the noncontrolling interests for Boardwalk Pipelines, resulting in an increase to Additional paid-in capital of $658 million, an increase to deferred income tax liabilities of $213 million and a decrease to AOCI of $29 million.
Following completion of the transaction on July 18, 2018, Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp. (“BPHC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Loews Corporation, holds, directly or indirectly, all of the limited partnership interests of Boardwalk Pipelines.
Loews Hotels & Co
In 2020, Loews Hotels & Co received aggregate proceeds of $57 million for the sale of an owned hotel and an office building. In 2019, Loews Hotels & Co received proceeds of $118 million for the sale of an owned hotel. In 2018, Loews Hotels & Co received proceeds of $40 million for the sale of an owned hotel.
Altium Packaging
In 2020, Altium Packaging paid approximately $60 million for the acquisition of a packaging manufacturer. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price for the acquisition resulted in the recognition of approximately $17 million of goodwill and approximately $35 million of intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships, and is subject to change within the measurement period. The acquisition was funded with available cash and debt financing at Altium Packaging.
In 2019, Altium Packaging paid approximately $260 million for three acquisitions of plastic packaging manufacturers located in the U.S. and Canada, including the acquisition in June of 2019 of Altium Healthcare Inc. (formerly known as Tri State Distribution, Inc.), a retail pharmaceutical packaging solutions provider. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, revenues for the three acquisitions since acquisition were $135 million and $76 million and net results were not significant. The allocation of the purchase prices for the three acquisitions resulted in the recognition of approximately $99 million of goodwill and approximately $87 million of intangible assets, primarily related to customer relationships. The acquisitions were funded with approximately $250 million of debt financing at Altium Packaging and available cash.
In 2018, Altium Packaging paid approximately $40 million for three acquisitions of plastic packaging manufacturers located in the U.S. and Canada, resulting in recognition of approximately $10 million of goodwill and approximately $15 million of intangible assets, primarily customer relationships.
Note 3. Investments
Net investment income is as follows:
(a) Net unrealized gains (losses) related to changes in fair value on securities still held were $88, $41 and $(121) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no investments in a single issuer exceeded 10% of shareholders’ equity, other than investments in securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and obligations of government-sponsored enterprises.
Investment gains (losses) are as follows:
(a) Gross investment gains on available-for-sale securities were $220, $125 and $168 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Gross investment losses on available-for-sale securities were $220, $131 and $164 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2020, $3 of investment losses were recognized due to the change in fair value of non-redeemable preferred stock still held as of December 31, 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2019, $66 of investment gains were recognized due to the change in fair value of non-redeemable preferred stock still held as of December 31, 2019.
The following table presents the activity related to the allowance on available-for-sale securities with credit impairments and PCD assets. Accrued interest receivables on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities totaled $371 million and is excluded from the estimate of expected credit losses and the amortized cost basis in the tables within this Note.
The components of available-for-sale impairment losses recognized in earnings by asset type are presented in the following table. The table includes losses on securities with an intention to sell and changes in the allowance for credit losses on securities since acquisition date:
The Company also recognized $21 million of losses in 2020 related to mortgage loans primarily due to changes in expected credit losses.
The net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments, which consists solely of the change in unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities, was $1.6 billion, $2.6 billion and $(1.8) billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
The amortized cost and fair values of fixed maturity securities are as follows:
(a) On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13; see Note 1. The Unrealized OTTI Losses (Gains) column that tracked subsequent valuation changes on securities for which a credit loss had previously been recorded has been replaced with the Allowance for Credit Losses column. Prior period amounts were not adjusted for the adoption of this standard.
The available-for-sale securities in a gross unrealized loss position for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded are as follows:
Based on current facts and circumstances, the Company believes the unrealized losses presented in the December 31, 2020 securities in a gross unrealized loss position table above are not indicative of the ultimate collectability of the current amortized cost of the securities, but rather are attributable to changes in interest rates, credit spreads and other factors. The Company has no current intent to sell securities with unrealized losses, nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell prior to recovery of amortized cost; accordingly, the Company has determined that there are no additional impairment losses to be recorded at December 31, 2020.
Contractual Maturity
The following table presents available-for-sale fixed maturity securities by contractual maturity.
Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be called or prepaid. Securities not due at a single date are allocated based on weighted average life.
Limited Partnerships
The carrying value of limited partnerships as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion, which includes net undistributed earnings of $252 million and $297 million. Limited partnerships comprising 54% of the total carrying value are reported on a current basis through December 31, 2020 with no reporting lag, 9% of the total carrying value are reported on a one month lag and the remainder are reported on more than a one month lag. The number of limited partnerships held and the strategies employed provide diversification to the limited partnership portfolio and the overall invested asset portfolio.
Limited partnerships comprising 56% and 66% of the carrying value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 employ hedge fund strategies. Limited partnerships comprising 36% and 29% of the carrying value at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were invested in private debt and equity and the remainder were primarily invested in real estate strategies. Hedge fund strategies include both long and short positions in fixed income, equity and derivative instruments. These hedge fund strategies may seek to generate gains from mispriced or undervalued securities, price differentials between securities, distressed investments, sector rotation or various arbitrage disciplines. Within hedge fund strategies, approximately 46% were equity related, 36% pursued a multi-strategy approach, 11% were focused on distressed investments and 7% were fixed income related as of December 31, 2020.
The ten largest limited partnership positions held totaled $914 million and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Based on the most recent information available regarding the Company’s percentage ownership of the individual limited partnerships, the carrying value reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents approximately 2% of the aggregate partnership equity at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related income reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations represents approximately 2%, 2% and 3% of the changes in aggregate partnership equity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
There are risks inherent in limited partnership investments which may result in losses due to short-selling, derivatives or other speculative investment practices. The use of leverage increases volatility generated by the underlying investment strategies.
The Company’s hedge fund limited partnership investments contain withdrawal provisions that generally limit liquidity for a period of thirty days up to one year or longer. Private equity and other non-hedge funds generally do not permit voluntary withdrawals. Typically, hedge fund withdrawals require advance written notice of up to 90 days.
Mortgage Loans
The following table presents the amortized cost basis of mortgage loans for each credit quality indicator by year of origination:
(a) The values in the table above reflect DSCR on a standardized amortization period and LTV based on the most recent appraised values trended forward using changes in a commercial real estate price index.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company may use derivatives in the normal course of business, primarily in an attempt to reduce exposure to market risk (principally interest rate risk, credit risk, equity price risk, commodity price risk and foreign currency risk) stemming from various assets and liabilities. The principal objective under such strategies is to achieve the desired reduction in economic risk, even if the position does not receive hedge accounting treatment.
The Company may enter into interest rate swaps, futures and forward commitments to purchase securities to manage interest rate risk. Credit derivatives such as credit default swaps may be entered into to modify the credit risk inherent in certain investments. Forward contracts, futures, swaps and options may be used to manage foreign currency and commodity price risk.
In addition to the derivatives used for risk management purposes described above, the Company may also use derivatives for purposes of income enhancement. Income enhancement transactions include interest rate swaps, call options, put options, credit default swaps, index futures and foreign currency forwards. See Note 4 for information regarding the fair value of derivative instruments.
The following tables present the aggregate contractual or notional amount and estimated fair value related to derivative financial instruments.
Investment Commitments
As part of the overall investment strategy, investments are made in various assets which require future purchase, sale or funding commitments. These investments are recorded once funded, and the related commitments may include future capital calls from various third-party limited partnerships, signed and accepted mortgage loan applications and obligations related to private placement securities. As of December 31, 2020, commitments to purchase or fund were approximately $1.2 billion and to sell were approximately $85 million under the terms of these investments.
Investments on Deposit
Securities with carrying values of approximately $3.0 billion and $2.7 billion were deposited by CNA’s insurance subsidiaries under requirements of regulatory authorities and others as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Cash and securities with carrying values of approximately $1.1 billion were deposited with financial institutions in trust accounts or as collateral for letters of credit to secure obligations with various third parties as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Note 4. Fair Value
Fair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following fair value hierarchy is used in selecting inputs, with the highest priority given to Level 1, as these are the most transparent or reliable:
•
Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
•
Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.
•
Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are not observable.
Prices may fall within Level 1, 2 or 3 depending upon the methodology and inputs used to estimate fair value for each specific security. In general, securities are priced using third party pricing services. Securities not priced by pricing services are submitted to independent brokers for valuation and, if those are not available, internally developed pricing models are used to value assets using a methodology and inputs that market participants presumably would use to value the assets. Prices obtained from third-party pricing services or brokers are not adjusted.
Control procedures are performed over information obtained from pricing services and brokers to ensure prices received represent a reasonable estimate of fair value and to confirm representations regarding whether inputs are observable or unobservable. Procedures may include: (i) the review of pricing service methodologies or broker pricing qualifications, (ii) back-testing, where past fair value estimates are compared to actual transactions executed in the market on similar dates, (iii) exception reporting, where period-over-period changes in price are reviewed and challenged with the pricing service or broker based on exception criteria and (iv) detailed analysis, where an independent analysis is performed of the inputs and assumptions used to price individual securities.
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized in the following tables. Corporate bonds and other includes obligations of the U.S. Treasury, government-sponsored enterprises, foreign governments and redeemable preferred stock.
The following tables present reconciliations for all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Net investment gains and losses are reported in Net income as follows:
Securities may be transferred in or out of levels within the fair value hierarchy based on the availability of observable market information and quoted prices used to determine the fair value of the security. The availability of observable market information and quoted prices varies based on market conditions and trading volume.
Valuation Methodologies and Inputs
The following section describes the valuation methodologies and relevant inputs used to measure different financial instruments at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the instruments are generally classified.
Fixed Maturity Securities
Level 1 securities include highly liquid government securities and exchange traded bonds valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 securities include most other fixed maturity securities as the significant inputs are observable in the marketplace. All classes of Level 2 fixed maturity securities are valued using a methodology based on information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, a discounted cash flow methodology or a combination of both when necessary. Common inputs for all classes of fixed maturity securities include prices from recently executed transactions of similar securities, marketplace quotes, benchmark yields, spreads off benchmark yields, interest rates and U.S. Treasury or swap curves. Specifically for asset-backed securities, key inputs include prepayment and default projections based on past performance of the underlying collateral and current market data. Fixed maturity securities are primarily assigned to Level 3 in cases where broker/dealer quotes are significant inputs to the valuation, and there is a lack of transparency as to whether these quotes are based on information that is observable in the marketplace. Level 3 securities also include private placement debt securities whose fair value is determined using internal models with some inputs that are not market observable.
Equity Securities
Level 1 securities include publicly traded securities valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 securities are primarily valued using pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions and other pricing models utilizing market observable inputs. Level 3 securities are primarily priced using broker/dealer quotes and internal models with some inputs that are not market observable.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Equity options are valued using quoted market prices and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Over-the-counter derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, currency forwards, total return swaps, commodity swaps, equity warrants and options, are valued using inputs including broker/dealer quotes and are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, depending on the amount of transparency as to whether these quotes are based on information that is observable in the marketplace.
Short Term and Other Invested Assets
Securities that are actively traded or have quoted prices are classified as Level 1. These securities include money market funds, treasury bills and exchange traded open-end funds valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 primarily includes commercial paper, for which all inputs are market observable. Fixed maturity securities purchased within one year of maturity are classified consistent with fixed maturity securities discussed above. Short term investments as presented in the tables above differ from the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets because certain short term investments, such as time deposits, are not measured at fair value.
Significant Unobservable Inputs
The following tables present quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs utilized in the fair value measurement of Level 3 assets. Valuations for assets and liabilities not presented in the tables below are primarily based on broker/dealer quotes for which there is a lack of transparency as to inputs used to develop the valuations. The quantitative detail of unobservable inputs from these broker quotes is neither provided nor reasonably available. The weighted average rate is calculated based on fair value.
For fixed maturity securities, an increase to the credit spread assumptions would result in a lower fair value measurement.
Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value
The carrying amount, estimated fair value and the level of the fair value hierarchy of the financial assets and liabilities which are not measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are presented in the following tables. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of short term debt and long term debt exclude finance lease obligations. The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and short term investments not carried at fair value and certain other assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to the short term nature of these items.
The fair values of debt were based on observable market prices when available. When observable market prices were not available, the fair values of debt were based on observable market prices of comparable instruments adjusted for differences between the observed instruments and the instruments being valued or is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.
Note 5. Receivables
Note 6. Property, Plant and Equipment
Depreciation expense and capital expenditures are as follows:
(a) Amounts presented for Diamond Offshore reflect the periods prior to deconsolidation. See Notes 2 and 20 for further discussion.
Capitalized interest related to the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets amounted to approximately $14 million, $18 million and $27 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Asset Impairments
During the first quarter of 2020, five drilling rigs that had indicators of impairment were evaluated. Based on the assumptions and analysis at that time, it was determined that the carrying values of four of these rigs were impaired. The fair values of these rigs were estimated using multiple probability-weighted cash flow analyses, whereby the fair value of each rig was estimated based on a calculation of the rig’s future net cash flows. These calculations utilized significant unobservable inputs, including utilization and dayrate scenarios, as well as management’s assumptions related to future oil and gas prices. These fair value estimates were representative of Level 3 fair value measurements due to the significant level of estimation involved and the lack of transparency as to the inputs used. An aggregate asset impairment charge of $774 million ($408 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 and is reported within Operating expenses and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
During 2018, Diamond Offshore recorded an asset impairment charge of $27 million ($12 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) to recognize a reduction in fair value of the Ocean Scepter. Diamond Offshore estimated the fair value of the impaired rig using a market approach based on a signed agreement to sell the rig, less estimated costs to sell. This valuation approach is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the level of estimation involved as the sale had not yet been completed at the time of the analysis.
Loews Hotels & Co evaluates properties with indications that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. It was determined that the carrying values of one property and capitalized costs related to a potential development project in 2020, four properties in 2019 and two properties in 2018 were impaired. Loews Hotels & Co recorded aggregate impairment charges of $30 million ($22 million after tax), $99 million ($77 million after tax) and $22 million ($15 million after tax) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and are reported within Operating expenses and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These impairments reduced Property, plant and equipment by $30 million and $62 million in 2020 and 2019 and Other assets by $37 million in 2019.
Loews Hotels & Co utilizes an undiscounted probability-weighted cash flow analysis in testing the recoverability of its long-lived assets for potential impairment. Assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include, among other things, (i) room revenue based on occupancy and average room rates, (ii) other revenue generated by the property, including food and beverage sales and ancillary services, as well as property specific revenue sources, (iii) operating expenses, including management and marketing fees and (iv) expenditures for repairs and refurbishments to maintain the asset’s value. When necessary, scenarios are developed using multiple assumptions of expected future events which Loews Hotels & Co assigns a probability of occurrence based on management’s expectations. This initial analysis results in a projected probability-weighted cash flow of the property, which is compared to the carrying value of the asset to assess recoverability. If the long-lived asset’s carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, Loews Hotels & Co compares the long-lived asset’s carrying value to fair value, estimating the fair value of the asset by discounting future cash flows using market participant assumptions or third-party indicators of fair value such as a recent independent appraisal. These calculations, at times, utilize significant unobservable inputs, including estimating the growth in the asset’s revenue and cost structure and are therefore considered Level 3 fair value measurements.
Note 7. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
A summary of the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill is as follows:
The increases as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 reflect the acquisitions made by Altium Packaging in 2020 and 2019. See Note 2 for further discussion on these acquisitions.
A summary of the net carrying amount of other intangible assets is as follows:
The balance as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 includes assets from acquisitions made by Altium Packaging.
Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 of $61 million, $45 million and $32 million is reported in Operating expenses and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2020, estimated amortization expense in each of the next five years is approximately $41 million in 2021, $41 million in 2022, $40 million in 2023, $38 million in 2024 and $36 million in 2025.
Note 8. Claim, Claim Adjustment Expense and Future Policy Benefit Reserves
Property and casualty insurance claim and claim adjustment expense reserves represent the estimated amounts necessary to resolve all outstanding claims, including incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims as of the reporting date. Reserve projections are based primarily on detailed analysis of the facts in each case, experience with similar cases and various historical development patterns. Consideration is given to historical patterns such as claim reserving trends and settlement practices, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims and product mix, as well as court decisions and economic conditions including inflation and public attitudes. All of these factors can affect the estimation of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.
Establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, including claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for catastrophic events that have occurred, is an estimation process. Many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and, therefore, the necessary reserve. Changes in the law, results of litigation, medical costs, the cost of repair materials and labor rates can affect ultimate claim costs. In addition, time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim, the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be. Accordingly, short-tail claims, such as property damage claims, tend to be more reasonably estimable than long-tail claims, such as workers’ compensation, general liability and professional liability claims. Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in the results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. There can be no assurance that the ultimate cost for insurance losses will not exceed current estimates.
CNA’s commercial property and casualty insurance operations (“Property & Casualty Operations”) include its Specialty, Commercial and International lines of business. CNA’s Other Insurance Operations outside of Property & Casualty Operations include its long term care business that is in run-off, certain corporate expenses, including interest on CNA’s corporate debt, and certain property and casualty businesses in run-off, including CNA Re and A&EP.
Liability for Unpaid Claim and Claim Adjustment Expenses
The table below reconciles the net liability for unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses to the amount presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
(a) Other Insurance Operations amounts are primarily related to long term care claim reserves, which are long duration insurance contracts, but also include amounts related to unfunded structured settlements arising from short duration insurance contracts.
(b) Reinsurance receivables presented are gross of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance and do not include reinsurance receivables related to paid losses.
(c) The Other Insurance Operations reinsurance receivables are primarily related to A&EP claims covered under the loss portfolio transfer (“LPT”).
The following table presents a reconciliation between beginning and ending claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, including claim and claim adjustment expense reserves of Other Insurance Operations.
(a) Total net incurred above does not agree to Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to amounts related to retroactive reinsurance deferred gain accounting, uncollectible reinsurance and benefit expenses related to future policy benefits, which are not reflected in the table above.
Reserving Methodology
In developing claim and claim adjustment expense (“loss” or “losses”) reserve estimates, CNA’s actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year. Every reserve group is reviewed at least once during the year, but most are reviewed more frequently. The analyses generally review losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, the historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications, the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and incurred loss patterns, the consistency of claims handling processes, the consistency of case reserving practices, changes in CNA’s pricing and underwriting, pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market and legal, judicial, social and economic trends. In addition to the detailed analyses, CNA reviews actual loss emergence for all products each quarter.
In developing the loss reserve estimates for property and casualty contracts, CNA generally projects ultimate losses using several common actuarial methods as listed below. CNA reviews the various indications from the various methods and applies judgment to select an actuarial point estimate. The carried reserve may differ from the actuarial point estimate as a result of CNA’s consideration of the factors noted above as well as the potential volatility of the projections associated with the specific product being analyzed and other factors affecting claims costs that may not be quantifiable through traditional actuarial analysis. The indicated required reserve is the difference between the selected ultimate loss and the inception-to-date paid losses. The difference between the selected ultimate loss and the case incurred or reported loss is IBNR. IBNR includes a provision for development on known cases as well as a provision for late reported incurred claims. The most frequently utilized methods to project ultimate losses include the following:
•
Paid development: The paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident years with further expected changes in paid losses.
•
Incurred development: The incurred development method is similar to the paid development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses.
•
Loss ratio: The loss ratio method multiplies premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident year.
•
Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and paid loss: The Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and paid loss method is a combination of the paid development approach and the loss ratio approach. This method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss ratio method.
•
Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and incurred loss: The Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and incurred loss method is similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and paid loss method except that it uses case incurred losses.
•
Frequency times severity: The frequency times severity method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident year to produce ultimate loss estimates.
•
Stochastic modeling: The stochastic modeling produces a range of possible outcomes based on varying assumptions related to the particular product being modeled.
For many exposures, especially those that are considered long-tail, a particular accident or policy year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In such a case, CNA’s actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the paid development method. As claims continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method. For most of CNA’s products, even the incurred losses for accident or policy years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In these cases, CNA may not assign any weight to the paid and incurred development methods. CNA may use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and frequency times severity methods. For short-tail exposures, the paid and incurred
development methods can often be relied on sooner, primarily because CNA’s history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. However, CNA may also use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and frequency times severity methods for short-tail exposures. For other more complex reserve groups where the above methods may not produce reliable indications, CNA uses additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation.
CNA’s reserving methodologies for mass tort and A&EP are similar as both are based on detailed reviews of large accounts with estimates of ultimate payments based on the facts in each case and CNA’s view of applicable law and coverage litigation.
Gross and Net Carried Reserves
The following tables present the gross and net carried reserves:
Net Prior Year Development
Changes in estimates of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance, for prior years are defined as net prior year loss reserve development. These changes can be favorable or unfavorable.
The following table and discussion present details of the net prior year loss reserve development in Property & Casualty Operations:
Development Tables
For CNA’s Property & Casualty Operations, the following tables present further detail and commentary on the development reflected in the financial statements for each of the periods presented. Also presented are loss reserve development tables that illustrate the change over time of reserves established for claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses arising from short-duration insurance contracts for certain lines of business within CNA’s Property & Casualty Operations. Not all lines of business are presented based on their context to CNA’s overall loss reserves, calendar year reserve development, or calendar year net earned premiums. Insurance contracts are considered to be short-duration contracts when the contracts are not expected to remain in force for an extended period of time.
The Cumulative Net Incurred Claim and Allocated Claim Adjustment Expenses tables, reading across, show the cumulative net incurred claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses relating to each accident year at the end of the stated calendar year. Changes in the cumulative amount across time are the result of CNA’s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The Cumulative Net Paid Claim and Allocated Claim Adjustment Expenses tables, reading across, show the cumulative amount paid for claims in each accident year as of the end of the stated calendar year. The Net Strengthening or (Releases) of Prior Accident Year Reserves tables, reading across, show the net increase or decrease in the cumulative net incurred accident year claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses during each stated calendar year and indicates whether the reserves for that accident year were strengthened or released.
The information in the tables is reported on a net basis after reinsurance and does not include the effects of discounting. The information contained in calendar years 2019 and prior is unaudited. To the extent CNA enters into a commutation, the transaction is reported on a prospective basis. To the extent that CNA enters into a disposition, the effects of the disposition are reported on a retrospective basis by removing the balances associated with it.
The amounts reported for the cumulative number of reported claims include direct and assumed open and closed claims by accident year at the claimant level. The number excludes claim counts for claims within a policy deductible where the insured is responsible for payment of losses in the deductible layer. Claim count data for certain assumed reinsurance contracts is unavailable.
In the loss reserve development tables, IBNR includes reserves for incurred but not reported losses and expected development on case reserves. CNA does not establish case reserves for allocated loss adjusted expenses (ALAE), therefore ALAE reserves are also included in the estimate of IBNR.
Unfavorable development in medical professional liability was primarily due to higher than expected frequency of large losses in recent accident years and unfavorable outcomes on specific claims in older accident years.
Favorable development in other professional liability and management liability was primarily due to lower than expected loss emergence in accident year 2017 and accident years prior to 2010.
Favorable development in surety was due to lower than expected frequency and lack of systemic loss activity for accident years 2019 and prior.
Unfavorable development in commercial auto was due to higher than expected claim severity in CNA’s middle market and construction business in recent accident years.
Unfavorable development in general liability was driven by higher than expected emergence in mass tort exposures, primarily due to New York reviver statute-related claims from accident years prior to 2010, increased bodily injury severities in accident years 2012 through 2016 and higher than expected frequency and severity in CNA’s umbrella business in accident years 2015 through 2019.
Favorable development in workers’ compensation was due to favorable medical trends driving lower than expected severity in multiple accident years.
Unfavorable development in property and other was primarily due to higher than expected large loss activity in accident year 2019 in CNA’s middle market, national accounts and marine business units.
Unfavorable development in medical professional liability was primarily due to higher than expected severity in accident years 2016 through 2018 in CNA’s aging services business, higher than expected severity in accident year 2013 in the allied healthcare business, unfavorable outcomes on individual claims and higher than expected severity in accident year 2017 in the dentists business.
Favorable development in other professional liability and management liability was primarily due to lower than expected claim frequency and favorable outcomes on individual claims in accident years 2017 and prior related to financial institutions, lower than expected large claim losses in recent accident years in CNA’s public company directors and officers liability business and lower than expected loss adjustment expenses across accident years 2010 through 2018.
Favorable development in surety was due to lower than expected frequency for accident years 2018 and prior.
Favorable development in commercial auto was primarily due to continued lower than expected severity across accident years 2015 and prior and a decline in bodily injury frequency in accident year 2018.
Unfavorable development in general liability was primarily due to higher than expected emergence in mass tort exposures, primarily from accident years 2016, 2015 and prior to 2010.
Favorable development in other coverages was due to lower than expected paid loss emergence on vehicle products in warranty, favorable medical trends driving lower than expected severity in accident years 2012 through 2018 in workers’ compensation, lower than expected claim severity related to catastrophe events in accident years 2017 and 2018 in property and other in Commercial and lower than expected large losses and claim severity in accident years 2018 and prior in Hardy, Europe and Canada in casualty. This was mostly offset by unfavorable development driven by higher than expected claims in Hardy on 2018 accident year Asian catastrophe events in property in International and potential design and construct exposures in professional indemnity within Europe financial lines in accident years 2017 and 2018.
Unfavorable development in medical professional liability was primarily due to higher than expected severity in accident years 2014 and 2017 in CNA’s hospitals business. In addition, there was higher than expected frequency and severity in aging services in accident years 2014 through 2017 combined, partially offset by lower than expected frequency in accident year 2015.
Favorable development in other professional liability and management liability was primarily due to lower than expected claim frequency in recent accident years related to financial institutions and professional liability errors and omissions (“E&O”), favorable severity in accident years 2015 and prior related to professional liability E&O and favorable outcomes on individual claims in financial institutions in accident years 2013 and prior.
Favorable development in surety was due to lower than expected loss emergence for accident years 2017 and prior.
Unfavorable development in general liability was driven by higher than expected claim severity in unsupported umbrella in accident years 2013 through 2016.
Favorable development in workers’ compensation was driven by lower frequency and severity experience and favorable impacts from California reforms.
Favorable development in other coverages was driven by lower than expected claim severity in catastrophes in accident year 2017 for property in Commercial, better than expected frequency in the liability portion of the package business in Canada and general liability in Europe in casualty, and for accident years 2015 and prior in Europe in healthcare and technology for International. This was partially offset by unfavorable development primarily driven by increased loss severity in the accident year 2017 in Europe professional indemnity in specialty for International.

A&EP Reserves
In 2010, Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”) together with several insurance subsidiaries completed a transaction with National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which substantially all of their legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to NICO through a loss portfolio transfer (“loss portfolio transfer” or “LPT”). At the effective date of the transaction, approximately $1.6 billion of net A&EP claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves were ceded to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $4.0 billion. The $1.6 billion of claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves ceded to NICO was net of $1.2 billion of ceded claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves under existing third party reinsurance contracts. The NICO LPT aggregate reinsurance limit also covers credit risk on the existing third party reinsurance related to these liabilities. NICO was paid a reinsurance premium of $2.0 billion and billed third party reinsurance receivables related to A&EP claims with a net book value of $215 million were transferred to NICO, resulting in total consideration of $2.2 billion.
In years subsequent to the effective date of the LPT, adverse prior year development on A&EP reserves was recognized resulting in additional amounts ceded under the LPT. As a result, the cumulative amounts ceded under the LPT have exceeded the $2.2 billion consideration paid, resulting in the NICO LPT moving into a gain position, requiring retroactive reinsurance accounting. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, this gain is deferred and only recognized in earnings in proportion to actual paid recoveries under the LPT. Over the life of the contract, there is no economic impact as long as any additional losses incurred are within the limit of the LPT. In a period in which a change in the estimate of A&EP reserves is recognized that increases or decreases the amounts ceded under the LPT, the proportion of actual paid recoveries to total ceded losses is affected and the change in the deferred gain is recognized in earnings as if the revised estimate of ceded losses was available at the effective date of the LPT. The effect of the deferred retroactive reinsurance benefit is recorded in Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The following table presents the impact of the loss portfolio transfer on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Net unfavorable prior year development of $125 million, $150 million and $178 million was recognized before consideration of cessions to the LPT for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
The unfavorable development in 2020 and 2019 was driven by higher than anticipated defense and indemnity costs on known direct asbestos and environmental accounts and a reduction in estimated reinsurance recoverable. The unfavorable development in 2018 was driven by higher than anticipated defense and indemnity costs on known direct asbestos and environmental accounts and by paid losses on assumed reinsurance exposures. Additionally, in 2020, 2019 and 2018, $25 million, $25 million and $16 million of the provision for uncollectible third-party reinsurance was released.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the cumulative amounts ceded under the LPT were $3.3 billion and $3.2 billion. The unrecognized deferred retroactive reinsurance benefit was $398 million and $392 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and is included within Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
NICO established a collateral trust account as security for its obligations under the LPT. The fair value of the collateral trust account was $4.2 billion and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. In addition, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. guaranteed the payment obligations of NICO up to the aggregate reinsurance limit as well as certain of NICO’s performance obligations under the trust agreement. NICO is responsible for claims handling and billing and collection from third-party reinsurers related to A&EP claims.
Life & Group Policyholder Reserves
CNA’s Life & Group business includes its run-off long term care business as well as structured settlement obligations not funded by annuities related to certain property and casualty claimants. Long term care policies provide benefits for nursing homes, assisted living facilities and home health care subject to various daily and lifetime caps. Generally, policyholders must continue to make periodic premium payments to keep the policy in force and CNA has the ability to increase policy premiums, subject to state regulatory approval.
CNA maintains both claim and claim adjustment expense reserves as well as future policy benefit reserves for policyholder benefits for its Life & Group business. Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves consist of estimated reserves for long term care policyholders that are currently receiving benefits, including claims that have been incurred but are not yet reported. In developing the claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates for long term care policies, CNA’s actuaries perform a detailed claim reserve review on an annual basis. The review analyzes the sufficiency of existing reserves for policyholders currently on claim and includes an evaluation of expected benefit utilization and claim duration. In addition, claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are also maintained for the structured settlement obligations. In developing the claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates for structured settlement obligations, CNA’s actuaries monitor mortality experience on an annual basis. CNA’s recorded claim and claim adjustment expense reserves reflect management's best estimate after incorporating the results of the most recent reviews. Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for long term care policies and structured settlement obligations are discounted as discussed in Note 1.
CNA completed its annual claim reserve reviews in the third quarters of 2020, 2019 and 2018. CNA’s 2020 claim reserve reviews resulted in a $46 million pretax increase in claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates for structured settlement obligations primarily due to lower discount rate assumptions and mortality assumption changes and a $37 million pretax reduction in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for long term care policies primarily due to lower claim severity than anticipated in the reserve estimates. CNA’s 2019 and 2018 claim reserve reviews resulted in $56 million and $31 million pretax reductions in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for long term care policies primarily due to lower claim severity than anticipated in the reserve estimates.
Future policy benefit reserves consist of the active life reserves related to CNA’s long term care policies for policyholders that are not currently receiving benefits and represent the present value of expected future benefit payments and expenses less expected future premium. The determination of these reserves requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected investment and policyholder experience over the life of the contract. Since many of these contracts may be in force for several decades, these assumptions are subject to significant estimation risk.
The actuarial assumptions that management believes are subject to the most variability are morbidity, persistency, discount rates and anticipated future premium rate increases. Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted. Persistency is the percentage of policies remaining in force and can be affected by
policy lapses, benefit reductions and death. Discount rates are influenced by the investment yield on assets supporting long term care reserves which is subject to interest rate and market volatility and may also be affected by changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Future premium rate increases are generally subject to regulatory approval, and therefore the exact timing and size of the approved rate increases are unknown. As a result of this variability, CNA’s long term care reserves may be subject to material increases if actual experience develops adversely to CNA’s expectations.
Annually, in the third quarter, management assesses the adequacy of its long term care future policy benefit reserves by performing a GPV to determine if there is a premium deficiency. Under the GPV, management estimates required reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the assessment without provisions for adverse deviation. The GPV required reserves are then compared to the existing recorded reserves. If the GPV required reserves are greater than the existing recorded reserves, the existing assumptions are unlocked and future policy benefit reserves are increased to the greater amount. Any such increase is reflected in the Company’s results of operations in the period in which the need for such adjustment is determined. If the GPV required reserves are less than the existing recorded reserves, assumptions remain locked in and no adjustment is required.
Periodically, management engages independent third parties to assess the appropriateness of its best estimate assumptions. The most recent third party assessment, performed in 2019, validated the assumption setting process and confirmed the best estimate assumptions appropriately reflected the experience data at that time.
The GPV for the long term care future policy benefit reserves performed in the third quarters of 2020 and 2019 indicated a premium deficiency primarily driven by lower discount rate assumptions. Recognition of the premium deficiencies resulted in $74 million and $216 million pretax increases in policyholders’ benefits reflected in the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. CNA’s 2018 GPV for the long term care future policy benefit reserves indicated the reserves were not deficient and no adjustment was required.
Note 9. Leases
Lease agreements primarily cover office facilities and machinery and equipment and expire at various dates. The Company’s leases are predominantly operating leases, which are included in Other assets and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain significant residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants.
Operating lease right of use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to determine the commencement date present value of lease payments is typically the Company’s secured borrowing rate, as most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate. The Company’s operating lease right of use asset was $370 million and $573 million and the Company’s operating lease liability was $501 million and $694 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Total lease expense was $110 million and $146 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, which includes operating lease expense of $84 million and $121 million, variable lease expense of $22 million and $19 million and short term lease expense of $4 million and $6 million. Prior to the adoption of the new lease standard, lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $120 million. Cash paid for amounts included in operating lease liabilities was $86 million and $117 million for year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Operating lease right of use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations was $40 million and $54 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The table below presents the maturities of lease liabilities:
The table below presents the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases and weighted average discount rate used in calculating the operating lease asset and liability.
Note 10. Income Taxes
Loews Corporation and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Loews Corporation has entered into a separate tax allocation agreement with CNA, a majority-owned subsidiary in which its ownership exceeds 80%. The agreement provides that Loews Corporation will: (i) pay to CNA the amount, if any, by which Loews Corporation’s consolidated federal income tax is reduced by virtue of inclusion of CNA in Loews Corporation’s return or (ii) be paid by CNA an amount, if any, equal to the federal income tax that would have been payable by CNA if it had filed a separate consolidated return. The agreement may be canceled by either of the parties upon thirty days written notice.
For 2018 through 2020, the Company participates in the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”), which is a voluntary program for large corporations. Under CAP, the IRS conducted a real-time audit and worked contemporaneously with the Company to resolve any issues prior to the filing of the 2018 and 2019 tax returns. The 2018 and 2019 examinations are completed. For 2020, the Company was selected to participate in the phase of CAP reserved for taxpayers whose risk of noncompliance does not support use of IRS resources. The Company believes this approach should reduce tax-related uncertainties, if any. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that any adjustments resulting from audits will not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company and/or its subsidiaries also file income tax returns in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These returns, with few exceptions, are no longer subject to examination by the various taxing authorities before 2016.
The current and deferred components of income tax expense (benefit) are as follows:
The components of U.S. and foreign income before income tax and a reconciliation between the federal income tax expense at statutory rates and the actual income tax expense (benefit) is as follows:
As of December 31, 2020, no deferred taxes are required on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries subject to tax.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding tax carryforwards and interest and penalties, is as follows:
As of December 31, 2020, $2 million of unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. The amount of related accrued interest and penalties was insignificant.
The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and tax refund claims in Income tax expense (benefit) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company recognizes penalties in Income tax expense (benefit) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest expense (benefit) amounts recorded by the Company were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Penalty amounts recorded by the Company were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
The following table summarizes deferred tax assets and liabilities:
(a) Includes $43 and $37 of deferred tax assets reflected in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Net operating loss carryforwards in foreign tax jurisdictions of $2 million expire between 2037 and 2039, and $11 million has no expiration. Foreign tax credit carryforwards of $8 million will expire between 2029 and 2030, and $3 million has no expiration.
Although realization of deferred tax assets is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that the recognized deferred tax assets will be realized through recoupment of ordinary and capital taxes paid in prior carryback years and through future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. Due to the mix of state tax jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate, as of December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance of $13 million was recorded related primarily to state net operating losses.
Note 11. Debt
(a) Amounts presented for Diamond Offshore reflects the period prior to the deconsolidation.
At December 31, 2020, the aggregate long term debt maturing in each of the next five years is approximately as follows: $37 million in 2021, $650 million in 2022, $1.1 billion in 2023, $2.0 billion in 2024, $7 million in 2025 and $6.4 billion thereafter. Long term debt is generally redeemable in whole or in part at the greater of the principal amount or the net present value of remaining scheduled payments discounted at the specified treasury rate plus a margin.
In May of 2020, Loews Corporation completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.2% senior notes due May 15, 2030. The proceeds of this offering are available for general corporate purposes.
CNA is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (“FHLBC”). FHLBC membership provides participants with access to additional sources of liquidity through various programs and services. As a requirement of membership in the FHLBC, CNA held $5 million of FHLBC stock as of December 31, 2020, giving it access to approximately $111 million of additional liquidity. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, CNA had no outstanding borrowings from the FHLBC.
In August of 2020, CNA completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 2.1% senior notes due August 15, 2030 and used the net proceeds to redeem the entire $400 million outstanding aggregate principal balance of its 5.8% senior notes due August 15, 2021 and for general corporate purposes.
In 2019, CNA amended and restated its existing credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. The agreement provides a five-year $250 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility which is intended to be used for general corporate purposes. At CNA’s election, the commitments under the amended and restated credit agreement may be increased from time to time up to an additional aggregate amount of $100 million, and two one-year extensions are available prior to any anniversary of the closing date, each subject to applicable consents. As of December 31, 2020, CNA had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement and was in compliance with all covenants.
In August of 2020, Boardwalk Pipelines completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.4% senior notes due February 15, 2031. Boardwalk Pipelines used the proceeds to retire the outstanding $440 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.5% senior notes due 2021 in November of 2020, to fund growth capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. Initially, the proceeds were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.
Boardwalk Pipelines has a revolving credit facility having aggregate lending commitments of $1,475 million maturing May 26, 2022. As of December 31, 2020, Boardwalk Pipelines had $130 million of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and had available $1,345 million of available borrowing capacity. As of February 8, 2021, Boardwalk Pipelines had $170 million of outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and had $1,305 million of available borrowing capacity. As of December 31, 2020, Boardwalk Pipelines was in compliance with all covenants.
Certain of the hotels wholly or partially owned by Loews Hotels & Co are financed by debt facilities, with a number of different lenders. Each of the loan agreements underlying these facilities contain a variety of financial and operational covenants. As of December 31, 2020, Loews Hotels & Co was in compliance with these covenants.
On February 3, 2021, Altium Packaging issued a $1.05 billion seven-year secured term loan. The term loan is a variable rate facility which bears interest at a floating rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus an applicable margin of 2.75%, subject to a 0.5% LIBOR floor. The proceeds were used to pay the outstanding principal balances of its variable rate term loans and lending facility and pay a dividend of $200 million.
Note 12. Shareholders’ Equity
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
The tables below present the changes in AOCI by component for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019 and 2020:
(a) On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13; see Note 1. The Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments with OTTI Losses column that tracked the change in unrealized gains (losses) on investments with OTTI losses has been replaced with the Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments with an Allowance for Credit Losses column. The balance as of January 1, 2020 in the Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments with OTTI Losses column is now reported in the Net Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Other Investments column. Prior period amounts were not adjusted for the adoption of this standard.
Amounts reclassified from AOCI shown above are reported in Net income as follows:
Common Stock Dividends
Loews Corporation declared and paid dividends of $0.25 per share in the aggregate on its common stock in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
There are no restrictions on Loews Corporation’s retained earnings or net income with regard to payment of dividends. However, as a holding company, Loews Corporation relies upon invested cash balances and distributions from its subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to declare and pay any dividends to holders of its common stock. The ability of Loews Corporation’s subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, compliance with covenants in their respective credit agreements and applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies. See Note 14 for a discussion of the regulatory restrictions on CNA’s availability to pay dividends.
Treasury Stock
Loews Corporation repurchased 22.0 million, 21.5 million and 20.3 million shares of its common stock at aggregate costs of $0.9 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2020, 22.0 million shares were retired. The remaining shares will be retired in 2021. Upon retirement, treasury stock was eliminated through a reduction to common stock, APIC and retained earnings.
Note 13. Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Disaggregation of revenues - Revenue from contracts with customers, other than insurance premiums, is reported as Non-insurance warranty revenue and within Operating revenues and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following table presents revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by revenue type along with the reportable segment and a reconciliation to Operating revenues and other as reported in Note 20:
(a) Revenues presented for Diamond Offshore reflect the periods prior to deconsolidation. See Notes 2 and 20 for further discussion.
Receivables from contracts with customers - As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, receivables from contracts with customers were approximately $246 million and $458 million and are included within Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Deferred revenue - As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred revenue resulting from contracts with customers was approximately $4.1 billion and $3.9 billion and is reported as Deferred non-insurance warranty revenue and within Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Approximately $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion of revenues recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were included in deferred revenue as of January 1, 2020 and 2019.
Contract costs - As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had approximately $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion of costs to obtain contracts with customers, primarily related to CNA for amounts paid to dealers and other agents to obtain non-insurance warranty contracts, which are reported as Deferred non-insurance warranty acquisition expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, amortization expense totaled $907 million and $912 million is included in Non-insurance warranty expense and Operating expenses and other in the Consolidated Statement of Income. There were no adjustments to deferred costs recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Performance obligations - As of December 31, 2020, approximately $13.4 billion of estimated operating revenues is expected to be recognized in the future related to outstanding performance obligations. The balance relates primarily to revenues for transportation and storage of natural gas and NGLs at Boardwalk Pipelines and non-insurance warranty services at CNA. Approximately $2.4 billion will be recognized during 2021, $2.0 billion in 2022 and the remainder in following years. The actual timing of recognition may vary due to factors outside of the Company’s control.
Note 14. Statutory Accounting Practices
CNA’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in various jurisdictions. These subsidiaries prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the respective jurisdictions’ insurance regulators. Domestic prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth in a variety of publications of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. These statutory accounting principles vary in certain respects from GAAP. In converting from statutory accounting principles to GAAP, the more significant adjustments include deferral of policy acquisition costs and the inclusion of net unrealized holding gains or losses in shareholders’ equity relating to certain fixed maturity securities.
CNA has a prescribed practice as it relates to the accounting under Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles No. 62R (“SSAP No. 62R”), Property and Casualty Reinsurance, paragraphs 88 and 89 in conjunction with the 2010 loss portfolio transfer with NICO which is further discussed in Note 8. The prescribed practice allows CNA to aggregate all third party A&EP reinsurance balances administered by NICO in Schedule F and to utilize the LPT as collateral for the underlying third-party reinsurance balances for purposes of calculating the statutory reinsurance penalty. This prescribed practice increased statutory capital and surplus by $91 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The payment of dividends by CNA’s insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is generally limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective insurance regulator.
Dividends from CCC are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the Illinois Department of Insurance (the “Department”) are determined based on the greater of the prior year’s statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding 12 months. Additionally, ordinary dividends may only be paid from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2020, CCC was in a positive earned surplus position. The maximum allowable dividend CCC could pay during 2021 that would not be subject to the Department’s prior approval is $1,070 million, less dividends paid during the preceding 12 months measured at that point in time. CCC paid dividends of $975 million in 2020. The actual level of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity, holding company liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company.
Combined statutory capital and surplus and statutory net income for the Combined Continental Casualty Companies are presented in the table below, determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance and/or other regulatory authorities.
(a) Information derived from the statutory-basis financial statements to be filed with insurance regulators.
CNA’s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements. RBC is a method developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The formula for determining the amount of RBC specifies various factors, weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity. The adequacy of a company’s actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the RBC results, as determined by the formula. Companies below minimum RBC requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action.
The statutory capital and surplus presented above for CCC was approximately 266% and 291% of company action level RBC at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Company action level RBC is the level of RBC which triggers a heightened level of regulatory supervision. The statutory capital and surplus of CNA’s foreign insurance subsidiaries, which is not significant to the overall statutory capital and surplus, also met or exceeded their respective regulatory and other capital requirements.
Note 15. Benefit Plans
Pension Plans - The Company has several non-contributory defined benefit plans for eligible employees. Benefits for certain plans are determined annually based on a specified percentage of annual earnings (based on the participant’s age or years of service) and a specified interest rate (which is established annually for all participants) applied to accrued balances. The benefits for another plan which covers salaried employees are based on formulas which include, among others, years of service and average pay. The Company’s funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with applicable governmental regulatory requirements.
Other Postretirement Benefit Plans - The Company has several postretirement benefit plans covering eligible employees and retirees. Participants generally become eligible after reaching age 55 with required years of service. Actual requirements for coverage vary by plan. Benefits for retirees who were covered by bargaining agreements vary by each unit and contract. Benefits for certain retirees are in the form of a Company health care account.
Benefits for retirees reaching age 65 are generally integrated with Medicare. Other retirees, based on plan provisions, must use Medicare as their primary coverage, with the Company reimbursing a portion of the unpaid amount; or are reimbursed for the Medicare Part B premium or have no Company coverage. The benefits provided by the Company are basically health and, for certain retirees, life insurance type benefits.
The Company funds certain of these benefit plans and accrues postretirement benefits during the active service of those employees who would become eligible for such benefits when they retire. The Company uses December 31 as the measurement date for their plans.
Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations:
Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost:
In determining the discount rate assumption, current market and liability information is utilized, including a discounted cash flow analysis of the pension and postretirement obligations. In particular, the basis for the discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities. The yield curve was applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans. The yield curves and indices evaluated in the selection of the discount rate are comprised of high quality corporate bonds that are rated AA by an accepted rating agency.
The expected long term rate of return for plan assets is determined based on widely-accepted capital market principles, long term return analysis for global fixed income and equity markets as well as the active total return oriented portfolio management style. Long term trends are evaluated relative to market factors such as inflation, interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies, in order to assess the capital market assumptions as applied to the plan. Consideration of diversification needs and rebalancing is maintained.
Assumed health care cost trend rates:
Net periodic (benefit) cost components:
The following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets:
The benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Changes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 include actuarial losses of $236 million and $300 million primarily driven by changes in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations.
A total return approach is employed whereby a mix of equity, limited partnerships and fixed maturity securities are used to maximize the long term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk and to manage cash flows according to plan requirements. The target allocation of plan assets is 40% to 60% invested in equity securities and limited partnerships, with the remainder primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. The intent of this strategy is to minimize expenses by generating investment returns that exceed the growth of the plan liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance is established after careful consideration of the plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial conditions. The investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of fixed maturity, equity and short term securities. Alternative investments, including limited partnerships, are used to enhance risk adjusted long term returns while improving portfolio diversification. At December 31, 2020, $192 million is committed to fund future capital calls from various third party limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related partnerships. Investment risk is monitored through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.
The table below presents the estimated future minimum benefit payments at December 31, 2020.
In 2021, it is expected that contributions of approximately $20 million will be made to pension plans and $2 million to postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.
Pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below.
(a) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in this table for these investments are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the statement of financial position.
The limited partnership investments held within the plans are recorded at fair value, which represents the plans’ shares of the net asset value of each partnership, as determined by the general partner. Limited partnerships comprising 75% and 80% of the carrying value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 employ hedge fund strategies that generate returns through investing in marketable securities in the public fixed income and equity markets and the remainder were primarily invested in private debt and equity. Within hedge fund strategies, approximately 69% were equity related, 27% pursued a multi-strategy approach and 4% were focused on distressed investments at December 31, 2020.
For a discussion of the valuation methodologies used to measure fixed maturity securities, equities and short term investments, see Note 4.
Other postretirement benefits plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below.
There were no Level 3 assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Savings Plans - The Company has several contributory savings plans which allow employees to make regular contributions based upon a percentage of their salaries. Matching contributions are made up to specified percentages of employees’ contributions. Employer contributions to these plans amounted to $90 million, $102 million and $100 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Stock-based Compensation - In 2016, shareholders approved the Loews Corporation 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2016 Loews Plan”) which replaced a previously existing plan. The aggregate number of shares of Loews Corporation common stock authorized under the 2016 Loews Plan is 6,000,000 shares, plus up to 3,000,000 shares that may be forfeited under the prior plan. The maximum number of shares of Loews Corporation common stock with respect to which awards may be granted to any individual in any calendar year is 500,000 shares. In accordance with the 2016 Loews Plan and the prior equity plan, Loews Corporation stock-based compensation consists of the following:
SARs: SARs were granted under the prior equity plan. The exercise price per share may not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Generally, SARs vest ratably over a four-year period and expire in ten years.
Time-based Restricted Stock Units: Time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) are granted under the 2016 Loews Plan and represent the right to receive one share of Loews Corporation common stock for each vested RSU. Generally, RSUs vest 50% on the second anniversary of the grant date and 50% on the third anniversary of the grant date.
Performance-based Restricted Stock Units: Performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) are granted under the 2016 Loews Plan and represent the right to receive one share of Loews Corporation common stock for each vested PSU, subject to the achievement of specified performance goals by the Company. Generally, performance-based RSUs vest, if performance goals are satisfied, 50% on the second anniversary of the grant date and 50% on the third anniversary of the grant date.
In 2020, Loews Corporation granted an aggregate of 219,571 RSUs and PSUs at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $49.99 per unit. No RSUs were forfeited during the year. 2,062,256 SARs were outstanding at December 31, 2020 with a weighted average exercise price of $41.65.
The Company recognized compensation expense that decreased net income by $37 million, $37 million and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Several of Loews Corporation’s subsidiaries also maintain their own stock-based compensation plans. Such amounts include Loews Corporation’s share of expense related to these plans.
Note 16. Reinsurance
CNA cedes insurance to reinsurers to limit its maximum loss, provide greater diversification of risk, minimize exposures on larger risks and to exit certain lines of business. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary liability of CNA. A credit exposure exists with respect to reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations. A collectability exposure also exists to the extent that the reinsurer disputes the liabilities assumed under reinsurance agreements. Property and casualty reinsurance coverages are tailored to the specific risk characteristics of each product line and CNA’s retained amount varies by type of coverage. Reinsurance contracts are purchased to protect specific lines of business such as property and workers’ compensation. Corporate catastrophe reinsurance is also purchased for property and workers’ compensation exposure. CNA also utilizes facultative reinsurance in certain lines. In addition, CNA assumes reinsurance, primarily through Hardy and as a member of various reinsurance pools and associations.
The following table presents the amounts receivable from reinsurers:
CNA has established an allowance for doubtful accounts on voluntary reinsurance receivables which relates to both amounts already billed on ceded paid losses as well as ceded reserves that will be billed when losses are paid in the future. The following table summarizes the outstanding amount of voluntary reinsurance receivables, gross of any collateral arrangements, by financial strength rating:
(a) Expected credit losses for legacy A&EP receivables are ceded to NICO and the reinsurance limit on the LPT has not been exhausted, therefore no allowance is recorded for these receivables and they are excluded from the table above. See Note 8 for more information on the LPT. Also excluded are receivables from involuntary pools.
CNA attempts to mitigate its credit risk related to reinsurance by entering into reinsurance arrangements with reinsurers that have credit ratings above certain levels and by obtaining collateral. On a limited basis, CNA may enter into reinsurance agreements with reinsurers that are not rated, primarily captive reinsurers. Receivables from captive reinsurers are backed by collateral arrangements and comprise the majority of the voluntary reinsurance receivables within the B- to B++ rating distribution in the table above. The primary methods of obtaining collateral are through reinsurance trusts, letters of credit and funds withheld balances. Such collateral, limited by the balance of open recoverables, was approximately $3.3 billion and $3.2 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
CNA’s largest recoverables from a single reinsurer, including ceded unearned premium reserves as of December 31, 2020 were approximately $1.9 billion from subsidiaries of the Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group, $377 million from the Gateway Rivers Insurance Company and $314 million from the Palo Verde Insurance Company. These amounts are substantially collateralized or otherwise secured. The recoverable from subsidiaries of the Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group includes amounts related to third party reinsurance for which NICO has assumed the credit risk under the terms of the loss portfolio transfer as discussed in Note 8.
The effects of reinsurance on earned premiums are presented in the following table:
Included in the direct and ceded earned premiums for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are $3.5 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.7 billion related to property business that is 100% reinsured under a significant third party captive program. The third party captives that participate in this program are affiliated with the non-insurance company policyholders, therefore this program provides a means for the policyholders to self-insure this property risk. CNA receives and retains a ceding commission.
Long term care premiums are from long-duration contracts; property and casualty premiums are from short-duration contracts.
Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations are net of estimated reinsurance recoveries of $3.2 billion, $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, including $2.4 billion, $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion related to the significant third party captive program discussed above.
Note 17. Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)
The sum of the quarterly per share amounts may not equal per share amounts reported for year-to-date periods. This is due to changes in the number of weighted average shares outstanding and the effects of rounding for each period.
(a) Net income for the third quarter of 2020 included net catastrophe losses of $112 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) and a $52 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) charge related to the recognition of an active life reserve premium deficiency as a result of the third quarter GPV.
(b) Net loss for the second quarter of 2020 included an investment loss of $957 million (after tax) related to the deconsolidation of Diamond Offshore and net catastrophe losses of $212 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests).
(c) Net loss for the first quarter of 2020 included an aggregate asset impairment charge of $408 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to Diamond Offshore drilling rigs.
(d) Net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 included net investment income of $116 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) related to limited partnerships and equity securities partially offset by asset impairment charges of $69 million (after tax).
(e) Net income for the third quarter of 2019 included a $151 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) charge related to the recognition of an active life reserve premium deficiency as a result of the third quarter GPV.
Note 18. Legal Proceedings
On May 25, 2018, plaintiffs Tsemach Mishal and Paul Berger (on behalf of themselves and the purported class, “Plaintiffs”) initiated a purported class action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Court”) against the following defendants: Boardwalk Pipelines, Boardwalk GP, LP (“General Partner”), Boardwalk GP, LLC and Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp. (“BPHC”) (together, “Defendants”), regarding the potential exercise by the General Partner of its right to purchase all of the issued and outstanding common units representing limited partnership interests in Boardwalk Pipelines not already owned by the General Partner or its affiliates.
On June 25, 2018, Plaintiffs and Defendants entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, subject to the approval of the Court (the “Proposed Settlement”). Under the terms of the Proposed Settlement, the lawsuit would be dismissed, and related claims against the Defendants would be released by the Plaintiffs, if BPHC, the sole member of the General Partner, elected to cause the General Partner to exercise its right to purchase the issued and outstanding common units of Boardwalk Pipelines pursuant to Boardwalk Pipelines’ Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (“Limited Partnership Agreement”), within a period specified by the Proposed Settlement. On June 29, 2018, the General Partner elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the issued and outstanding common units representing limited partnership interests in Boardwalk Pipelines not already owned by the General Partner or its affiliates pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement within the period specified by the Proposed Settlement. The transaction was completed on July 18, 2018.
On September 28, 2018, the Court denied approval of the Proposed Settlement. On February 11, 2019, a substitute verified class action complaint was filed in this proceeding. The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was heard by the Court in July of 2019. In October of 2019, the Court ruled on the motion and granted a partial dismissal, with certain aspects of the case proceeding to trial. The case is set for trial in February of 2021.
The Company and its subsidiaries also are from time to time parties to other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is difficult to predict the outcome or effect of any litigation, management does not believe that the outcome of any pending litigation, including the Boardwalk Pipelines matter described above, will materially affect the Company’s results of operations or equity.
Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies
CNA Financial
CNA has provided guarantees, if the primary obligor fails to perform, to holders of structured settlement annuities issued by a previously owned subsidiary. As of December 31, 2020, the potential amount of future payments CNA could be required to pay under these guarantees was approximately $1.7 billion, which will be paid over the lifetime of the annuitants. CNA does not believe any payment is likely under these guarantees, as CNA is the beneficiary of a trust that must be maintained at a level that approximates the discounted reserves for these annuities.
CNA recently became aware of discrepancies in the experience rating calculation of certain general liability policies. These calculation discrepancies resulted in certain policyholders being undercharged while others were overcharged. CNA has made corrections to its systems and processes to address the issue. CNA recorded a charge which reduced earned premium by $14 million in anticipation of voluntarily issuing premium refunds in connection with policies written from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020 which were overcharged. CNA has contacted regulators in states with a significant anticipated volume of premium refunds. Fines or penalties related to the foregoing are reasonably possible, but the amount of such fines, if any, cannot be estimated at this time.
Note 20. Segments
Loews Corporation has five reportable segments comprised of three individual consolidated operating subsidiaries, CNA, Boardwalk Pipelines and Loews Hotels & Co; the Corporate segment and Diamond Offshore. The Corporate segment is primarily comprised of Loews Corporation excluding its subsidiaries and the operations of Altium Packaging. Diamond Offshore was deconsolidated during the second quarter of 2020. See Note 2 for further information on the deconsolidation of Diamond Offshore. Each of the operating subsidiaries and Diamond Offshore are headed by a chief executive officer who is responsible for the operation of its business and has the duties and authority commensurate with that position.
CNA’s business is the sale of property and casualty insurance coverage primarily through a network of independent agents, brokers and managing general underwriters. CNA’s operations also include its long term care business that is in run-off, certain corporate expenses, including interest on CNA’s corporate debt, and certain property and casualty businesses in run-off, including CNA Re and A&EP.
Boardwalk Pipelines is engaged in the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas and NGLs. This segment consists of interstate natural gas pipeline systems located in the Gulf Coast region, Oklahoma, Arkansas and the midwestern states of Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, natural gas storage facilities in four states and NGL pipelines and storage facilities in Louisiana and Texas, with approximately 14,095 miles of pipeline.
Loews Hotels & Co operates a chain of 27 hotels, 26 of which are in the United States and one of which is in Canada.
The Corporate segment consists of investment income from the Parent Company’s cash and investments, Parent Company interest expense, other unallocated Parent Company expenses and the results of Altium Packaging. Purchase accounting adjustments have been pushed down to the appropriate subsidiary.
The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1.
In the following tables certain financial measures are presented to provide information used by management to monitor the Company’s operating performance. These schedules present the reportable segments of the Company and their contribution to the consolidated financial statements. Amounts presented will not necessarily be the same as those in the individual financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries due to adjustments for purchase accounting, income taxes and noncontrolling interests.
Statements of Operations and Total assets by segment are presented in the following tables.
(a) Amounts presented for Diamond Offshore reflect the periods prior to the deconsolidation.
Note 21. Subsequent Event
On December 30, 2020, CNA entered into an agreement with Cavello Bay Reinsurance Limited (“Cavello”), a subsidiary of Enstar Group Limited, under which Cavello reinsured a legacy portfolio of excess workers’ compensation policies. The transaction closed on February 5, 2021. Under the terms of the transaction, based on reserves in place as of January 1, 2020, and adjusted for any subsequent claim activity, CNA ceded to Cavello approximately $690 million of net excess workers’ compensation liabilities relating to business written in 2007 and prior under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $1 billion. A loss of approximately $11 million (after tax and noncontrolling interests) will be recognized in the first quarter of 2021.
