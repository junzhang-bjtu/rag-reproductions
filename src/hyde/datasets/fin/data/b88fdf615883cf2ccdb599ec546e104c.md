ITEM 8.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
HEI and Hawaiian Electric:
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“generally accepted accounting principles”). Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for its allowance for credit losses in 2020 due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.The adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 is also communicated in a critical audit matter below.
Basis for Opinions
The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Electric Utility Segment - Regulatory Assets and Liabilities - Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. (“Hawaiian Electric” or the “Utility”) is subject to rate regulation by the Hawaii Public Utility Commission (the “PUC”) and accounts for the effects of regulation under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 980, “Regulated Operations,” as management believes that the operations of the Utility currently satisfy the criteria for regulatory accounting. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; operation and maintenance expense; and depreciation expense. As of December 31, 2020, regulatory assets and liabilities amounted to approximately $766,708,000 and $959,786,000, respectively. The Company’s continued accounting under ASC Topic 980 generally requires that rates are established by an independent, third party regulator; rates are designed to recover the costs of providing service; and it is reasonable to assume that rates can be charged to, and collected from, customers. On December 23, 2020, the PUC issued a Decision and Order approving a new performance-based regulation (“PBR”) framework.
Hawaiian Electric’s rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and earnings oversight. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Utility’s costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, Hawaiian Electric’s investment in the utility business. Any decision by the PUC could (1) impact the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets and (2) necessitate a refund in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities.
We identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about the applicability of applying the specialized rules and the impacted account balances, including disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the applicability of the specialized rules and the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs and (2) a refund to customers. Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the PUC, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost- based rate regulation and the uncertainty of future decisions by the rate regulators included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over (1) the evaluation of the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation and (2) the evaluation of the likelihood of (a) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets and (b) a refund that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. Such controls include the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or refunding amounts in rates.
•With the assistance of professionals in our firm having expertise in regulatory accounting, we evaluated the Company’s conclusion that it should apply the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation including considerations as a result of the PBR decision and order.
•We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.
•We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the PUC for the Utility, regulatory statutes, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the PUC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.
•For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Utility’s filings with the PUC and the filings with the PUC by intervenors that may impact the Utility’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.
•We obtained analyses from management, which includes input from regulatory and legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, or refundable in rates.
Allowance for Credit Losses - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements (also see Change in Accounting Principle explanatory paragraph above)
Critical Audit Matter Description
The allowance for credit losses is a material estimate of the Company and as of December 31, 2020, the total balance was $101.2 million. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments”, which replaced the incurred loss methodology for the allowance for credit losses with an expected loss methodology. The allowance for credit losses is based on the composition, characteristics, and quality of the loans and off-balance sheet credit exposures, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The credit loss models use a probability- of-default, loss given default, and exposure at default methodology to estimate expected credit losses.
The Company also incorporates qualitative factors to adjust the historical loss rates or other static sources as these rates may not be an accurate indicator of expected losses in the current portfolio. These qualitative factors include, but are not limited to, adjustments for changes in policies and procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and any concentrations of credit.
The selection of relevant and appropriate qualitative factors in calculating the allowance for credit losses requires significant management judgment. Given the magnitude of the qualitative factors and significant amount of judgment required by management in developing the qualitative component of the overall allowance, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the allowance for credit losses required a high degree of auditor judgment, an increased level of effort, and the need to involve more experienced audit professionals.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the allowance for credit losses, included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls over the allowance for credit losses, including management’s controls over the respective qualitative factors.
•We evaluated the reasonableness and conceptual soundness of the allowance for credit losses modeling framework, including the use of qualitative factors.
•We tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculation of the qualitative allowance for credit losses as well as the accuracy and completeness of data used as inputs to the determination of qualitative factors.
•We evaluated the qualitative factors applied to the historical loss rates, including assessing the basis for the factors and the reasonableness of the qualitative factors used in the allowance for credit losses.
•We evaluated the directional consistency and magnitude of the qualitative adjustments, as well as the absolute value of the allowance for credit losses attributable to the qualitative adjustments.
•In order to identify potential bias in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, we performed analytical analysis, including retrospective review, where we compared the estimate of losses to actual losses, analyzed ratios of the allowance for credit losses to loans and other relevant metrics, such as losses and nonperforming loans, and performed peer analysis where we compared relevant metrics to comparable financial institutions, and evaluated the relevance of the underlying data used to determine qualitative factors, to identify potential bias in the determination of the allowance for credit losses.
Goodwill - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company’s goodwill balance was $82.2 million as of December 31, 2020, which relates to the Company’s reporting Bank segment. The fair value of the Bank exceeded its carrying value by more than 35% as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was recognized. The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of the Bank to its carrying value. The Company used a weighting of the income approach (discounted cash flows) and
market approach to estimate fair value. More weight was given to the income approach (75%) as this approach uses the projected performance of the Bank in the current stressed environment and would be more indicative of the current fair value of the Bank. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to discount rate and forecasts of net income, including estimated cost savings if the Bank were acquired.
Given the significant estimates and assumptions made by management to estimate the fair value of the Bank, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the selection of the discount rate and forecasts of net income, including estimated cost savings if the Bank were acquired, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to the discount rate and forecasts of net income, specifically the level of estimated cost savings if the Bank were acquired, used by management to estimate the fair value of the Bank included the following, among others:
•We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including those over the determination of the fair value of the Bank, such as controls related to management’s selection of the discount rate and forecasts of net income, including the level of estimated cost savings if the Bank were acquired.
•We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast net income by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.
•We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s net income forecasts, including estimated cost savings if the Bank were acquired, by comparing the forecasts to:
◦Historical net income.
◦Cost savings observed in market transactions.
◦Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors.
◦Forecasted information included in the Company’s press releases as well as in analyst and industry reports of the Company and companies in its peer group.
•With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the (1) valuation methodology and (2) discount rate by:
◦Testing the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation.
◦Developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 · Summary of significant accounting policies
General
Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. (HEI) is a holding company with direct and indirect subsidiaries principally engaged in electric utility, banking, and renewable/sustainable infrastructure investment businesses operating in the State of Hawaii. HEI owns Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. (Hawaiian Electric), ASB Hawaii, Inc. (ASB Hawaii), an intermediate holding company that owns American Savings Bank, F.S.B. (ASB), and Pacific Current, LLC (Pacific Current). Pacific Current’s significant subsidiaries include Hamakua Energy, LLC (Hamakua Energy) and Mauo, LLC (Mauo).
Hawaiian Electric and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Hawaii Electric Light Company, Inc. (Hawaii Electric Light) and Maui Electric Company, Limited (Maui Electric), are regulated public electric utilities (collectively, the Utilities) in the business of generating, purchasing, transmitting, distributing and selling electric energy on all major islands in Hawaii other than Kauai. See Note 2.
ASB is a federally chartered savings bank providing a full range of banking services to individual and business customers through its branch system in Hawaii.
Hamakua Energy, owns and operates a 60-megawatt (MW) combined-cycle power plant, which sells the power it produces only to Hawaii Electric Light. Mauo is a commercial-scale, solar-plus-storage project (8.6 MW of solar and 42.3 MW of storage) currently under construction on the islands of Oahu and Maui.
Basis of presentation. In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.
Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change for HEI and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company) include the amounts reported as fair value for investment securities (ASB only); pension and other postretirement benefit obligations; contingencies and litigation; income taxes; regulatory assets and liabilities (Utilities only); electric utility unbilled revenues (Utilities only); asset retirement obligations (Utilities only); goodwill (ASB only) and allowance for credit losses (ASB only).
Consolidation. The HEI consolidated financial statements include the accounts of HEI and its subsidiaries. The Hawaiian Electric consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries. When HEI or Hawaiian Electric has a controlling financial interest in another entity (usually, majority voting interest), that entity is consolidated. Investments in companies over which the Company or the Utilities have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for using the equity method. The consolidated financial statements exclude variable interest entities (VIEs) when the Company or the Utilities are not the primary beneficiaries. In general, significant intercompany amounts are eliminated in consolidation (see Note 2 for exceptions).
Cash and cash equivalents. The Utilities consider cash on hand, deposits in banks, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, short-term commercial paper of non-affiliates and liquid investments (with original maturities of three months or less) to be cash and cash equivalents. The Company considers the same items to be cash and cash equivalents as well as ASB’s deposits with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB), federal funds sold (excess funds that ASB loans to other banks overnight at the federal funds rate) and securities purchased under resale agreements with original maturities of three months or less. Additionally, ASB is required by the Federal Reserve System to maintain noninterest-bearing cash reserves equal to a percentage of certain deposits. The reserve requirement for ASB at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was nil and $26.2 million, respectively. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve Board reduced the reserve requirement to 0% to support the depository institutions during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Restricted cash. The Utilities consider funds on deposit with trustees, which represent the undrawn proceeds from the issuance of special purpose revenue bonds, to be restricted cash because these funds are available only to finance (or reimburse payment of) approved capital expenditures. In addition to the Utilities’ funds on deposit with trustees, the Company considers cash held by trustees related to secured loans at Pacific Current subsidiaries to be restricted cash. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, total restricted cash of the Company was $17.6 million and $30.9 million, respectively, and for the Utilities was $16.0 million and $30.9 million, respectively.
Property, plant and equipment. Property, plant and equipment are reported at cost. Self-constructed electric utility plant includes engineering, supervision, administrative and general costs and an allowance for the cost of funds used during the
construction period. These costs are recorded in construction in progress and are transferred to utility plant when construction is completed and the facilities are either placed in service or become useful for public utility purposes. Costs for betterments that make utility plant more useful, more efficient, of greater durability or of greater capacity are also capitalized. Upon the retirement or sale of electric utility plant, generally no gain or loss is recognized. The cost of the plant retired is charged to accumulated depreciation. Amounts collected from customers for cost of removal are included in regulatory liabilities. See discussion regarding “Utility projects” in Note 3.
Depreciation. Depreciation is computed primarily using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets being depreciated. Electric utility plant additions in the current year are depreciated beginning January 1 of the following year in accordance with rate-making. Electric utility plant has lives ranging from 16 to 51 years for production plant, from 10 to 79 years for transmission and distribution plant, and from 5 to 50 years for general plant. The Utilities’ composite annual depreciation rate, which includes a component for cost of removal, was 3.2% in 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Retirement benefits. Pension and other postretirement benefit costs are charged primarily to expense and electric utility plant (in the case of the Utilities). Funding for the Company’s qualified pension plans (Plans) is based on actuarial assumptions adopted by the Pension Investment Committee administering the Plans. The participating employers contribute amounts to pension trusts for the Plans in accordance with the funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), including changes promulgated by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and considering the deductibility of contributions under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company generally funds at least the net periodic pension cost during the year, subject to ERISA minimum and Internal Revenue Code limits and targeted funded status.
Certain health care and/or life insurance benefits are provided to eligible retired employees and the employees’ beneficiaries and covered dependents. The Company generally funds the net periodic postretirement benefit costs other than pensions (except for executive life) for postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB), while maximizing the use of the most tax-advantaged funding vehicles, subject to cash flow requirements and reviews of the funded status with the consulting actuary.
Environmental expenditures. The Company and the Utilities are subject to numerous federal and state environmental statutes and regulations. In general, environmental contamination treatment costs are charged to expense. Environmental costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life, increase the capacity, or improve the safety or efficiency of property; the costs mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination; or the costs are incurred in preparing the property for sale. Environmental costs are either capitalized or charged to expense when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. The Utilities review their sites and measure the liability quarterly by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs of each identified site using currently available information, including existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, experience gained at similar sites, and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties.
Income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the Company’s and the Utilities’ assets and liabilities at federal and state tax rates expected to be in effect when such deferred tax assets or liabilities are realized or settled. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
HEI and the Utilities’ investment tax credits are deferred and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the properties to which the credits relate (and for the Utilities, this treatment is in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 980, “Regulated Operations”).
The Utilities are included in the consolidated income tax returns of HEI. However, income tax expense has been computed for financial statement purposes as if each utility filed a separate income tax return and Hawaiian Electric filed a consolidated Hawaiian Electric income tax return.
Governmental tax authorities could challenge a tax return position taken by the Company. The Company and the Utilities use a “more-likely-than-not” recognition threshold and measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
Fair value measurements. Fair value estimates are estimates of the price that would be received to sell an asset, or paid upon the transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value estimates are generally determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and are based on market data obtained from independent sources. However, in certain cases, the Company and the Utilities use their
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
own assumptions about market participant assumptions based on the best information available in the circumstances. These valuations are estimates at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information, information about the financial instrument and judgments regarding future expected loss experience, economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result if the Company or the Utilities were to sell its entire holdings of a particular financial instrument at one time. Because no active trading market exists for a portion of the Company’s and the Utilities’ financial instruments, fair value estimates cannot be determined with precision. Changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, could significantly affect the estimates. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses could have a significant effect on fair value estimates, but have not been considered in making such estimates.
The Company and the Utilities group their financial assets measured at fair value in three levels outlined as follows:
Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is used to measure fair value whenever available.
Level 2: Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or inputs to the valuation methodology that are derived principally from or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.
Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.
Classification in the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the asset or liability. For instruments classified in Level 1 and 2 where inputs are primarily based upon observable market data, there is less judgment applied in arriving at the fair value. For instruments classified in Level 3, management judgment is more significant due to the lack of observable market data.
The Company reviews and updates the fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs in fair value measurements may result in a reclassification between the fair value hierarchy levels and are recognized based on period-end balances.
Fair value is also used on a nonrecurring basis to evaluate certain assets for impairment or for disclosure purposes. Examples of nonrecurring uses of fair value include mortgage servicing rights accounted for by the amortization method, loan impairments for certain loans, real estate acquired in settlement of loans, goodwill and asset retirement obligations (AROs).
Earnings per share (HEI only). Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income for common stock by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed similarly, except that dilutive common shares for stock compensation is added to the denominator. There were no shares of antidilutive securities outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Impairment of long-lived assets and long-lived assets to be disposed of. The Company and the Utilities review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell.
Recent accounting pronouncements.
Credit losses. In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which replaces the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology. The new methodology is referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology and applies to financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to loans, loan commitments and held-to-maturity securities. In addition, ASU No. 2016-13 amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The other-than-temporary
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
impairment model of accounting for credit losses on AFS debt securities has been replaced with an estimate of expected credit losses only when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset. The length of time the fair value of an AFS debt security has been below the amortized cost will no longer impact the determination of whether a credit loss exists. The AFS debt security model requires the use of an allowance to record the estimated losses (and subsequent recoveries).
The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 on January 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective method with the cumulative effect of initially applying the amendments recognized in retained earnings as of January 1, 2020. The CECL models use a probability-of-default, loss given default and exposure at default methodology to estimate the expected credit losses. Within each model or calculation, loans are further segregated based on additional risk characteristics specific to that loan type, such as risk rating, FICO score, bankruptcy score, age of loan and collateral. The Company uses both internal and external historical data, as appropriate, and a blend of economic forecasts to estimate credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period and then reverts to a longer-term historical loss experience to arrive at lifetime expected credit losses. The reversion period incorporates forward-looking expectations about repayments (including prepayments) as determined by the Company’s asset liability management system.
The allowance for credit losses (ACL) is a material estimate of the Company. As a result of the change from an incurred loss model to a methodology that considers the credit loss over the expected life of the loan, on January 1, 2020, the Company recorded an adjustment of $21 million to increase the ACL, including a $2 million increase in the allowance for loan commitments, with a corresponding adjustment to reduce retained earnings by $15 million on an after-tax basis. The ACL is based on the composition, characteristics and quality of the loans and off balance sheet credit exposures as well as the prevailing economic conditions as of the adoption date. The increase in the ACL primarily relates to required reserves for residential mortgages and consumer loans, due to the requirement to estimate lifetime expected credit losses, with lower ACL requirements for commercial and commercial real estate loans due to their short-term nature. Based on the credit quality of the Company’s existing held-to-maturity and AFS investment securities portfolio, the Company did not recognize an ACL at adoption for those investments. The adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact to the Utilities’ customer and other accounts receivables and accrued unbilled revenue. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2020 are presented under ASU No. 2016-13 while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable GAAP (see Note 4).
The table below summarizes the impact of the Company’s adoption of ASU No. 2016-13.
1 The allowance for credit losses is classified in “Loans held for investments, net,” and the allowance for loan commitments is classified in “Other” liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.
Income Taxes. In December 2019, FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” which removes specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740, improves financial statement preparers’ application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP under certain situations. ASU 2019-12 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.
Reclassifications. Certain reclassifications of prior year amounts were made to conform to the current-year financial statement presentation. Reclassifications did not affect previously reported cash flows, net income or retained earnings.

Electric utility
Regulation by the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Hawaii (PUC). The Utilities are regulated by the PUC and account for the effects of regulation under FASB ASC Topic 980, “Regulated Operations.” As a result, the Utilities’ financial statements reflect assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses based on current cost-based rate-making regulations (see Note 3-“Regulatory assets and liabilities”). Their continued accounting under ASC Topic 980 generally requires that rates are established by an independent, third-party regulator; rates are designed to recover the costs of providing service; and it is reasonable to assume that rates can be charged to, and collected from, customers. Management believes that the operations of the Utilities, including the impact of the newly approved PBR Framework, currently satisfy the criteria under ASC Topic 980.
The rate schedules of the Utilities include energy costs recovery clauses (ECRCs) under which electric rates are adjusted for changes in the weighted-average price paid for fuel oil and certain components of purchased power, and the relative amounts of company-generated power and purchased power. The rate schedules also include purchased power adjustment clauses (PPACs) under which the remaining purchase power expenses are recovered through surcharge mechanisms. The amounts collected through the ECRCs and PPACs are required to be reconciled quarterly.
Accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount. The Utilities generally assess a late payment charge on balances unpaid from the previous month. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the Utilities’ best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the Utilities’ existing accounts receivable. Due to the economic impact of COVID on customers and the moratorium on electric service disconnections through March 31, 2021, the allowance for doubtful accounts increased in 2020. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the allowance for customer accounts receivable, accrued unbilled revenues and other accounts receivable was $17.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively.
Electric utility revenues. Revenues related to electric service are generally recorded when service is rendered and include revenues applicable to energy consumed in the accounting period but not yet billed to the customers. The Utilities also record revenue under a decoupling mechanism. See “Current Decoupling” discussion in Note 3 - Electric utility segment.
Repairs and maintenance costs. Repairs and maintenance costs for overhauls of generating units are generally expensed as they are incurred.
Allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). AFUDC represents the estimated costs of debt (i.e., interest) and equity funds used to finance plant construction. AFUDC is credited on the statement of income and charged to construction in progress on the balance sheet. If a project under construction is delayed for an extended period of time, AFUDC on the delayed project may be stopped after assessing the causes of the delay and probability of recovery. The tax gross up of the allowance for equity funds used during construction is credited to income taxes on the statement of income and charged to a regulatory asset. This gross up, net of amortization of the regulatory asset, is reflected in income tax expense.
The weighted-average AFUDC rate was 7.1% in 2020, 7.4% in 2019 and 7.3% in 2018, and reflected quarterly compounding.
Asset retirement obligations. AROs are accounted for in accordance with ASC 410-20, Asset Retirement Obligations. AROs are recognized at present value of expected costs to retire long-lived assets from service, provided a legal obligation exists and a reasonable estimate of the fair value and the settlement date can be made. In the subsequent period, the liability is accreted to its future value while the asset retirement cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the underlying asset. The Utilities’ recognition of AROs have no impact on earnings, as the cost of the AROs are recovered over the life of the asset through depreciation. AROs recognized by the Utilities relate to legal obligations with the retirement of plant and equipment, including removal of asbestos and other hazardous materials. See “Asset retirement obligations” in Note 3 - Electric utility segment.
Bank (HEI only)
Investment securities. Investments in debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity (HTM), trading or available-for-sale (AFS). ASB determines the appropriate classification at the time of purchase. Debt securities that ASB intends to and has the ability to hold to maturity are classified as HTM securities and reported at amortized cost. Marketable debt securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Marketable debt securities not classified as either HTM or trading securities are classified as AFS and reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses for AFS securities are excluded from earnings and reported on a net basis in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) until realized.
Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Discounts and premiums on securities are accreted or amortized into interest income using the interest method over the remaining contractual lives of the agency obligation securities and the
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
estimated lives of the mortgage-backed securities adjusted for anticipated prepayments. ASB uses actual prepayment experience and estimates of future prepayments to determine the constant effective yield necessary to apply the interest method of income recognition. The discounts and premiums on the agency obligations portfolio are accreted or amortized on a prospective basis using expected contractual cash flows. The discounts and premiums on the mortgage-backed securities portfolio are accreted or amortized on a retrospective basis using changes in anticipated prepayments. This method requires a retrospective adjustment of the effective yield each time ASB changes the estimated life as if the new estimate had been known since the original acquisition date of the securities. Estimates of future prepayments are based on the underlying collateral characteristics and historic or projected prepayment behavior of each security. The specific identification method is used in determining realized gains and losses on the sales of securities.
AFS debt securities with unrealized losses are reviewed quarterly. ASB will first assess whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either criteria is met, the security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through income. For AFS securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, ASB evaluates whether the decline in fair value is the result of a credit loss or other factors. The determination of whether or not a credit loss exists is based on consideration of the cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security. ASB develops these expectations after considering various factors such as agency ratings, the financial condition of the issuer, payment history, payment structure of the security, industry and market conditions, underlying collateral and other factors which may be relevant based on the facts and circumstances pertaining to individual securities. If this assessment indicates that a credit loss exists, the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security are compared to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a provision for (or reversal of) credit losses. Losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of an AFS security is confirmed or when either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there was no indicated impairment as ASB expects to collect the contractual cash flows for these investments.
Held-to-maturity debt securities are assessed periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary to absorb credit losses expected to occur over the remaining contractual life of the securities. The carrying amount of held-to-maturity debt securities is presented net of the valuation allowance for credit losses when such an allowance is deemed necessary.
Stock in FHLB is carried at cost and is reviewed at least quarterly for impairment, with valuation adjustments recognized in noninterest income.
Loans. ASB carries loans at amortized cost less the allowance for credit losses, loan origination fees (net of direct loan origination costs), commitment fees and purchase premiums and discounts. Interest on loans is credited to income as it is earned. Discounts and premiums are accreted or amortized over the life of the loans using the interest method.
Loan origination fees (net of direct loan origination costs) are deferred and recognized as an adjustment in yield over periods not exceeding the contractual life of the loan using the interest method or taken into income when the loan is paid off or sold. Nonrefundable commitment fees (net of direct loan origination costs, if applicable) received for commitments to originate or purchase loans are deferred and, if the commitment is exercised, recognized as an adjustment of yield over the life of the loan using the interest method. Nonrefundable commitment fees received for which the commitment expires unexercised are recognized as income upon expiration of the commitment.
Loans held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value on an aggregate basis. Premiums, discounts and net deferred loan fees are not amortized while a loan is classified as held for sale. A sale is recognized only when the consideration received is other than beneficial interests in the assets sold and control over the assets is transferred irrevocably to the buyer. Gains or losses on sales of loans are recognized at the time of sale and are determined by the difference between the net sales proceeds and the allocated basis of the loans sold.
Allowance for credit losses. The ACL represents management’s estimate of expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of the related loans as of the balance sheet date. Contractual terms are adjusted for expected prepayments but are not extended for expected extensions, renewals or modifications except in circumstances where ASB reasonably expects to execute a troubled debt restructuring with the borrower or where certain extension or renewal options are embedded in the original contract and not unconditionally cancellable by the bank.
Accrued interest receivables on loans are presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a component of other assets. When accrued interest is deemed to be uncollectible (typically when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status), interest
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
income is reversed against interest income on loans. ASB follows established policies for placing loans on nonaccrual status, so uncollectible accrued interest receivable is reversed in a timely manner. As a result, the bank has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables.
Credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the ACL. The ACL is maintained at a level the Bank considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing assessments and evaluations of the collectability of loans. The bank’s expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience, current market and economic conditions, and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable. Generally, the Bank considers its forecasts to be reasonable and supportable for a period of up to a year from the estimation date. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, expected credit losses are estimated by reverting to historical loss information without adjustment for changes in economic conditions. The Bank evaluates the length of its reasonable and supportable forecast period, its reversion period and reversion methodology at least annually, or more often if warranted by economic conditions or other circumstances.
The Bank’s methodology for determining the ACL includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans which are individually evaluated.
ASB disaggregates its portfolio loans into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses. Commercial, commercial real estate, and commercial construction loans are defined as non-homogeneous loans and ASB utilizes a risk rating system for evaluating the credit quality of the loans. Non-homogeneous loans are also categorized into the regulatory asset quality classifications-Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss based on credit quality. ASB utilizes a numerical-based, risk rating “PD Model” that takes into consideration fiscal year-end financial information of the borrower and identified financial attributes including retained earnings, operating cash flows, interest coverage, liquidity and leverage that demonstrate a strong correlation with default to assign default probabilities at the borrower level. In addition, a loss given default (LGD) value is assigned to each loan to measure loss in the event of default based on loan specific features such as collateral that mitigates the amount of loss in the event of default.
Residential, consumer and credit scored business loans are considered homogeneous loans, which are typically underwritten based on common, uniform standards. For the homogeneous portfolio, the quality of the loan is best indicated by the repayment performance of an individual borrower. ASB supplements performance data with external credit bureau data and credit scores such as the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score on a quarterly basis. ASB has built portfolio loss models for each major segment based on the combination of internal and external data to predict the probability of default at the loan level.
The Bank also considers qualitative factors in determining the ACL. Qualitative factors are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses but that are not fully captured within the bank’s expected credit loss models. These include but are not limited to adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting, monitoring or collections, economic conditions, portfolio mix, lending and risk management personnel, results of internal audit and quality control reviews, collateral values and any concentrations of credit.
.
The reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to cover expected losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the unfunded credit facilities, including an assessment of historical commitment utilization experience, credit risk grading and historical loss rates. This process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses, as discussed above. Net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income.
The allowance for credit losses is based on currently available information and historical experience, and future adjustments may be required from time to time to the allowance for credit losses based on new information and changes that occur (e.g., due to changes in economic conditions, particularly in Hawaii). Actual losses could differ from management’s estimates, and these differences and subsequent adjustments could be material.
Nonperforming loans. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when contractually past due 90 days or more, or earlier if the probability of collection is insufficient to warrant further accrual. All interest that is accrued but not collected is reversed. A loan may be returned to accrual status if (i) principal and interest payments have been brought current and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected to be made, (ii) the loan has otherwise become well-secured and in the process of collection, or (iii) the borrower has been making regularly scheduled payments in full for the prior six months and it is reasonably assured that the loan will be brought fully current within a reasonable period. Cash receipts on nonaccruing loans are generally applied to reduce the unpaid principal balance.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Loans considered to be uncollectible are charged-off against the allowance for credit losses. The amount and timing of charge-offs on loans includes consideration of the loan type, length of delinquency, insufficiency of collateral value, lien priority and the overall financial condition of the borrower. Recoveries on loans previously charged-off are credited back to the allowance for credit losses. Loans that have been charged-off against the allowance for credit losses are periodically monitored to evaluate whether further adjustments to the allowance are necessary.
Loans in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolio are charged-off when the loan is risk rated “Doubtful” or “Loss.” The loan or a portion thereof is determined to be uncollectible after considering the borrower’s overall financial condition and collateral deficiency. A commercial or commercial real estate loan is considered uncollectible when: (a) the borrower is delinquent in principal or interest 90 days or more; (b) significant improvement in the borrower’s repayment capacity is doubtful; and/or (c) collateral value is insufficient to cover outstanding indebtedness and no other viable assets or repayment sources exist.
Loans in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios are charged-off when the loan or a portion thereof is determined to be uncollectible after considering the borrower’s overall financial condition and collateral deficiency. Such loan is considered uncollectible when: (a) the borrower is delinquent in principal or interest 180 days or more; (b) it is probable that collateral value is insufficient to cover outstanding indebtedness and no other viable assets or repayment sources exist; (c) notification of the borrower’s bankruptcy is received or the borrower’s debt is discharged in bankruptcy and the loan is not reaffirmed; or (d) in cases where ASB is in a subordinate position to other debt, the senior lien holder has foreclosed and ASB’s junior lien is extinguished.
Other consumer loans are generally charged-off when the balance becomes 120 days delinquent.
Loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring. Loans are considered to have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) when, due to a borrower’s financial difficulties, ASB makes concessions to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider for a non-troubled borrower. Modifications may include interest rate reductions, interest only payments for an extended period of time, protracted terms such as amortization and maturity beyond the customary length of time found in the normal market place, and other actions intended to minimize economic loss and to provide alternatives to foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Generally, a nonaccrual loan that has been modified in a TDR remains on nonaccrual status until the borrower has demonstrated sustained repayment performance for a period of six consecutive months. However, performance prior to the modification, or significant events that coincide with the modification, are included in assessing whether the borrower can meet the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to accrual status at the time of loan modification or after a shorter performance period. If the borrower’s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is uncertain, or there is reasonable doubt over the full collectability of principal and interest, the loan remains on nonaccrual status.
Real estate acquired in settlement of loans. ASB records real estate acquired in settlement of loans at fair value, less estimated selling expenses. ASB obtains appraisals based on recent comparable sales to assist management in estimating the fair value of real estate acquired in settlement of loans. Subsequent declines in value are charged to expense through a valuation allowance. Costs related to holding real estate are charged to operations as incurred.
Goodwill. Goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment during the fourth quarter. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of goodwill was $82.2 million. The goodwill relates to ASB and is the Company’s only intangible asset with an indefinite useful life.
To determine if there was an impairment to the book value of goodwill pertaining to ASB, the fair value of ASB was estimated using a valuation method based on the market and income approaches. The market approach considers publicly traded financial institutions and measures the institutions’ market values as a multiple to (1) net income and (2) tangible book equity. The market approach also looks at sale transactions to determine the fair value under this approach. The mean market value multiples for net income and tangible book equity from the selected institutions were applied to ASB’s last twelve months’ net income, next year’s net income and tangible book equity to calculate ASB’s fair value using the market approach. Industry sale transactions for 2019 and 2020 were reviewed and the mean market capitalization to earnings and tangible book value from the financial institutions in the sales transactions were used to calculate the fair value under this approach. The income approach uses a discounted cash flow method to value a company on a going concern basis and is based on the concept that the future benefits derived from a particular company can be measured by its sustainable after-tax cash flows in the future. ASB used its forecasted net income and estimated cost savings if the bank were acquired and applied a discount rate to calculate its discounted cash flows. A capitalization of earnings method was used to calculate a terminal value for the discounted cash flow method. The income approach was weighted 75%, the publicly traded company valuation method was weighted 20% and the sale transaction valuation method was weighted 5%. More weight was given to the income approach as this approach uses
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
the projected performance of ASB in the stressed environment and would be more indicative of the current fair value of the Bank. For the three years ended December 31, 2020, there has been no impairment of goodwill.
Mortgage banking. Mortgage loans held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value on an aggregate basis. Premiums, discounts and net deferred loan fees are not amortized while a loan is classified as held-for-sale. A sale is recognized only when the consideration received is other than beneficial interests in the assets sold and control over the assets is transferred irrevocably to the buyer. Gains or losses on sales of loans are recognized at the time of sale and are determined by the difference between the net sales proceeds and the allocated basis of the loans sold. ASB is obligated to subsequently repurchase a loan if the purchaser discovers a standard representation or warranty violation such as noncompliance with eligibility requirements, customer fraud or servicing violations. This primarily occurs during a loan file review. ASB considers and records a reserve for loan repurchases if appropriate.
ASB recognizes a mortgage servicing asset when a mortgage loan is sold with servicing rights retained. This mortgage servicing right (MSR) is initially capitalized at its presumed fair value based on market data at the time of sale and accounted for in subsequent periods at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. Mortgage servicing assets or liabilities are included as a component of gain on sale of loans. Under ASC Topic 860, “Transfers and Servicing,” ASB amortizes the MSRs in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income and assess for impairment at each reporting date.
ASB’s MSRs are stratified based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans including loan type such as fixed-rate 15- and 30-year mortgages and note rate in bands primarily of 50 to 100 basis points. For each stratum, fair value is calculated by discounting expected net income streams using discount rates that reflect industry pricing for similar assets. Expected net income streams are estimated based on industry assumptions regarding prepayment expectations and income and expenses associated with servicing residential mortgage loans for others.
ASB uses a present value cash flow model using techniques described above to estimate the fair value of MSRs. Because observable market prices with exact terms and conditions may not be readily available, ASB compares the fair value of MSRs to an estimated value calculated by an independent third-party on a semi-annual basis. The third-party relies on both published and unpublished sources of market related assumptions and its own experience and expertise to arrive at a value. ASB uses the third-party value only to assess the reasonableness of fair value generated by the valuation model.
Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for each stratum when the carrying amount exceeds fair value, with any associated provision recorded as a component of loan servicing fees included in “Revenues - bank” in the consolidated statements of income. A direct write-down is recorded when the recoverability of the valuation allowance is deemed to be unrecoverable.
Loan servicing fee income represents income earned for servicing mortgage loans owned by investors. It includes mortgage servicing fees and other ancillary servicing income, net of guaranty fees. Servicing fees are generally calculated on the outstanding principal balances of the loans serviced and are recorded as income when earned.
Tax credit investments. ASB invests in limited liability entities formed to operate qualifying affordable housing projects.
The affordable housing investments provide tax benefits to investors in the form of tax deductions from operating losses and tax credits. As a limited partner, ASB has no significant influence over the operations. These investments are initially recorded at the initial capital contribution with a liability recognized for the commitment to contribute additional capital over the term of the investment.
ASB uses the proportional amortization method of accounting for its investments. Under the proportional amortization method, ASB amortizes the cost of its investments in proportion to the tax credits and other tax benefits it receives. The amortization, tax credits and tax benefits are reported as a component of income tax expense.
For these limited liability entities, ASB assesses whether it is the primary beneficiary of the limited liability entity, which is a variable interest entity (VIE). The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE; and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. Generally, ASB, as a limited partner, is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary as it does not meet the power criterion, i.e., no power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and no direct ability to unilaterally remove the general partner.
All tax credit investments are evaluated for potential impairment at least annually, or more frequently, when events or conditions indicate that it is deemed probable that ASB will not recover its investment. If an investment is determined to be
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
impaired, it is written down to its estimated fair value and the new cost basis of the investment is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in value. As of December 31, 2020, ASB did not have any impairment losses resulting from forfeiture or ineligibility of tax credits or other circumstances related to its low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying amount of LIHTC investments was $83.4 million and $66.3 million, respectively, and included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
ASB’s unfunded commitments to fund its LIHTC investment partnerships were $41.0 million and $23.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These unfunded commitments are unconditional and legally binding and are recorded in other liabilities with a corresponding increase in other assets.
The table below summarizes the amounts in income tax expense related to ASB’s LIHTC investments:

Note 2 · Segment financial information
The electric utility and bank segments are strategic business units of the Company that offer different products and services and operate in different regulatory environments. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described for the Company in the summary of significant accounting policies, except as otherwise indicated and except that federal and state income taxes for each segment are calculated on a “stand-alone” basis. HEI evaluates segment performance based on net income. Each segment accounts for intersegment sales and transfers as if the sales and transfers were to third parties (i.e., at current market prices). Intersegment revenues consist primarily of Hamakua Energy revenues, interest, rent and preferred stock dividends.
Electric utility
Hawaiian Electric and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, are public electric utilities in the business of generating, purchasing, transmitting, distributing and selling electric energy on all major islands in Hawaii other than Kauai, and are regulated by the PUC. The utility subsidiaries are aggregated within the electric utility segment because they: (1) are involved in the business of supplying electric energy in the same geographical location (i.e., the State of Hawaii), (2) have similar production processes that comprise electric generation, (3) serve similar customers within their franchise territories (e.g., residential, commercial and industrial customers), (4) use similar electric grids to distribute the energy to their customers, (5) are regulated by the PUC and undergo similar rate-making processes, (6) have similar economic characteristics and (7) perform financial reporting oversight and management of the business at the consolidated level.

ASB is a federally chartered savings bank that provides a full range of banking services to individual and business customers through its branch system in Hawaii. ASB is subject to examination and comprehensive regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and is subject to reserve requirements established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
Other
“Other” includes amounts for the holding companies (HEI and ASB Hawaii), Pacific Current, and other subsidiaries not qualifying as reportable segments, and intercompany eliminations.
Pacific Current. Pacific Current was formed in September 2017 to focus on investing in non-regulated renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure in the State of Hawaii to help achieve the state’s sustainability goals. Significant investments of Pacific Current made through its subsidiaries, Hamakua Energy, LLC and Mauo, include:
Hamakua power plant. On November 24, 2017, Hamakua Energy, LLC acquired Hamakua Energy Partners, L.P.’s 60-MW combined cycle power plant and other assets from affiliates of ArcLight Capital Partners, a private equity firm. The plant sells all the power it produces to Hawaii Electric Light under an existing power purchase agreement (PPA) that expires in 2030.
Solar-plus-storage power purchase agreement. On February 2, 2018, Mauo executed definitive agreements to acquire a solar-plus-storage PPA for a multi-site, commercial-scale project that will provide 8.6 MW of solar capacity and 42.3 megawatthour (MWh) of storage capacity on the islands of Maui and Oahu. The PPA has a 15-year term with a customer option to extend for an additional five years. The system is being constructed by a third party contractor under an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contract that was contemporaneously negotiated and executed by Mauo. The EPC contract provides a fixed price for the purchase of the completed system, a project completion schedule and performance obligations designed to match the requirements of the solar-plus-storage PPA. Mauo is funding the construction of the project with a construction facility that will be repaid at the commercial operation date (ultimately with cash from investment tax credits, state renewable tax credits, non-recourse project debt, and equity).
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Segment financial information was as follows:
1 Contributions in aid of construction balances are included in capital expenditures.
Intercompany electricity sales of the Utilities to ASB and “other” segments are not eliminated because those segments would need to purchase electricity from another source if it were not provided by the Utilities and the profit on such sales is nominal.
Bank fees that ASB charges the Utilities and “other” segments are not eliminated because those segments would pay fees to another financial institution if they were to bank with another institution and the profit on such fees is nominal.
Hamakua Energy, LLC’s (Hamakua Energy’s) sales to Hawaii Electric Light (a regulated affiliate) are eliminated in consolidation.

Note 3 · Electric utility segment
Regulatory assets and liabilities. Regulatory assets represent deferred costs and accrued decoupling revenues which are expected to be recovered through rates over PUC-authorized periods. Generally, the Utilities do not earn a return on their regulatory assets; however, they have been allowed to recover interest on certain regulatory assets and to include certain regulatory assets in rate base. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts included in rates and collected from ratepayers for costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred that are refundable to customers. For example, the regulatory liability for cost of removal in excess of salvage value represents amounts that have been collected from ratepayers for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future to retire utility plant. Generally, the Utilities include regulatory liabilities in rate base or are required to apply interest to certain regulatory liabilities. In the table below, noted in parentheses are the original PUC authorized amortization or recovery periods and, if different, the remaining amortization or recovery periods as of December 31, 2020 are noted.
Regulatory assets were as follows:
Regulatory liabilities were as follows:
The regulatory asset and liability relating to retirement benefit plans was recorded as a result of pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms adopted by the PUC in rate case decisions for the Utilities in 2007 (see Note 10).
Major customers. The Utilities received 11% ($249 million), 11% ($281 million) and 11% ($273 million) of their operating revenues from the sale of electricity to various federal government agencies in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Cumulative preferred stock. The following series of cumulative preferred stock are redeemable only at the option of the respective company at the following prices in the event of voluntary liquidation or redemption:
Hawaiian Electric is obligated to make dividend, redemption and liquidation payments on the preferred stock of each of its subsidiaries if the respective subsidiary is unable to make such payments, but this obligation is subordinated to Hawaiian Electric’s obligation to make payments on its own preferred stock.
Related-party transactions. HEI charged the Utilities $5.6 million, $6.0 million and $5.9 million for general management and administrative services in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amounts charged by HEI to its subsidiaries for services provided by HEI employees are allocated primarily on the basis of time expended in providing such services.
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, Hamakua Energy, LLC (an indirect subsidiary of HEI) sold energy and capacity to Hawaii Electric Light (subsidiary of Hawaiian Electric and indirect subsidiary of HEI) under a PPA in the amount of $50 million and $68 million, respectively.
Hawaiian Electric’s short-term borrowings from HEI totaled nil at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Borrowings among the Utilities are eliminated in consolidation. Interest charged by HEI to Hawaiian Electric was not material for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Unconsolidated variable interest entities.
Power purchase agreements. As of December 31, 2020, the Utilities had four PPAs for firm capacity (excluding the Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) PPA as PGV had been offline since May 2018 due to lava flow on Hawaii Island, but returned to service at a level providing limited output without firm capacity in the fourth quarter of 2020) and other PPAs with independent power producers (IPPs) and Schedule Q providers (i.e., customers with cogeneration and/or power production facilities who buy power from or sell power to the Utilities), none of which are currently required to be consolidated as VIEs.
Pursuant to the current accounting standards for VIEs, the Utilities are deemed to have a variable interest in Kalaeloa Partners, L.P. (Kalaeloa), AES Hawaii, Inc. (AES Hawaii) and Hamakua Energy by reason of the provisions of the PPA that the Utilities have with the three IPPs. However, management has concluded that the Utilities are not the primary beneficiary of Kalaeloa, AES Hawaii and Hamakua Energy because the Utilities do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the three IPPs’ economic performance nor the obligation to absorb their expected losses, if any, that could potentially be significant to the IPPs. Thus, the Utilities have not consolidated Kalaeloa, AES Hawaii and Hamakua Energy in its consolidated financial statements. Hamakua Energy is an indirect subsidiary of Pacific Current, and is consolidated in HEI’s consolidated financial statements.
For the other PPAs with IPPs, the Utilities have concluded that the consolidation of the IPPs was not required because either the Utilities do not have variable interests in the IPPs due to the absence of an obligation in the PPAs for the Utilities to absorb any variability of the IPPs, or the IPP was considered a “governmental organization,” and thus excluded from the scope of accounting standards for VIEs. Two IPPs of as-available energy declined to provide the information necessary for Utilities to determine the applicability of accounting standards for VIEs.
If information is ultimately received from the IPPs, a possible outcome of future analyses of such information is the consolidation of one or both of such IPPs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The consolidation of any significant IPP could have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the recognition of a significant amount of assets and liabilities and, if such a consolidated IPP were operating at a loss and had insufficient equity, the potential recognition of such losses. If the Utilities determine they are required to consolidate the financial statements of such an IPP and the consolidation has a material effect, the Utilities would retrospectively apply accounting standards for VIEs to the IPP.
Commitments and contingencies.
Contingencies. The Utilities are subject in the normal course of business to pending and threatened legal proceedings. Management does not anticipate that the aggregate ultimate liability arising out of these pending or threatened legal proceedings
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
will be material to its financial position. However, the Utilities cannot rule out the possibility that such outcomes could have a material effect on the results of operations or liquidity for a particular reporting period in the future.
Power purchase agreements. Purchases from all IPPs were as follows:
1 Includes hydro power and other PPAs
As of December 31, 2020, the Utilities had four firm capacity PPAs for a total of 516.5 megawatts (MW) of firm capacity and excludes the PGV facility. The PGV facility with 34.6 MW of firm capacity had been offline since May 2018 due to lava flow on Hawaii Island, but returned to service at a level providing limited output without firm capacity in the fourth quarter of 2020. The PUC allows rate recovery for energy and firm capacity payments to IPPs under these agreements. Assuming that each of the agreements remains in place for its current term (and as amended) and the minimum availability criteria in the PPAs are met, aggregate minimum fixed capacity charges, excluding the PGV facility, are expected to be approximately $93 million in 2021, $72 million in 2022, $30 million each in 2023, 2024 and 2025, and $188 million from 2026 through 2033.
In general, the Utilities base their payments under the PPAs upon available capacity and actual energy supplied and they are generally not required to make payments for capacity if the contracted capacity is not available, and payments are reduced, under certain conditions, if available capacity drops below contracted levels. In general, the payment rates for capacity have been predetermined for the terms of the agreements. Energy payments will vary over the terms of the agreements. The Utilities pass on changes in the fuel component of the energy charges to customers through the energy cost adjustment clause (ECRC) in their rate schedules. The Utilities do not operate, or participate in the operation of, any of the facilities that provide power under the agreements. Title to the facilities does not pass to Hawaiian Electric or its subsidiaries upon expiration of the agreements, and the agreements do not contain bargain purchase options for the facilities.
Purchase power adjustment clause. The PUC has approved purchased power adjustment clauses (PPACs) for the Utilities. Purchased power capacity, operation and maintenance (O&M) and other non-energy costs previously recovered through base rates are now recovered in the PPACs and, subject to approval by the PUC, such costs resulting from new purchased power agreements can be added to the PPACs outside of a rate case. Purchased energy costs continue to be recovered through the ECRC.
Kalaeloa Partners, L.P. Under a 1988 PPA, as amended, Hawaiian Electric is committed to purchase 208 MW of firm capacity from Kalaeloa. Hawaiian Electric and Kalaeloa continue negotiations to address the PPA term that ended on May 23, 2016. The PPA automatically extends on a month-to-month basis as long as the parties are still negotiating in good faith. Hawaiian Electric and Kalaeloa have agreed that neither party will terminate the PPA (which has been subject to automatic extension on a month-to-month basis) prior to April 30, 2021, to allow for a negotiated resolution.
AES Hawaii, Inc. Under a PPA entered into in March 1988, as amended (through Amendment No. 2) for a period of 30 years ending September 2022, Hawaiian Electric agreed to purchase 180 MW of firm capacity from AES Hawaii. Hawaiian Electric and AES Hawaii have been in dispute over an additional 9 MW of capacity. In February 2018, Hawaiian Electric reached agreement with AES Hawaii on an amendment to the PPA. However, in June 2018, the PUC issued an order suspending review of the amendment pending a State of Hawaii Department of Health (DOH) decision on AES Hawaii’s request for approval of its Emission Reduction Plan and partnership with Hawaiian Electric. If approved by the PUC, the amendment will resolve AES Hawaii’s claims related to the additional capacity.
Hu Honua Bioenergy, LLC (Hu Honua). In May 2012, Hawaii Electric Light signed a PPA, which the PUC approved in December 2013, with Hu Honua for 21.5 MW of renewable, dispatchable firm capacity fueled by locally grown biomass from a facility on the island of Hawaii. Under the terms of the PPA, the Hu Honua plant was scheduled to be in service in 2016. However, Hu Honua encountered construction and litigation delays, which resulted in an amended and restated PPA between Hawaii Electric Light and Hu Honua dated May 9, 2017. In July 2017, the PUC approved the amended and restated PPA, which
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
becomes effective once the PUC’s order is final and non-appealable. In August 2017, the PUC’s approval was appealed by a third party. On May 10, 2019, the Hawaii Supreme Court issued a decision remanding the matter to the PUC for further proceedings consistent with the court’s decision which must include express consideration of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would result from approving the PPA, whether the cost of energy under the PPA is reasonable in light of the potential for GHG emissions, and whether the terms of the PPA are prudent and in the public interest, in light of its potential hidden and long-term consequences. On June 20, 2019, the PUC issued an order reopening the docket for further proceedings, including re-examining all of the issues in the proceedings. On September 29, 2019, the PUC issued an order setting the procedural schedule for the matter and on December 20, 2019, issued an order modifying the procedural schedule. Pre-hearing matters were completed on March 6, 2020. On July 9, 2020, the PUC issued an order denying Hawaii Electric Light’s request to waive the amended and restated PPA from the PUC’s competitive bidding requirements and therefore, dismissed the request for approval of the amended and restated PPA without prejudice to possible participation in any future competitive bidding process. On July 20, 2020, Hu Honua filed a motion for reconsideration of the PUC’s order which was denied by the PUC on September 9, 2020. On September 16, 2020, Hu Honua filed its notice of appeal to the Hawaii Supreme Court of the PUC’s order denying Hu Honua’s motion for reconsideration.
Molokai New Energy Partners (MNEP). In July 2018, the PUC approved Maui Electric’s PPA with MNEP to purchase solar energy from a PV plus battery storage project. The 4.88 MW photovoltaic (PV) and 3 MW Battery Energy Storage System project was to deliver no more than 2.64 MW at any time to the Molokai system. On March 25, 2020, MNEP filed a complaint in the United Stated District Court for the District of Hawaii against Maui Electric claiming breach of contract. On June 3, 2020, Maui Electric provided Notice of Default and Termination of the PPA to MNEP terminating the PPA with an effective date of July 10, 2020. Thereafter, MNEP filed an amended Complaint to include claims relating to the termination and Hawaiian Electric filed its Answer to the Amended Complaint on September 11, 2020, disputing the facts presented by MNEP and all claims within the original and amended complaint.
Utility projects. Many public utility projects require PUC approval and various permits from other governmental agencies. Difficulties in obtaining, or the inability to obtain, the necessary approvals or permits or community support can result in significantly increased project costs or even cancellation of projects. In the event a project does not proceed, or if it becomes probable the PUC will disallow cost recovery for all or part of a project, or if PUC-imposed caps on project costs are expected to be exceeded, project costs may need to be written off in amounts that could result in significant reductions in Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated net income.
Enterprise Resource Planning/Enterprise Asset Management (ERP/EAM) implementation project. On August 11, 2016, the PUC approved the Utilities’ request to commence the ERP/EAM implementation project, subject to certain conditions, including a $77.6 million cap on cost recovery as well as a requirement that the Utilities achieve future cost savings consistent with a minimum of $246 million in ERP/EAM project-related benefits to be delivered to customers over the system’s 12-year service life. The decision and order (D&O) approved the deferral of certain project costs and allowed the accrual of AFUDC, but limited the AFUDC rate to 1.75%.
The ERP/EAM Implementation Project went live in October 2018. Hawaii Electric Light and Hawaiian Electric began to incorporate their portion of the deferred project costs in rate base and started the amortization over a 12-year period in January 2020 and November 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the total deferred project costs and accrued carrying costs after the project went into service amounted to $58.8 million, which is net of the amortization of $1.3 million at Hawaiian Electric and Hawaii Electric Light.
In February 2019, the PUC approved a methodology for passing the future cost saving benefits of the new ERP/EAM system to customers developed by the Utilities in collaboration with the Consumer Advocate. The Utilities filed a benefits clarification document on June 10, 2019, reflecting $150 million in future net O&M expense reductions and cost avoidance, and $96 million in capital cost reductions and tax savings over the 12-year service life. To the extent the reduction in O&M expense relates to amounts reflected in electric rates, the Utilities would reduce future rates for such amounts. In October 2019, the PUC approved the Utilities and the Consumer Advocate’s Stipulated Performance Metrics and Tracking Mechanism. As of December 31, 2020, the Utilities’ regulatory liability was $10.8 million ($6.9 million for Hawaiian Electric, $1.6 million for Hawaii Electric Light and $2.3 million for Maui Electric) for the O&M expense savings included in rates. As part of the settlement agreement approved in the Hawaiian Electric 2020 test year rate case, the regulatory liability for Hawaiian Electric will be amortized over five years, beginning in November 2020, and the O&M benefits for Hawaiian Electric will be considered flowed through to customers. As part of the PBR proceeding, the regulatory liability as of December 31, 2020 for Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric will be flowed to customers as part of the customer dividend in the ARA in 2021.
At the PUC’s direction, the Utilities have been filing Semi-Annual Enterprise System Benefits (SAESB) reports. The most recent SAESB report was filed on August 31, 2020 for the period January 1 through June 30, 2020.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
West Loch PV Project. In November 2019, Hawaiian Electric placed into service a 20-MW (ac) utility-owned and operated renewable and dispatchable solar facility on property owned by the Department of the Navy. PUC orders resulted in a project cost cap of $67 million (including a cap of $4.7 million for the in-kind work to be performed in exchange for use of the Navy property) with capital cost recovery approved under MPIR (See “Performance-based regulation framework” section below for MPIR guidelines and cost recovery discussion.) Project costs incurred as of December 31, 2020 amounted to $53.3 million and generated $14.7 million and $14.0 million in federal and state nonrefundable tax credits, respectively. For book and regulatory purposes, the tax credits are being deferred and amortized, starting in 2020, over 25 years and 10 years for federal and state credits, respectively.
As part of the approval of the project, a performance guarantee mechanism was established, which calls for the Utilities to provide energy at target annual energy production levels. Production shortfalls are compensated to customers by the amount of shortfall multiplied by the Equivalent Levelized Energy Price (ELEP) based on the revenue requirements of the actual total cost of the project, but not to exceed 9.56 cents/kilowatthours (kWh). Compensations for shortfall are provided to customers as a credit through the PPAC, while production surpluses are refunded to the Utilities up to amount of previously issued underproduction credits. In December 2020, the Utilities accrued $0.6 million in estimated underproduction credits to be returned to customers in 2021 due to not meeting the 2020 annual production target of 46,850 MWh. The 2020 underproduction credit is based on an interim ELEP representing total project costs at December 31, 2020. The credit will be trued up based on a final ELEP based on final project costs.
Environmental regulation. The Utilities are subject to environmental laws and regulations that regulate the operation of existing facilities, the construction and operation of new facilities and the proper cleanup and disposal of hazardous waste and toxic substances.
Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, like other utilities, periodically encounter petroleum or other chemical releases associated with current or previous operations. The Utilities report and take action on these releases when and as required by applicable law and regulations. The Utilities believe the costs of responding to such releases identified to date will not have a material effect, individually or in the aggregate, on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
Former Molokai Electric Company generation site. In 1989, Maui Electric acquired Molokai Electric Company. Molokai Electric Company had sold its former generation site (Site) in 1983 but continued to operate at the Site under a lease until 1985. The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has since identified environmental impacts in the subsurface soil at the Site. In cooperation with the DOH and EPA, Maui Electric further investigated the Site and the Adjacent Parcel to determine the extent of impacts of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), residual fuel oils and other subsurface contaminants. Maui Electric has a reserve balance of $2.7 million as of December 31, 2020, representing the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted cost for remediation of the Site and the Adjacent Parcel; however, final costs of remediation will depend on the cleanup approach implemented.
Pearl Harbor sediment study. In July 2014, the U.S. Navy notified Hawaiian Electric of the Navy’s determination that Hawaiian Electric is a Potentially Responsible Party responsible for the costs of investigation and cleanup of PCBs contamination in sediment in the area offshore of the Waiau Power Plant as part of the Pearl Harbor Superfund Site. Hawaiian Electric was also required by the EPA to assess potential sources and extent of PCB contamination onshore at Waiau Power Plant.
As of December 31, 2020, the reserve account balance recorded by Hawaiian Electric to address the PCB contamination was $10 million. The reserve balance represents the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted cost for the onshore and offshore investigation and remediation. The final remediation costs will depend on the actual onshore and offshore cleanup costs.
Asset retirement obligations. Asset retirement obligations (AROs) represent legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain tangible long-lived assets, are measured as the present value of the projected costs for the future retirement of specific assets and are recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The Utilities’ recognition of AROs have no impact on their earnings. The cost of the AROs is recovered over the life of the asset through depreciation. AROs recognized by the Utilities relate to legal obligations associated with the retirement of plant and equipment, including removal of asbestos and other hazardous materials.
The Utilities recorded AROs related to: 1) the removal of retired generating units, certain types of transformers and underground storage tanks; 2) the abandonment of fuel pipelines, underground injection and supply wells; and 3) the removal of equipment and restoration of leased land used in connection with Utility-owned renewable and dispatchable generation facilities.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Changes to the ARO liability included in “Other liabilities” on Hawaiian Electric’s balance sheet were as follows:
The Utilities have not recorded AROs for assets that are expected to operate indefinitely or where the Utilities cannot estimate a settlement date (or range of potential settlement dates). As such, ARO liabilities are not recorded for certain asset retirement activities, including various Utilities-owned generating facilities and certain electric transmission, distribution and telecommunications assets resulting from easements over property not owned by the Utilities.
Regulatory proceedings.
Current Decoupling. Decoupling is a regulatory model that is intended to provide the Utilities with financial stability and facilitate meeting the State of Hawaii’s goals to transition to a clean energy economy and achieve an aggressive renewable portfolio standard. The current decoupling mechanism has the following major components: (1) monthly revenue balancing account (RBA) revenues or refunds for the difference between PUC-approved target revenues and recorded adjusted revenues, which delinks revenues from kWh sales, (2) rate adjustment mechanism (RAM) revenues for escalation in certain O&M expenses and rate base changes, (3) MPIR component, (4) performance incentive mechanisms (PIMs), and (5) an earnings sharing mechanism, which would provide for a reduction of revenues between rate cases in the event the utility exceeds the return on average common equity (ROACE) allowed in its most recent rate case.
Performance-based regulation framework. On December 23, 2020, the PUC issued a D&O (PBR D&O) approving a new performance-based regulation framework (PBR Framework). Under the PBR Framework, the Utilities’ current decoupling will continue to be used with modifications, as described below. The existing cost recovery mechanisms will continue as currently implemented (e.g., the Energy Cost Recovery Clause (ECRC), Purchased Power Adjustment Clause (PPAC), Demand Side Management surcharge (DSM), Renewable Energy Infrastructure Program (REIP), Demand Response Adjustment Clause (DRAC), pension and Other Post-Employment Benefits (OPEB) tracking mechanisms). In addition to annual revenues provided by the annual revenue adjustment (ARA), the Utilities may seek relief for extraordinary projects or programs through the Exceptional Project Recovery Mechanism (EPRM) (formerly known as the Major Project Interim Recovery (MPIR) adjustment mechanism) and earn financial rewards for exemplary performance as provided through a portfolio of Performance Incentive Mechanisms (PIMs) and Shared Savings Mechanisms (SSMs). The PBR Framework will incorporate a variety of other performance mechanisms, including Scorecards, Reported Metrics, and an expedited Pilot Process. The PBR Framework also contains a number of safeguards, including a symmetric Earnings Sharing Mechanism (ESM) which protects the Utilities and customers from excessive earnings or losses, as measured by the Utilities’ Return on Equity (ROE) and a Re-Opener mechanism, under which the PUC will open an examination, at its discretion, to determine if adjustments or modifications to specific PBR mechanisms are appropriate.
Rate adjustment mechanism. The existing RAM is based on the lesser of: a) an inflationary adjustment for certain O&M expenses and return on investment for certain rate base changes, or b) cumulative annual compounded increase in Gross Domestic Product Price Index applied to annualized target revenues (the RAM Cap). Annualized target revenues may be reset upon the issuance of an interim or final decision and order (D&O) in a rate case. All Utilities were limited to the RAM Cap in 2020.
Under the new PBR Framework, the ARA mechanism will replace the RAM, effective on June 1, 2021. The current effective target revenues, which includes the existing RAM, will continue to be in effect for the period from June 1, 2020, through May 31, 2021.
Annual revenue adjustment mechanism. The PBR Framework established a five-year multi-year rate period during which there will be no general rate cases. Target revenues will be adjusted according to an index-driven annual revenue adjustment (ARA) based on (i) an inflation factor, (ii) a predetermined X-factor to encompass productivity, which is set at zero, (iii) a Z-factor to account for exceptional circumstances not in the Utilities’ control and (iv) a customer dividend consisting of a negative adjustment of 0.22% compounded annually and a flow through of the “pre-PBR” savings commitment from the management audit recommendations developed in a prior docket.
As a result of an Order issued by the PUC pursuant to a motion for partial reconsideration the customer dividend for “pre-PBR” savings commitment portion to be delivered to customers will be at a rate of $6.61 million per year from 2021 to 2025,
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
and the remaining Enterprise Resource Planning system benefits savings of $3.9 million, to be delivered to customers in 2021. The implementation of the ARA is scheduled to occur on June 1, 2021.
Earnings sharing mechanism. A symmetrical earnings sharing mechanism (ESM) for actual return on equity outside of a 300 basis points dead band above and below a target ROE of 9.5%, which is the current authorized ROE for the Utilities. There is a 50/50 sharing between customers and Utilities for the for actual earnings falling within 150 basis points outside of the dead band in either direction, and a 90/10 sharing for any further difference. A Re-opener investigation will be triggered if the Utilities credit rating outlook indicates a potential credit downgrade below investment grade status, or if its earned ROE enters the outer most tier of the ESM.
Major project interim recovery. On April 27, 2017, the PUC issued an order that provided guidelines for interim recovery of revenues to support major projects placed in service between general rate cases.
Projects eligible for recovery through the MPIR adjustment mechanism are major projects (i.e., projects with capital expenditures net of customer contributions in excess of $2.5 million), including, but not restricted to, renewable energy, energy efficiency, utility scale generation, grid modernization and smaller qualifying projects grouped into programs for review. The MPIR adjustment mechanism provides the opportunity to recover revenues for approved costs of eligible projects placed in service between general rate cases wherein cost recovery is limited by a revenue cap and is not provided by other effective recovery mechanisms. The request for PUC approval must include a business case, and all costs that are allowed to be recovered through the MPIR adjustment mechanism must be offset by any related benefits. The guidelines provide for accrual of revenues approved for recovery upon in-service date to be collected from customers through the annual RBA tariff. Capital projects that are not recovered through the MPIR would be included in the RAM and be subject to the RAM Cap, until the next rate case when the Utilities would request recovery in base rates.
The 2019 approved MPIR amounts for Schofield Generating Station of $19.8 million (which accrued effective January 1, 2019), included the 2019 return on project amount (based on the 90% cap on cost recovery of the project through any mechanism other than base rates) in rate base, depreciation and incremental O&M expenses, are collected from June 2020 through May 2021.
The PUC approved the Utilities’ requests for MPIR recovery of the cost of the Grid Modernization Strategy Phase 1 project and West Loch PV project in March and December 2019, respectively. On June 5, 2020, the Utilities submitted 2020 MPIR amounts totaling $23.6 million for the Schofield Generation Station ($19.2 million), West Loch PV project ($3.8 million) and Grid Modernization Strategy Phase 1 project ($0.6 million for all three utilities) for the accrual of revenues effective January 1, 2020, that included the 2020 return on project amount (based on the capped amount) in rate base, depreciation and incremental O&M expenses, for collection from June 2021 through May 2022.
On October 22, 2020, the PUC issued the final D&O in Hawaiian Electric’s 2020 test year rate case approving the parties’ settlement agreement, including the parties’ agreement to remove the 90% cap on cost recovery for the Schofield Generating Station, such that 100% of the allowed project costs will flow through the MPIR mechanism. The 2020 MPIR amounts were revised to reflect the new lower depreciation rates effective January 1, 2020 as approved in the Hawaiian Electric 2020 test year rate case, and for the removal of the 90% cap on cost recovery and revised rate of return effective November 1, 2020.
Exceptional project recovery mechanism. The existing MPIR was renamed EPRM to include deferred and O&M expense projects and to permit the Utilities to include the full amount of approved costs in the EPRM for recovery in the first year the project goes into service, pro-rated for the portion of the year the project is in service. Any pending application for MPIR relief submitted by the Utilities prior to the PBR D&O, will be grandfathered under the MPIR Guidelines.
Performance incentive mechanisms. The PUC has established the following PIMs: (1) Service Quality performance incentives, (2) Phase 1 Request for proposal (RFP) PIM for procurement of low-cost renewable energy, (3) Phase 2 RFP PIMs for generation and generation plus storage project, and Grid Services and standalone storage.
•Service Quality performance incentives (ongoing). Service Quality performance incentives are measured on a calendar-year basis. The PIM tariff requires the performance targets, deadbands and the amount of maximum financial incentives used to determine the PIM financial incentive levels for each of the PIMs to be re-determined upon issuance of an interim or final order in a general rate case for each utility.
•Service Reliability Performance measured by System Average Interruption Duration and Frequency Indexes (penalties only). Target performance is based on each utility’s historical 10-year average performance with a deadband of one standard deviation. The maximum penalty for each performance index is 20 basis points applied to the common equity share of each respective utility’s approved rate base (or maximum penalties of approximately $6.8 million - for both indices in total for the three utilities).
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
•Call Center Performance measured by the percentage of calls answered within 30 seconds. Target performance is based on the annual average performance for each utility for the most recent 8 quarters with a deadband of 3% above and below the target. The maximum penalty or reward is 8 basis points applied to the common equity share of each respective utility’s approved rate base (or maximum penalties or rewards of approximately $1.4 million - in total for the three utilities).
•In December 2019, the Utilities accrued $0.3 million in estimated rewards for call center performance, net of service reliability penalties, for 2019. The net service quality performance rewards related to 2019 will be reflected in the 2020 annual decoupling filing and increased customer rates in the period June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2021.
•In December 2020, the Utilities accrued $0.9 million in estimated rewards for call center performance, net of service reliability penalties, for 2020. The net service quality performance rewards related to 2020 will be reflected in the 2021 annual decoupling filing.
•Phase 1 RFP PIM. Procurement of low-cost variable renewable resources through the request for proposal process in 2018 is measured by comparison of the procurement price to target prices. The incentive is a percentage of the savings determined by comparing procured price to a target of 11.5 cents per kWh for renewable projects with storage capability and 9.5 cents per kWh for energy-only renewable projects. Half of the incentive was earned upon PUC approval of the PPAs and the other half is eligible to be earned in the year following the in-service date of the projects and is dependent on the amount of energy the Utilities receive from the facilities. The total amount of the incentive the Utilities are eligible for is capped at $3.5 million. Based on the seven PPAs approved in 2019, the Utilities recognized $1.7 million in 2019 with the remaining award to be recognized in the year following the in-service date of the projects, which is estimated to occur from 2023-2024.
•Phase 2 RFP PIMs. On October 9, 2019, the PUC issued an order establishing PIMs for the Utilities with regards to the Variable Renewable Dispatchable Generation and Energy Storage RFPs as well as the Delivery of Grid Services via Customer-sited Distributed Energy Resources RFPs that were issued on August 22, 2019 for Oahu, Maui and Hawaii island. The order establishes pricing thresholds, timelines to complete contracting, and other performance criteria for the performance incentive eligibility. The PIMs provide incentives only without penalties. The earliest the Utilities would be eligible for a PIM pursuant to this order is upon PUC approval of executed contracts resulting from the Phase 2 RFPs. The order requires contracts under the Grid Service RFP be filed for approval by May 2020 (subsequently extended to July 9, 2020), and by September 2020 under the Renewable RFPs, with a declining PIM for projects that are not filed by these deadlines. On July 9, 2020, the Utilities filed two Grid Service Purchase Agreements for the Grid Service RFP, which qualify for PIMs, however, details of the incentive metrics will be determined by PUC. On September 15, 2020, the Utilities filed eight power purchase agreements for the Phase 2 RFP. Of those eight, only one project qualified for a potential PIM incentive. The Utilities do not anticipate that any of the remaining projects from the Phase 2 RFP will qualify for PIM. On December 31, 2020, the PUC approved the two Grid Services Purchase Agreements without further clarification regarding the PIM. The Utility has filed a letter to the PUC in January to seek guidance to the next step of defining the details of the incentive metrics.
•The PUC has established the following new PIMs in its PBR D&O. These PIMs are pending development of tariffs.
•Renewable portfolio standard (RPS)-A PIM that provides a financial reward for accelerating the achievement of renewable portfolio standard goals. The Utilities may earn a reward for the amount of system generation above the interpolated statutory RPS goal at $20/MWh in 2021 and 2022, $15/MWh in 2023, and $10/MWh for the remainder of the MRP. Penalties are already prescribed in the RPS as $20/MWh for failing to meet RPS targets in 2030, 2040 and 2045. The evaluation period will commence on January 1, 2021.
•Grid Services Procurement PIM that provides financial rewards for grid services acquired in 2021 and 2022. The Utilities can earn a total maximum reward of $1.5 million over 2021 and 2020. The evaluation period will commence on January 1, 2021.
•Interconnection Approval PIM that provides financial rewards and penalties for interconnection times for distributed energy resources systems <100 kW in size. The Utilities can earn a total annual maximum reward of $3.0 million or a total annual maximum penalty of $0.9 million. The evaluation period will commence on January 1, 2021.
•Low-to-Moderate Income (LMI) Energy Efficiency PIM that provides financial rewards for collaboration between the Utilities and the third-party Public Benefits Fee Administrator to deliver energy savings for low- and moderate-income customers. The rewards for the PIM metrics will be collectively capped at $2.0 million. The PIM will initially have a duration of three years and be subject to an annual review. The evaluation period will commence as of the date of the effective tariff.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
•Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) Utilization PIM that provides financial rewards for acceleration of the number of customers with advanced meters enabled to support time-varying rates and next generation distributed energy resources programs. The Utilities can earn a total annual maximum reward of $2.0 million. The evaluation period will commence as of the date of the effective tariff.
Annual decoupling filings. The net annual incremental amounts to be collected (refunded) from June 1, 2020 through May 31, 2021 are as follows:
Most recent rate proceedings.
Hawaiian Electric 2020 test year rate case. On May 27, 2020, Hawaiian Electric and the Consumer Advocate filed a Stipulated Settlement Letter, documenting a global settlement of all issues in this rate case. The Parties agreed that as a result of this settlement agreement, there will be no increase in electric revenues over the revenues established in the 2017 test year rate case.
On May 13, 2020, the PUC issued its Final Report on the Management Audit, which recommended various operational and organizational changes intended to better manage costs and provide value to customers. The report also recommended a three-year timeframe to ramp up to a sustained $25 million in annual savings by the end of 2022, split between capital (approximately 80%) and O&M (approximately 20%). In its statement of position on the management audit filed on June 17, 2020, Hawaiian Electric committed to deliver these savings to customers over time through a proposal it later submitted in its statement of position in the PBR proceeding.
On October 22, 2020, the PUC issued a final D&O approving the stipulated settlement agreement filed in the proceeding. As a result, there will be no increase in base electric rates established in the 2017 test year rate case. In the final D&O, the PUC approved the capital structure that consists of a 58% total equity ratio, and a ROACE of 9.5% for the 2020 test year. The resulting return on rate base (RORB) is 7.37%. The D&O approved the agreement to implement the overall lower depreciation rates approved in the last depreciation study proceeding, effective January 1, 2020. See “Annual revenue adjustment mechanism” under “Performance-based regulation framework” above, regarding the PUC’s decision on the treatment of Hawaiian Electric’s Management Audit savings commitment. Hawaiian Electric’s proposed RBA provision tariff and ECRC tariff submitted on November 6, 2020 were approved by the PUC on December 11, 2020 and took effect on January 1, 2021.
Hawaii Electric Light 2019 test year rate case. On November 13, 2019, the PUC issued an interim decision maintaining Hawaii Electric Light’s revenues at current effective rates based on an interim revenue requirement of $387 million, average rate base of $534 million, and a 7.52% RORB that incorporates a ROACE of 9.5% and 58.0% total equity ratio, and tariffs became effective January 1, 2020. On July 28, 2020, the PUC issued a final D&O, approving the Stipulated Partial Settlement Letter in part and ordering final rates for the 2019 test year to remain at current effective rates such that there is a zero increase in rates. The PUC determined that an appropriate ROACE for the 2019 test year is 9.5%, approved a capital structure of 58% total equity and approved as fair a 7.52% RORB. In addition, the order, among others, (1) approved a 10-year amortization period for the state investment tax credit; and (2) approved a modification to Hawaii Electric Light’s ECRC to incorporate a 98%/2% risk-sharing split between customers and Hawaii Electric Light with an annual maximum exposure cap of +/- $600,000. The proposed final tariffs and PIM tariffs took effect on November 1, 2020, and the ECRC tariff became effective on January 1, 2021.
Regulatory assets for COVID-19 related costs. On May 4, 2020, the PUC issued an order, authorizing all utilities, including the Utilities, to establish regulatory assets to record costs resulting from the suspension of disconnections of service during the pendency of the Governor’s Emergency Proclamation and until otherwise ordered by the PUC. In future proceedings, the PUC will consider the reasonableness of the costs, the appropriate period of recovery, any amount of carrying costs thereon, and any savings directly attributable to suspension of disconnects, and other related matters. As part of the order, the PUC prohibits the Utilities from charging late payment fees on past due payments. On June 30, 2020, the PUC issued an order approving the Utilities’ request made in April 2020 for deferral treatment of COVID-19 related costs through December 31, 2020. The Utilities requested to extend the deferral period to June 30, 2021, which is pending the PUC’s approval. The Utilities are required to file quarterly reports to update the Utilities’ financial condition, report measures in place to assist their customers during the COVID-19 emergency situation, identify the planned deferred costs and details for the deferred costs, and identify funds received or benefits received that have resulted from the COVID-19 emergency period. The recovery of the regulatory

Bank-owned life insurance is life insurance purchased by ASB on the lives of certain key employees, with ASB as the beneficiary. The insurance is used to fund employee benefits through tax-free income from increases in the cash value of the policies and insurance proceeds paid to ASB upon an insured’s death.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Investment securities. The major components of investment securities were as follows:
* Issued or guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies or sponsored agencies
ASB does not believe that the investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020, represent a credit loss. Total gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to change in market conditions. On a quarterly basis the investment securities are evaluated for changes in financial condition of the issuer. Based upon ASB’s evaluation, all securities held within the investment portfolio continue to be investment grade by one or more agencies. The contractual cash flows of the U.S. Treasury, federal agency obligations and agency mortgage-backed securities are backed by the full faith and credit guaranty of the United States government or an agency of the government. ASB does not intend to sell the securities before the recovery of its amortized cost basis and there have been no adverse changes in the timing of the contractual cash flows for the securities. ASB’s investment securities portfolio did not require an allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020.
U.S. Treasury, federal agency obligations, corporate bonds, and mortgage revenue bonds have contractual terms to maturity. Mortgage-backed securities have contractual terms to maturity, but require periodic payments to reduce principal. In addition, expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay the underlying mortgages.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The contractual maturities of investment securities were as follows:
The proceeds, gross gains and losses from sales of available-for-sale securities were as follows:
Interest income from taxable and non-taxable investment securities were as follows:
ASB pledged securities with a market value of approximately $445 million and $546 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as collateral for public funds and other deposits, mortgage pipeline hedge margin, automated clearinghouse transactions, The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Discount Window and bankruptcy account, and The Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines advance line. In addition, ASB pledged securities with a market value of $92 million and $130 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as collateral for securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
Stock in FHLB. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, ASB’s stock in FHLB was carried at cost ($8.7 million and $8.4 million, respectively) because it can only be redeemed at par and it is a required investment based on measurements of ASB’s capital, assets and borrowing levels.
Quarterly and as conditions warrant, ASB reviews its investment in the stock of the FHLB for impairment. ASB evaluated its investment in FHLB stock for credit losses as of December 31, 2020, consistent with its accounting policy. ASB did not recognize any credit losses for 2020, 2019 and 2018 based on its evaluation of the underlying investment.
Future deterioration in the FHLB’s financial position and/or negative developments in any of the factors considered in ASB’s impairment evaluation may result in future impairment losses.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Loans. The components of loans were summarized as follows:
ASB’s policy is to require private mortgage insurance on all real estate loans when the loan-to-value ratio of the property exceeds 80% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price at origination. For non-owner occupied residential property purchases, the loan-to-value ratio may not exceed 75% of the lower of the appraised value or purchase price at origination.
ASB services real estate loans for investors (principal balance of $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively), which are not included in the accompanying balance sheets data. ASB reports fees earned for servicing such loans as income when the related mortgage loan payments are collected and charges loan servicing cost to expense as incurred.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, ASB had pledged loans with an amortized cost of approximately $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, as collateral to secure advances from the FHLB.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate amount of loans to directors and executive officers of ASB and its affiliates and any related interests (as defined in Federal Reserve Board (FRB) Regulation O) of such individuals, was $13.2 million and $24.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, $10.0 million and $18.0 million of the loan balances, respectively, were to related interests of individuals who are directors of ASB. All such loans were made at ASB’s normal credit terms.
Allowance for credit losses. As discussed in Note 1, ASB must maintain an allowance for credit losses that is adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses associated with its loan portfolio.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The allowance for credit losses (balances and changes) and financing receivables by portfolio segment were as follows:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Allowance for loan commitments. The allowance for loan commitments by portfolio segment were as follows:
Credit quality. ASB performs an internal loan review and grading on an ongoing basis. The review provides management with periodic information as to the quality of the loan portfolio and effectiveness of its lending policies and procedures. The objectives of the loan review and grading procedures are to identify, in a timely manner, existing or emerging credit trends so that appropriate steps can be initiated to manage risk and avoid or minimize future losses. Loans subject to grading include commercial, commercial real estate and commercial construction loans.
Each commercial and commercial real estate loan is assigned an Asset Quality Rating (AQR) reflecting the likelihood of repayment or orderly liquidation of that loan transaction pursuant to regulatory credit classifications: Pass, Special Mention, Substandard, Doubtful, and Loss. The AQR is a function of the probability of default model rating, the loss given default, and possible non-model factors which impact the ultimate collectability of the loan such as character of the business owner/guarantor, interim period performance, litigation, tax liens and major changes in business and economic conditions. Pass exposures generally are well protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the value of the asset or underlying collateral. Special Mention loans have potential weaknesses that, if left uncorrected, could jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. Substandard loans have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and are characterized by the distinct possibility that ASB may sustain some loss. An asset classified Doubtful has the weaknesses of those classified Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. An asset classified Loss is considered uncollectible and has such little value that its continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted.

The credit risk profile by vintage date based on payment activity or internally assigned grade for loans was as follows:
Revolving loans converted to term loans during 2020 in the commercial, home equity line of credit and consumer portfolios were $14.4 million, $11.3 million and $2.8 million, respectively.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The credit risk profile based on payment activity for loans was as follows:
The credit risk profile based on nonaccrual loans were as follows:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The credit risk profile based on loans whose terms have been modified and accruing interest were as follows:
ASB did not recognize interest on nonaccrual loans for 2020 and 2019.
Troubled debt restructurings. A loan modification is deemed to be a TDR when the borrower is determined to be experiencing financial difficulties and ASB grants a concession it would not otherwise consider. When a borrower experiencing financial difficulty fails to make a required payment on a loan or is in imminent default, ASB takes a number of steps to improve the collectability of the loan and maximize the likelihood of full repayment. At times, ASB may modify or restructure a loan to help a distressed borrower improve its financial position to eventually be able to fully repay the loan, provided the borrower has demonstrated both the willingness and the ability to fulfill the modified terms. TDR loans are considered an alternative to foreclosure or liquidation with the goal of minimizing losses to ASB and maximizing recovery.
ASB may consider various types of concessions in granting a TDR including maturity date extensions, extended amortization of principal, temporary deferral of principal payments, and temporary interest rate reductions. ASB rarely grants principal forgiveness in its TDR modifications. Residential loan modifications generally involve interest rate reduction, extending the amortization period, or capitalizing certain delinquent amounts owed not to exceed the original loan balance. Land loans at origination are typically structured as a three-year term, interest-only monthly payment with a balloon payment due at maturity. Land loan TDR modifications typically involve extending the maturity date up to three years and converting the payments from interest-only to principal and interest monthly, at the same or higher interest rate. Commercial loan modifications generally involve extensions of maturity dates, extending the interest only or amortization period, and temporary deferral or reduction of principal payments. ASB generally does not reduce the interest rate on commercial loan TDR modifications. Occasionally, additional collateral and/or guaranties are obtained.
The allowance for credit losses on TDR loans that do not share risk characteristics are individually evaluated based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective original contractual rate or based on the fair value of collateral less cost to sell. The financial impact of the estimated loss is an increase to the allowance associated with the modified loan. When available information confirms that specific loans or portions thereof are uncollectible (confirmed losses), these amounts are charged off against the allowance for credit losses.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Loan modifications that occurred during 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:
1 The period end balances reflect all paydowns and charge-offs since the modification period. TDRs fully paid off, charged-off, or foreclosed upon by period end are not included.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Loans modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default of 90 days or more in 2020, 2019, and 2018 and for which the payment default occurred within one year of the modification, were as follows:
If a loan modified in a TDR subsequently defaults, ASB evaluates the loan for further impairment. Based on its evaluation, adjustments may be made in the allocation of the allowance or partial charge-offs may be taken to further write-down the carrying value of the loan. Commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loan terms have been modified in a TDR totaled nil at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provides that a financial institution may elect to suspend the requirements under GAAP for certain loan modifications that would otherwise be categorized as a TDR and any related impairment for accounting purposes.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Board of Governors of the FRB, the FDIC, the National Credit Union Administration, the OCC, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, in consultation with the state financial regulators (collectively, the “agencies”) issued a joint interagency statement (issued March 22, 2020; revised statement issued April 7, 2020). Some of the provisions applicable to the Company include, but are not limited to accounting for loan modifications, past due reporting and nonaccrual status and charge-offs.
Loan modifications that do not meet the conditions of the CARES Act may still qualify as a modification that does not need to be accounted for as a TDR. The agencies confirmed with the FASB staff that short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs. This includes short-term (e.g., six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or insignificant delays in payment. Financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 as past due because of the deferral. A loan’s payment date is governed by the due date stipulated in the legal agreement. If a financial institution agrees to a payment deferral, these loans would not be considered past due during the period of the deferral. Lastly, during short-term COVID-19 modifications, these loans generally should not be reported as nonaccrual or as classified.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Collateral-dependent loans. A loan is considered collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the loan is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral.
Loans considered collateral-dependent were as follows:
ASB had $3.8 million and $3.5 million of consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that were in the process of foreclosure at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The credit risk profile by internally assigned grade for loans was as follows:

The total carrying amount and the total unpaid principal balance of impaired loans and ASB’s average recorded investment of, and interest income recognized from, impaired loans were as follows:
* Since loan was classified as impaired.
Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). In its mortgage banking business, ASB sells residential mortgage loans to government-sponsored entities and other parties, who may issue securities backed by pools of such loans. ASB retains no beneficial interests in these loans other than the servicing rights of certain loans sold.
ASB received $567.7 million, $277.1 million and $112.2 million of proceeds from the sale of residential mortgages in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, and recognized gains on such sales of $23.7 million, $4.9 million, and $1.5 million in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Repurchased mortgage loans were nil for 2020, 2019 and 2018. The repurchase reserve was $0.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Mortgage servicing fees, a component of other income, net, were $3.4 million, $3.0 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Changes in the carrying value of MSRs were as follows:
1 Reflects impact of loans paid in full.
Changes related to MSRs were as follows:
The estimated aggregate amortization expenses of MSRs for 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 are $2.1 million, $1.7 million, $1.3 million, $1.0 million and $0.8 million, respectively.
ASB capitalizes MSRs acquired upon the sale of mortgage loans with servicing rights retained. On a monthly basis, ASB compares the net carrying value of the MSRs to its fair value to determine if there are any changes to the valuation allowance and/or other-than-temporary impairment for the MSRs.
ASB uses a present value cash flow model to estimate the fair value of MSRs. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for each stratum when the carrying amount exceeds fair value, with any associated provision recorded as a component of loan servicing fees included in “Revenues - bank” in the consolidated statements of income. A direct write-down is recorded when the recoverability of the valuation allowance is deemed to be unrecoverable.
Key assumptions used in estimating the fair value of ASB’s MSRs used in the impairment analysis were as follows:
The sensitivity analysis of fair value of MSRs to hypothetical adverse changes of 25 and 50 basis points in certain key assumptions was as follows:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The effect of a variation in certain assumptions on fair value is calculated without changing any other assumptions. This analysis typically cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of a change in one key assumption to the changes in the fair value of MSRs typically is not linear.
Deposit liabilities. The summarized components of deposit liabilities were as follows:
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, time certificates of $250,000 or more totaled $121.3 million and $302.0 million, respectively.
The approximate scheduled maturities of time certificates outstanding at December 31, 2020 were as follows:
Overdrawn deposit accounts are classified as loans and totaled $1.0 million and $2.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Interest expense on deposit liabilities by type of deposit was as follows:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Other borrowings.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as financing transactions and the obligations to repurchase these securities are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. ASB pledges investment securities as collateral for securities sold under agreements to repurchase. All such agreements are subject to master netting arrangements, which provide for conditional right of set-off in case of default by either party; however, ASB presents securities sold under agreements to repurchase on a gross basis in the balance sheet. The following tables present information about the securities sold under agreements to repurchase, including the related collateral received from or pledged to counterparties:
The securities underlying the agreements to repurchase are book-entry securities and were delivered by appropriate entry into the counterparties’ accounts or into segregated tri-party custodial accounts at the FHLB. The securities underlying the agreements to repurchase continue to be reflected in ASB’s asset accounts. The counterparties or tri-parties may determine that additional collateral is required based on movements in the fair value of the collateral. Typically, a five percent discount is taken from the fair value of the investment securities to determine the value of the collateral pledged for the repurchase agreements.
Information concerning securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which provided for the repurchase of identical securities, was as follows:

Advances from Federal Home Loan Bank. FHLB advances were nil as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. ASB and the FHLB are parties to an Advances, Pledge and Security Agreement (Advances Agreement), which applies to currently outstanding and future advances, and governs the terms and conditions under which ASB borrows and the FHLB makes loans or advances from time to time. Under the Advances Agreement, ASB agrees to abide by the FHLB’s credit policies, and makes certain warranties and representations to the FHLB. Upon the occurrence of and during the continuation of an “Event of Default” (which term includes any event of nonpayment of interest or principal of any advance when due or failure to perform any promise or obligation under the Advances Agreement or other credit arrangements between the parties), the FHLB may, at its option, declare all indebtedness and accrued interest thereon, including any prepayment fees or charges, to be immediately due and payable. Advances from the FHLB are collateralized by loans and stock in the FHLB. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, ASB’s available FHLB borrowing capacity was $2.1 billion, and $2.3 billion, respectively. In February 2020, the FHLB of Des Moines notified its members that certain assets, which included high-quality home equity lines of credit that were priced off a variable index with a fixed rate option, would no longer qualify as collateral for FHLB Advances and effective October 1, 2020, the FHLB of Des Moines no longer accepted the fixed rate portion of any home equity lines of credit as collateral. In addition, effective July 13, 2020, the FHLB of Des Moines lowered their Loan to Value (LTV), a system-wide percentage applied to eligible pledged collateral to determine borrowing capacity, to reflect ongoing risks in the market due to COVID-19. The lower LTV reduced ASB’s collateral value of the existing pledged loans and the borrowing capacity. To increase the borrowing capacity at the FHLB of Des Moines, ASB pledged commercial real estate loans and is evaluating other assets to pledge as collateral to increase its reserve borrowing capacity with the FHLB.
ASB is required to obtain and hold a specific number of shares of capital stock of the FHLB. ASB was in compliance with all Advances Agreement requirements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Common stock equity. ASB is regulated and supervised by the OCC. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on ASB’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, ASB must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of ASB’s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors.
The prompt corrective action provisions impose certain restrictions on institutions that are undercapitalized. The restrictions imposed become increasingly more severe as an institution’s capital category declines from “undercapitalized” to “critically undercapitalized.” The regulators have substantial discretion in the corrective actions that might direct and could include restrictions on dividends and other distributions that ASB may make to ASB Hawaii and the requirement that ASB develop and implement a plan to restore its capital. In 1988, HEI agreed with the OTS predecessor regulatory agency at the time, to contribute additional capital to ASB up to a maximum aggregate amount of approximately $65.1 million (Capital Maintenance Agreement). As of December 31, 2020, as a result of capital contributions in prior years, HEI’s maximum obligation to contribute additional capital under the Capital Maintenance Agreement has been reduced to approximately $28.3 million.
To be categorized as “well capitalized,” ASB must maintain minimum total capital, Tier 1 capital, and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, ASB had adopted the community bank leverage ratio framework and was only required to comply with Tier 1 leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019 ASB was in compliance with the minimum capital requirements under OCC regulations, and was categorized as “well capitalized” under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed the institution’s category under the capital guidelines.
The tables below set forth actual and minimum required capital amounts and ratios:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
In 2020, ASB paid cash dividends of $31.0 million to HEI, compared to cash dividends of $56.0 million in 2019. The FRB and OCC approved the dividends.
Related-party transactions. HEI charged ASB $2.3 million, $2.3 million and $2.2 million for general management and administrative services in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amounts charged by HEI for services performed by HEI employees to its subsidiaries are allocated primarily on the basis of time expended in providing such services. All amounts charged to ASB were settled as a capital contribution by HEI to ASB.
Derivative financial instruments. ASB enters into interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) with borrowers, and forward commitments to sell loans or to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities to investors to hedge against the inherent interest rate and pricing risks associated with selling loans.
ASB enters into IRLCs for residential mortgage loans, which commit ASB to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specific interest rate and within a specified period of time. IRLCs that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale are considered derivative financial instruments under applicable accounting guidance. Outstanding IRLCs expose ASB to the risk that the price of the mortgage loans underlying the commitments may decline due to increases in mortgage interest rates from inception of the rate lock to the funding of the loan. The IRLCs are free-standing derivatives which are carried at fair value with changes recorded in mortgage banking income.
ASB enters into forward commitments to hedge the interest rate risk for rate locked mortgage applications in process and closed mortgage loans held for sale. These commitments are primarily forward sales of to-be-announced mortgage backed securities. Generally, when mortgage loans are closed, the forward commitment is liquidated and replaced with a mandatory delivery forward sale of the mortgage to a secondary market investor. In some cases, a best-efforts forward sale agreement is utilized as the forward commitment. These commitments are free-standing derivatives which are carried at fair value with changes recorded in mortgage banking income.
Changes in the fair value of IRLCs and forward commitments subsequent to inception are based on changes in the fair value of the underlying loan resulting from the fulfillment of the commitment and changes in the probability that the loan will fund within the terms of the commitment, which is affected primarily by changes in interest rates and the passage of time.
The notional amount and fair value of ASB’s derivative financial instruments were as follows:
ASB’s derivative financial instruments, their fair values, and balance sheet location were as follows:
1 Asset derivatives are included in other assets and liability derivatives are included in other liabilities in the balance sheets.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The following table presents ASB’s derivative financial instruments and the amount and location of the net gains or losses recognized in ASB’s statements of income:
Commitments. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitments. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since certain commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. ASB minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by requiring that customers meet certain conditions prior to disbursing funds. The amount of collateral, if any, is based on a credit evaluation of the borrower and may include residential real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and property, plant and equipment.
Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by ASB to guarantee payment and performance of a customer to a third party. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. ASB holds collateral supporting those commitments for which collateral is deemed necessary.
The following is a summary of outstanding off-balance sheet arrangements:
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation assessment. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) raised the minimum reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund to 1.35 percent but required the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio on small institutions (generally insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less) when setting assessments. In September 2018, the reserve ratio reached 1.36 percent and the FDIC awarded the small institutions an assessment credit, which was applied to a portion of the 2019 and 2020 assessments for these banks. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 ASB’s FDIC insurance expenses were $2.3 million, $1.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively.
Note 5 · Short-term borrowings
Commercial paper and bank term loan. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, HEI had $65 million and $97 million of commercial paper outstanding, respectively. On April 20, 2020, HEI closed on a $65 million 364-day term loan (HEI term loan) from a syndicate of two banks. The HEI term loan bears interest at a floating rate at HEI’s option of either (i) a rate equal to an alternate base rate as defined in the agreement or (ii) a rate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate, as defined in the agreement, plus an applicable margin, and matures on April 19, 2021. The proceeds of the HEI term loan were used to pay down the balance on the HEI Facility, which increased the available borrowing capacity on the HEI Facility by $65 million. The HEI term loan contains provisions requiring the maintenance by HEI of certain financial ratios substantially consistent with those in HEI’s existing, amended and restated revolving unsecured credit agreement. The HEI term loan may be prepaid without penalty at any time, but proceeds from any debt capital market transactions over $50 million must first be applied to pay down the HEI term loan. HEI drew $50 million of unsecured senior notes on December 29, 2020 and used the proceeds to pay down the HEI term loan on December 30, 2020. On January 29, 2021, the remaining HEI term loan balance of $15 million was repaid. The weighted-average interest rate of HEI’s outstanding commercial paper, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 0.8% and 2.3%, respectively. The interest rate of HEI’s term loan, as of December 31, 2020, was 1.9%.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Hawaiian Electric had nil and $39 million of commercial paper outstanding, respectively. Additionally, on May 19, 2020, Hawaiian Electric paid off and terminated the $100 million term loan credit agreement dated as of December 23, 2019. In addition, Hawaiian Electric entered into a 364-day, $50 million term loan credit agreement that matures on April 19, 2021. The term loan credit agreement includes substantially the same financial covenant and customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default (the occurrence of which may result in the loan outstanding becoming immediately due and payable) consistent with those in Hawaiian Electric’s existing, amended and restated revolving unsecured credit agreement. The loan may be prepaid without penalty at any time, but must be paid down if Hawaiian Electric receives proceeds from any debt capital market transactions over $75 million. Hawaiian Electric drew the full $50 million on May 19, 2020. On January 15, 2021, Hawaiian Electric paid off the $50 million term loan in conjunction with the terms of the loan credit agreement. The weighted-average interest rate of Hawaiian Electric’s outstanding commercial paper and bank term loan as of December 31, 2020 was 1.9%.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, HEI had three letters of credit outstanding in the aggregate amount of $6 million, on behalf of Hamakua Energy.
Credit agreements. HEI and Hawaiian Electric each entered into a separate agreement with a syndicate of eight financial institutions (the HEI Facility and Hawaiian Electric Facility, respectively, and together, the Credit Facilities), effective July 3, 2017, to amend and restate their respective previously existing revolving unsecured credit agreements. The $150 million HEI Facility and $200 million Hawaiian Electric Facility both will terminate on June 30, 2022. None of the facilities are collateralized. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facilities.
Under the Credit Facilities, draws would generally bear interest, based on each company’s respective current long-term credit ratings, at the “Adjusted LIBO Rate,” as defined in the agreement, plus 1.375% and annual fees on undrawn commitments, excluding swingline borrowings, of 20 basis points. The Credit Facilities contain provisions for pricing adjustments in the event of a long-term ratings change based on the respective Credit Facilities’ ratings-based pricing grid, which includes the ratings by Fitch, Moody’s and S&P. Certain modifications were made to incorporate some updated terms and conditions customary for facilities of this type. The Credit Facilities continue to contain customary conditions that must be met in order to draw on them, including compliance with covenants (such as covenants preventing HEI’s/Hawaiian Electric’s subsidiaries from entering into agreements that restrict the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or to repay borrowings from, HEI/Hawaiian Electric; and a covenant in Hawaiian Electric’s facility restricting Hawaiian Electric’s ability, as well as the ability of any of its subsidiaries, to guarantee additional indebtedness of the subsidiaries if such additional debt would cause the subsidiary’s “Consolidated Subsidiary Funded Debt to Capitalization Ratio” to exceed 65%).
Under the HEI Facility, it is an event of default if HEI fails to maintain an unconsolidated “Capitalization Ratio” (funded debt) of 50% or less or if HEI no longer owns Hawaiian Electric or ASB. Under the Hawaiian Electric Facility, it is an event of default if Hawaiian Electric fails to maintain a “Consolidated Capitalization Ratio” (equity) of at least 35%, or if Hawaiian Electric is no longer owned by HEI.
The Credit Facilities will be maintained to support each company’s respective short-term commercial paper program, but may be drawn on to meet each company’s respective working capital needs and general corporate purposes.
On April 20, 2020, Hawaiian Electric closed on a $75 million 364-day revolving credit agreement (364-day Revolver) with a syndicate of four banks. Under the 364-day Revolver, draws bear interest at a floating rate at Hawaiian Electric’s option of either (i) a rate equal to an alternate base rate as defined in the agreement or (ii) a rate equal to an adjusted London interbank offered rate, as defined in the agreement, plus an applicable margin, requires annual fees for undrawn amounts, and terminates on April 19, 2021. The 364-day Revolver includes substantially the same financial covenant and customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default (the occurrence of which may result in the loan outstanding becoming immediately due and payable) consistent with those in Hawaiian Electric’s existing, amended and restated revolving unsecured credit agreement. As of December 31, 2020, Hawaiian Electric had no amounts outstanding on this revolving credit agreement.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
1 See components of “Total long-term debt” and unamortized debt issuance costs in Hawaiian Electric and subsidiaries’ Consolidated Statements of Capitalization.
2 In December 2020, the loan was amended to extend the final maturity date to March 31, 2023; however, the loan continues to incorporate a paydown of the loan balance to no greater than $7 million or state renewable tax credits not received by January 5, 2022.
As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate principal payments required on the Company’s long-term debt for 2021 through 2025 are $55 million in 2021, $241 million in 2022, $162 million in 2023, $6 million in 2024 and $103 million in 2025. As of December 31, 2020, the aggregate payments of principal required on the Utilities’ long-term debt for 2021 through 2025 are nil in 2021, $52 million in 2022, $100 million in 2023, nil in 2024 and $47 million in 2025.
The HEI term loans and senior notes contain customary representation and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default (the occurrence of which may result in some or all of the notes then outstanding becoming immediately due and payable). The HEI term loans and senior notes also contain provisions requiring the maintenance by HEI of certain financial ratios generally consistent with those in HEI’s existing, amended revolving unsecured credit agreement. Upon a change of control or certain dispositions of assets (as defined in the note purchase agreements of the senior notes), HEI is required to offer to prepay the senior notes.
The Utilities’ senior notes contain customary representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default (the occurrence of which may result in some or all of the notes of each and all of the utilities then outstanding becoming immediately due and payable) and provisions requiring the maintenance by Hawaiian Electric, and each of Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric, of certain financial ratios generally consistent with those in Hawaiian Electric’s existing, amended revolving unsecured credit agreement.
Changes in long-term debt.
HEI. On September 11, 2020, HEI executed a $50 million private placement note purchase agreement (HEI Series 2020A) under which HEI has authorized the issue and sale of $50 million of unsecured senior notes.
On November 17, 2020, HEI executed a $75 million private placement note purchase agreement (HEI Series 2020B and HEI Series 2020C) under which HEI has authorized the issue and sale of $75 million of unsecured senior notes to be drawn in two tranches.
As defined in the note purchase agreements, at its option, HEI can draw the notes on a delayed basis. The following table displays the actual draw date or the required by draw date of the HEI notes.
Proceeds from the HEI Series 2020A were used to pay down $50 million on the HEI term loan. Proceeds from the HEI Series 2020B (1) tranche were used to repay the remaining $15 million balance on the HEI term loan, together with interest
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
accrued to the date of prepayment, with the balance used to repay a portion of HEI’s commercial paper outstanding. Proceeds from the HEI Series 2020B (2) and 2020C tranches will be used for general corporate purposes, including the paydown of commercial paper balances. Interest is paid semiannually on June 15th and December 15th. The HEI note purchase agreements contain certain restrictive financial covenants that are substantially the same as the financial covenants contained in HEI’s senior credit facility, as amended. The HEI notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time at the prepayment price of the principal amount, together with interest accrued to the date of prepayment plus a “Make-Whole Amount,” as defined in the agreements.
Ka‘ie‘ie Waho Company, LLC. On September 28, 2020, Ka‘ie‘ie Waho Company, LLC, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of HEI, entered into a $13 million non-recourse term loan agreement with Bank of Hawaii. The proceeds of the loan were used to acquire a 6-MW solar photovoltaic facility on Kauai, which serves as collateral for the loan. The loan bears interest at a rate equal to LIBOR, as defined in the agreement, plus 2.00%, swapped to a fixed rate of 2.79% with an interest rate swap, matures September 28, 2031, and requires the maintenance of a minimum debt service coverage ratio equal to at least 1.10 to 1.0. The loan requires quarterly principal and monthly interest payments, which total approximately $0.4 million per quarter.
Hawaiian Electric. On May 14, 2020, the Utilities issued, through a private placement pursuant to separate note purchase agreements (NPAs), the following unsecured senior notes bearing taxable interest (May Notes):
The May Notes include substantially the same financial covenants and customary conditions as Hawaiian Electric’s credit agreement. Hawaiian Electric is also a party as guarantor under the NPAs entered into by Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric. All of the proceeds of the May Notes were used by Hawaiian Electric, Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric to finance their capital expenditures and/or to reimburse funds used for the payment of capital expenditures. The May Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time at the prepayment price of the principal amount, together with interest accrued to the date of prepayment plus a “Make-Whole Amount,” as defined in the agreement.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
On October 29, 2020, the Utilities executed, through a private placement pursuant to separate NPAs, unsecured senior notes bearing taxable interest (October Notes) as shown in the table below. The October Notes had a delayed draw feature and the Utilities drew down all the proceeds on January 14, 2021.
The October Notes include substantially the same financial covenants and customary conditions as Hawaiian Electric’s credit agreement. Hawaiian Electric is also a party as guarantor under the NPAs entered into by Hawaii Electric Light and Maui Electric. The Utilities did not obtain any of the proceeds at execution and instead drew down all the proceeds on January 14, 2021. The proceeds were used to finance their capital expenditures and/or to reimburse funds used for the payment of capital expenditures. The October Notes may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time at the prepayment price of the principal amount plus a “Make-Whole Amount.”
Note 7 · Shareholders’ equity
Reserved shares. As of December 31, 2020, HEI had reserved a total of 17.4 million shares of common stock for future issuance under the HEI Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (DRIP), the Hawaiian Electric Industries Retirement Savings Plan (HEIRSP), the HEI 2011 Nonemployee Director Stock Plan, the ASB 401(k) Plan and the 2010 Executive Incentive Plan.
Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Changes in the balances of each component of AOCI were as follows:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Reclassifications out of AOCI were as follows:
The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02 and related amendments on January 1, 2019, and used the effective date as the date of initial application. The Company elected the practical expedient package under which the Company did not reassess its prior conclusions about whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, whether there is a change in lease classification for any expired or existing leases under the new standard, or whether there were initial direct costs for any existing leases that would be treated differently under the new standard. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all of its leases that qualify, and accordingly, does not recognize lease liabilities and ROU assets for all leases that have lease terms that are 12 months or less. The amounts related to short-term leases are not material. The Company elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for its real estate and equipment and fossil fuel and renewable energy PPAs. The Company elected the practical expedient to not assess all existing land easements that were not previously accounted for in accordance with ASC 840.
The Company leases certain real estate and equipment for various terms under long-term operating lease agreements. The agreements expire at various dates through 2054 and provide for renewal options up to 10 years. The periods associated with the renewal options are excluded for the purpose of determining the lease term unless the exercise of the renewable option is reasonably certain. In the normal course of business, it is expected that many of these agreements will be replaced by similar agreements. Certain real estate leases require the Company to pay for operating expenses such as common area maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance, which are recognized as variable lease expense when incurred and are not included in the measurement of the lease liability.
Additionally, the Utilities contract with independent power producers to supply energy under long-term power purchase agreements. Certain PPAs are treated as operating leases under the new standard because the Company elected the practical expedient package under which prior conclusions about lease identification were not reassessed. The fixed capacity payments under the PPAs are included in the lease liability, while the variable lease payments (e.g., payments based on kWh) are excluded from the lease liability. Several as-available PPAs have variable-only payment terms based on production. For PPAs with no minimum lease payments, the Utilities do not recognize any lease liabilities or ROU assets, and the related costs are reported as variable lease costs. In the fourth quarter of 2020, PGV returned to service at a level providing limited output without firm capacity. Until PGV is fully operational, Hawaii Electric Light is not required to make any fixed capacity payments and is only obligated to make variable lease payments. Therefore, as of December 31, 2020, Hawaii Electric Light did not recognize any lease liability or ROU asset for the PGV PPA.
In August 2019, Hawaiian Electric entered into a lease agreement for a total office space of approximately 195,000 square feet in downtown Honolulu to lower costs and bring together office workers currently in separate leased buildings. The lease consists of two different phases with commencement dates of January 2020 and January 2021, respectively, and is an operating
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
lease for a term of 12 years with various options to extend up to 10 years. Annual base rent expense for each phase is approximately $1.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively, and the operating lease liability recorded upon commencement of each phase was $21 million and $19 million, respectively. In addition to the annual base rent payments that are included in the lease liability, there are additional payments for operating expenses, which are recognized as variable lease cost when incurred. These payments are related to operating expenses, such as common area maintenance, various taxes and insurance. Under the terms of the lease, Hawaiian Electric is entitled to receive up to $5.0 million and $4.6 million in reimbursements for various office improvements for each phase, respectively. The amounts are to be included as a reduction to the initial measurement of the ROU asset on each respective commencement date, and will be subsequently adjusted if the actual reimbursements are different from the initial amounts previously recognized. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, total amount of office improvements to be reimbursed by the lessor for each phase was $2.6 million and nil, respectively.
In December 31, 2020, Hawaiian Electric entered into an agreement with an unrelated party to sublease out approximately 64,000 square feet of the downtown Honolulu office space commencing in January 2021. The sublease is an operating lease for six and a half years with an option to extend the term for an additional two years. Estimated base rent revenue is approximately $8.3 million for the entire lease term. In addition to the base rent, Hawaiian Electric will also collect from the sublessee its proportionate share of all operating expenses, utilities, and taxes, which will be recognized as an additional rent revenue.
The Utilities’ lease payments for each operating lease agreement were discounted using its estimated unsecured borrowing rates for the appropriate term, reduced for the estimated impact of collateral, which is a reduction of approximately 25 basis points. ASB’s lease payments for each operating lease agreement were discounted using Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (FHLB) fixed rate advance rates, which are collateralized, for the appropriate term. The FHLB is ASB’s primary wholesale funding source and can provide collateralized borrowing rates for various terms starting at overnight borrowings to 30-year borrowing terms.
Amounts related to the Company’s total lease cost and cash flows arising from lease transactions are as follows:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The following table summarizes the maturity of our operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020:
1The fixed capacity payment related to the existing PPA with PGV, which will expire on December 31, 2027, is not included as a lease liability as of December 31, 2020. While the facility returned to service in the fourth quarter of 2020, it has been operating at a level providing only limited output, which does not provide firm capacity and does not obligate the Utility to make firm capacity payments. The contractual annual capacity payment is approximately $7 million. The lease liability will be remeasured when PGV returns to operating with firm capacity, at which time contractual firm capacity payments are reestablished.
Revenue from contracts with customers. The revenues subject to Topic 606 include the Utilities’ electric energy sales revenue and the ASB’s transaction fees, as further described below.
Electric Utilities.
Electric energy sales. Electric energy sales represent revenues from the generation and transmission of electricity to customers under tariffs approved by the PUC. Transaction pricing for electricity is determined and approved by the PUC for each rate class and includes revenues from the base electric charges, which are composed of (1) the customer, demand, energy, and minimum charges, and (2) the power factor, service voltage, and other adjustments as provided in each rate and rate rider schedule. The Utilities satisfy performance obligations over time, i.e., the Utilities generate and transfer control of the electricity over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Utilities’ performance. Payments from customers are generally due within 30 days from the end of the billing period. As electric bills to customers reflect the amount that corresponds directly with the value of the Utilities’ performance to date, the Utilities have elected to use the right to invoice practical expedient, which entitles them to recognize revenue in the amount they have the right to invoice.
The Utilities’ revenues include amounts for recovery of various Hawaii state revenue taxes. Revenue taxes are generally recorded as an expense in the year the related revenues are recognized. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Utilities’ revenues include recovery of revenue taxes of approximately $202 million, $226 million and $226 million, respectively, which amounts are in “Taxes, other than income taxes” expense. However, the Utilities pay revenue taxes to the taxing authorities based on (1) the prior year’s billed revenues (in the case of public service company taxes and PUC fees) in the current year or (2) the current year’s cash collections from electric sales (in the case of franchise taxes) after year end. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Utilities had recorded $111 million and $132 million, respectively, in “Taxes accrued, including revenue taxes” on the Utilities’ consolidated balance sheet for amounts previously collected from customers or accrued for public service company taxes and PUC fees, net of amounts paid to the taxing authorities. Such amounts will be used to pay public service company taxes and PUC fees owed for the following year.
Bank.
Bank fees. Bank fees are primarily transaction-based and are recognized when the transaction has occurred and the performance obligation satisfied. From time to time, customers will request a fee waiver and ASB may grant reversals of fees. Revenues are not recorded for the estimated amount of fee reversals for each period.
Fees from other financial services - These fees primarily include debit card interchange income and fees, automated teller machine fees, credit card interchange income and fees, check ordering fees, wire fees, safe deposit rental fees, corporate/business fees, merchant income, online banking fees and international banking fees. Amounts paid to third parties for payment
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
network expenses are included in this financial statement caption in ASB’s Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income Data (in Revenues-Bank financial statement caption of HEI’s Consolidated Statements of Income).
Fee income on deposit liabilities - These fees primarily include “not sufficient funds” fees, monthly deposit account service charge fees, commercial account analysis fees and other deposit fees.
Fee income on other financial products - These fees primarily include commission income from the sales of annuity, mutual fund, and life insurance products. ASB also offers a fee-based, managed account product in which income is based on a percentage of assets under management.
Other Segment.
Other sales. Other sales primarily consist of revenues from the generation and sale of renewable energy at fixed contractual prices per kWh to customers under power purchase agreements by Pacific Current subsidiaries. The performance obligation is satisfied over time as renewable energy is generated and control is transferred to the customer that simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided. Payments from customers are generally due within 30 days from the end of the billing period. The bill to customers reflect the amount that corresponds directly with the value of performance to date. Pacific Current has elected to use the right to invoice practical expedient, which entitles it to recognize revenue in the amount they have the right to invoice.
Revenues from other sources. Revenues from other sources not subject to Topic 606 are accounted for as follows:
Electric Utilities.
Regulatory revenues. Regulatory revenues primarily consist of revenues from the decoupling mechanism, cost recovery surcharges and the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts (the Tax Act) adjustments.
Decoupling mechanism - Under the current decoupling mechanism, the Utilities are allowed to recover or obligated to refund the difference between actual revenue and the target revenue as determined by the PUC, collect revenue adjustment mechanism and major project interim recovery revenues, and recover or refund performance incentive mechanism penalties or rewards. These adjustments will be reflected in tariffs in future periods. Under the decoupling tariff approved in 2011, the prior year accrued RBA revenues and the annual RAM amount are billed from June 1 of each year through May 31 of the following year, which is within 24 months following the end of the year in which they are recorded as required by the accounting standard for alternative revenue programs (see “Regulatory proceedings” in Note 3).
Cost recovery surcharges - For the timely recovery of additional costs incurred, and reconciliation of costs and expenses included in tariffed rates, the Utilities recognize revenues under surcharge mechanisms approved by the PUC. These will be reflected in tariffs in future periods (e.g., ECRC and PPAC).
Tax Act adjustments - These represent adjustments to revenues for the amounts included in tariffed revenues that will be returned to customers as a result of the Tax Act.
Since revenue adjustments discussed above resulted from either agreements with the PUC or change in tax law, rather than contracts with customers, they are not subject to the scope of Topic 606. Also, see Notes 1, 3 and 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Utilities have elected to present these revenue adjustments on a gross basis, which results in the amounts being billed to customers presented in revenues from contracts with customers and the amortization of the related regulatory asset/liability as revenues from other sources. Depending on whether the previous deferral balance being amortized was a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, and depending on the size and direction of the current year deferral of surcharges and/or refunds to customers, it could result in negative regulatory revenue during the year.
Utility pole attachment fees. These fees primarily represent revenues from third-party companies for their access to and shared use of Utilities-owned poles through licensing agreements. As the shared portion of the utility pole is functionally dependent on the rest of the structure, no distinct goods appear to exist. Therefore, these fees are not subject to the scope of Topic 606, but recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 610, Other Income.
Bank.
Interest and dividend income. Interest and fees on loans are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 310, Receivables, including the related allowance for credit losses. Interest and dividends on investment securities are recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other bank noninterest income. Other bank noninterest income primarily consists of mortgage banking income and bank-owned life insurance income.
Mortgage banking income - Mortgage banking income consists primarily of realized and unrealized gains on sale of loans accounted for pursuant to ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. Interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sales are considered derivatives and are accounted pursuant to ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.
Bank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) - The recognition of BOLI cash surrender value does not represent a contract with a customer and is accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force Issue 06-05, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance-Determining the Amount that Could be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85-4, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance.
Revenue disaggregation. The following tables disaggregate revenues by major source, timing of revenue recognition, and segment:
There are no material contract assets or liabilities associated with revenues from contracts with customers existing at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Accounts receivable and unbilled revenues related to contracts with customers represent an unconditional right to consideration since all performance obligations have been satisfied. These amounts are disclosed as accounts receivable and unbilled revenues, net on HEI’s consolidated balance sheets and customer accounts receivable, net and accrued unbilled revenues, net on Hawaiian Electric’s consolidated balance sheets.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had no material remaining performance obligations due to the nature of the Company’s contracts with its customers. For the Utilities, performance obligations are fulfilled as electricity is delivered to customers. For ASB, fees are recognized when a transaction is completed.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Defined benefit plans. Substantially all of the employees of HEI and the Utilities participate in the Retirement Plan for Employees of Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc. and Participating Subsidiaries (HEI Pension Plan). Substantially all of the employees of ASB participated in the American Savings Bank Retirement Plan (ASB Pension Plan) until it was frozen on December 31, 2007. The HEI Pension Plan and the ASB Pension Plan (collectively, the Plans) are qualified, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans and include, in the case of the HEI Pension Plan, benefits for utility union employees determined in accordance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreements between the Utilities and the union. The Plans are subject to the provisions of ERISA. In addition, some current and former executives and directors of HEI and its subsidiaries participate in noncontributory, nonqualified plans (collectively, Supplemental Plans). In general, benefits are based on the employees’ or directors’ years of service and compensation.
The continuation of the Plans and the Supplemental Plans and the payment of any contribution thereunder are not assumed as contractual obligations by the participating employers. The Supplemental Plan for directors has been frozen since 1996. The ASB Pension Plan was frozen as of December 31, 2007. The HEI Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and ASB Supplemental Executive Retirement, Disability, and Death Benefit Plan (noncontributory, nonqualified, defined benefit plans) were frozen as of December 31, 2008. No participants have accrued any benefits under these plans after the respective plan’s freeze and the plans will be terminated at the time all remaining benefits have been paid.
Each participating employer reserves the right to terminate its participation in the applicable plans at any time, and HEI and ASB reserve the right to terminate their respective plans at any time. If a participating employer terminates its participation in the Plans, the interest of each affected participant would become 100% vested to the extent funded. Upon the termination of the Plans, assets would be distributed to affected participants in accordance with the applicable allocation provisions of ERISA and any excess assets that exist would be paid to the participating employers. Participants’ benefits in the Plans are covered up to certain limits under insurance provided by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
Postretirement benefits other than pensions. HEI and the Utilities provide eligible employees health and life insurance benefits upon retirement under the Postretirement Welfare Benefits Plan for Employees of Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. and participating employers (Hawaiian Electric Benefits Plan). Eligibility of employees and dependents is based on eligibility to retire at termination, the retirement date and the date of hire. The plan was amended in 2011, changing eligibility for certain bargaining unit employees hired prior to May 1, 2011, based on new minimum age and service requirements effective January 1, 2012, per the collective bargaining agreement, and certain management employees hired prior to May 1, 2011 based on new eligibility minimum age and service requirements effective January 1, 2012. The minimum age and service requirements for management and bargaining unit employees hired May 1, 2011 and thereafter have increased and their dependents are not eligible to receive postretirement benefits. Employees may be eligible to receive benefits from the HEI Pension Plan but may not be eligible for postretirement welfare benefits if the different eligibility requirements are not met.
The executive death benefit plan was frozen on September 10, 2009 for participants at benefit levels as of that date.
The Company’s and Utilities’ cost for OPEB has been adjusted to reflect the plan amendments, which reduced benefits and created prior service credits to be amortized over average future service of affected participants. The amortization of the prior service credit will reduce benefit costs until the various credit bases are fully recognized. Each participating employer reserves the right to terminate its participation in the Hawaiian Electric Benefits Plan at any time.
Balance sheet recognition of the funded status of retirement plans. Employers must recognize on their balance sheets the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans with an offset to AOCI in shareholders’ equity (using the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO), to calculate the funded status).
The PUC allowed the Utilities to adopt pension and OPEB tracking mechanisms in previous rate cases. The amount of the net periodic pension cost (NPPC) and net periodic benefits costs (NPBC) to be recovered in rates is established by the PUC in each rate case. Under the Utilities’ tracking mechanisms, any actual costs determined in accordance with GAAP that are over/under amounts allowed in rates are charged/credited to a regulatory asset/liability. The regulatory asset/liability for each utility will then be amortized over 5 years beginning with the respective utility’s next rate case. Accordingly, all retirement benefit expenses (except for executive life and nonqualified pension plan expenses, which amounted to $1.1 million in 2020 and 2019) determined in accordance with GAAP will be recovered.
Under the tracking mechanisms, amounts that would otherwise be recorded in AOCI (excluding amounts for executive life and nonqualified pension plans), net of taxes, as well as other pension and OPEB charges, are allowed to be reclassified as a regulatory asset, as those costs will be recovered in rates through the NPPC and NPBC in the future. The Utilities have
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
reclassified to a regulatory asset/(liability) charges for retirement benefits that would otherwise be recorded in AOCI (amounting to the elimination of a potential adjustment to AOCI of $53.7 million pretax and $(21.8) million pretax for 2020 and 2019, respectively).
Under the pension tracking mechanism, the Utilities are required to make contributions to the pension trust in the amount of the actuarially calculated NPPC, except when limited by the ERISA minimum contribution requirements or the maximum contributions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. Contributions in excess of the calculated NPPC are recorded in a separate regulatory asset.
The OPEB tracking mechanisms generally require the Utilities to make contributions to the OPEB trust in the amount of the actuarially calculated NPBC, (excluding amounts for executive life), except when limited by material, adverse consequences imposed by federal regulations. Future decisions in rate cases could further impact funding amounts.
Defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans information. The changes in the obligations and assets of the Company’s and Utilities’ retirement benefit plans and the changes in AOCI (gross) for 2020 and 2019 and the funded status of these plans and amounts related to these plans reflected in the Company’s and Utilities’ consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the other postretirement benefit plan shown in the table above had APBOs in excess of plan assets.
Pension benefits. In 2020, investment returns were higher than assumed rates and together with updates to mortality assumptions projected generationally, improved the funded position. Actuarial losses due to demographic experience, including assumption changes, the most significant of which was the decrease in the discount rate used to measure PBO compared to the prior year, partially offset the improvement in funded position.
In 2019, investment returns were higher than assumed rates and together with updates to mortality assumptions projected generationally, improved the funded position. Actuarial losses due to demographic experience, including assumption changes, the most significant of which was the decrease in the discount rate used to measure PBO compared to the prior year, partially offset the improvement in funded position.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Other benefits. In 2020, investment returns were higher than assumed rates and together with updates to the per capita claims cost to reflect 2021 premiums, improved funded position and offset the actuarial losses due to demographic experience, including assumption changes, the most significant of which was the decrease in the discount rate used to measure APBO.
In 2019, investment returns were higher than assumed rates, which improved funded position and predominately offset the actuarial losses due to demographic experience, including assumption changes, the most significant of which was the decrease in the discount rate used to measure APBO. Updates to the per capita claims costs also contributed to a deterioration in the funded position.
The dates used to determine retirement benefit measurements for the defined benefit plans and OPEB were December 31 of 2020, 2019 and 2018.
For purposes of calculating NPPC and NPBC for all plan assets, the Company and the Utilities have determined the market-related value of retirement benefit plan assets, primarily equity securities and fixed income securities, by calculating the difference between the expected return and the actual return on the fair value of the plan assets, then amortizing the difference over future years - 0% in the first year and 25% in each of years two through five - and finally adding or subtracting the unamortized differences for the past four years from fair value. The method includes a 15% range restriction around the fair value of such assets (i.e., 85% to 115% of fair value). Effective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted a change in accounting principle for the plans’ fixed income securities from a calculated market-related value method to the fair value method in the calculation of the expected return on plan assets component of NPPC and NPBC. The remaining plan assets will continue to use the calculated market-related value methodology. The Company considers the fair value approach to be preferable for its fixed-income portfolio because it results in a current reflection of changes in the value of plan assets in a way similar to the obligations it is intended to hedge. The Company evaluated the effect of this change in accounting principle and deemed it to be immaterial to the historical and current financial statements of the Company and Hawaiian Electric and, therefore, does not plan to account for the change retrospectively and will instead record the cumulative effects from the change in accounting principle in earnings for non-Utility businesses in its 2021 financial statements. Amounts related to the Utilities will be reflected as adjustments to regulatory assets as appropriate, consistent with the expected regulatory treatment.
A primary goal of the plans is to achieve long-term asset growth sufficient to pay future benefit obligations at a reasonable level of risk. The investment policy target for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans reflects the philosophy that long-term growth can best be achieved by prudent investments in equity securities while balancing overall fund and pension liability volatility by an appropriate allocation to fixed income securities. In order to reduce the level of portfolio risk and volatility in returns, efforts have been made to diversify the plans’ investments by asset class, geographic region, market capitalization and investment style.
The asset allocation of defined benefit retirement plans to equity and fixed income securities (excluding cash) and related investment policy targets and ranges were as follows:
1 Asset allocation (excluding cash) is applicable to only HEI and the Utilities. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, nearly all of ASB’s pension assets were invested in fixed income securities.
2 Asset allocation (excluding cash) is applicable to only HEI and the Utilities. ASB does not fund its other benefits.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Assets held in various trusts for the retirement benefit plans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and were as follows:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
None of the investments presented in the tables above have unfunded commitments.
(a) Represents investments in funds that primarily invest in non-U.S., emerging markets equities. Redemption frequency for pension benefits assets as of December 31, 2020 were: daily, 62% and monthly, 38%, and as of December 31, 2019 were daily, 60% and monthly, 40%. Redemption frequency for other benefits assets as of December 31, 2020 were: daily, 58% and monthly, 42% and as of December 31, 2019 were: daily, 59% and monthly, 41%.
(b) Represents investments in fixed income securities invested in a US-dollar denominated fund that seeks to exceed the Barclays Capital Long Corporate A or better Index through investments in US-dollar denominated fixed income securities and commingled vehicles.
(c) Represents investments in cash equivalent funds. This class includes funds that invest primarily in securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies or instrumentalities. For pension benefits, the fund may also invest in fixed income securities of investment grade issuers.
The fair values of the investments shown in the table above represent the Company’s best estimates of the amounts that would be received upon sale of those assets in an orderly transaction between market participants at that date. Those fair value measurements maximize the use of observable inputs. However, in situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset at the measurement date, the fair value measurement reflects the Company’s judgments about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset. Those judgments are developed by the Company based on the best information available in the circumstances.
The fair value of investments measured at net asset value presented in the tables above are intended to permit reconciliation to the fair value of plan assets amounts.
The Company used the following valuation methodologies for assets measured at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Equity securities, equity index and exchange-traded funds, U.S. Treasury fixed income securities and public mutual funds (Level 1). Equity securities, equity index and exchange-traded funds, U.S. Treasury fixed income securities and public mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities or funds are traded.
Fixed income securities (Level 2). Fixed income securities, other than those issued by the U.S. Treasury, are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The following weighted-average assumptions were used in the accounting for the plans:
NA Not applicable
1 HEI and the Utilities pension benefits discount rate only at December 31, 2020 and 2019. ASB’s pension benefits discount rate at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 2.76% and 3.49%, respectively. All other disclosed rates apply to the Company and the Utilities.
2 ASB’s pension benefits discount rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.49%. All other disclosed rates apply to the Company and the Utilities.
3 HEI’s and Utilities’ plan assets only. For 2020, 2019 and 2018, ASB’s expected return on plan assets was 3.69%, 4.51% and 3.94%, respectively.
4 The Company and the Utilities use a graded rate of compensation increase assumption based on age. The rate provided above is an average across all future years of service for the current population.
The Company and the Utilities based their selection of an assumed discount rate for 2021 NPPC and NPBC and December 31, 2020 disclosure on a cash flow matching analysis that utilized bond information provided by Bloomberg for all non-callable, high quality bonds (generally rated Aa or better) as of December 31, 2020. In selecting the expected rate of return on plan assets for 2021 NPPC and NPBC: a) HEI and the Utilities considered economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans (primarily equity and fixed income investments), the Plans’ asset allocations, industry and corporate surveys and the past performance of the plans’ assets in selecting 7.25% and b) ASB considered its liability driven investment strategy in selecting 2.96%, which is consistent with the assumed discount rate as of December 31, 2020 with a 20 basis point active manager premium. For 2020, retirement benefit plans’ assets of HEI and the Utilities had a net return of 16.9%.
As of December 31, 2020, the assumed health care trend rates for 2021 and future years were as follows: medical, 6.75%, grading down to 5% for 2028 and thereafter; dental, 5%; and vision, 4%. As of December 31, 2019, the assumed health care trend rates for 2020 and future years were as follows: medical, 7%, grading down to 5% for 2028 and thereafter; dental, 5%; and vision, 4%.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The components of NPPC and NPBC were as follows:
The Company recorded pension expense of $59 million in each of 2020, 2019 and 2018 and OPEB expense of $(0.1) million, $(0.1) million and nil in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and charged the remaining amounts primarily to electric utility plant. The Utilities recorded pension expense of $55 million, $57 million and $55 million and OPEB (income) expense of $(0.2) million, $(0.3) million and $(0.1) million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and charged the remaining amounts primarily to electric utility plant.
Additional information on the defined benefit pension plans’ accumulated benefit obligations (ABOs), which do not consider projected pay increases (unlike the PBOs shown in the table above), and pension plans with ABOs and PBOs in excess of plan assets were as follows:
HEI consolidated. The Company estimates that the cash funding for the qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2021 will be $52 million, which should fully satisfy the minimum required contributions to those plans, including requirements of the Utilities’ pension tracking mechanisms and the Plan’s funding policy. The Company’s current estimate of contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2021 is nil.
As of December 31, 2020, the benefits expected to be paid under all retirement benefit plans in 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026 through 2030 amount to $96 million, $99 million, $103 million, $107 million, $110 million and $610 million, respectively.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Hawaiian Electric consolidated. The Utilities estimate that the cash funding for the qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2021 will be $51 million, which should fully satisfy the minimum required contributions to that Plan, including requirements of the pension tracking mechanisms and the Plan’s funding policy. The Utilities’ current estimate of contributions to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2021 is nil.
As of December 31, 2020, the benefits expected to be paid under all retirement benefit plans in 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026 through 2030 amounted to $88 million, $91 million, $93 million, $97 million, $101 million and $559 million, respectively.
Defined contribution plans information. For each of 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company’s expenses and cash contributions for its defined contribution plans under the HEIRSP and the ASB 401(k) Plan were $7 million. The Utilities’ expenses and cash contributions for its defined contribution plan under the HEIRSP for 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $3 million, $3 million and $2 million, respectively.
Under the 2010 Equity and Incentive Plan, as amended, HEI can issue shares of common stock as incentive compensation to selected employees in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance shares and other share-based and cash-based awards. The 2010 Equity and Incentive Plan (original EIP) was amended and restated effective March 1, 2014 (EIP) and an additional 1.5 million shares were added to the shares available for issuance under these programs.
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 3.0 million shares remained available for future issuance under the terms of the EIP, assuming recycling of shares withheld to satisfy minimum statutory tax liabilities relating to EIP awards, including an estimated 0.6 million shares that could be issued upon the vesting of outstanding restricted stock units and the achievement of performance goals for awards outstanding under long-term incentive plans (assuming that such performance goals are achieved at maximum levels).
Restricted stock units awarded under the 2010 Equity and Incentive Plan in 2020, 2019, 2018 and 2017 will vest and be issued in unrestricted stock in four equal annual increments on the anniversaries of the grant date and are forfeited to the extent they have not become vested for terminations of employment during the vesting period, except that pro-rata vesting is provided for terminations due to death, disability and retirement. Restricted stock units expense has been recognized in accordance with the fair-value-based measurement method of accounting. Dividend equivalent rights are accrued quarterly and are paid at the end of the restriction period when the associated restricted stock units vest.
Stock performance awards granted under the 2020-2022, 2019-2021 and 2018-2020 long-term incentive plans (LTIP) entitle the grantee to shares of common stock with dividend equivalent rights once service conditions and performance conditions are satisfied at the end of the three-year performance period. LTIP awards are forfeited for terminations of employment during the performance period, except that pro-rata participation is provided for terminations due to death, disability and retirement based upon completed months of service after a minimum of 12 months of service in the performance period. Compensation expense for the stock performance awards portion of the LTIP has been recognized in accordance with the fair-value-based measurement method of accounting for performance shares.
Under the 2011 Nonemployee Director Stock Plan (2011 Director Plan), HEI can issue shares of common stock as compensation to nonemployee directors of HEI, Hawaiian Electric and ASB. In June 2019, an additional 300,000 shares were made available for issuance under the 2011 Director Plan. As of December 31, 2020, there were 274,163 shares remaining available for future issuance under the 2011 Director Plan.
Share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit were as follows:
1For 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company has not capitalized any share-based compensation.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Stock awards. HEI granted HEI common stock to nonemployee directors under the 2011 Director Plan as follows:
The number of shares issued to each nonemployee director of HEI, Hawaiian Electric and ASB is determined based on the closing price of HEI common stock on the grant date.
Restricted stock units. Information about HEI’s grants of restricted stock units was as follows:
(1)Weighted-average grant-date fair value per share based on the average price of HEI common stock on the date of grant.
For 2020, 2019 and 2018, total restricted stock units and related dividends that vested had a fair value of $4.2 million, $3.2 million and $2.7 million, respectively, and the related tax benefits were $0.7 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020, there was $5.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested restricted stock units. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years.
Long-term incentive plan payable in stock. The 2018-2020, 2019-2021 and 2020-2022 LTIPs provide for performance awards under the EIP of shares of HEI common stock based on the satisfaction of performance goals, including a market condition goal. The number of shares of HEI common stock that may be awarded is fixed on the date the grants are made, subject to the achievement of specified performance levels and calculated dividend equivalents. The potential payout varies from 0% to 200% of the number of target shares, depending on the achievement of the goals. The market condition goal is based on HEI’s total shareholder return (TSR) compared to the Edison Electric Institute Index over the relevant three-year period. The other performance condition goals relate to EPS growth, return on average common equity (ROACE), renewable portfolio standards, Hawaiian Electric’s net income growth, ASB’s efficiency ratio and Pacific Current’s EBITDA growth and return on average invested capital.
LTIP linked to TSR. Information about HEI’s LTIP grants linked to TSR was as follows:
(1)Weighted-average grant-date fair value per share determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The grant date fair values of the shares were determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model utilizing actual information for the common shares of HEI and its peers for the period from the beginning of the performance period to the grant date and estimated future stock volatility and dividends of HEI and its peers over the remaining three-year performance period. The expected stock volatility assumptions for HEI and its peer group were based on the three-year historic stock volatility, and the annual dividend yield assumptions were based on dividend yields calculated on the basis of daily stock prices over the same three-year historical period.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The following table summarizes the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the LTIP awards linked to TSR and the resulting fair value of LTIP awards granted:
For 2020, total vested LTIP awards linked to TSR and related dividends had a fair value of $2.6 million and the related tax benefits were $0.4 million. There were no share-based LTIP awards linked to TSR with a vesting date in 2018 or 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, there was $1.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested performance awards payable in shares linked to TSR. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.
LTIP awards linked to other performance conditions. Information about HEI’s LTIP awards payable in shares linked to other performance conditions was as follows:
(1)Weighted-average grant-date fair value per share based on the average price of HEI common stock on the date of grant.
For 2020, total vested LTIP awards linked to other performance conditions and related dividends had a fair value of $7.6 million and the related tax benefits were $1.2 million. There were no share-based LTIP awards linked to other performance conditions with a vesting date in 2018 or 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, there was $4.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the nonvested shares linked to performance conditions other than TSR. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The components of income taxes attributable to net income for common stock were as follows:
* In 2020, primarily represents federal tax credits related to Mauo’s solar-plus-storage project, deferred and amortized starting in 2020. In 2019, primarily represents federal and state credits related to Hawaiian Electric’s West Loch PV project, deferred and amortized starting in 2020.
A reconciliation of the amount of income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate to the amount provided in the consolidated statements of income was as follows:
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
The tax effects of book and tax basis differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:
1 As of December 31, 2020, HEI consolidated and Hawaiian Electric consolidated have deferred tax assets of $10.9 million and $5.8 million respectively, relating to the benefit of state tax credit carryforwards of $14.6 million and $7.8 million respectively. These state tax credit carryforwards primarily relate to the West Loch PV project and do not expire. The Company concluded that as of December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance is not required.
The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible. Based upon historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income, management believes it is more likely than not the Company and the Utilities will realize substantially all of the benefits of the deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, valuation allowances for deferred tax benefits were nil. The Utilities are included in the consolidated federal and Hawaii income tax returns of HEI and are subject to the provisions of HEI’s tax sharing agreement, which determines each subsidiary’s (or subgroup’s) income tax return liabilities and refunds on a standalone basis as if it filed a separate return (or subgroup consolidated return).
The following is a reconciliation of the Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits for 2020, 2019 and 2018.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were $11.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Utilities had $11.6 million and nil, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Utilities’ annual effective tax rate.
HEI consolidated. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in “Interest expense-other than on deposit liabilities and other bank borrowings” and penalties, if any, in operating expenses. In 2020, 2019 and
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
2018, the Company recognized approximately $(0.5) million, $0.1 million and $(0.1) million in interest expense. The Company had $0.1 million and $0.6 million of interest accrued as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Hawaiian Electric consolidated. The Utilities recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in “Interest expense and other charges, net” and penalties, if any, in operating expenses. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Utilities recognized approximately $(0.3) million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million in interest expense. The Utilities had $0.1 million and $0.4 million of interest accrued as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
As of December 31, 2020, the disclosures above present the Company’s and the Utilities’ accruals for potential tax liabilities, which involve management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of the benefits being sustained under governmental review. While the Company and the Utilities currently do not expect material changes to occur in the next twelve months, the Company and the Utilities are generally unable to estimate the range of impacts on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate from the resolution of these issues until the Internal Revenue Service addresses them in the current examination process, and therefore, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to the Company’s and the Utilities’ uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease within the next 12 months. The final resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in adjustments to recorded amounts.
Based on information currently available, the Company and the Utilities believe these accruals have adequately provided for potential income tax issues with federal and state tax authorities, and that the ultimate resolution of tax issues for all open tax periods will not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.
The statute of limitations for IRS examinations has expired for years prior to 2017. The Company is currently under IRS examination for the tax years 2017 and 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company and the Hawaii Department of Taxation agreed to a final assessment of tax liabilities for the years 2011 through 2018, however, the statute of limitations for Hawaii remains open for tax years 2011 and subsequent.

Note 14 · Regulatory restrictions on net assets
The abilities of certain of HEI’s subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to HEI are subject to contractual and regulatory restrictions. Under the PUC Agreement, in the event that the consolidated common stock equity of the electric utility subsidiaries falls below 35% of the total capitalization of the electric utilities (including the current maturities of long-term debt, but excluding short-term borrowings), the electric utility subsidiaries would, absent PUC approval, be restricted in their payment of cash dividends to 80% of the earnings available for the payment of dividends in the current fiscal year and preceding five years, less the amount of dividends paid during that period. The PUC Agreement also provides that the foregoing dividend restriction shall not be construed as relinquishing any right the PUC may have to review the dividend policies of the electric utility subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, the consolidated common stock equity of HEI’s electric utility subsidiaries was 57% of their total capitalization (as calculated for purposes of the PUC Agreement). As of December 31, 2020, Hawaiian Electric and its subsidiaries had common stock equity of $2.1 billion of which approximately $859 million was not available for transfer to HEI in the form of dividends, loans or advances without regulatory approval.
The ability of ASB to make capital distributions to HEI and other affiliates is restricted under federal law. Subject to a limited exception for stock redemptions that do not result in any decrease in ASB’s capital and would improve ASB’s financial condition, ASB is prohibited from declaring any dividends, making any other capital distributions, or paying a management fee to a controlling person if, following the distribution or payment, ASB would be deemed to be undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. ASB is required to notify the FRB and OCC prior to making any capital distribution (including dividends) to HEI (through ASB Hawaii). All dividends are subject to review by the OCC and FRB and receipt of a letter from the FRB communicating the agencies’ non-objection to the payment of any dividend ASB proposes to
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
declare and pay to ASB Hawaii and HEI. Generally, the FRB and OCC may disapprove or deny ASB’s request to make a capital distribution if the proposed distribution will cause ASB to become undercapitalized, or the proposed distribution raises safety and soundness concerns, or the proposed distribution violates a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement between ASB and the OCC. As of December 31, 2020, in order to maintain its “well-capitalized” position, ASB could not transfer approximately $405 million of net assets to HEI.
HEI and its subsidiaries are also subject to debt covenants, preferred stock resolutions and the terms of guarantees that could limit their respective abilities to pay dividends. The Company does not expect that the regulatory and contractual restrictions applicable to HEI and/or its subsidiaries will significantly affect the operations of HEI or its ability to pay dividends on its common stock.
Note 15 · Significant group concentrations of credit risk
Most of the Company’s business activity is with customers located in the State of Hawaii.
The Utilities are regulated operating electric public utilities engaged in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity on the islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui, Lanai and Molokai in the State of Hawaii. The Utilities provide the only electric public utility service on the islands they serve. The Utilities extend credit to customers, all of whom reside or conduct business in the State of Hawaii. See Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Utilities’ major customers. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1260 represents roughly half of the Utilities’ workforce covered by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on October 31, 2021.
Most of ASB’s financial instruments are based in the State of Hawaii, except for the investment securities it owns. Substantially all real estate loans are collateralized by real estate in Hawaii. ASB’s policy is to require mortgage insurance on all real estate loans with a loan to appraisal ratio in excess of 80% at origination.
Pacific Current’s investments are in the State of Hawaii since its strategy is focused on investing in non-regulated renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure in the State of Hawaii.
Fair value measurement and disclosure valuation methodology. The following are descriptions of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value and for estimating fair value for financial instruments not carried at fair value:
Short-term borrowings-other than bank. The carrying amount of short-term borrowings approximated fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Investment securities. The fair value of ASB’s investment securities is determined quarterly through pricing obtained from independent third-party pricing services or from brokers not affiliated with the trade. Non-binding broker quotes are infrequent and generally occur for new securities that are settled close to the month-end pricing date. The third-party pricing vendors ASB uses for pricing its securities are reputable firms that provide pricing services on a global basis and have processes in place to ensure quality and control. The third-party pricing services use a variety of methods to determine the fair value of securities that fall under Level 2 of ASB’s fair value measurement hierarchy. Among the considerations are quoted prices for similar securities in an active market, yield spreads for similar trades, adjustments for liquidity, size, collateral characteristics, historic and generic prepayment speeds, and other observable market factors.
To enhance the robustness of the pricing process, ASB will on a quarterly basis compare its standard third-party vendor’s price with that of another third-party vendor. If the prices are within an acceptable tolerance range, the price of the standard vendor will be accepted. If the variance is beyond the tolerance range, an evaluation will be conducted by ASB and a challenge to the price may be made. Fair value in such cases will be based on the value that best reflects the data and observable characteristics of the security. In all cases, the fair value used will have been independently determined by a third-party pricing vendor or non-affiliated broker.
The fair value of the mortgage revenue bonds is estimated using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of future principal and interest payments and, therefore is classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
Loans held for sale. Residential and commercial loans are carried at the lower of cost or market and are valued using market observable pricing inputs, which are derived from third party loan sales and, therefore, are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Loans held for investment. Fair value of loans held for investment is derived using a discounted cash flow approach which includes an evaluation of the underlying loan characteristics. The valuation model uses loan characteristics which includes product type, maturity dates and the underlying interest rate of the portfolio. This information is input into the valuation models along with various forecast valuation assumptions including prepayment forecasts, to determine the discount rate. These assumptions are derived from internal and third party sources. Since the valuation is derived from model-based techniques, ASB includes loans held for investment within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.
Collateral dependent loans. Collateral dependent loans have been adjusted to fair value. When a loan is identified as collateral dependent, the Company measures the impairment using the current fair value of the collateral, less selling costs. Depending on the characteristics of a loan, the fair value of collateral is generally estimated by obtaining external appraisals, but in some cases, the value of the collateral may be estimated as having little or no value. Non-real estate collateral may be valued using an appraisal, net book value per the borrower’s financial statements, or aging reports, adjusted or discounted based on management’s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of the valuation and management’s expertise and knowledge of the client and client’s business, resulting in a Level 3 fair value classification. If it is determined that the value of the collateral dependent loan is less than its recorded investment, the Company recognizes this impairment and adjusts the carrying value of the loan to fair value through the allowance for credit losses.
Real estate acquired in settlement of loans. Foreclosed assets are carried at fair value (less estimated costs to sell) and are generally based upon appraisals or independent market prices that are periodically updated subsequent to classification as real estate owned. Such adjustments typically result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. ASB estimates the fair value of collateral-dependent loans and real estate owned using the sales comparison approach.
Mortgage servicing rights. MSRs are capitalized at fair value based on market data at the time of sale and accounted for in subsequent periods at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. MSRs are evaluated for impairment at each reporting date. ASB's MSRs are stratified based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans including loan type and note rate. For each stratum, fair value is calculated by discounting expected net income streams using discount rates that reflect industry pricing for similar assets. Expected net income streams are estimated based on industry assumptions regarding prepayment expectations and income and expenses associated with servicing residential mortgage loans for others. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance for each stratum when the carrying amount exceeds fair value, with any associated provision recorded as a component of loan servicing fees included in "Revenues - bank" in the consolidated statements of income. A direct write-down is recorded when the recoverability of the valuation allowance is deemed to be unrecoverable. ASB compares the fair value of MSRs to an estimated value calculated by an independent third-party. The third-party relies on both published and unpublished sources of market related assumptions and its own experience and expertise to arrive at a value. ASB uses the third-party value only to assess the reasonableness of its own estimate.
Time deposits. The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the rates currently offered for FHLB advances of similar remaining maturities. Deposit liabilities are classified in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
Other borrowings. For advances and repurchase agreements, fair value is estimated using quantitative discounted cash flow models that require the use of interest rate inputs that are currently offered for advances and repurchase agreements of similar remaining maturities. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including broker market transactions and third party pricing services.
Long-term debt-other than bank. Fair value of fixed-rate long-term debt-other than bank was obtained from third-party financial services providers based on the current rates offered for debt of the same or similar remaining maturities and from discounting the future cash flows using the current rates offered for debt of the same or similar risks, terms, and remaining maturities. The carrying amount of floating rate long-term debt-other than bank approximated fair value because of the short-term interest reset periods. Long-term debt-other than bank is classified in Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.
Interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs). The estimated fair value of commitments to originate residential mortgage loans for sale is based on quoted prices for similar loans in active markets. IRLCs are classified as Level 2 measurements.
Forward sales commitments. To be announced (TBA) mortgage-backed securities forward commitments are classified as Level 1, and consist of publicly-traded debt securities for which identical fair values can be obtained through quoted market prices in active exchange markets. The fair values of ASB’s best efforts and mandatory delivery loan sale commitments are determined using quoted prices in the market place that are observable and are classified as Level 2 measurements.
The following table presents the carrying or notional amount, fair value, and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company’s financial instruments. For stock in Federal Home Loan Bank, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value because it can only be redeemed at par.

Fair value measurements on a recurring basis. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:
1 Derivatives are carried at fair value in other assets or other liabilities in the balance sheets with changes in value included in mortgage banking income.
2 Derivatives are included in Other liabilities in the balance sheets.
There were no transfers of financial assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The changes in Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:
ASB holds two mortgage revenue bonds issued by the Department of Budget and Finance of the State of Hawaii. The Company estimates the fair value by using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of estimated future principal and interest payments. The unobservable input used in the fair value measurement is the weighted average discount rate. As of December 31, 2020, the weighted average discount rate was 2.13% which was derived by incorporating a credit spread over the one month LIBOR rate. Significant increases (decreases) in the weighted average discount rate could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis. Certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and therefore are not included in the tables above. These measurements primarily result from assets carried at the lower of cost or fair value or from impairment of individual assets. The carrying value of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were as follows:
For 2020 and 2019, there were no adjustments to fair value for ASB’s loans held for sale.
The following table presents quantitative information about Level 3 fair value measurements for financial instruments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:
(1) Represent percent of outstanding principal balance.
(2) N/A - Not applicable. There is one asset in each fair value measurement type.
Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation would result in significantly higher (lower) fair value measurements.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
Selected quarterly information was as follows:
Note: HEI owns all of Hawaiian Electric’s common stock, therefore per share data for Hawaiian Electric is not meaningful.
1Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2019 includes gains on property sales totaling $10.8 million, and net income and net income for common stock includes $7.9 million (or $0.07 per share (basic and diluted) at ASB’s 26.8% statutory tax rate).
2The quarterly basic earnings per common share are based upon the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding in each quarter.
3The quarterly diluted earnings per common share are based upon the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding in each quarter plus the dilutive incremental shares at quarter end.
