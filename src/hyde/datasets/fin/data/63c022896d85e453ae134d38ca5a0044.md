REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of KemPharm, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of KemPharm, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis of Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
As described in Note B to the financial statements, the Company’s revenues are derived from contracts with customers that may include multiple performance obligations, consideration constrained by regulatory milestones over which the Company may have little or no control, and services that may be delivered over a period of time. Management exercises significant judgement in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements including:
● Determination of stand-alone selling prices (SSP) for each distinct performance obligation.
● Timing of when revenue is recognized for each distinct performance obligation.
● Estimation of constrained consideration to be included in the transaction price when determining the amount of revenue to recognize.
● Determining the time period over which to recognize revenue.
We identified the Company’s revenue recognition related to its collaboration and license contracts and other contracts as a critical audit matter because the identification of accounting performance obligations, determination of the initial transaction price and estimation of SSP for each performance obligation and estimation of the period over which to recognize revenue required significant audit effort and a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity to evaluate the evidence obtained.
Our procedures related to the Company’s revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following, among others:
● Evaluated the Company’s significant accounting policies related to customer agreements in accordance with the applicable accounting standards.
● Obtained customer agreements and performed the following procedures, among others:
○ Obtained and read contract source documents, including master agreements, statements of work, and other documents that were part of the agreement.
○ Tested management’s identification of significant terms for completeness, including the identification of distinct performance obligations and constrained consideration.
○ Tested management’s evaluation of the time period over which revenue should be recognized.
● Evaluated management’s estimate of SSP related to products and services that are not sold separately for reasonableness and tested the completeness and accuracy of the data used in determining the SSP.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
A.
Description of Business and Basis of Presentation
Organization
KemPharm, Inc. (the “Company”) is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of proprietary prodrugs to treat serious medical conditions through its proprietary Ligand Activated Therapy ("LAT®") technology. The Company utilizes its proprietary LAT technology to generate improved prodrug versions of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") approved drugs as well as to generate prodrug versions of existing compounds that may have applications for new disease indications. The Company's product candidate pipeline is focused on the high need areas of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ("ADHD") and stimulant use disorder ("SUD"). The Company's clinical product candidates for the treatment of ADHD include AZSTARYS™ (formerly referred to as KP415) and KP484, and the Company's clinical product candidate for the treatment of SUD includes KP879. In addition, the Company has received FDA approval for APADAZ®, an immediate-release combination product containing benzhydrocodone, a prodrug of hydrocodone and acetaminophen. On March 2, 2021, the Company announced that the FDA approved the new drug application ("NDA") for AZSTARYS, a once-daily product for the treatment of ADHD in patients age six years and older.
Reverse Stock Split
On December 23, 2020, the Company completed a one-for-sixteen reverse stock split (the “Reverse Stock Split”), which reduced the number of shares of the Company’s common stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split. The number of shares of the Company’s authorized common stock was not affected by the Reverse Stock Split and the par value of the Company’s common stock remained unchanged at $0.0001 per share. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who otherwise held fractional shares of the Company’s common stock as a result of the Reverse Stock Split received a cash payment in lieu of such fractional shares. Except where disclosed, all amounts related to number of shares and per share amounts have been retroactively restated in these financial statements.
Liquidity
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has experienced recurring negative operating cash flows and has a stockholders' deficit, and its cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2020 are not sufficient to fund the Company’s operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least one year from December 31, 2020. However, after taking into account the underwritten public offering, debt restructuring with subsequent payoff and warrant inducement transactions discussed in Note R this concern has been alleviated and the Company's cash and cash equivalents as of the filing date are sufficient to fund the Company's operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for a least one year from the date these financial statements are issued.
Entry into 2019 ELOC Agreement
In February 2019, the Company entered into a purchase agreement for an equity line of credit (the “2019 ELOC Agreement”) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (“Lincoln Park”) which provided that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, the Company previously could sell to Lincoln Park up to $15.0 million of shares of common stock from time to time over the 36-month term of the 2019 ELOC Agreement, and upon execution of the 2019 ELOC Agreement, the Company issued an additional 7,512 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park as commitment shares in accordance with the closing conditions within the 2019 ELOC Agreement. Concurrently with entering into the 2019 ELOC Agreement, the Company also entered into a registration rights agreement with Lincoln Park (the “2019 ELOC Registration Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to register the sale of the shares of common stock that have been and may be issued to Lincoln Park under the 2019 ELOC Agreement pursuant to the Company’s existing shelf registration statement on Form S-3 or a new registration statement. The 2019 ELOC Agreement was terminated in February 2020 in connection with entering into the 2020 ELOC Agreement (discussed below). Prior to the termination of the 2019 ELOC Agreement, the Company sold 212,579 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park (exclusive of the 7,512 commitment shares) under the 2019 ELOC Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $5.4 million.
Entry into 2020 ELOC Agreement
In February 2020, the Company entered into a purchase agreement for an equity line of credit (the “2020 ELOC Agreement”) with Lincoln Park which provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth therein, the Company may sell to Lincoln Park up to $4.0 million of shares of common stock from time to time over the 12-month term of the 2020 ELOC Agreement, and upon execution of the 2020 ELOC Agreement the Company issued an additional 19,289 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park as commitment shares in accordance with the closing conditions within the 2020 ELOC Agreement. Concurrently with entering into the 2020 ELOC Agreement, the Company also entered into a registration rights agreement with Lincoln Park (the “2020 ELOC Registration Rights Agreement”) pursuant to which the Company agreed to register the sale of the shares of common stock that have been and may be issued to Lincoln Park under the 2020 ELOC Agreement pursuant to the Company’s existing shelf registration statement on Form S-3 or a new registration statement. In May 2020, the Company reached the maximum allowable shares to be issued under the Current Registration Statement of 579,260 shares (inclusive of the 19,289 commitment shares) as defined in Section 2(f)(i) of the 2020 ELOC Agreement and therefore cannot issue additional shares under the 2020 ELOC Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has sold 559,971 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park (exclusive of the 19,289 commitment shares) under the 2020 ELOC Agreement for gross proceeds of approximately $2.3 million.
License Agreements
Entry into KP415 License Agreement
In September 2019, the Company entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “KP415 License Agreement”) with Commave Therapeutics SA, an affiliate of Gurnet Point Capital (“Commave”). Under the KP415 License Agreement, the Company granted to Commave an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Company’s product candidates containing serdexmethylphenidate (“SDX”) and d-methylphenidate (“d-MPH”), including AZSTARYS, KP484, and, at the option of Commave, KP879, KP922 or any other product candidate developed by the Company containing SDX and developed to treat ADHD or any other central nervous system disorder (the “Additional Product Candidates” and, collectively with AZSTARYS and KP484, the “Licensed Product Candidates”). Pursuant to the KP415 License Agreement, Commave (i) paid the Company an upfront payment of $10.0 million; (ii) agreed to pay milestone payments of up to $63.0 million upon the occurrence of specified regulatory milestones related to AZSTARYS and KP484; (iii) agreed to pay additional payments of up to $420.0 million upon the achievement of specified U.S. sales milestones; and (iv) has agreed to pay the Company quarterly, tiered royalty payments ranging from a percentage in the high single digits to the mid-twenties of Net Sales (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) in the United States and a percentage in the low to mid-single digits of Net Sales in each country outside the United States, in each case subject to specified reductions under certain conditions as described in the KP415 License Agreement. Commave is obligated to make such royalty payments on a product-by-product basis until expiration of the Royalty Term (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) for the applicable product.
In May 2020, the FDA accepted the Company’s NDA for AZSTARYS. Per the KP415 License Agreement, the Company received a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA’s acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA.
Commave has also agreed to be responsible and reimburse the Company for all of development, commercialization and regulatory expenses for the Licensed Product Candidates, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the KP415 License Agreement.
The KP415 License Agreement also established a joint steering committee, which monitors progress of the development of both AZSTARYS and KP484. Subject to the oversight of the joint steering committee, the Company otherwise retains all responsibility for the conduct of all regulatory activities required to obtain new drug application approval of AZSTARYS and KP484; provided that Commave shall be the sponsor of any clinical trials conducted by the Company on behalf of Commave.
In accordance with the terms of the Company’s March 20, 2012 Termination Agreement with Aquestive Therapeutics (formerly known as MonoSol Rx, LLC), Aquestive Therapeutics has the right to receive an amount equal to 10% of any royalty or milestone payments made to the Company related to AZSTARYS, KP484 or KP879 under the KP415 License Agreement.
Entry into APADAZ License Agreement
In October 2018, the Company entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “APADAZ License Agreement”) with KVK Tech, Inc. (“KVK”) pursuant to which we have granted an exclusive license to KVK to conduct regulatory activities for, manufacture and commercialize APADAZ in the United States.
Pursuant to the APADAZ License Agreement, KVK agreed to pay the Company certain payments and cost reimbursements of an estimated $3.4 million, which includes a payment of $2.0 million within 10 days of the achievement of a specified milestone related to the initial formulary adoption of APADAZ (the “Initial Adoption Milestone”). In addition, KVK has agreed to make additional payments to the Company upon the achievement of specified sales milestones of up to $53.0 million in the aggregate. Further, the Company and KVK will share the quarterly net profits of APADAZ by KVK in the United States at specified tiered percentages, ranging from the Company receiving 30% to 50% of net profits, based on the amount of net sales on a rolling four quarter basis. The Company is responsible for a portion of commercialization and regulatory expenses for APADAZ until the Initial Adoption Milestone is achieved, after which KVK will be responsible for all expenses incurred in connection with commercialization and maintaining regulatory approval in the United States.
The APADAZ License Agreement will terminate on the later of the date that all of the patent rights for APADAZ have expired in the United States or KVK’s cessation of commercialization of APADAZ in the United States. KVK may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement upon 90 days written notice if a regulatory authority in the United States orders KVK to stop sales of APADAZ due to a safety concern. In addition, after the third anniversary of the APADAZ License Agreement, KVK may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement without cause upon 18 months prior written notice. The Company may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement if KVK stops conducting regulatory activities for or commercializing APADAZ in the United States for a period of six months, subject to specified exceptions, or if KVK or its affiliates challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of any licensed patent under the APADAZ License Agreement. Both parties may terminate the APADAZ License Agreement (i) upon a material breach of the APADAZ License Agreement, subject to a 30-day cure period, (ii) if the other party encounters bankruptcy or insolvency or (iii) if the Initial Adoption Milestone is not achieved. Upon termination, all licenses and other rights granted by the Company to KVK pursuant to the APADAZ License Agreement would revert to the Company.
The APADAZ License Agreement also established a joint steering committee, which monitors progress of the commercialization of APADAZ.
Consulting Arrangements
From time to time, the Company enters into consulting arrangements with third-parties to provide research and development, manufacturing and/or commercialization services. Such arrangements may require the Company to deliver various rights, services, including research and development services, regulatory services and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to the Company in the form of consulting fees and reimbursements of out-of-pocket third-party research and development, regulatory and commercial costs.
Corium Consulting Agreement
In July 2020, the Company entered into a consultation services arrangement (the “Corium Consulting Agreement”) with Corium, Inc. (“Corium”) under which Corium engaged the Company to guide the product development and regulatory activities for certain current and potential future products in Corium’s portfolio, as well as continue supporting preparation for the potential commercial launch of AZSTARYS (together, “Corium Consulting Services”). Corium is a portfolio company of Gurnet Point Capital and is responsible for leading all commercialization activities for AZSTARYS under the KP415 License Agreement, as discussed above.
Under the Corium Consulting Agreement, the Company is entitled to receive payments from Corium of up to $15.6 million, $13.6 million of which will be paid in quarterly installments through March 31, 2022. The remaining $2.0 million is conditioned upon the achievement of a specified regulatory milestone related to Corium’s product portfolio. Corium also agreed to be responsible for and reimburse the Company for all development, commercialization and regulatory expenses incurred as part of the performance of the Corium Consulting Services.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, the useful lives of property and equipment, the recoverability of long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for leases, and assumptions used for purposes of determining stock-based compensation, income taxes, and the fair value of the derivative and warrant liability, among others. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash on deposit with multiple financial institutions, the balances of which frequently exceed insured limits, and accounts receivable, which are concentrated amongst a limited number of customers.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers any highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.
Property and Equipment
The Company records property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs of renewals and improvements that extend the useful lives of the assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which generally range from three to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the term of the related lease. Upon retirement or disposition of assets, the costs and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts with the resulting gains or losses, if any, reflected in the statements of operations.
Debt Issuance Costs
Debt issuance costs incurred in connection with financing arrangements are recorded as a reduction of the related debt on the balance sheet and amortized over the life of the respective financing arrangement using the effective interest method.
Offering Costs
Offering costs incurred in connection with capital offering arrangements are recorded as deferred offering costs in prepaid expenses and other currents assets on the balance sheet. Once the offering arrangement closes the deferred offering costs are reclassified as a reduction of the related net proceeds of the offering in additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. If its a continuous offering the deferred offering costs are amortized over the life of the respective offering arrangement using a pro-rata method which matches the costs to the funds raised from the offering. If the continuous offering arrangement terminates prior to all the deferred offering costs being recognized the deferred offering costs are written off and expensed in general and administrative expense on the statement of operations.
Supply Arrangements
The Company enters into supply arrangements for the supply of components of its product and product candidates. These arrangements also may include a share of future revenue if related product or product candidates reach commercialization. Costs under these supply arrangements, if any, are expensed as incurred (Note I).
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. When such events occur, the Company compares the carrying amounts of the assets to their undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying values, an impairment loss is recorded for the difference between the carrying values and fair values of the asset. No such impairment occurred for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, based on the Company’s principal or, in absence of a principal, most advantageous market for the specific asset or liability.
The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy to classify and disclose all assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, in periods subsequent to their initial measurement. The hierarchy requires the Company to use observable inputs when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs, when determining fair value. The three tiers are defined as follows:
●
Level 1-Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;
●
Level 2-Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly in the marketplace for identical or similar assets and liabilities; and
●
Level 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions.
Revenue Recognition
The Company commenced recognizing revenue in accordance with the provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”), starting January 1, 2018. However, the Company had no revenue until the third quarter of 2019.
Arrangements with Multiple-Performance Obligations
From time to time, the Company enters into arrangements for research and development, manufacturing and/or commercialization services. Such arrangements may require the Company to deliver various rights, services, including intellectual property rights/licenses, research and development services, and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to the Company in the form of nonrefundable upfront license fees, development and commercial performance milestone payments, royalty payments, consulting fees and/or profit sharing.
In arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects the Company’s best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by the Company on a stand-alone basis or using an adjusted market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available.
The consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. Should there be royalties, the Company utilizes the sales and usage-based royalty exception in arrangements that resulted from the license of intellectual property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur.
Licensing Agreements
The Company enters into licensing agreements with licensees that fall under the scope of ASC 606.
The terms of the Company’s licensing agreements typically include one or more of the following: (i) upfront fees; (ii) milestone payments related to the achievement of development, regulatory, or commercial goals; and (iii) royalties on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments may result in licensing revenues.
As part of the accounting for these agreements, the Company must develop estimates and assumptions that require judgment to determine the underlying stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation which determines how the transaction price is allocated among the performance obligations. Generally, the estimation of the stand-alone selling price may include such estimates as, independent evidence of market price, forecasted revenues or costs, development timelines, discount rates, and probability of regulatory success. The Company evaluates each performance obligation to determine if they can be satisfied at a point in time or over time, and it measures the services delivered to the licensee which are periodically reviewed based on the progress of the related program. The effect of any change made to an estimated input component and, therefore revenue or expense recognized, would be recorded as a change in estimate. In addition, variable consideration (e.g., milestone payments) must be evaluated to determine if it is constrained and, therefore, excluded from the transaction price.
Up-front Fees: If a license to the Company’s intellectual property is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement, the Company recognizes revenues from the transaction price allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license. For licenses that are bundled with other promises, the Company utilizes judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time.
Milestone Payments: At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments (variable consideration), the Company evaluates whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimates the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within the Company’s or the licensee’s control, such as non-operational developmental and regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received. At the end of each reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of achievement of milestones that are within its or the licensee’s control, such as operational developmental milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect collaboration revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment. Revisions to the Company’s estimate of the transaction price may also result in negative licensing revenues and earnings in the period of adjustment.
KP415 License Agreement
In September 2019, the Company entered into the KP415 License Agreement with Commave under which the Company granted to Commave an exclusive, worldwide license to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Company’s product candidates containing SDX and d-MPH, including AZSTARYS, KP484, and, at the option of Commave, KP879, KP922 and/or any other product candidate developed by the Company containing SDX and developed to treat ADHD or any other central nervous system disorder. The license granted to Commave is distinct from other performance obligations as Commave can benefit from the license either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and the license is separately identifiable from other promises in the KP415 License Agreement.
In exchange for the exclusive, worldwide license, discussed above, Commave paid the Company a non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million. The Company is also entitled to additional payments from Commave of up to $63.0 million, conditioned upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones related to AZSTARYS and KP484. In May 2020, the FDA accepted the Company’s NDA for AZSTARYS. Per the KP415 License Agreement, the Company received a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA’s acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA. In addition, the Company is entitled to payments from Commave of up to $420.0 million in the aggregate, conditioned upon the achievement of certain U.S. sales milestones, which are dependent upon, among other things, the timing of approval for a new drug application for AZSTARYS and its final approved label, if any. Further, Commave will pay the Company quarterly, tiered royalty payments ranging from a percentage in the high single digits to mid-twenties of Net Sales (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) in the U.S. and a percentage in the low to mid-single digits of Net Sales in each country outside of the U.S., in each case subject to specified reductions under certain conditions as described in the KP415 License Agreement
Commave also agreed to be responsible for and reimburse the Company for all of development, commercialization and regulatory expenses incurred on the licensed products, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the KP415 License Agreement. As part of this agreement the Company is obligated to perform consulting services on behalf of Commave related to the licensed products. For these consulting services, Commave has agreed to pay the Company a set rate per hour on any consulting services performed on behalf of Commave for the benefit of the licensed products.
The KP415 License Agreement is within the scope of ASC 606, as the transaction represents a contract with a customer where the participants function in a customer / vendor relationship and are not exposed equally to the risks and rewards of the activities contemplated under the KP415 License Agreement. Using the concepts of ASC 606, the Company identified the grant of the exclusive, worldwide license and the performance of consulting services, which includes the reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs, as its only two performance obligations at inception. The Company further determined that the transaction price, at inception, under the agreement was $10.0 million upfront payment plus the fair value of the Development Costs (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) which was allocated among the performance obligations based on their respective related stand-alone selling price.
The consideration allocated to the grant of the exclusive, worldwide license was $10.0 million, which reflects the standalone selling price. The Company utilized the adjusted market assessment approach to determine this standalone selling price which included analyzing prospective offers received from various entities throughout our licensing negotiation process as well as the consideration paid to other competitors in the market for a similar type transaction. The Company determined that the intellectual property licensed under the KP415 License Agreement represented functional intellectual property and it has significant standalone functionality and therefore should be recognized at a point in time as opposed to over time. The revenue related to the grant of the exclusive, worldwide license was recognized at a point in time at the inception of the KP415 License Agreement.
The consideration allocated to the performance of consulting services, which includes the reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs, was the fair value of the Development Costs (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement), which reflects the standalone selling price. The Company utilized a blended approach which took into consideration the adjusted market assessment approach and the expected cost plus a margin approach to determine this standalone selling price. This blended approach utilized the adjusted market approach and expected cost plus margin approach to value the performance of consulting services which included analyzing hourly rates of vendors in the a market who perform similar services to those of the Company to develop a range and then analyzing the average cost per hour of our internal resources and applying a margin which placed the value in the median of the previously identified range. For the reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs the Company utilized the expected cost plus a margin approach, which included estimating the actual out-of-pocket cost the Company expects to pay to third-parties for research and development costs and applying a margin, if necessary. The Company determined that no margin was necessary of these out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs as these are purely pass-through costs and the margin for managing these third-party activities is included within the value of the performance of consulting services. The Company determined that the performance of consulting services, including reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs, is a performance obligation that is satisfied over time as the services are performed and the reimbursable costs are paid. As such, the revenue related to the performance obligation will be recognized as the consulting services are performed and the services associated with the reimbursable out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs are incurred and paid by the Company, in accordance with the practical expedient allowed under ASC 606 regarding an entity’s right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly to the value to the customer of the entity’s performance completed to date. As discussed above, the combination of the standalone selling price of these consulting services and certain out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs for AZSTARYS was the fair value of the Development Costs at inception. These Development Costs effectively created a cap on certain consulting services and out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs identified in the initial product development plan for AZSTARYS which was anticipated at the inception date of the KP415 License Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has recognized all of the consulting services and out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs under this cap.
Under the KP415 License Agreement, Commave was granted an exclusive right to first negotiation whereby upon completion of a Phase 1 proof-of-concept study, the Company and Commave may negotiate the economics terms under which that certain Additional Product may be included as a Product option to include Additional Products as Product(s) (both as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) under the KP415 License Agreement (the “Additional Product Option”). In addition to the Additional Product Option, Commave was also granted a right of first refusal (“ROFR”) to acquire, license and/or commercialize any of the Additional Product Candidates should they choose not to exercise the Additional Product Option. Should Commave choose to exercise the Additional Product Option on any Additional Product Candidates, Commave and the Company shall negotiate in good faith regarding the economic terms of such Additional Product. Further, should Commave exercise the ROFR on any Additional Product Candidate, the economic terms of the agreement shall be the same as those offered to the third-party. Under ASC 606 an option to acquire additional goods or services gives rise to a performance obligation if the option provides a material right to the customer. The Company concluded that the above described Additional Product Option and ROFR do not constitute material rights to the customer as Commave would acquire the goods or services at a to be negotiated price, which the Company expects to approximate fair value and therefore Commave would not receive a material discount on these goods or services compared to market rates.
The Company is entitled to additional payments from Commave conditioned upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones related to AZSTARYS and KP484 and the achievement of certain U.S. sales milestones, which are dependent upon, among other things, the timing of approval for a new drug application for AZSTARYS and its final approved label, if any. Further, Commave will pay the Company quarterly, tiered royalty payments ranging from a percentage in the high single digits to mid-twenties of Net Sales (as defined in the KP415 License Agreement) in the U.S. and a percentage in the low to mid-single digits of Net Sales in each country outside of the U.S., in each case subject to specified reductions under certain conditions as described in the KP415 License Agreement. The Company concluded that these regulatory milestones, sales milestones and royalty payments each contain a significant uncertainty associated with a future event. As such, these milestone and royalty payments are constrained at contract inception and are not included in the transaction price as the Company could not conclude that it is probable a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur surrounding these milestone payments. At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates its assessment of whether the milestone and royalty payments are constrained by considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the potential revenue reversal.
For example, in May 2020, the FDA accepted the Company’s NDA for AZSTARYS. Per the KP415 License Agreement, the Company received a regulatory milestone payment of $5.0 million following the FDA’s acceptance of the AZSTARYS NDA. Since the FDA accepted the Company’s NDA for AZSTARYS the constraint was removed and revenue recognized. The associated revenue was allocated among the two performance obligations identified at contract inception. Since both performance obligations were satisfied as of the end of the second quarter of 2020 the full $5.0 million payment was recognized as revenue during the second quarter of 2020.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized revenue under the KP415 License Agreement of $7.3 million. In accordance with the guidance provided in ASC 340-40, Contracts with Customers, the Company capitalized approximately $2.8 million of incremental costs incurred in obtaining the KP415 License Agreement and will amortize these costs as the revenue associated with the exclusive worldwide license, reimbursement of out-of-pocket third-party research and development costs and consulting services is recognized. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has recognized all of these incremental costs, $0.8 million of which was recognized in the year ended December 31, 2020 and is recorded in the line item titled royalty and direct contract acquisition costs in the statement of operations. There was $12.8 million of revenue and $1.9 million of associated direct contract acquisition costs recognized for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the KP415 License Agreement. There was no deferred revenue related to this agreement as of December 31, 2020 or December 31, 2019.
Consulting Arrangements
The Company enters into consulting arrangements with third-parties that fall under the scope of ASC 606. These arrangements may require the Company to deliver various rights, services, including research and development services, regulatory services and/or commercialization support services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to the Company in the form of consulting fees and reimbursements of out-of-pocket third-party research and development, regulatory and commercial costs.
Corium Consulting Agreement
The Corium Consulting Agreement is within the scope of ASC 606, as the transaction represents a contract with a customer where the participants function in a customer / vendor relationship and are not exposed equally to the risks and rewards of the activities contemplated under the Corium Consulting Agreement. Using the concepts of ASC 606, the Company identified the performance of consulting services, which includes the reimbursement to the Company of third-party pass-through costs, as its only performance obligation at inception. The Company further determined that the transaction price, at inception, under the agreement was $13.6 million which is the fair value of the consulting services, including the reimbursement of third-party pass-through costs. The Company concluded that the regulatory milestone contains a significant uncertainty associated with a future event. As such, this milestone is constrained at contract inception and is not included in the transaction price as the Company could not conclude that it is probable a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur surrounding these milestone payments. At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates its assessment of whether the milestone is constrained by considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the potential revenue reversal.
The Company determined that the performance of consulting services, including reimbursement of third-party pass-through costs, is a performance obligation that is satisfied over time as the services are performed and the reimbursable costs are paid. As such, the revenue related to the performance obligation will be recognized as the consulting services are performed and the services associated with the reimbursable third-party pass-through costs are incurred and paid by the Company, in accordance with the practical expedient allowed under ASC 606 regarding an entity’s right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly to the value to the customer of the entity’s performance completed to date. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has recognized approximately 30% of the consulting services and third-party pass-through costs under the Corium Consulting Agreement.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized revenue under the Corium Consulting Agreement of $3.9 million. There was no revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2019 related to the Corium Consulting Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had deferred revenue related to this agreement of $0.1 million. There was no deferred revenue related to this agreement as of December 31, 2019 as it was not entered into until July 2020.
Other Consulting Arrangements
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized revenue under other consulting arrangements of $2.0. There was no revenue recognized from other consulting arrangements for the year ended December 31, 2019. There was no deferred revenue from other from consulting arrangements as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Accounts and Other Receivables
Accounts and other receivables consists of receivables under the KP415 License Agreement and Corium Consulting Agreement, as well as receivables related to other consulting arrangements, income tax receivables and other receivables due to the Company. Receivables under the KP415 License Agreement and Corium Consulting Agreement are recorded for amounts due to the Company related to reimbursable third-party costs and performance of consulting services. These receivables, as well as the receivables related to other consulting arrangements, are evaluated to determine if any reserve or allowance should be established at each reporting date. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had receivables related to the Corium Consulting Agreement in the amount of $2.1 million, other consulting arrangements in the amount of $0.4 million and no receivables related to the KP415 License Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had receivables related to the KP415 License Agreement in the amount of $1.6 million and receivables related to other consulting arrangements of $0.1 million. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019 no reserve or allowance for doubtful accounts has been established.
Research and Development
Major components of research and development costs include cash compensation, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense on research and development property and equipment, costs of preclinical studies, clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing, costs of drug development, costs of materials and supplies, facilities cost, overhead costs, regulatory and compliance costs, and fees paid to consultants and other entities that conduct certain research and development activities on the Company’s behalf. Costs incurred in research and development are expensed as incurred.
The Company records nonrefundable advance payments it makes for future research and development activities as prepaid expenses. Prepaid expenses are recognized as expense in the statements of operations as the Company receives the related goods or services.
The Company enters into contractual agreements with third-party vendors who provide research and development, manufacturing, and other services in the ordinary course of business. Some of these contracts are subject to milestone-based invoicing and services are completed over an extended period of time. The Company records liabilities under these contractual commitments when an obligation has been incurred. This accrual process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with the applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost when the Company has not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. The majority of the service providers invoice the Company monthly in arrears for services performed. The Company makes estimates of the accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on the facts and circumstances known. The Company periodically confirms the accuracy of the estimates with the service providers and make adjustments, if necessary.
Patent Costs
Patent costs, including related legal costs, are expensed as incurred and recorded within general and administrative expenses on the statements of operations.
Income Taxes
The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Company believes is more likely than not to be realized.
Uncertain tax positions are recognized only when the Company believes it is more likely than not that the tax position will be upheld on examination by the taxing authorities based on the merits of the position. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized income tax uncertainties in income tax expense. The Company did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The Company files income tax returns in the United States for federal and various state jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal and state and local income tax examinations for years prior to 2014, although carryforward attributes that were generated prior to 2017 may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service if used in a future period. No income tax returns are currently under examination by taxing authorities.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to employees, officers and directors based on the estimated fair values of the awards as of the grant date. The Company records the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest as expense over the requisite service period. The Company also accounts for equity instruments issued to non-employees using a fair value approach under Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") subtopic 505-50, inclusive of the modifications made by Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Non-Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2018-17”). The Company values equity instruments and stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share of Common Stock
The Company uses the two-class method to compute net loss per common share because the Company has issued securities, other than common stock, that contractually entitle the holders to participate in dividends and earnings of the Company. The two-class method requires earnings for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive distributed and undistributed earnings. Holders of each series of the Company’s convertible preferred stock and select warrants are entitled to participate in distributions, when and if declared by the board of directors, that are made to common stockholders and, as a result, are considered participating securities.
Segment and Geographic Information
Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise (business activity from which it earns revenue and incurs expenses) for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s CODM is its Chief Executive Officer. The Company views its operations and manages its business as a single operating and reporting segment. All assets of the Company were held in the United States as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Application of New or Revised Accounting Standards-Adopted
From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) or other standard-setting bodies issue accounting standards that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date.
In April 2012, President Obama signed the Jump-Start Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for an emerging growth company. As an emerging growth company, the Company could have elected to adopt new or revised accounting standards when they become effective for non-public companies, which typically is later than public companies must adopt the standards. The Company has irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act and, as a result, will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)-Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”), which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. This update applies to all entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off-balance-sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and disclosures.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)-Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), which modifies the disclosure requirements on fair value measurements in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on the concepts in the FASB Concepts Statement, Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting-Chapter 8: Notes to Financial Statements, which the FASB finalized on August 28, 2018, including the consideration of costs and benefits. This update applies to all entities that are required, under existing U.S. GAAP, to make disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair value measurements. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments on changes in unrealized gains and losses, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and the narrative description of measurement uncertainty should be applied prospectively for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. The adoption of ASU 2018-13 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial statements and disclosures.
Application of New or Revised Accounting Standards-Not Yet Adopted
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40); Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”), which addresses issues identified as a result of the complexities associated with applying U.S. GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. This update addresses, among other things, the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, targeted improvements to the disclosures for convertible instruments and earnings-per-share (“EPS”) guidance and amendments to the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity, as well as the related EPS guidance. This update applies to all entities that issue convertible instruments and/or contracts in an entity’s own equity. This guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. FASB specified that an entity should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2020-06 could have on the Company’s financial statements and disclosures.

Deerfield Facility Agreement
In June 2014, the Company entered into a $60 million multi-tranche credit facility (the “Deerfield Facility Agreement”) with Deerfield Private Design Fund III, LP (“Deerfield”). At the time the Company entered into the Deerfield Facility Agreement, the Company borrowed the first tranche, which consisted of a term loan of $15 million (the “Term Note”) and a senior secured loan of $10 million (the “Deerfield Convertible Note”).
Deerfield is no longer obligated to provide the Company any additional disbursements under the Deerfield Facility Agreement. Deerfield may convert any portion of the outstanding principal and any accrued but unpaid interest on the Deerfield Convertible Note into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion price of $5.85 per share (the “Deerfield Note Put Option”). After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the conversion price became $93.60.
The Deerfield Convertible Note originally bore interest at 9.75% per annum, but was subsequently reduced to 6.75%. Interest accrued on the outstanding balance under the Deerfield Convertible Note was due quarterly in arrears. The Company originally had to repay one-third of the outstanding principal amount of the Deerfield Convertible Note on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the Deerfield Facility Agreement (June 2018 and June 2019). In June 2018, Deerfield agreed to convert the $3,333,333 of the principal amount then due, plus $168,288 of accrued interest, into 37,410 shares of our common stock (as discussed below in the section entitled “Facility Agreement Waiver and Fifth Amendment to Senior Secured Convertible Note”). In September 2019, the Company entered into an amendment with Deerfield in order to (i) reduce the interest rate applicable under the Deerfield Facility Agreement from 9.75% to 6.75%, (ii) provide for “payment in kind” of interest on the Loans (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement), and (iii) defer the Loan payments due pursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement until June 1, 2020 (as discussed below in the section entitled “2021 Note Exchange Effected in September 2019”). In December 2019, the Company entered into another amendment with Deerfield in order to (i) defer the Loan payments due pursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement until March 31, 2021 and (ii) allow for the entries of additional debt and debt holders under the Deerfield Facility Agreement (as discussed below in the section entitled “2021 Note Exchange Effected in December 2019”). The Company is also obligated to repay principal of the Deerfield Convertible Note in the amount of $6,980,824 plus any capitalized interest to date on March 31, 2021. Prepayment of the outstanding balance is not allowed without written consent of Deerfield.
Pursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement, the Company issued to Deerfield 1,923,077 shares of Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock (“Series D Preferred”) as consideration for the loans provided to the Company thereunder. Upon completion of the initial public offering, these shares of Series D Preferred automatically reclassified into 256,410 shares of the Company’s common stock. After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the reclassified shares became 16,025 shares.
The Company also issued to Deerfield a warrant to purchase 14,423,076 shares of Series D Preferred at an initial exercise price of $0.78 per share, which is exercisable until June 2, 2024 (the “Deerfield Warrant”). Upon completion of the Company’s initial public offering, the Deerfield Warrant automatically converted into a warrant to purchase 1,923,077 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $5.85 per share. After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the shares issuable upon conversion of the warrant became 120,192 shares of common stock, and the exercise price of the Deerfield Warrant became $93.60 per share, which in January 2021 was further adjusted to $46.25 per share in connection with the Company entering into the Inducement Letters (as defined in Note R) which triggered the anti-dilution provisions of the Deerfield Warrant. This warrant qualifies as a participating security under ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, and is treated as such in the net loss per share calculation (Note O). If a Major Transaction occurs (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement) Deerfield may require the Company to redeem the Deerfield Warrant for a cash amount equal to the Black-Scholes value of the portion of the Deerfield Warrant to be redeemed (the “Warrant Put Option”).
The Company recorded the fair value of the shares of Series D Preferred to debt issuance costs on the date of issuance. The Company also recorded the fair value of the Deerfield Warrant and the embedded Warrant Put Option to debt discount on the date of issuance. The debt issuance costs and debt discount are amortized over the term of the related debt and the expense is recorded as interest expense related to amortization of debt issuance costs and discount in the statements of operations.
Pursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement, the Company may not enter into specified transactions, including a debt financing in the aggregate value of $750,000 or more, other than permitted indebtedness under the Deerfield Facility Agreement, a merger, an asset sale or any other change of control transaction or any joint venture, partnership or other profit-sharing arrangement, without the prior approval of the Required Lenders (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement). Additionally, if the Company were to enter into a major transaction, including a merger, consolidation, sale of substantially all of its assets or other change of control transaction, Deerfield would have the ability to demand that prior to consummation of such transaction the Company repay all outstanding principal and accrued interest of any notes issued under the Deerfield Facility Agreement. Under each warrant issued pursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement, Deerfield has the right to demand that the Company redeem the warrant for a cash amount equal to the Black-Scholes value of a portion of the warrant upon the occurrence of specified events, including a merger, an asset sale or any other change of control transaction.
The Deerfield Facility Agreement also includes high yield discount obligation protections that went into effect in June 2019. Going forward, if at any interest payment date our outstanding indebtedness under the Deerfield Facility Agreement would qualify as an “applicable high yield discount obligation” under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the” Code”) then the Company is obligated to prepay in cash on each such date the amount necessary to avoid such classification.
Issuance of 5.50% Senior Convertible Notes and Third Amendment to Senior Secured Convertible Note and Warrant
In February 2016, the Company issued $86.3 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.50% Senior Convertible Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Notes”) to Cowen and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, as representatives of the several initial purchasers (the “Initial Purchasers”), who subsequently resold the 2021 Notes to qualified institutional buyers (the “Note Offering”) in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
The 2021 Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture, dated as of February 9, 2016 (the “Indenture”), between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”). Interest on the 2021 Notes was payable semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on August 1, 2016, at a rate of 5.50% per year. The 2021 Notes had an original maturity of February 1, 2021 unless earlier converted or repurchased.
The net proceeds from the Note Offering were approximately $82.8 million, after deducting the Initial Purchasers’ discount and estimated offering expenses. Concurrent with the Note Offering, the Company used approximately $18.6 million of the net proceeds from the Note Offering to repay in full the Term Note, plus all accrued but unpaid interest, a make-whole interest payment and a prepayment premium on the Term Note.
The 2021 Notes were not redeemable prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund was provided for the 2021 Notes. The 2021 Notes were convertible at an initial conversion rate of 58.4454 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, subject to adjustment under the Indenture, which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately $17.11 per share of common stock. After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the conversion rate of the 2021 Notes would be approximately 3.6528 shares of the Company’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes, which is equal to a conversion price of approximately $273.76 per share.
If the Company underwent a “fundamental change” (as defined in the Indenture), holders could have required that the Company repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2021 Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2021 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.
The Indenture included customary terms and covenants, including certain events of default after which the 2021 Notes may be due and payable immediately.
As described in more detail below, in multiple exchanges occurring in October 2018, December 2019 and January 2020, all outstanding 2021 Notes were exchanged by the holders thereof for either shares of our common stock or senior secured convertible promissory notes issued under the terms of the Deerfield Facility Agreement.
Facility Agreement Waiver and Fifth Amendment to Senior Secured Convertible Note
In June 2018, the Company entered into the Facility Agreement Waiver and Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to the Deerfield Convertible Note with Deerfield. The Fifth Amendment, among other things, provided that (i) $3,333,333 of the principal amount, plus $168,288 of accrued interest, of the Deerfield Convertible Note issued pursuant to the terms of the Deerfield Facility Agreement was converted into 37,410 shares of the Company’s common stock, with such principal conversion amount being applied against and in full satisfaction of the amortization payment due June 2, 2018; (ii) Deerfield waived specified rights under the Deerfield Facility Agreement with regards to such principal and interest amount; and (iii) amended specified provisions of the Deerfield Convertible Note as they relate to the delivery of shares of the Company’s common stock in connection with any conversion of the Deerfield Convertible Note.
2021 Note Exchange Effected in October 2018
In October 2018, the Company entered into an exchange agreement (the “October 2018 Exchange Agreement”) with Deerfield and Deerfield Special Situations Fund, L.P. (the “Deerfield Lenders”). Under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, the Deerfield Lenders exchanged an aggregate of $9,577,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes for an aggregate of 9,577 shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 (“Series A Preferred Stock”).
As a condition to closing of the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series A Certificate of Designation”) with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware, setting forth the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series A Preferred Stock.
Each share of Series A Preferred Stock has an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of common stock at a price equal to $3.00 per share (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events). Immediately following the exchange under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, there were an aggregate of 3,192,333 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described below). After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock would be $48.00 per share and shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock would be 199,519 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2020, all 9,577 shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement have been converted into an aggregate 199,519 shares of the Company’s common stock.
2021 Note Exchange Effected in September 2019
In September 2019, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement and Amendment to Facility Agreement (the “September 2019 Exchange Agreement”) with the Deerfield Lenders. Under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, the Company issued an aggregate of 93,742 shares of the Company’s common stock and an aggregate of 1,576 shares of the Company’s Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Series B-1 Preferred Stock”) (such shares of common stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the “Initial Exchange Shares”), in exchange for the cancellation of an aggregate of $3,000,000 principal amount of the Company’s 2021 Notes. The September 2019 Exchange Agreement provided the Deerfield Lenders the option to exchange up to an additional aggregate of $27,000,000 principal amount of the 2021 Notes (the “Optional Exchange Principal Amount”) for shares of common stock or shares of the Company’s Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Series B-2 Preferred Stock” and, together with the Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the “Series B Preferred Stock”), subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, including limits as to the principal amount that can be exchanged prior to specified dates therein. If the Deerfield Lenders choose to exchange any portion of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount for shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock, such exchange would be effected at an exchange price of $1,000 per share. If the Deerfield Lenders choose to exchange any portion of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount for shares of common stock, such exchange would be effected at an exchange price equal to the greater of (i) $0.9494, or (ii) the average of the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on the principal securities exchange or trading market on which the common stock is then trading on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange. After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the exchange price of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount would be $15.1904 or the average of the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on the principal securities exchange or trading market on which the common stock is then trading on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange.
As a condition to closing of the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B-1 Certificate of Designation”) and a Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B-2 Certificate of Designation”) with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware, setting forth the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock, respectively.
Each share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock has an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of common stock at a per share price equal to $0.9494 per share (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events). Immediately following the exchange under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, there were an aggregate of 1,659,996 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the then outstanding Series B-1 Preferred Stock (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described below). After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the conversion price of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock would be $15.1904 and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock would be 103,749 shares of common stock. Each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock has an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of common stock at a per share price equal to the greater of (i) $0.9494 (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events), or (ii) the average of the volume-weighted average prices of the common stock on the principal securities exchange or trading market on which the common stock is then trading on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange. Immediately following the exchange under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement there was an aggregate of 28,439,015 shares of Common Stock issuable (i) in exchange of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount, or (ii) upon conversion of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock issuable in exchange of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount (in each case without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described below). After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the conversion price of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock would be $15.1904 or the average of the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on the principal securities exchange or trading market on which the common stock is then trading on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange and the shares of stock issuable in exchange of the Optional Exchange Principal Amount or upon conversion of Series B-2 Preferred stock would be 1,777,437 shares of common stock.
The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Deerfield Lenders; provided that the Deerfield Lenders are prohibited from converting shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of common stock if, as a result of such conversion, such holders (together with certain affiliates and “group” members of such holders) would beneficially own more than 4.985% of the total number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding. The Series B Preferred Stock is not redeemable. In the event of the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Deerfield Lenders will receive an amount equal to $0.0001 per share, plus any declared but unpaid dividends, and thereafter will share ratably in any distribution of the Company’s assets with holders of common stock and with the holders of any shares of any other class or series of capital stock of the Company entitled to share in such remaining assets of the Company (including the Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis). With respect to rights upon liquidation, the Series B Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock, on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, if any is outstanding, and junior to existing and future indebtedness. Except as otherwise required by law (or with respect to approval of certain actions involving the Company’s organizational documents that materially and adversely affect the holders of Series B Preferred Stock), the Series B Preferred Stock does not have voting rights. The Series B Preferred Stock is not subject to any price-based anti-dilution protections and does not provide for any accruing dividends, but provides that holders of Series B Preferred Stock will participate in any dividends on the common stock on an as-converted basis (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described above). The Series B-1 Certificate of Designation and the Series B-2 Certificate of Designation also provide for partial liquidated damages in the event that the Company fails to timely convert shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock or Series B-2 Preferred Stock, respectively, into common stock in accordance with the applicable certificate of designation.
As of December 31, 2020, all 1,576 shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock issued under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement have been converted into an aggregate of 103,749 shares of common stock, and there were no shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock outstanding.
The September 2019 Exchange Agreement also amended the Deerfield Facility Agreement, in order to (i) reduce the interest rate applicable under the Deerfield Facility Agreement from 9.75% to 6.75%, (ii) provide for “payment in kind” of interest on the Loans (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement), and (iii) defer the Loan payments pursuant to the Deerfield Facility Agreement until June 1, 2020. The September 2019 Exchange Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by the Company and the Holders. The September 2019 Exchange Agreement also requires the Company to reimburse the Holders for up to $150,000 of expenses relating to the transactions contemplated by the September 2019 Exchange Agreement.
The Company determined the changes to the Deerfield Facility Agreement met the definition of a troubled debt restructuring under ASC 470-60, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Debtors, as the Company was experiencing financial difficulties and Deerfield granted a concession. The amendments to the terms of the Deerfield Facility Agreement resulted in no gain on restructuring because the total cash outflows required under the amended Deerfield Facility Agreement exceeded the carrying value of the original Deerfield Facility Agreement immediately prior to amendment. Prospectively, the Deerfield Facility Agreement, and the associated Deerfield Convertible Note will continue to be carried net of the associated discount and debt issuance costs which will be amortized and recorded as interest expense using a modified effective interest rate based on the amendments.
The changes to the 2021 Notes, under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, were accounted for as a debt modification with the $2.3 million change in fair value of the embedded conversion feature, associated with the Optional Exchange Principal Amount, recorded as an increase to additional paid in capital and as a debt discount to be amortized to interest expense under the effective interest method over the remaining term of the 2021 Notes.
2021 Note Exchange Effected in December 2019
In December 2019, the Company entered into the December 2019 Exchange Agreement and Amendment to Facility Agreement, Senior Secured Convertible Notes and Warrants (the “December 2019 Exchange Agreement”) with the Deerfield Lenders and Delaware Street Capital Master Fund, L.P. (“DSC” and, collectively with the Deerfield Lenders, the “December 2019 Holders”). Under the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, the Company issued senior secured convertible promissory notes under the Deerfield Facility Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $71,418,011 (the “December 2019 Notes”), in exchange for the cancellation of an aggregate of $71,418,011 principal amount and accrued interest of the Company’s 2021 Notes. Upon entering into the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to pay the December 2019 Holders, in the aggregate, an interest payment of $745,011 which represents 50% of the accrued interest, as of December 18, 2019, on the 2021 Notes owned by the December 2019 Holders. The remainder of such interest was included in the principal amount of the December 2019 Notes.
The December 2019 Notes bear interest at 6.75% per annum. The December 2019 Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at an initial conversion price of $17.11 per share (which represents the conversion price of the 2021 Notes), subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the December 2019 Notes. As of the date of issuance, the December 2019 Notes were convertible, by their terms, into an aggregate of 4,174,051 shares of the Company’s common stock. After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the conversion price of the December 2019 Notes would be $273.76 per share and the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon conversion of the December 2019 Notes would be 260,876 shares of common stock. The Company subsequently amended the December 2019 Notes to provide that such notes shall be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $93.60 per share (which represents the conversion price of the Deerfield Convertible Note). The conversion price of the December 2019 Notes will be adjusted downward if the Company issues or sells any shares of common stock, convertible securities, warrants or options at a sale or exercise price per share less than the greater of the December 2019 Notes’ conversion price or the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock on the last trading date immediately prior to such issuance, or, in the case of a firm commitment underwritten offering, on the date of execution of the underwriting agreement between the Company and the underwriters for such offering. However, if the Company effects an “at the market offering” as defined in Rule 415 of the Securities Act, of its common stock, the conversion price of the December 2019 Notes will be adjusted downward pursuant to this anti-dilution adjustment only if such sales are made at a price less than $93.60 per share, provided that this anti-dilution adjustment will not apply to any sales made under (x) the 2020 ELOC, (y) the ATM Agreement, or (z) the September 2019 Exchange Agreement (as amended). Notwithstanding anything in the contrary in the December 2019 Notes, the anti-dilution adjustment of such notes shall not result in the conversion price of the December 2019 Notes being less than $9.328 per share. The December 2019 Notes are convertible at any time at the option of the holders thereof, provided that a holder of a December 2019 Note is prohibited from converting such note into shares of the Company’s common stock if, as a result of such conversion, such holder (together with certain affiliates and “group” members) would beneficially own more than 4.985% of the total number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding. However, the December 2019 Note issued to DSC, due to the fact DSC was a beneficial owner of more than 4.985% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock then issued and outstanding, has a beneficial ownership cap equal to 19.985% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock then issued and outstanding. Pursuant to the December 2019 Notes, the December 2019 Holders have the option to demand repayment of all outstanding principal, and any unpaid interest accrued thereon, in connection with a Major Transaction (as defined in the December 2019 Notes), which shall include, among others, any acquisition or other change of control of the Company; a liquidation, bankruptcy or other dissolution of the Company; or if at any time after March 31, 2021, shares of the Company’s common stock are not listed on an Eligible Market (as defined in the December 2019 Notes). The December 2019 Notes are subject to specified events of default, the occurrence of which would entitle the December 2019 Holders to immediately demand repayment of all outstanding principal and accrued interest on the December 2019 Notes. Such events of default include, among others, failure to make any payment under the December 2019 Notes when due, failure to observe or perform any covenant under the Deerfield Facility Agreement (as defined below) or the other transaction documents related thereto (subject to a standard cure period), the failure of the Company to be able to pay debts as they come due, the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings against the Company, a material judgement levied against the Company and a material default by the Company under the Deerfield Warrant, the December 2019 Notes or the Deerfield Convertible Note.
The December 2019 Exchange Agreement amends the Deerfield Facility Agreement in order to, among other things, (i) provide for the Deerfield Facility Agreement to govern the December 2019 Notes received by the December 2019 Holders pursuant to the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, (ii) extend the maturity of the Deerfield Convertible Note from February 14, 2020 and June 1, 2020, as applicable, to March 31, 2021, (iii) defer interest payments on the Deerfield Convertible Note until March 31, 2021 (which such interest shall accrue as “payment-in-kind” interest), (iv) designate DSC as a Lender under (and as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement), (v) name Deerfield as the “Collateral Agent” for all Lenders and (vi) modify the terms and conditions under which the Company may issue additional pari passu and subordinated indebtedness under the Deerfield Facility Agreement (subject to certain conditions specified in the Deerfield Facility Agreement).
The December 2019 Exchange Agreement also amends and restates the Deerfield Convertible Note to conform the definitions of “Eligible Market” and “Major Transactions” to the definition in the December 2019 Notes, to remove provisions that were only applicable prior to the Company’s initial public offering and to make certain other changes to conform to the December 2019 Notes. The conversion price for the Deerfield Convertible Note remains $93.60 per share, subject to adjustment on the same basis as the December 2019 Notes.
The December 2019 Exchange Agreement also amends the Deerfield Warrant to conform the definitions of “Eligible Market” and “Major Transaction” in the Warrant with the definitions of such terms in the December 2019 Notes.
The December 2019 Exchange Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by the Company and the December 2019 Holders, including a covenant of the Company to, upon request, use commercially reasonable efforts to use its technology to discover a product based upon a compound that may be identified by the Deerfield Lenders in a manner that is reasonably acceptable to the Deerfield Lenders, or one of their affiliates, with the terms of such discovery plan, including the Company’s compensation thereunder, to be mutually agreed to by the parties.
In connection with entering into the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, on December 18, 2019, the Company amended and restated that certain Guaranty and Security Agreement, dated June 2, 2014, by and between the Company and the other parties thereto (the “GSA”) to, among other things, (i) provide that all of the notes will be secured by the liens securing the indebtedness under the Deerfield Facility Agreement, and (ii) name Deerfield as the “Collateral Agent” under the GSA.
In connection with entering into the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, the Company also entered into an amendment (the “September 2019 Exchange Agreement Amendment”) to the September 2019 Exchange Agreement to, among other things, (i) amend and restate Annex I of the September 2019 Exchange Agreement to allow the Deerfield Lenders to effect optional exchanges of the December 2019 Notes and the Deerfield Convertible Note under the terms of the September 2019 Exchange Agreement; (ii) amend the common stock exchange price under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement to be a per share price equal to the greater of (x) $0.60, subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events, or (y) the average of the volume-weighted average prices of the Company’s common stock on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange, (iii) provide that no more than 28,439,015 of shares of the Company’s common stock shall be issued pursuant to optional exchanges under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement (whether by common stock exchange or upon conversion of Series B-2 Shares (as defined in the September 2019 Exchange Agreement Amendment)), subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events and (iv) eliminate limitations regarding the timing and aggregate amount of principal which may be exchanged under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement. These changes in the September 2019 Exchange Agreement Amendment significantly modified the Optional Exchange Principal Amount, as such after giving effect to the September Exchange Agreement Amendment the Optional Exchange Principal Amount ceases to exist the new optional exchanges are referred to as the Deerfield Optional Conversion Feature. After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the exchange price of the Deerfield Optional Conversion Feature would be $9.60 per share or the average of the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on the principal securities exchange or trading market on which the common stock is then trading on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange and the shares of the Company’s common stock issued pursuant to the optional exchanges would be 1,777,437 shares of common stock.
In connection with entering into the September 2019 Amendment, the Company filed an amendment to the Series B-2 Certificate of Designation (the “Series B-2 Certificate of Designation Amendment”) with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware. The Series B-2 Certificate of Designation Amendment provides that each share of the Company’s Series B-2 preferred stock is convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a per share price equal to the common stock exchange price under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, which equals the greater of (i) $9.60 (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events), or (ii) the average of the volume-weighted average prices of the Company’s common stock on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange.
As of December 31, 2020, the Deerfield Lenders have converted $17.1 million of principal under the December 2019 Notes into all 1,777,437 shares of common stock available under the Deerfield Optional Conversion Feature.
The Company determined the changes to the Deerfield Convertible Note met the definition of a troubled debt restructuring under ASC 470-60, Troubled Debt Restructurings by Debtors, as the Company was experiencing financial difficulties and Deerfield granted a concession. The amendments to the terms of the Deerfield Convertible Note resulted in no gain on restructuring because the total cash outflows required under the amended Deerfield Convertible Note exceeded the carrying value of the original Deerfield Convertible Note immediately prior to amendment. Prospectively, the Deerfield Convertible Note will continue to be carried net of the associated discount and debt issuance costs which will be amortized and recorded as interest expense using a modified effective interest rate based on the amendments.
The changes to the 2021 Notes, under the December 2019 Exchange Agreement, referred to after as the December 2019 Notes, were accounted for as a debt modification, prospectively, the December 2019 Notes will be carried net of the associated discount and debt issuance costs which will be amortized and recorded as interest expense using a modified effective interest rate based on the amendments.
2021 Note Exchange Effected in January 2020
In January 2020, the Company entered into the January 2020 Exchange Agreement (the “January 2020 Exchange Agreement”) with M. Kingdon Offshore Master Fund, LP (“Kingdon”). Under the January 2020 Exchange Agreement, the Company issued a senior secured convertible note in the aggregate principal amount of $3,037,354 (the “January 2020 Note”) in exchange for the cancellation of an aggregate of $3,037,354 principal amount and accrued interest of the 2021 Note then owned by Kingdon. Upon entering into the January 2020 Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to pay Kingdon an interest payment of $37,354, which represents 50% of the accrued and unpaid interest, as of January 13, 2020, on Kingdon’s 2021 Note. The remainder of such interest was included in the principal amount of the January 2020 Note.
The January 2020 Note was issued with substantially the same terms and conditions as the December 2019 Notes (as amended by the amendment described in more detail below).
In connection with entering into the January 2020 Exchange Agreement, the Company entered into an Amendment to Facility Agreement and December 2019 Notes and Consent (the “December 2019 Note Amendment”) with the December 2019 Holders that, among other things, (i) amended the December 2019 Notes to (a) reduce the Conversion Price (as defined in the December 2019 Notes) from $17.11 to $5.85 per share and (b) increased the Floor Price (as defined in the December 2019 Notes) from $0.38 to $0.583 per share, and (ii) amended the Deerfield Facility Agreement to (x) provide for Kingdon to join the Deerfield Facility Agreement as a Lender (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement) and (y) provide that the 2020 Note and shall constitute a “Senior Secured Convertible Note” (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement) for purposes of the Deerfield Facility Agreement and other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Deerfield Facility Agreement). After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the Conversion Price became $93.60 per share and the Floor Price became $9.328 per share.

December 2020 Exchange Agreement and Amendment to Facility Agreement, Notes and Investors’ Rights Agreement
In December 2020, the Company entered into a December 2020 Exchange Agreement and Amendment to Facility Agreement, Notes and Investors’ Rights Agreement, as amended (the “December 2020 Exchange Agreement”) with the Deerfield Lenders, DSC and Kingdon (collectively, the “Facility Agreement Note Holders”). Under the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, the Company and the Facility Agreement Note Holders have agreed that (a) the Company will make a cash pre-payment of a portion of principal amount of the Deerfield Convertible Note, the December 2019 Notes and the January 2020 Note (collectively, the “Facility Agreement Notes”) to the Facility Agreement Note Holders (the “Debt Payment”) equal to approximately $30.3 million, plus accrued interest if such payment is made on or after January 1, 2021, and (b) subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions specified in the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, including the making of the Debt Payment, issue shares of its Series B-2 Preferred Stock and warrants exercisable for shares of its common stock (the “Exchange Warrants”), in exchange for the cancellation of a portion of the principal amount of the Facility Agreement Notes owned by the Facility Agreement Note Holders in an aggregate amount equal to the Debt Payment, plus the Q4 PIK Interest Payment (as defined in the December 2020 Exchange Agreement) (such transaction, the “December 2020 Exchange”).
The December 2020 Exchange Agreement amends the Facility Agreement Notes to provide that the failure of the Company’s common stock to remain listed on an eligible securities market will not constitute a “Major Transaction” unless such failure occurs after March 31, 2023.
Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions specified in the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, including the making of the Debt Payment and the consummation of the exchange, the December 2020 Exchange Agreement will amend that certain Facility Agreement dated as of June 2, 2014, as amended (the “Facility Agreement”), by and among the Company and the Facility Agreement Note Holders in order to, among other things, (i) extend the maturity date of the Facility Agreement Notes to March 31, 2023, (ii) provide for cash payments of interest on the Loans (as defined in the Facility Agreement) for the periods following July 1, 2021, and (iii) provide for specified prepayment terms on the Loans.

The Exchange Warrants to be issued pursuant to the December 2020 Exchange Agreement will be exercisable for a number of shares of the Company’s common stock equal to 75% of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock issued in the Exchange (without regard for any beneficial ownership limitations included therein). The Exercise Warrants will be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as the warrants issued to the public in the public offering of the Company’s securities contemplated pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1, file no. 333-250945 (the “Public Offering”), with an exercise price equal to the exercise price per share of the warrants issued in the Public Offering and will provide that the Facility Agreement Note Holders will be limited from exercising such Exchange Warrants if, as a result of such exercise, such holders (together with certain affiliates and “group” members of such holders) would beneficially own more than 4.985% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock then issued and outstanding.
The December 2020 Exchange Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants made by the Company and the Facility Agreement Note Holders party thereto, including a covenant of the Company for the benefit of the Facility Agreement Holders party to the Exchange Agreement to file a registration statement to register for resale under the Securities Act the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Exchange Warrants or conversion of the shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the terms of the December 2020 Exchange Agreement.

As a condition to closing of the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, the Company has agreed to file an Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Restated Series B-2 Certificate of Designation”) with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware, setting forth the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock.
Each share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock will have an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and will be convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a per share price equal to the price per share to the public of the Company’s common stock in the Public Offering (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events).
The Series B-2 Preferred Stock will be convertible at any time on or after the PDUFA Date (as defined in the Restated Series B-2 Certificate of Designation) at the option of the holders thereof; provided that the holders thereof will be prohibited from converting shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock into shares of the Company’s common stock if, as a result of such conversion, such holders (together with certain affiliates and “group” members of such Holders) would beneficially own more than 4.985% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock then issued and outstanding. The Series B-2 Preferred Stock will not be redeemable. In the event of the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up or a change in control of the Company (each, a “Liquidation Event”), the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock will receive, prior to any distribution or payment on our common stock, an amount equal to the greater of (i) $1,000 per share (in the case of a change in control, transaction consideration with such value), or (ii) the amount (in the case of a change in control, in the form of the transaction consideration) per share each such holder would have been entitled to receive if every share of Series B-2 Preferred Stock had been converted into common stock immediately prior to such Liquidation Event, in each case, plus any declared but unpaid dividends thereon. With respect to rights upon liquidation, the Series B-2 Preferred Stock will rank senior to the common stock, on parity with any Parity Securities (as defined in the Restated Series B-2 Certificate of Designation) and junior to existing and future indebtedness. Except as otherwise required by law (or with respect to approval of certain actions involving the Company’s organizational documents that adversely affect the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock and other specified matters regarding the rights, preferences and privileges of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock), the Series B-2 Preferred Stock will not have voting rights. The Series B-2 Preferred Stock will not be subject to any price-based anti-dilution protections and will not provide for any accruing dividends, but provides that holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock will participate in any dividends on the Company’s common stock on an as-converted basis (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described above). The Restated Series B-2 Certificate of Designation will also provide for partial liquidated damages in the event that the Company fails to timely convert shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock into common stock in accordance with the Restated Series B-2 Certificate of Designation.
Debt Restructuring
In anticipation of the Public Offering (as defined and discussed in further detail in Note R), and to meet the Nasdaq Listing Requirements, the Company agreed in December 2020 to restructure the December 2019 Notes and the January 2020 Note in the aggregate principal amount of $60.8 million and the Deerfield Note in the principal amount of $7.5 million (collectively the "the Facility Notes"). The total outstanding principal and accrued interest under the Facility Notes was $69.4 million as of December 31, 2020.
Under the terms of the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, the Company, on January 12, 2021, in connection with the closing of the Public Offering:
● Exchanged $31.5 million of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Facility Notes for (i) 31,476.98412 shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock, and (ii) Exchange Warrants exercisable for 3,632,019 shares of the Company's common stock, and
● Made a payment of $30.3 million (the "Debt Payment"), in partial repayment of the remaining outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Facility Notes.
Following the completion of these transactions, the aggregate balance of principal and accrued interest remaining outstanding under the Facility Notes was approximately $7.6 million. With respect to this remaining outstanding balance under the Facility Notes, the December 2020 Exchange Agreement amended the terms of that debt to provide that:
● The maturity date was changed to March 31, 2023, and the debt is prepayable upon specified conditions, and
● Interest would accrue at the rate of 6.75% per annum, payable quarterly, would be added to principal until June 30, 2021, and then be payable in cash thereafter.
Based on the above transactions which occurred after the balance sheet date of December 31, 2020, but prior to the issuance of the financial statement the Company reclassified the entire $68.2 million of convertible notes, and the associated debt issuance costs and discounts, from current to long-term on the balance sheet.
Payoff of Facility Agreement Notes and Termination of Facility Agreement
On February 8, 2021, the Company entered into a payoff letter with the Facility Note holders to pay off and thereby terminate the Deerfield Facility Agreement.
Pursuant to the payoff letter, the Company paid a total of $8.0 million to the Facility Note holders, representing the total principal balance and accrued interest outstanding and a prepayment fee in repayment of our outstanding obligations under the Deerfield Facility Agreement.
For further discussion of the Debt Restructuring and the payoff of the Facility Notes and termination of the Deerfield Facility Agreement refer to Note R.
PPP Loan
On April 23, 2020, the Company received proceeds of $0.8 million from the PPP Loan under the PPP of the recently enacted CARES Act, a portion of which may be forgiven, which the Company used to retain current employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments. The PPP Loan matures on April 23, 2022 and bears annual interest at a rate of 1.0%. Payments of principal and interest on the PPP Loan were originally deferred for the first six months of the PPP Loan term. Thereafter, the Company would have been required to pay the lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest. As of December 31, 2020, $0.4 million of the PPP Loan is recorded on the balance sheet in current portion of loans payable and $0.4 million is recorded in loan payable, less current portion.
The CARES Act and the PPP provide a mechanism for forgiveness of up to the full amount borrowed. Under the PPP, the Company may apply for and be granted forgiveness for all or part of the PPP Loan. The amount of loan proceeds eligible for forgiveness was originally based on a formula that takes into account a number of factors, including the amount of loan proceeds used by the Company during the eight-week period after the loan origination for certain purposes, including payroll costs, interest on certain mortgage obligations, rent payments on certain leases, and certain qualified utility payments, provided that at least 75% of the loan amount was used for eligible payroll costs. Subject to the other requirements and limitations on loan forgiveness, only loan proceeds spent on payroll and other eligible costs during the covered eight-week period would have qualified for forgiveness.
On June 5, 2020, President Trump signed into law the PPP Flexibility Act of 2020 (the “Flexibility Act”), which among other things provided the following important changes to the PPP:
●
Extended the covered period for loan forgiveness from eight weeks after the date of loan disbursement to 24 weeks after the date of loan disbursement, providing substantially greater flexibility for borrowers to qualify for loan forgiveness. Borrowers who had already received PPP loans retained the option to use an eight-week covered period.
●
Lowered the requirements that 75 percent of a borrower’s loan proceeds must be used for payroll costs and that 75 percent of the loan forgiveness amount must have been spent on payroll costs during the 24-week loan forgiveness covered period to 60 percent for each of these requirements. If a borrower uses less than 60 percent of the loan amount for payroll costs during the forgiveness covered period, the borrower will continue to be eligible for partial loan forgiveness, subject to at least 60 percent of the loan forgiveness amount having been used for payroll costs.
●
Provided a safe harbor from reductions in loan forgiveness based on reductions in full-time equivalent employees for borrowers that are unable to return to the same level of business activity the business was operating at before February 15, 2020, due to compliance with requirements or guidance issued between March 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, related to worker or customer safety requirements related to COVID-19.
●
Provided a safe harbor from reductions in loan forgiveness based on reductions in full-time equivalent employees, to provide protections for borrowers that are both unable to rehire individuals who were employees of the borrower on February 15, 2020, and unable to hire similarly qualified employees for unfilled positions by December 31, 2020.
●
Increased to five years the maturity of PPP loans that are approved by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the “SBA”) (based on the date SBA assigns a loan number) on or after June 5, 2020.
●
Extended the deferral period for borrower payments of principal, interest, and fees on PPP loans to the date that SBA remits the borrower’s loan forgiveness amount to the lender (or, if the borrower does not apply for loan forgiveness, 10 months after the end of the borrower’s loan forgiveness covered period).
Based on the changes provided by the Flexibility Act the Company plans to take advantage of (i) the extended covered period for loan forgiveness from eight weeks to 24 weeks, (ii) the lowered requirement that a certain percentage of loan proceeds must be used for payroll costs from 75 percent to 60 percent, (iii) the extended deferral period for payments of principal, interest and fees from six months after loan disbursement to 10 months after the SBA remits the borrower’s loan forgiveness amount to the lender and (iv) take advantage of an safe harbor provisions as applicable. The Company will be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, in accordance with the amortization schedule described above. Based on the changes provided by the Flexibility Act the Company expects that substantially all of the PPP loan will be forgiven, however, the Company cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be eligible for loan forgiveness or that any amount of the PPP Loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA.
Letters of Credit
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has one irrevocable letter of credit supporting certain finance lease agreements. This letter of credit is guaranteed by a money market account which is reported as restricted cash on the balance sheet.

Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Matters
From time to time, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. For some matters, a liability is not probable, or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and, therefore, an accrual has not been made. However, for such matters when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability and can reasonably estimate the amount, the Company accrues and discloses such estimates. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no accruals have been made related to commitments and contingencies.
Lease Agreements
We have operating and finance leases for office space, laboratory facilities and various laboratory equipment, furniture and office equipment and leasehold improvements. Our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 5 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to 5 years, and some which include options to terminate the leases within 1 year.
Florida
The Company leases office space in Florida, comprised of two contiguous office suites, under non-cancelable operating leases, which expire in August 2025 and February 2026, as to each space respectively, and include the right to extend the term of the leases for two successive five-year terms upon expiration. In February 2020, the Company agreed to sublease office space in Florida, comprised of one of the two contiguous suites, under a non-cancelable operating lease, which expires in February 2026. In October, 2020, the Company agreed to terminate this sublease in exchange for a termination fee.
Iowa
The Company leases office and laboratory facilities in Iowa under a non-cancelable operating lease. The Company’s lease for its Iowa facilities expires in September 2021 and includes a renewal option that could extend the lease for successive one-year terms upon expiration.
Virginia
The Company leases office and laboratory facilities in Virginia under a non-cancelable operating lease. The Company’s lease for its Virginia facilities expires in August 2021.
North Carolina
The Company leased office space in North Carolina under a non-cancelable operating lease. The original expiration date of the Company’s lease was May 2020. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company subleased its office space in North Carolina under a non-cancelable operating lease to a third-party tenant. The sublease term with the third-party runs concurrent with the lease term the Company has with the landlord. In October 2019, the Company terminated the head lease with the landlord and the sublease with the subtenant so that the landlord and subtenant could enter directly into a lease.
In March 2020, the Company leased office space in North Carolina under a non-cancelable operating lease. The Company's lease for its North Carolina facilities expires in March 2022.
Finance Lease
The Company leases various laboratory equipment, furniture and office equipment and leasehold improvements that are accounted for as finance leases and that require ongoing payments, including interest expense. The finance leases are financed through various financial institutions and are collateralized by the underlying assets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the interest rates for assets under remaining finance leases range from 7.19% to 14.34%.
The components of lease expense were as follows (in thousands):
Rent expense for non-cancelable operating leases was $0.6 million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows (in thousands):

Supply Arrangement
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company has one manufacturing arrangement that involves potential future expenditures related to research and development.
In November 2009, the Company entered into a supply agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) with Johnson Matthey Inc. (“JMI”) whereby JMI has agreed to supply the Company with all of the benzhydrocodone necessary for clinical trials and commercial sale for a price equal to JMI’s manufacturing cost and to provide process optimization and development services for benzhydrocodone. The Company’s FDA-approved drug, APADAZ, contains benzhydrocodone. Expense of $3.2 million was recorded under this agreement for the year ended December 31, 2019. The expense under this agreement for the year ended December 31, 2020 was negligible. The Company must purchase all of its U.S. benzhydrocodone needs from JMI and JMI cannot supply benzhydrocodone to other companies. The term of the Supply Agreement extends as long as the Company holds a valid and enforceable patent for benzhydrocodone or until the tenth anniversary of a commercial launch of a FDA-approved drug incorporating benzhydrocodone, whichever date is later. Upon the expiration of such term, the agreement will automatically renew for a period of two years unless either party provides 12 months prior notice of its intent not to renew. Under the agreement, JMI will receive a tiered-based royalty share on the net sales on the commercial sale of a FDA-approved drug incorporating benzhydrocodone. No reliable estimate of the future payments can be made at this time.

Preferred Stock and Warrants
Authorized, Issued, and Outstanding Preferred Stock
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had 10,000,000 shares of authorized preferred stock, of which 9,578 shares were designated as Series A Preferred Stock, 1,576 shares were designated as Series B-1 Preferred Stock and 27,000 shares were designated as Series B-2 Preferred Stock. Of the designated preferred stock 9,577 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 1,576 shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock were issued as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. No shares of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B-1 Preferred Stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. No shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock were issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
In October 2018, the Company entered into the October 2018 Exchange Agreement. Under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement the Company issued to the Holders 9,577 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock has an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and is convertible into shares of common stock at a price equal to $3.00 per share (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events). Immediately following the exchange under the October 2018 Exchange Agreement, there were an aggregate of 3,192,333 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described below), and as of December 31, 2020 all issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock had been converted into shares of common stock. After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock would be $48.00 and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred stock would be 199,519 shares of common stock.
In September 2019, the Company entered into the September 2019 Exchange Agreement. Under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement the Company issued to the Holders 1,576 shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock. Each share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock had an aggregate stated value of $1,000 and was convertible into shares of common stock at a price equal to the greater of (i) $0.9494, or (ii) the average of the volume-weighted average price of the Common Stock on the principal securities exchange or trading market on which the common stock is then trading on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange (subject to adjustment to reflect stock splits and similar events). Immediately following the exchange under the September 2019 Exchange Agreement, there were an aggregate of 1,659,996 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described below). After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the conversion price of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock would be $15.1904 or the average of the volume-weighted average price of the common stock on the principal securities exchange or trading market on which the common stock is then trading on each of the 15 trading days immediately preceding such exchange and the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock would be 103,749 shares of common stock. The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible at any time at the option of the Holders; provided that the Holders are prohibited from converting shares of Series B Preferred Stock into shares of common stock if, as a result of such conversion, such Holders (together with certain affiliates and “group” members of such Holders) would beneficially own more than 4.985% of the total number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding. The Series B Preferred Stock is not redeemable. In the event of the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Holders will receive an amount equal to $0.0001 per share, plus any declared but unpaid dividends, and thereafter will share ratably in any distribution of the Company’s assets with holders of common stock and with the holders of any shares of any other class or series of capital stock of the Company entitled to share in such remaining assets of the Company (including Series A Preferred Stock on an as-converted basis. With respect to rights upon liquidation, the Series B Preferred Stock ranks senior to the common stock, on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock, if any is then outstanding, and junior to existing and future indebtedness. Except as otherwise required by law (or with respect to approval of certain actions involving the Company’s organizational documents that materially and adversely affect the holders of Series B Preferred Stock), the Series B Preferred Stock does not have voting rights. The Series B Preferred Stock is not subject to any price-based anti-dilution protections and does not provide for any accruing dividends, but provides that holders of Series B Preferred Stock will participate in any dividends on the common stock on an as-converted basis (without giving effect to the limitation on conversion described above). The Series B-1 Certificate of Designation and the Series B-2 Certificate of Designation also provide for partial liquidated damages in the event that the Company fails to timely convert shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock or Series B-2 Preferred Stock, respectively, into Common Stock in accordance with the applicable Certificate of Designation. As of December 31, 2020 all issued shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock have been converted into shares of common stock.
As a condition to closing of the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, the Company has agreed to file the Restated Series B-2 Certificate of Designation with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware, setting forth the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock. Refer to Note G for further discussion.

Common Stock Activity
The following table summarizes common stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Warrants
On June 2, 2014, pursuant to the terms of the Deerfield Facility Agreement, the Company issued the Deerfield Warrant to purchase 14,423,076 shares of Series D Preferred (Note J). The Company recorded the fair value of the Deerfield Warrant as a debt discount and a warrant liability. The Deerfield Warrant, if unexercised, expires on the earlier of June 2, 2024, or upon a liquidation event. Upon completion of the Company’s initial public offering (the “IPO”), the Deerfield Warrant automatically converted into a warrant to purchase 1,923,077 shares of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $5.85 per share. After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the exercise price of the Deerfield Warrant became $93.60 and the shares of the Company’s common stock issuable upon exercise of the Deerfield Warrant became 120,192 shares of common stock. As a result of the Warrant Inducement transaction on January 26, 2021 (refer to Note R) the anti-dilution provisions within this Warrant were triggered and the exercise price was reduced from $93.60 per share to $46.25 per share. The Company is amortizing the debt discount over the term of the Deerfield Convertible Note and the expense is recorded as interest expense related to amortization of debt issuance costs and discount in the statements of operations.
The Company determined that the Deerfield Warrant should be recorded as a liability and stated at fair value at each reporting period upon inception. As stated above, upon completion of the IPO, the Deerfield Warrant automatically converted into warrants to purchase the Company’s common stock. The Deerfield Warrant remains classified as a liability and is recorded at fair value at each reporting period since it can be settled in cash. Changes to the fair value of the warrant liability are recorded through the unaudited condensed statements of operations as a fair value adjustment (Note M).
In connection with a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “APADAZ License Agreement”) with KVK Tech, Inc. (“KVK”), in October 2018, the Company issued to KVK a warrant to purchase up to 500,000 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $2.30 per share, which reflected the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the execution date of the APADAZ License Agreement (the “KVK Warrant”). The KVK Warrant is initially not exercisable for any shares of common stock. Upon the achievement of each of four specified milestones under the KVK Warrant, the KVK Warrant will become exercisable for an additional 125,000 shares, up to an aggregate of 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. The exercise price and the number and type of shares underlying the KVK Warrant are subject to adjustment in the event of specified events, including a reclassification of the Company’s common stock, a subdivision or combination of the Company’s common stock, or in the event of specified dividend payments. The KVK Warrant is exercisable until October 24, 2023. Upon exercise, the aggregate exercise price may be paid, at KVK’s election, in cash or on a net issuance basis, based upon the fair market value of the Company’s common stock at the time of exercise. After giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split effected in December 2020, the exercise price of the KVK Warrant became $36.80 and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the KVK Warrant became 31,250 shares of common stock.
The Company determined that, since KVK qualifies as a customer under ASC 606, the KVK Warrant should be recorded as a contract asset and recognized as contra-revenue as the Company recognizes revenue from the APADAZ License Agreement. In addition, the Company determined that the KVK Warrant qualifies as a derivative under ASC 815 and should be recorded as a liability and stated at fair value each reporting period. The Company calculates the fair value of the KVK Warrant using a probability-weighted Black-Scholes option pricing model. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in the inputs to the Black Scholes model are accounted for as changes in the fair value of the derivative under ASC 815 and are recorded as fair value adjustment related to derivative and warrant liability in the statements of operations. Changes in the number of shares that are expected to be issued are treated as changes in variable consideration under ASC 606 and are recorded as a change in contract asset in the balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, a contract asset of $0.4 million is recorded in other long-term assets on the balance sheets related to the KVK Warrant.
L.
Stock-Based Compensation
The Company maintains a stock-based compensation plan (the “Incentive Stock Plan”) that governs stock awards made to employees and directors prior to completion of the IPO.
In November 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company ("the Board"), and in April 2015, the Company’s stockholders, approved the Company’s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”), which became effective in April 2015. The 2014 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, other forms of equity compensation, and performance cash awards. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued under the 2014 Plan is 408,167 as of December 31, 2020. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 2016, and ending on and including January 1, 2024, by 4% of the total number of shares of the Company’s capital stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or a lesser number of shares determined by the Board. Pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Plan, on January 1, 2021, the common stock reserved for issuance under the 2014 Plan automatically increased by 181,492 shares.
During 2020, the Company granted to certain consultants fully vested restricted stock awards (“RSAs”) under the 2014 Plan. The RSAs were granted as compensation in accordance with each consultants consulting agreement for services performed during 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, RSAs were granted for a total of 10,247 shares of common stock.
During 2019, the Company granted to each non-employee member of the Company’s board of directors (each a “non-employee Director”) two separate fully vested RSAs under the 2014 Plan. The RSAs were granted in lieu of the quarterly cash compensation payable under the Company’s Third Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy to each non-employee Director for service as a member of the Company’s board of directors, and applicable committees thereof, for the first and second quarters of 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, RSAs were granted for a total of 5,104 shares of common stock. In addition, the Company granted to a consultant fully vested RSAs under the 2014 Plan. The RSAs were granted as compensation in accordance with the consultant's consulting agreement for services performed during 2019.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, stock options to acquire 279 shares of common stock were exercised for approximately $2,000 with an intrinsic value of approximately $1,000. During the year ended December 31, 2019 no stock options were exercised.
Stock-based compensation expense recorded under the Incentive Stock Plan and the 2014 Plan is included in the following line items in the accompanying statements of operations (in thousands):
Stock Option Awards
The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option, the expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option. The expected term represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding. Due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected term of the stock options, the Company uses the simplified method to estimate the expected term for its “plain vanilla” stock options. Under the simplified method, the expected term of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term. Some options, for example those that have exercise prices in excess of the fair value of the underlying stock, are not considered “plain vanilla” stock options. For these options, the Company uses an expected term equal to the contractual term of the option. Expected volatility for options granted prior to the second anniversary of the IPO is based on a blend of historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies and the Company over the estimated expected term of the stock options. For options granted after the second anniversary of the IPO, expected volatility is based on the Company’s historical volatility over the estimated expected term of the stock options. The Company assumes no dividend yield because dividends are not expected to be paid in the near future, which is consistent with the Company’s history of not paying dividends.
The Company recognizes compensation expense related to stock-based payment transactions upon satisfaction of the requisite service or vesting requirements. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised based on actual forfeitures, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
Using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the weighted-average fair value of awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, fair value was $5.00 and $22.88 per share, respectively. The assumptions used to estimate fair value are as follows:
The activity under the Incentive Stock Plan and the 2014 Plan for the year ended December 31, 2020, is summarized as follows:
Information regarding currently outstanding and exercisable options as of December 31, 2020, is as follows:
The total fair value of stock options vested during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $3.7 million and $4.9 million, respectively.
Unvested stock options as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, were as follows:
As of December 31, 2020, there was $1.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the 2014 Plan. That compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.72 years.
There was $0.3 million of stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based awards recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020. There was no stock-based compensation expense related to performance-based awards recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019.
M.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their respective fair values due to the short-term nature of such instruments.
The fair value of the Deerfield Convertible Note was $7.3 million and $6.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The fair value of the December 2019 Notes was $56.2 million and $57.0 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The fair value of the January 2020 Note was $3.1 million as of December 31, 2020 and the fair value of the 2021 Notes was $2.4 million as of December 31, 2019. The Deerfield Convertible Note, December 2019 Notes, January 2020 Note and 2021 Notes fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as their value is based on the credit worthiness of the Company, which is an unobservable input. The Company used a Tsiveriotis-Fernandes model to value the Deerfield Convertible Note and December 2019 Notes as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company also used a Tsiveriotis-Fernandes model to value the January 2020 Note as of December 31, 2020 and the 2021 Notes as of December 31, 2019.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The Company evaluates its financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis to determine the appropriate level in which to classify them for each reporting period. This determination requires significant judgments to be made. The following table summarizes the conclusions reached regarding fair value measurements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (in thousands):
The Company’s Deerfield Warrant liability, embedded Warrant Put Option, embedded Deerfield Note Put Option and the fundamental change and the make-whole interest provisions embedded in the 2021 Notes are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Deerfield Warrant liability, embedded Warrant Put Option and the embedded Deerfield Note Put Option are reported on the balance sheets in derivative and warrant liability. The Company used a Monte Carlo simulation to value the Deerfield Warrant liability, embedded Warrant Put Option and the embedded Deerfield Note Put Option as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Company also used a Monte Carlo simulation to value the fundamental change and make-whole interest provisions embedded in the 2021 Notes as of December 31, 2019. Significant unobservable inputs used in measuring the fair value of these financial instruments included the Company’s estimated enterprise value, an estimate of the timing of a liquidity or fundamental change event and a present value discount rate. Changes in the fair value of the Deerfield Warrant liability, embedded Warrant Put Option and the embedded Deerfield Note Put Option are reflected in the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as a fair value adjustment related to derivative and warrant liability. In addition, changes in the fair value of the fundamental change and make-whole interest provisions embedded in the 2021 Notes are reflected in the statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as a fair value adjustment related to derivative and warrant liability.
The derivative liability for the Deerfield Warrant was $230,000 and $77,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The derivative liability for the embedded Warrant Put Option was $25,000 and $19,000 at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The derivative liability for the Deerfield Note Conversion Feature had no value at December 31, 2020 or 2019, respectively. A 10% increase in the enterprise value would result in an increase of $29,000 in the estimated fair value of the Deerfield Warrant liability, an increase of $8,000 in the estimated fair value of the embedded Warrant Put Option liability and no change in the estimated fair value of the Deerfield Note Conversion Feature liability. In addition, the Company assumed a weighted-average probability of a liquidity event occurring of approximately 87% with an estimated probability-weighted value of approximately $45.3 million and a weighted-average probability of a fundamental change event occurring of approximately 47% with an estimated probability-weighted value of approximately $200 million, respectively, with estimated timing in each scenario of Q1 2021. The Company also assumed a present value discount rate of approximately 27% in its analysis, which approximates the estimated credit spread of the Company at the date of the latest debt financing event which is most closely related to relative notes.
The Company’s KVK Warrant liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the KVK Warrant liability is reported on the balance sheets in derivative and warrant liability. The Company estimates the fair value of the KVK Warrant using a probability-weighted Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the warrant, the expected stock price volatility, expected dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the warrant. The expected term represents the period of time the warrant is expected to be outstanding. For the KVK Warrant, the Company used an expected term equal to the contractual term of the warrant. Expected volatility is based on the Company's historical volatility since the IPO. The Company assumes no dividend yield because dividends are not expected to be paid in the near future, which is consistent with the Company’s history of not paying dividends. Changes in the fair value of the KVK Warrant liability are reflected in the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 as a fair value adjustment related to derivative and warrant liability.
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances for the derivative and warrant liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) is as follows (in thousands):

Income Taxes
The Company’s financial statements include a total state tax benefit related to research and development credits of $34,000 and $22,000 on a loss before income taxes of approximately $12.8 million and $24.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A reconciliation of the difference between the benefit for income taxes and income taxes at the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate is as follows (in thousands, except amounts pertaining to rate which are shown as a percentage):
The components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows (in thousands):
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will not realize the benefits of these deductible differences in the future.
The Company had the following federal net operating loss carryforward and research activities credits as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands):
The Company also has certain state net operating loss carryforwards totaling $211.3 million, $145.4 million of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2027 and $65.9 million of which have no expiration date. Due to potential ownership changes that may have occurred or would occur in the future, Internal Revenue Code Section 382 may place additional limitations on the Company’s ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforward.
ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, uses the term “more likely than not” to evaluate whether or not a tax position will be sustained upon examination. The Company has not identified any tax positions that do not meet the more likely than not threshold.
On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted into law in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company has evaluated the various income and payroll tax provisions and expects little or no impact to income tax expense.
O.
Net Loss Per Share
Under the two-class method, for periods with net income, basic net income per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net income attributable to shares of common stock by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Net income attributable to shares of common stock is computed by subtracting from net income the portion of current period earnings that participating securities would have been entitled to receive pursuant to their dividend rights had all of the period’s earnings been distributed. No such adjustment to earnings is made during periods with a net loss as the holders of the participating securities have no obligation to fund losses. Diluted net loss per share of common stock is computed under the two-class method by using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the potential dilutive effects of stock options and warrants. In addition, the Company analyzes the potential dilutive effect of the outstanding convertible securities under the if-converted method when calculating diluted loss per share of common stock in which it is assumed that the outstanding convertible securities convert into common stock at the beginning of the period or date of issuance, if the convertible security was issued during the period. The Company reports the more dilutive of the approaches (two-class or if-converted) as its diluted net loss per share of common stock during the period.
The following table summarizes the computation of basic and diluted net loss and net loss per share of common stock of the Company (in thousands, except share and per share amounts):
Diluted net loss per share of common stock is the same as basic net loss per share of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 because the effects of potentially dilutive items were anti-dilutive for the respective periods. The following securities, presented on a common stock equivalent basis, have been excluded from the calculation of weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding because their effect is anti-dilutive:
* Balance as of December 31, 2019 is inclusive of 1,652,437 shares of Common Stock issuable (i) in exchange of the Deerfield Optional Conversion Feature, or (ii) upon conversion of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock issuable in exchange of the Deerfield Optional Conversion Feature. As of December 31, 2020, the Deerfield Optional Conversion Feature has been utilized in full.
P.
Severance Expense
In February 2020, the Company eliminated the chief business officer role and Gordon K. Johnson separated from the Company. In connection with his separation, Mr. Johnson is entitled to severance benefits as documented in his Amended and Restated Employment Agreement entered into in June 2015. The severance benefits consist of personnel and other related charges of approximately $0.4 million and stock compensation expense of approximately $0.4 million related to the acceleration of vesting on unvested shares subject to certain stock options. These severance benefits are presented as severance expense in the statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had accrued severance expense recorded within accounts payable and accrued expenses in the amount of $0.1 million. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, there was no accrued severance or severance expense, respectively.
Q.
Employee Benefit Plan
The Company has a 401(k) retirement plan (the “401(k) Plan”) that covers substantially all employees. The Company may provide a discretionary match with a maximum amount of 4% of the participant’s compensation, which vests immediately. The Company made matching contributions under the 401(k) Plan of $145,000 and $133,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The Company has a discretionary profit sharing plan (the “Profit Sharing Plan”) that covers all employees. Employees become eligible participants in the Profit Sharing Plan once they have provided three years of service to the Company. The Company made no contributions to the Profit Sharing Plan in 2020 or 2019.
R. Subsequent Events
Underwriting Agreement
On January 8, 2021, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) with Roth Capital Partners, LLC (the “Underwriter” or "Roth"), to issue and sell 6,765,463 shares of common stock of the Company, pre-funded warrants to purchase 926,844 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 7,692,307 shares of common stock at an exercise price per share of $6.50 in an underwritten public offering (the “Public Offering”) pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-250945) and a related prospectus, in each case filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The offering price to the public is $6.50 per share of common stock and accompanying warrant, representing a public offering price of $6.4999 per share of common stock and $0.0001 per related warrant. In addition, the Company granted the Underwriter an option to purchase, for a period of 45 days, up to an additional 1,153,846 shares of the Company’s common stock and/or warrants to purchase up to an additional 1,153,846 shares of the Company’s common stock.
On January 8, 2021, the Underwriter exercised its over-allotment option, in part, for warrants to purchase 754,035 shares of the Company’s common stock. Further on February 1, 2021, the Underwriter again exercised its over-allotment option to purchase 374,035 shares of common stock. On February 3, 2021, we closed the underwriter's partial exercise of its over-allotment option.
On January 12, 2021, the Company closed the Public Offering. The aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Public Offering, including over-allotment, totaled approximately $52.4 million, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company.
Pre-Funded Warrants
On January 12, 2021, pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company issued pre-funded warrants to purchase 926,844 shares of the Company’s common stock to specified investors in the Public Offering.
Duration and Exercise Price
Each pre-funded warrant has an initial exercise price per share equal to $0.0001. The pre-funded warrants will be immediately exercisable and will not expire prior to exercise. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise is subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of stock dividends, stock splits, reorganizations or similar events affecting the Company’s common stock.
Exercisability
The pre-funded warrants are exercisable, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part, by delivering to the Company a duly executed exercise notice accompanied by payment in full for the number of shares of common stock purchased upon such exercise (except in the case of a cashless exercise as discussed below). A holder (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of the pre-funded warrant to the extent that the holder would own more than 4.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock immediately after exercise, except that upon at least 61 days’ prior notice from the holder to the Company, the holder may increase the amount of beneficial ownership of outstanding stock after exercising the holder’s pre-funded warrants up to 9.99% of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise, as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the pre-funded warrants and Delaware law. Purchasers of pre-funded warrants may also elect prior to the issuance of the pre-funded warrants to have the initial exercise limitation set at 9.99% of the Company’s outstanding common stock.
Cashless Exercise
In lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to the Company upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, the holder may elect instead to receive upon such exercise (either in whole or in part) the net number of shares of common stock determined according to a formula set forth in the pre-funded warrants.
Rights as a Stockholder
Except as otherwise provided in the pre-funded warrants or by virtue of such holder’s ownership of shares of the Company’s common stock, the holders of the pre-funded warrants do not have the rights or privileges of holders of common stock with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the pre-funded warrants, including any voting rights, until they exercise their pre-funded warrants. The pre-funded warrants provide that holders have the right to participate in distributions or dividends paid on the Company’s common stock.
Fundamental Transaction
In the event of a fundamental transaction, as described in the pre-funded warrants and generally including any reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification of the Company’s common stock, the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company’s properties or assets, the Company’s consolidation or merger with or into another person, the acquisition of more than 50% of the Company’s outstanding common stock, or any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of 50% of the voting power represented by the Company’s outstanding common stock, the holders of the pre-funded warrants will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the pre-funded warrants the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that the holders would have received had they exercised the pre-funded warrants immediately prior to such fundamental transaction.
As of March 11, 2021, all pre-funded warrants have been exercised for 926,841 shares of common stock and gross proceeds of approximately $72.
Warrants to Purchase Common Stock
On January 12, 2021, pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement and December 2020 Exchange Agreement (as defined below), the Company issued warrants to purchase 12,078,361 shares of the Company’s common stock (collectively, the “Warrants”) in the Public Offering and in connection with the transactions contemplated under the December 2020 Exchange Agreement.
Duration and Exercise Price
The Warrants are exercisable from and after the date of their issuance and expire on the fifth anniversary of such date, at an exercise price per share of common stock equal to $6.50 per share. The holder of a Warrant will not be deemed a holder of the underlying common stock until the Warrant is exercised. No fractional shares of common stock will be issued in connection with the exercise of Warrant. Instead, for any such fractional share that would have otherwise been issued upon exercise of a Warrant, the Company will round such fraction up to the next whole share.
Exercisability
The Warrants will be exercisable, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part, by delivering to the Company a duly executed exercise notice, provided that payment in full for the number of shares of the Company’s common stock purchased upon such exercise is delivered to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Warrants (except in the case of a cashless exercise as discussed below). A holder (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of the Warrant to the extent that the holder and its affiliates and any other person or entities with which such holder would constitute a Section 13(d) “group” would own more than 4.985% of the Company’s outstanding common stock immediately after exercise.
Cashless Exercise
If, at the time a holder exercises its Warrants, a registration statement registering the issuance of the shares of common stock underlying such Warrant under the Securities Act is not then effective or available for the issuance of such shares, then in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to the Company upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, the holder may elect instead to receive upon such exercise (either in whole or in part) the net number of shares of common stock determined according to a formula set forth in the Warrants.
Right as a Stockholder
Except as otherwise provided in the Warrants or by virtue of such holder’s ownership of shares of the Company’s common stock, the holders of the Warrants do not have the rights or privileges of holders of common stock with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the Warrants, including any voting rights, until they exercise their Warrants. The Warrants provide that holders have the right to participate in distributions or dividends paid on the Company’s common stock.
Fundamental Transaction
In the event of a fundamental transaction, as described in the Warrants and generally including any reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification of the Company’s common stock, the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company’s properties or assets, the Company’s consolidation or merger with or into another person, the acquisition of more than 50% of the Company’s outstanding common stock, or any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of 50% of the voting power represented by the Company’s outstanding common stock, the holders of the Warrants will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the Warrants the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that the holders would have received had they exercised the Warrants immediately prior to such fundamental transaction. In addition, in the event of a fundamental transaction which is approved by the Company’s board of directors, the holders of the warrants have the right to require the Company or a successor entity to redeem the Warrants for cash in the amount of the Black Scholes value of the unexercised portion of the Warrants on the date of the consummation of the fundamental transaction. In the event of a fundamental transaction which is not approved by the Company’s board of directors, the holders of the Warrants have the right to require the Company or a successor entity to redeem the Warrants in the amount of the Black Scholes value of the unexercised portion of the Warrants on the date of the consummation of the fundamental transaction payable in the form of consideration paid to the holders of common stock in such fundamental transaction.
As of March 11, 2021, 3,057,395 Warrants have have been exercised for 2,626,418 shares of common stock and gross proceeds of approximately $14.3 million. These amounts are exclusive of the Warrants exercised as part of the Warrant Exercise Inducement transaction discussed below.
Underwriter Warrant
On January 12, 2021, pursuant to the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Company issued to the Underwriter a warrant to purchase 806,932 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Underwriter Warrant”). The Underwriter Warrant is subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as the Warrants, provided that the exercise price for the Underwriter Warrant is $8.125 per share. If the Underwriter exercises any additional portion of its over-allotment option, then the Company shall issue the Underwriter an additional Underwriter Warrant exercisable for a number of shares of common stock equal to 5.0% of the number of shares of common stock issued in such over-allotment exercise (including the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of any Warrants issued in connection therewith). In connection with the closing of the Underwriter's partial exercise of its over-allotment option, on February 3, 2021, the Underwriter was issued an additional warrant to purchase 18,702 shares of common stock. As of March 11, 2020, no Underwriter Warrants have been exercised.
December 2020 Exchange Agreement Amendment
On January 12, 2021, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, the Company entered into an Amendment to Senior Secured Convertible Notes and Amendment to Warrant (the “January 2021 Amendment”) with the Deerfield Holders. The January 2021 Amendment modifies certain specified terms of (i) the Facility Notes and (ii) the Deerfield Warrant to, among other things, exclude the transactions contemplated by the December 2020 Exchange Agreement and issuance of securities pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement from the anti-dilution provisions of the Facility Notes and the Deerfield Warrant.
Series B-2 Preferred Stock
Pursuant to the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, on January 12, 2021, the Company issued to the Facility Note Holders an aggregate of 31,476.98412 shares of its Series B-2 Preferred Stock and warrants exercisable for an aggregate of 3,632,019 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “Exchange Warrants”).
The Series B-2 Preferred Stock is convertible into an aggregate of 4,842,690 shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to $6.4999.
Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of the Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock
On January 11, 2021, as a condition to closing of the transactions contemplated by the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, the Company filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and Limitations of Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B-2 Certificate of Designation”) with the Secretary of State of the State Delaware, setting forth the preferences, rights and limitations of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock.
Immediately following, the closing of the Public Offering, pursuant to the terms of the December 2020 Exchange Agreement, the Company:
●
Exchanged approximately $31.5 million (the "Exchange") of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Facility Notes for (i) the Series B-2 Preferred Stock and (ii) the Exchange Warrants; and
●
made a payment of approximately $30.3 million (the “Debt Payment”) in partial repayment of the remaining outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Facility Notes.
Immediately following the completion of the Exchange and Debt Payment, the aggregate balance of principal and accrued interest remaining outstanding under the Facility Notes was approximately $7.6 million.
Upon the closing of the Exchange and related Debt Payment, the amendments to the Facility Agreement, the Notes and the Investors’ Rights Agreement, dated as of February 19, 2015, by and among the Company, Deerfield and the other parties signatory thereto, contemplated by the December 2020 Exchange Agreement that were conditional upon, among other things, the closing of the Public Offering, the filing of the Series B-2 Certificate of Designation and/or the approval for listing of the Company’s common stock, including the shares issuable upon conversion of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock and exercise of the Exchange Warrants, on the Nasdaq Capital Market, became effective on January 12, 2021.
As of March 11, 2021, all shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock have have been converted into 4,842,699 shares of common stock.
Listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market
On January 7, 2021, the Company’s common stock was approved for listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company’s common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on January 8, 2021 under the ticker symbol “KMPH”.
Warrant Exercise Inducement Letters and Issuance of Warrants
On January 26, 2021, the Company entered into warrant exercise inducement offer letters (“Inducement Letters”) with certain holders of warrants issued in the Public Offering discussed above (the "Existing Warrants") (collectively, the “Exercising Holders”) pursuant to which such holders agreed to exercise for cash their Existing Warrants to purchase 6,620,358 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for the Company’s agreement to issue new warrants (the “Inducement Warrants”) on substantially the same terms as the Existing Warrants, except as set forth in the following sentence, to purchase up to 7,944,430 shares of the Company’s common stock, which is equal to 120% of the number of shares of the Company’s common stock issued upon exercise of the Existing Warrants. The purchase price of the Inducement Warrants was $0.125 per share underlying each Inducement Warrant, and the Inducement Warrants have an exercise price of $6.36 per share. The Company received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $44.0 million from the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Exercising Holders and the sale of the Inducement Warrants. The Company engaged Roth as its exclusive placement agent in connection with these transactions and paid Roth a fee equal to 6% of gross proceeds from the exercise of the Existing Warrants by the Exercising Holders and the sale of the Inducement Warrants. As a result of this transaction the anti-dilution provisions contained with the Deerfield Warrant were triggered and the exercise price of the Deerfield Warrant was reduced from $93.60 per share to $46.25 per share.
The Company also agreed to file a registration statement covering the resale of the shares of the Company’s common stock issued or issuable upon the exercise of the Inducement Warrants no later than 10 calendar days following the date of the Inducement Letters.
Inducement Warrant Terms
Duration and Exercise Price
The Inducement Warrants are exercisable from and after the date of their issuance and expire on the fifth anniversary of such date, at an exercise price per share of common stock equal to $6.36 per share. The holder of an Inducement Warrant will not be deemed a holder of the underlying common stock until the Inducement Warrant is exercised. No fractional shares of common stock will be issued in connection with the exercise of the Inducement Warrants. Instead, for any such fractional share that would have otherwise been issued upon exercise of an Inducement Warrant, the Company will round such fraction up to the next whole share.
Exercisability
The Inducement Warrants will be exercisable, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part, by delivering to the Company a duly executed exercise notice, provided that payment in full for the number of shares of the Company’s common stock purchased upon such exercise is delivered to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Inducement Warrants (except in the case of a cashless exercise as discussed below). A holder (together with its affiliates) may not exercise any portion of the Inducement Warrant to the extent that the holder and its affiliates and any other person or entities with which such holder would constitute a Section 13(d) “group” would own more than 4.99% (or, upon election by a holder prior to the issuance of its Inducement Warrants, 9.99%) of the Company’s outstanding common stock immediately after exercise.
Cashless Exercise
If, at the time a holder exercises its Inducement Warrants, a registration statement registering the issuance of the shares of common stock underlying such Inducement Warrant under the Securities Act is not then effective or available for the issuance of such shares, then in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to the Company upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, the holder may elect instead to receive upon such exercise (either in whole or in part) the net number of shares of common stock determined according to a formula set forth in the Inducement Warrants.
Right as a Stockholder
Except as otherwise provided in the Inducement Warrants or by virtue of such holder’s ownership of shares of the Company’s common stock, the holders of the Inducement Warrants do not have the rights or privileges of holders of common stock with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the Inducement Warrants, including any voting rights, until they exercise their Inducement Warrants. The Inducement Warrants provide that holders have the right to participate in distributions or dividends paid on the Company’s common stock.
Fundamental Transaction
In the event of a fundamental transaction, as described in the Inducement Warrants and generally including any reorganization, recapitalization or reclassification of the Company’s common stock, the sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company’s properties or assets, the Company’s consolidation or merger with or into another person, the acquisition of more than 50% of the Company’s outstanding common stock, or any person or group becoming the beneficial owner of 50% of the voting power represented by the Company’s outstanding common stock, the holders of the Inducement Warrants will be entitled to receive upon exercise of the Inducement Warrants the kind and amount of securities, cash or other property that the holders would have received had they exercised the Inducement Warrants immediately prior to such fundamental transaction. In addition, in the event of a fundamental transaction which is approved by the Company’s board of directors, the holders of the Inducement Warrants have the right to require the Company or a successor entity to redeem the Inducement Warrants for cash in the amount of the Black Scholes value of the unexercised portion of the Inducement Warrants on the date of the consummation of the fundamental transaction. In the event of a fundamental transaction which is not approved by the Company’s board of directors, the holders of the Inducement Warrants have the right to require the Company or a successor entity to redeem the Inducement Warrants in the amount of the Black Scholes value of the unexercised portion of the Warrants on the date of the consummation of the fundamental transaction payable in the form of consideration paid to the holders of common stock in such fundamental transaction.
As of March 11, 2021, 1,676,921 Inducement Warrants have have been exercised for 1,676,921 shares of common stock and gross proceeds of approximately $10.7 million.
Payoff of Facility Agreement Notes and Termination of Facility Agreement
On February 8, 2021, the Company entered into a payoff letter with the Facility Agreement Note Holders, pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay off and thereby terminate the Facility Agreement.
Pursuant to the payoff letter, the Company paid a total of $8.0 million to the Facility Agreement Note Holders, representing the principal balance, accrued interest outstanding and a prepayment fee in repayment of the Company’s outstanding obligations under the Facility Agreement.
Pursuant to the payoff letter, all outstanding indebtedness and obligations of the Company owing to the Facility Agreement Note Holders under the Facility Agreement have been paid in full. The Facility Agreement and the notes thereunder, as well as the security interests in the assets of the Company securing the Facility Agreement and note obligations, have been terminated. The Facility Agreement Note Holders will retain the warrants previously issued to them by the Company.
FDA Approval of the AZSTARYS NDA
On March 2, 2021, the Company announced that the FDA approved the NDA for AZSTARYS™ (serdexmethylphenidate and dexmethylphenidate capsules, for oral use, CII), a once-daily product for the treatment of ADHD in patients age six years and older. As a result of the FDA’s approval of the AZSTARYS NDA, the Company has earned a regulatory milestone payment as provided under the KP415 License Agreement.
