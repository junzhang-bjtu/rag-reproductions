REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of SuRo Capital Corp.
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities of SuRo Capital Corp. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) including the consolidated schedule of investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows, and changes in net assets for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the financial highlights (presented in Note 8) for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the financial highlights for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Basis for Opinion
These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, by correspondence with the custodian, loan agents, and borrowers; when replies were not received, we performed other auditing procedures. We believe that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) related to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Valuation of Investments - Level 3 Investments in Preferred Stock and Common Stock
As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, approximately 41% of the Company’s $431 million total investments in securities as of December 31, 2020 represents investments in level 3 common stock and preferred stock issued by private companies whose fair value, as disclosed by management, is determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Management applied significant judgment in determining the fair value of these level 3 investments, which involved the use of significant unobservable inputs with respect to the revenue and/or other multiples utilized, discounts rates and precedent transactions.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of level 3 investments in preferred stock and common stock is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment involved by management in determining the fair value of these level 3 investments, including the use of various valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing audit procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained relating to the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial highlights. Our principle audit procedures included, among others,
(i) testing the completeness and accuracy of management’s valuations, including evaluating the appropriateness of management’s methodologies, evaluating the reasonableness of assumptions and significant unobservable inputs; including revenue and/or other multiples utilized, discounts rates and precedent transactions and;
(ii) the involvement of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge to assist in the assessment of the fair values for a sample of investments, including reviewing the valuation methodologies, assessing the assumptions utilized in developing the estimates, and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s conclusions in deriving the valuations.

The table below displays the Company’s subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020, which, other than GSV Capital Lending, LLC (“GCL”), are collectively referred to as the “Taxable Subsidiaries.” The Taxable Subsidiaries were formed to hold portfolio investments. The Taxable Subsidiaries, including their associated portfolio investments, are consolidated with the Company for accounting purposes, but have elected to be treated as separate entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes. GCL was formed to originate portfolio loan investments within the state of California and is consolidated with the Company for accounting purposes.

The Company’s investment objective is to maximize its portfolio’s total return, principally by seeking capital gains on its equity and equity-related investments, and to a lesser extent, income from debt investments. The Company invests principally in the equity securities of what it believes to be rapidly growing venture-capital-backed emerging companies. The Company may acquire its investments in these portfolio companies through: offerings of the prospective portfolio companies, transactions on secondary marketplaces for private companies, or negotiations with selling stockholders. In addition, we may invest in private credit and in the founders equity, founders warrants, forward purchase agreements, and private investment in public equity transactions of special purpose acquisition companies. The Company may also invest on an opportunistic basis in select publicly traded equity securities or certain non-U.S. companies that otherwise meet its investment criteria, subject to any applicable limitations under the 1940 Act.
SURO CAPITAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2020
NOTE 2-SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The Company is an investment company following the specialized accounting and reporting guidance specified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, all of which were of a normal recurring nature, were considered necessary for the fair presentation of consolidated financial statements for the period have been included.
Basis of Consolidation
Under Article 6 of Regulation S-X and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”) Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies, the Company is precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company, a controlled operating company that provides substantially all of its services and benefits to the Company, and certain entities established for tax purposes where the Company holds a 100% interest. Accordingly, the Company’s consolidated financial statements include its accounts and the accounts of the Taxable Subsidiaries and GCL, its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the Company’s management to make a number of significant estimates. These include estimates of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities and other estimates that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reporting period. It is likely that changes in these estimates will occur in the near term. The Company’s estimates are inherently subjective in nature and actual results could differ materially from such estimates.
Uncertainties and Risk Factors
The Company is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties in the nature of its operations, as well as vulnerability due to certain concentrations. Refer to "Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the nature of the Company’s operations. Refer to “Note 4-Investments at Fair Value” for an overview of the Company’s industry and geographic concentrations.
Investments at Fair Value
The Company applies fair value accounting in accordance with GAAP and the AICPA’s Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies. The Company values its assets on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the 1940 Act.
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a framework for measuring fair value that includes a hierarchy used to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level 1-Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
SURO CAPITAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2020
Level 2-Valuations based on observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3-Valuations based on unobservable inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. The majority of the Company’s investments are Level 3 investments and are subject to a high degree of judgment and uncertainty in determining fair value.
When the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. For example, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable (Level 3). Therefore, gains and losses for such assets and liabilities categorized within the Level 3 table set forth in “Note 4-Investments at Fair Value” may include changes in fair value that are attributable to both observable inputs (Levels 1 and 2) and unobservable inputs (Level 3).
A review of fair value hierarchy classifications is conducted on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification for certain financial assets or liabilities. Reclassifications impacting Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are reported as transfers in/out of the Level 3 category as of the beginning of the measurement period in which the reclassifications occur. Refer to “Levelling Policy” below for a detailed discussion of the levelling of the Company’s financial assets or liabilities and events that may cause a reclassification within the fair value hierarchy.
Securities for which market quotations are readily available on an exchange are valued at the most recently available closing price of such security as of the valuation date, unless there are legal or contractual restrictions on the sale or use of such security that under ASC 820-10-35 should be incorporated into the security’s fair value measurement as a characteristic of the security that would transfer to market participants who would buy the security. The Company may also obtain quotes with respect to certain of its investments from pricing services, brokers or dealers in order to value assets. When doing so, the Company determines whether the quote obtained is sufficient according to GAAP to determine the fair value of the security. If determined to be adequate, the Company uses the quote obtained.
Securities for which reliable market quotations are not readily available or for which the pricing source does not provide a valuation or methodology, or provides a valuation or methodology that, in the judgment of management, our Board of Directors or the valuation committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Valuation Committee”), does not reliably represent fair value, shall each be valued as follows:
1. The quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment;
2. Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management;
3. An independent third-party valuation firm is engaged by the Valuation Committee to conduct independent appraisals and review management’s preliminary valuations and make its own independent assessment, for all investments for which there are no readily available market quotations;
4. The Valuation Committee discusses the valuations and recommends to the Company’s Board of Directors a fair value for each investment in the portfolio based on the input of management and the independent third-party valuation firm; and
5. The Company’s Board of Directors then discusses the valuations recommended by the Valuation Committee and determines in good faith the fair value of each investment in the portfolio.
SURO CAPITAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2020
In making a good faith determination of the fair value of investments, the Company considers valuation methodologies consistent with industry practice. Valuation methods utilized include, but are not limited to the following: comparisons to prices from secondary market transactions; venture capital financings; public offerings; purchase or sales transactions; as well as analysis of financial ratios and valuation metrics of the portfolio companies that issued such private equity securities to peer companies that are public, analysis of the portfolio companies’ most recent financial statements and forecasts, and the markets in which the portfolio company does business, and other relevant factors. The Company assigns a weighting based upon the relevance of each method to determine the fair value of each investment.
For investments that are not publicly traded or that do not have readily available market quotations, the Valuation Committee generally engages an independent valuation firm to provide an independent valuation, which the Company’s Board of Directors considers, among other factors, in making its fair value determinations for these investments. For the current and prior fiscal year, the Valuation Committee engaged an independent valuation firm to perform valuations of 100% of the Company’s investments for which there were no readily available market quotations.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company’s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, these estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been reported had a ready market for the investments existed, and it is reasonably possible that the difference could be material.
In addition, changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the realized gains or losses on investments to be different from the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation currently reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
Equity Investments
Equity investments for which market quotations are readily available in an active market are generally valued at the most recently available closing market prices and are classified as Level 1 assets. Equity investments with readily available market quotations that are subject to sales restrictions due to an initial public offering (“IPO”) by the portfolio company will be classified as Level 1. Any other equity investments with readily available market quotations that are subject to sales restrictions that would transfer to market participants who would buy the security may be valued at a discount for a lack of marketability (“DLOM”), to the most recently available closing market prices depending upon the nature of the sales restriction. These investments are generally classified as Level 2 assets. The DLOM used is generally based upon the market value of publicly traded put options with similar terms.
The fair values of the Company’s equity investments for which market quotations are not readily available are determined based on various factors and are classified as Level 3 assets. To determine the fair value of a portfolio company for which market quotations are not readily available, the Company may analyze the relevant portfolio company’s most recently available historical and projected financial results, public market comparables, and other factors. The Company may also consider other events, including the transaction in which the Company acquired its securities, subsequent equity sales by the portfolio company, and mergers or acquisitions affecting the portfolio company. In addition, the Company may consider the trends of the portfolio company’s basic financial metrics from the time of its original investment until the measurement date, with material improvement of these metrics indicating a possible increase in fair value, while material deterioration of these metrics may indicate a possible reduction in fair value.
In determining the value of equity or equity-linked securities (including warrants to purchase common or preferred stock) in a portfolio company, the Company considers the rights, preferences and limitations of such securities. In cases where a portfolio company’s capital structure includes multiple classes of preferred and common stock and equity-linked securities with different rights and preferences, the Company may use an option pricing model to allocate value to each equity-linked security, unless it believes a liquidity event such as an acquisition or a dissolution is imminent, or the portfolio company is unlikely to continue as a going concern. When equity-linked securities expire worthless, any cost associated with these positions is recognized as a realized loss on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In the event these securities are exercised into common or preferred stock, the cost associated with these securities is
SURO CAPITAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2020
reassigned to the cost basis of the new common or preferred stock. These conversions are noted as non-cash operating items on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Debt Investments
Given the nature of the Company’s current debt investments (excluding U.S. Treasuries), principally convertible and promissory notes issued by venture-capital-backed portfolio companies, these investments are classified as Level 3 assets because there is no known or accessible market or market indexes for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. The Company’s debt investments are valued at estimated fair value as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors.
Options
The Company’s Board of Directors will ascribe value to options based on fair value analyses that can include discounted cash flow analyses, option pricing models, comparable analyses and other techniques as deemed appropriate. These investments are classified as Level 3 assets because there is no known or accessible market or market indexes for these investment securities to be traded or exchanged. The Company’s options are valued at estimated fair value as determined by the Company’s Board of Directors.
Portfolio Company Investment Classification
The Company is a non-diversified company within the meaning of the 1940 Act. The Company classifies its investments by level of control. As defined in the 1940 Act, control investments are those where there is the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company. Control is generally deemed to exist when a company or individual directly or indirectly owns beneficially more than 25% of the voting securities of an investee company. Affiliated investments and affiliated companies are defined by a lesser degree of influence and are deemed to exist when a company or individual directly or indirectly owns, controls or holds the power to vote 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a portfolio company. Refer to the Consolidated Schedules of Investments as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, for details regarding the nature and composition of the Company’s investment portfolio.
Levelling Policy
The portfolio companies in which the Company invests may offer their shares in IPOs. The Company’s shares in such portfolio companies are typically subject to lock-up agreements for 180 days following the IPO. Upon the IPO date, the Company transfers its investment from Level 3 to Level 1 due to the presence of an active market, or Level 2 if limited by the lock-up agreement. The Company prices the investment at the closing price on a public exchange as of the measurement date. In situations where there are lock-up restrictions, as well as legal or contractual restrictions on the sale or use of such security that under ASC 820-10-35 should be incorporated into the security’s fair value measurement as a characteristic of the security that would transfer to market participants who would buy the security, the Company will classify the investment as Level 2 subject to an appropriate DLOM to reflect the restrictions upon sale. The Company transfers investments between levels based on the fair value at the beginning of the measurement period in accordance with FASB ASC 820. For investments transferred out of Level 3 due to an IPO, the Company transfers these investments based on their fair value at the IPO date.
Securities Transactions
Securities transactions are accounted for on the date the transaction for the purchase or sale of the securities is entered into by the Company (i.e., trade date). Securities transactions outside conventional channels, such as private transactions, are recorded as of the date the Company obtains the right to demand the securities purchased or to collect the proceeds from a sale and incurs an obligation to pay for securities purchased or to deliver securities sold, respectively.
Valuation of Other Financial Instruments
The carrying amounts of the Company’s other, non-investment financial instruments, consisting of cash, receivables, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature.
SURO CAPITAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2020
Cash
The Company places its cash with U.S. Bank, N.A., Bridge Bank (a subsidiary of Western Alliance Bank), and Silicon Valley Bank, and at times, cash held in these accounts may exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limit. The Company believes that U.S. Bank, N.A., Western Alliance Bank, and Silicon Valley Bank are high-quality financial institutions and that the risk of loss associated with any uninsured balance is remote.
Escrow Proceeds Receivable
A portion of the proceeds from the sale of portfolio investments are held in escrow as a recourse for indemnity claims that may arise under the sale agreement. Amounts held in escrow are held at estimated realizable value and included in net realized gains (losses) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the period in which they occurred and are adjusted as needed. Any remaining escrow proceeds balances from these transactions reasonably expected to be received are reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as escrow proceeds receivable. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had $852,462 and $265,303, respectively, in escrow proceeds receivable.
Deferred Financing Costs
The Company records origination costs related to lines of credit as deferred financing costs. These costs are deferred and amortized as part of interest expense using the straight-line method over the respective life of the line of credit. For modifications to a line of credit, any unamortized origination costs are expensed. Included within deferred financing costs are offering costs incurred relating to the Company’s shelf registration statement on Form N-2. The Company defers these offering costs until capital is raised pursuant to the shelf registration statement or until the shelf registration statement expires. For equity capital raised, the offering costs reduce paid-in capital resulting from the offering. For debt capital raised, the associated offering costs are amortized over the life of the debt instrument. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had deferred financing costs of $297,196 and $11,382, respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.
Operating Leases & Related Deposits
The Company accounts for its operating leases as prescribed by ASC 842, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize a right of use asset on the balance sheet, representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a corresponding lease liability for all leases with terms greater than 12 months. The lease expense is presented as a single lease cost that is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Non-lease components (maintenance, property tax, insurance and parking) are not included in the lease cost. On June 3, 2019, the Company entered a 5-year operating lease for primary office space for which the Company has recorded a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for the operating lease obligation. These amounts have been discounted using the rate implicit in the lease. Refer to “Note 7-Commitments and Contingencies-Operating Leases and Related Deposits” for further detail.
Stock-based Compensation
Using the fair value recognition provisions as prescribed by ASC 718, Stock Compensation, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the appropriate service period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards requires considerable judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options and the expected volatility of our stock price. Differences between actual results and these estimates could have a material effect on our financial results. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. Refer to “Note 11-Stock-Based Compensation” for further detail.

Revenue Recognition
The Company recognizes gains or losses on the sale of investments using the specific identification method. The Company recognizes interest income, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, on an accrual basis. The Company recognizes dividend income on the ex-dividend date.
Investment Transaction Costs and Escrow Deposits
Commissions and other costs associated with an investment transaction, including legal expenses not reimbursed by the portfolio company, are included in the cost basis of purchases and deducted from the proceeds of sales. The Company makes certain acquisitions on secondary markets, which may involve making deposits to escrow accounts until certain conditions are met, including the underlying private company’s right of first refusal. If the underlying private company does not exercise or assign its right of first refusal and all other conditions are met, then the funds in the escrow account are delivered to the seller and the account is closed. Such transactions would be reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as escrow deposits. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had no material escrow deposits.
Unrealized Appreciation or Depreciation of Investments
Unrealized appreciation or depreciation is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the investment and the cost basis of such investment.
U.S. Federal and State Income Taxes
The Company elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (a “RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2014, has qualified to be treated as a RIC for subsequent taxable years and intends to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. To qualify for tax treatment as a RIC, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of the sum of investment company taxable income (“ICTI”) including payment-in-kind interest income, as defined by the Code, and net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of its gross tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions) for each taxable year (the "Annual Distribution Requirement"). Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to carry forward into the next tax year ICTI in excess of current year dividend distributions. Any such carryforward ICTI must be distributed on or before December 31 of the subsequent tax year to which it was carried forward.
If the Company meets the Annual Distribution Requirement, but does not distribute (or is not deemed to have distributed) each calendar year a sum of (1) 98% of its net ordinary income for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of its capital gain net income for the one-year period ending October 31 in that calendar year and (3) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years (the “Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement”), it generally will be required to pay an excise tax equal to 4% of the amount by which the Excise Tax Avoidance Requirement exceeds the distributions for the year. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will exceed estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income, the Company will accrue excise taxes, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned using an annual effective excise tax rate. The annual effective excise tax rate is determined by dividing the estimated annual excise tax by the estimated annual taxable income.
So long as the Company qualifies and maintains its tax treatment as a RIC, it generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal and state income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that it distributes at least annually to its stockholders as dividends. Rather, any tax liability related to income earned by the RIC will represent obligations of the Company’s investors and will not be reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Taxable Subsidiaries are taxable subsidiaries, regardless of whether the Company is a RIC. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expenses as a result of their ownership of the portfolio companies. Such income tax expenses and deferred taxes, if any, will be reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
SURO CAPITAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2020
If it is not treated as a RIC, the Company will be taxed as a regular corporation (a “C corporation”) under Subchapter C of the Code for such taxable year. If the Company has previously qualified as a RIC but is subsequently unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, and certain amelioration provisions are not applicable, the Company would be subject to tax on all of its taxable income (including its net capital gains) at regular corporate rates. The Company would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would it be required to make distributions. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to its stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate stockholders would be eligible to claim a dividend received deduction with respect to such dividend; non-corporate stockholders would generally be able to treat such dividends as “qualified dividend income,” which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of the Company’s current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. In order to requalify as a RIC, in addition to the other requirements discussed above, the Company would be required to distribute all of its previously undistributed earnings attributable to the period it failed to qualify as a RIC by the end of the first year that it intends to requalify for tax treatment as a RIC. If the Company fails to requalify for tax treatment as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, it may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of its assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if the Company had been liquidated) that it elects to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five years. The Company was taxed as a C Corporation for its 2012 and 2013 taxable years. Refer to “Note 9-Income Taxes” for further details.
The Company elected to be treated as a RIC for the taxable year ended December 31, 2014 in connection with the filing of its 2014 tax return. As a result, the Company was required to pay a corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on the amount of the net built-in gains in its assets (the amount by which the net fair market value of the Company’s assets exceeds the net adjusted basis in its assets) either (1) as of the date it converted to a RIC (i.e., the beginning of the first taxable year that the Company qualifies as a RIC, which would be January 1, 2014), or (2) to the extent that the Company recognized such net built-in gains during the five-year recognition period beginning on the date of conversion. As of January 1, 2014, the Company had net unrealized built-in gains, but did not incur a built-in-gains tax for the 2014 tax year due to the fact that there were sufficient net capital loss carryforwards to completely offset recognized built-in gains as well as available net operating losses. The five-year recognition period ended on December 31, 2018.
Per Share Information
Net change in net assets resulting from operations per basic common share is computed using the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period presented. Diluted net change in net assets resulting from operations per common share is computed by dividing net increase/(decrease) in net assets resulting from operations for the period adjusted to include the pre-tax effects of interest incurred on potentially dilutive securities, by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus any potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. The Company used the if-converted method in accordance with FASB ASC 260, Earnings Per Share (“ASC 260”) to determine the number of potentially dilutive shares outstanding. Refer to “Note 6-Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations per Common Share-Basic and Diluted” for further detail.
Recently Issued or Adopted Accounting Standards
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), which is intended to improve fair value and defined benefit disclosure requirements by removing disclosures that are not cost beneficial, clarifying disclosures' specific requirements, and adding relevant disclosure requirements. The amendments took effect for all organizations for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted the eliminated and modified disclosure requirements during the year ended December 31, 2020. No significant changes to the fair value disclosures were necessary in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in order to comply with ASU 2018-13.
In August 2018, the SEC issued Final Rule Release No. 33-10532, Disclosure Update and Simplification, amending certain disclosure requirements intended to eliminate redundant, duplicative, overlapping, outdated or superseded, in light of other SEC
SURO CAPITAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2020
disclosure requirements, U.S. GAAP requirements, or changes in the information environment. In part, this final rule requires an investment company to present distributable earnings in total on the consolidated balance sheet, rather than showing the three components of distributable earnings as previously required. The Company decided not to adopt this change as the current, more detailed and expanded disclosure presentation was deemed to be most helpful, useful, and transparent for users of our consolidated financial statements. The impact of the adoption of this amendment on the Company's consolidated financial statements would not be material. Additionally, the final rule requires disclosure of changes in net assets within a registrant's Form 10-Q filing on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis for both the current year and prior year comparative periods.
In March 2020, the SEC adopted a final rule under SEC Release No. 34-88365 ("SEC Rule 12b-2 Update"), amending the accelerated filer and large accelerated filer definitions in Exchange Act Rule 12b-2. The amendments include a provision under which a BDC will be excluded from the “accelerated filer” and “large accelerated filer” definitions if the BDC has (1) a public float of $75.0 million or more, but less than $700.0 million, and (2) has annual investment income of less than $100.0 million. In addition, BDCs are subject to the same transition provisions for accelerated filer and large accelerated filer status as other issuers, but instead substituting investment income for revenue. The amendments will reduce the number of issuers required to comply with the auditor attestation on the internal control over financial reporting requirement provided under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. SEC Rule 12b-2 Update applies to annual report filings due on or after April 27, 2020. The adoption of this rule has resulted in the Company no longer being an accelerated filer. The Company is also not required to comply with the auditor attestation on the internal control over financial reporting requirement provided under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
In May 2020, the SEC adopted rule amendments that will impact the requirement of investment companies, including BDCs, to disclose the financial statements of certain of their portfolio companies or acquired funds (the “Final Rules”). The Final Rules adopted a new definition of “significant subsidiary” set forth in Rule 1-02(w)(2) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. Rules 3-09 and 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X require investment companies to include separate financial statements or summary financial information, respectively, in such investment company’s periodic reports for any portfolio company that meets the definition of “significant subsidiary.” The Final Rules amend the definition of “significant subsidiary” in a manner that is intended to more accurately capture those portfolio companies that are more likely to materially impact the financial condition of an investment company. The Final Rules will be effective on January 1, 2021, but voluntary compliance is permitted in advance of the effective date. The Company has elected to comply in advance of the effective date for the year ended December 31, 2020. The adoption of this rule has an impact on the consolidated financial statements in that far fewer subsidiaries require disclosure under the Final Rules as compared to the previous rules.
In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, Codification Improvements, which made various technical changes and corrections intended to provide clarifications to existing guidance, as well as simplifications to wording or structure of existing guidance. The amendments in Sections B and C are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, for public business entities. Early application of the amendments in this Update is permitted for public business entities for any annual or interim period for which financial statements have not been issued. The Company did not early adopt the modified disclosure requirements during the year ended December 31, 2020, but is evaluating the guidance of our adoption upon its effective date.
From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standards setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. The Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards and any that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements upon adoption.
NOTE 3-RELATED-PARTY ARRANGEMENTS
Internalization of Company’s Operating Structure
On and effective March 12, 2019 (the "Effective Date"), our Board of Directors approved internalizing our operating structure and we began operating as an internally managed non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Prior to the Effective Date, we were externally managed by our former investment adviser, GSV Asset Management, pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, and our former administrator, GSV Capital Service Company, provided the administrative services necessary for our operations pursuant to the Administration Agreement.
SURO CAPITAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2020
The accounting implications and related controls associated with the Internalization were analyzed and updated for fiscal year 2020.
Termination of Investment Advisory Agreement
On and effective March 12, 2019, the Investment Advisory Agreement was terminated by mutual agreement of GSV Asset Management and us in connection with our Internalization.
Prior to our Internalization, GSV Asset Management served as our external investment adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, we paid GSV Asset Management a fee for its services consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 2.00% of our gross assets (our total assets as reflected on our balance sheet with no deduction for liabilities). The incentive fee was determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equaled the lesser of (i) 20% of our realized capital gains during such calendar year, if any, calculated on an investment-by-investment basis, subject to a non-compounded preferred return, or “hurdle” of 8.00% per year, and a “catch-up” feature, and (ii) 20% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees. See “-Investment Advisory Agreement” below.
As the Investment Advisory Agreement has been terminated, there will be no base management fees or incentives fees payable to GSV Asset Management going forward.
Termination of Administration Agreement
On and effective March 12, 2019, the Administration Agreement was terminated by mutual agreement of GSV Capital Service Company and us in connection with our Internalization.
Prior to our Internalization, GSV Capital Service Company served as our external administrator and provided administrative services necessary for our operations, including but not limited to, furnishing us with office facilities, equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities, as well as providing us with certain other administrative services, including, but not limited to, assisting us with determining and publishing our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders.
Under the Administration Agreement, we did not pay any fees to GSV Capital Service Company but reimbursed GSV Capital Service Company for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by GSV Capital Service Company in performing its services under the Administration Agreement, including, but not limited to, fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and our allocable portion of rent and compensation of our President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and other staff providing administrative services. See “-Administration Agreement” below.
As the Administration Agreement has been terminated, there will be no costs incurred by GSV Capital Service Company going forward.
Departure of Director and Reduction of Number of Directors
On and effective March 12, 2019, Michael T. Moe resigned from our Board of Directors in connection with our Internalization. As a result of Mr. Moe’s resignation, our Board of Directors reduced the number of directors that constitute our full Board of Directors to five directors from six directors in accordance with our bylaws. Mr. Moe continued to provide certain services to us pursuant to the Consulting Agreement (as defined below). See “-Consulting Agreement.”

Consulting Agreement
On and effective March 12, 2019, we entered into a Consulting Agreement (the “Consulting Agreement”) with Michael T. Moe, the former Chairman of our Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of GSV Asset Management, for the purpose of assisting us with certain transition services following the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement and our Internalization. Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, Mr. Moe provided certain transition services to us related to our existing portfolio investments for which Mr. Moe previously had oversight in his role as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of GSV Asset Management. Such transition services included providing information to us regarding such portfolio companies, including as a member of a portfolio company’s board of directors, assisting with the transition of portfolio company board seats as requested by us, making appropriate introductions to representatives of portfolio companies, and providing other similar types of services that we may reasonably request.
The term of the Consulting Agreement commenced on March 12, 2019 and continued for eighteen months in accordance with its terms.

Amended and Restated Trademark License Agreement
On and effective March 12, 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Trademark License Agreement (the “Amended and Restated License Agreement”) with GSV Asset Management in connection with termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement. See “-Termination of Investment Advisory Agreement.”
GSV Asset Management is the owner of the trade name “GSV”, and other state or unregistered “GSV” marks, including the trading symbol “GSVC” (collectively, the “Licensed Marks”). Pursuant to the Amended and Restated License Agreement, GSV Asset Management granted us a non-transferable, non-sublicensable, and non-exclusive right and license to use the Licensed Marks, solely in connection with the operation of our existing business.
The term of the Amended and Restated License Agreement commenced on March 12, 2019 and continued for eighteen months in accordance with its terms. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated License Agreement, we paid GSV Asset Management a total amount equal to $1,250,000. On September 12, 2020, the Amended and Restated License Agreement expired in accordance with its terms and was not renewed or extended.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company incurred $582,438, $667,563, and $0 respectively, of licensing expense, as included in "other expenses" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Investment Advisory Agreement
On March 12, 2019, in connection with the Company's Internalization, the Investment Advisory Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms.
Prior to our Internalization on March 12, 2019, the Company had entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with GSV Asset Management. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, GSV Asset Management was paid a quarterly management fee and an annual incentive fee. GSV Asset Management is controlled by Michael T. Moe, the former Chairman of the Company’s Board of Directors. Mr. Moe, through his ownership interest in GSV Asset Management, was entitled to a portion of any profits earned by GSV Asset Management in performing its services under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Mr. Moe serves as the principal of GSV Asset Management and manages the business and internal affairs of GSV

Asset Management. Mark Klein, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, President, and a member of the Company’s Board of Directors, or entities with which he is affiliated, received consulting fees from GSV Asset Management equal to a percentage of each of the base management fee and the incentive fee paid by the Company to GSV Asset Management pursuant to a consulting agreement with GSV Asset Management. As the Investment Advisory Agreement has been terminated, Mr. Klein no longer has a consulting agreement or any other affiliation with GSV Asset Management.
Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, there were no restrictions on the right of any manager, partner, officer or employee of GSV Asset Management to engage in any other business or to devote his or her time and attention in part to any other business, whether of a similar or dissimilar nature, or to receive any fees or compensation in connection therewith (including fees for serving as a director of, or providing consulting services to, one or more of the Company’s portfolio companies). GSV Asset Management had, however, adopted an internal policy whereby any fees or compensation received by a manager, partner, officer or employee of GSV Asset Management in exchange for serving as a director of, or providing consulting services to, any of the Company’s portfolio companies would be transferred to the Company, net of any personal taxes incurred, upon such receipt for the benefit of the Company and its stockholders.
Management Fees
Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, GSV Asset Management was paid a base management fee of 2.00% of gross assets, which is the Company’s total assets reflected on its Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities (with no deduction for liabilities) reduced by any non-portfolio investments. During the month of January 2018, pursuant to a voluntary waiver by GSV Asset Management, the Company paid GSV Asset Management a base management fee of 1.75%, a 0.25% reduction from the 2.00% base management fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. On February 2, 2018 GSV Asset Management voluntarily agreed to reduce fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement (the “Waiver Agreement”). Pursuant to the Waiver Agreement, effective February 1, 2018, the base management fee is reduced to 1.75% of the Company’s gross assets, as further described below. The waiver of a portion of the base management fee is not subject to recourse against or reimbursement by the Company.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not accrue or waive any management fees due to the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, effective March 12, 2019. GSV Asset Management earned $848,723, and $5,199,900 in management fees for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and waived $0 and $892,421 in management fees for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
As the Investment Advisory Agreement has been terminated, there will be no base management fee payable to GSV Asset Management going forward.
Incentive Fees
Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, GSV Asset Management was paid an annual incentive fee equal to the lesser of (i) 20% of the Company’s realized capital gains during each calendar year, if any, calculated on an investment-by-investment basis, subject to a non-compounded preferred return, or “hurdle,” and a “catch-up” feature, and (ii) 20% of the Company’s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any previously paid incentive fees. Effective February 1, 2018, the incentive fee paid by the Company to GSV Asset Management under the Investment Advisory Agreement was modified pursuant to the terms of the Waiver Agreement, as further described below.
The Company was required to accrue incentive fees for all periods as if the Company had fully liquidated its entire investment portfolio at the fair value stated on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2018 or prior to the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement. The accrual considered both the hypothetical liquidation of the Company’s portfolio described previously, as well as the Company’s actual cumulative realized gains and losses since inception, as well any previously paid incentive fees.

December 31, 2020
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not accrue any incentive fees due to the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, effective March 12, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company reversed previously accrued incentive fees of $4,660,472, due to the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement. As the Investment Advisory Agreement has been terminated, there will be no incentive fee payable to GSV Asset Management going forward. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company accrued incentive fees of $382,387. Pursuant to the Waiver Agreement, on February 2, 2018, GSV Asset Management forfeited $5.0 million of the accrued incentive fees.
Management and Incentive Fee Waiver Agreement
On February 2, 2018, GSV Asset Management voluntarily agreed to reduce the fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement pursuant to the Waiver Agreement. The Waiver Agreement was effective beginning February 1, 2018 and changed the fee structure set forth in the Investment Advisory Agreement by: (i) reducing the Company’s base management fee from 2.00% to 1.75%; and (ii) creating certain high-water marks that must be reached before any incentive fee is paid to GSV Asset Management.
Pursuant to the Waiver Agreement, in addition to the “hurdle” feature in the incentive fee, GSV Asset Management had agreed to additional conditions on its ability to receive an incentive fee. Specifically, the Waiver Agreement provided that an incentive fee earned by GSV Asset Management under the Investment Advisory Agreement would be payable to GSV Asset Management only if, at the time that such incentive fee becomes payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, both the Company’s stock price and its last reported net asset value per share were equal to, or greater than, $12.55 (the “High-Water Mark”). The High-Water Mark was based upon the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of all the Company’s equity offerings since its initial public offering, less the dollar amount of all dividends paid by the Company since inception. Upon such time that the High-Water Mark was achieved, and GSV Asset Management was paid an incentive fee, a new High-Water Mark would have been established. Each new High-Water Mark would have been equal to the most recent High-Water Mark, plus 10%. Any High-Water Mark then in effect would have been adjusted to reflect any dividends paid by the Company or any stock split effected by the Company.
For the avoidance of doubt, after the effective date of the Waiver Agreement, under no circumstances would the aggregate fees earned by GSV Asset Management in any quarterly period have been higher than those aggregate fees that would have been earned prior to the effectiveness of the Waiver Agreement.
As of each of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, there were no receivables owed to the Company by GSV Asset Management. As the Investment Advisory Agreement has been terminated, there will be no receivables owed to the Company by GSV Asset Management going forward.
Administration Agreement
On March 12, 2019, in connection with the Company's Internalization, the Administration Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms.
Prior to the Internalization, the Company had entered into the Administration Agreement with GSV Capital Service Company to provide administrative services, including furnishing the Company with office facilities, equipment, clerical, bookkeeping, record keeping services, and other administrative services. The Company reimbursed GSV Capital Service Company an allocable portion of overhead and other expenses in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including a portion of the rent and the compensation of the Company’s President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and other staff providing administrative services. While there was no limit on the total amount of expenses the Company may have been required to reimburse to GSV Capital Service Company, GSV Capital Service Company would only charge the Company for the actual expenses GSV Capital Service Company incurred on the Company’s behalf, or the Company’s allocable portion thereof, without any profit to GSV Capital Service Company.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company did not incur any costs under the Administration Agreement due to the termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, effective March 12, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company incurred $306,084 and $1,702,047 respectively, in such costs incurred under the Administration

Agreement. As the Administration Agreement has been terminated, there will be no costs incurred by GSV Capital Service Company on behalf of the Company going forward.
License Agreement
On March 12, 2019, in connection with the Company's Internalization, as of the Effective Date, the Company entered into the Amended and Restated Trademark License Agreement to use the trade name “GSV”, and other state or unregistered “GSV” marks, including the trading symbol “GSVC.” for a period of up to eighteen months and a predetermined fee of $1,250,000. Other than with respect to this limited license, the Company has no legal right to the “GSV” name. On September 12, 2020, the Amended and Restated License Agreement expired in accordance with its terms and was not renewed or extended.
Prior to the Internalization on March 12, 2019, the Company entered into a license agreement with GSV Asset Management pursuant to which GSV Asset Management had agreed to grant the Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name “GSV.” Under this agreement, the Company had the right to use the GSV name for so long as the Investment Advisory Agreement with GSV Asset Management is in effect.
Other Arrangements
The Company’s executive officers and directors, and the principals of the Company’s former investment adviser, GSV Asset Management, serve or may serve as officers, directors, or managers of entities that operate in a line of business similar to the Company’s, including new entities that may be formed in the future. Accordingly, they may have obligations to investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which might not be in the best interests of the Company or the Company’s stockholders.
The 1940 Act prohibits the Company from participating in certain negotiated co-investments with certain affiliates unless it receives an order from the SEC permitting it to do so. As a BDC, the Company is prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with certain of its affiliates without the prior approval of the Board of Directors, including its independent directors, and, in some cases, the SEC. The affiliates with which the Company may be prohibited from transacting include its officers, directors, and employees and any person controlling or under common control with the Company, subject to certain exceptions.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company may enter into transactions with portfolio companies that may be considered related-party transactions. To ensure that the Company does not engage in any prohibited transactions with any persons affiliated with the Company, the Company has implemented certain written policies and procedures whereby the Company’s executive officers screen each of the Company’s transactions for any possible affiliations between the proposed portfolio investment, the Company, companies controlled by the Company, and the Company’s executive officers and directors.

Significant Unobservable Inputs for Level 3 Assets and Liabilities
In accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, the tables below provide quantitative information about the Company’s fair value measurements of its Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. In addition to the techniques and inputs noted in the tables below, according to the Company’s valuation policy, the Company may also use other valuation techniques and methodologies when determining the Company’s fair value measurements. The tables below are not intended to be all-inclusive, but rather provide information on the significant Level 3 inputs as they relate to the Company’s fair value measurements. To the extent an unobservable input is not reflected in the tables below, such input is deemed insignificant with respect to the Company’s Level 3 fair value measurements as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. Significant changes in the inputs in isolation would result in a significant change in the fair value measurement, depending on the input and the materiality of the investment. Refer to “Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies-Investments at Fair Value” for more detail.
As of December 31, 2020
________________________
(1) As of December 31, 2020, the Company used a hybrid market and income approach to value certain common and preferred stock investments as the Company felt this approach better reflected the fair value of these investments. By considering multiple valuation approaches (and consequently, multiple valuation techniques), the valuation approaches and techniques are not likely to change from one period of measurement to the next; however, the weighting of each in determining the final fair value of a Level 3 investment may change based on recent events or transactions. The hybrid approach may also consider certain risk weightings to account for the uncertainty of future events. Refer to “Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies-Investments at Fair Value” for more detail.
(2) The Company considers all relevant information that can reasonably be obtained when determining the fair value of Level 3 investments. Due to any given portfolio company’s information rights, changes in capital structure, recent events, transactions, or liquidity events, the type and availability of unobservable inputs may change. Increases/(decreases) in revenue multiples, earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) multiples, time to expiration, and stock price/strike price would result in higher (lower) fair

values all else equal. Decreases (increases) in discount rates, volatility, and annual risk rates, would result in higher (lower) fair values all else equal. The market approach utilizes market value (revenue and EBIT) multiples of publicly traded comparable companies and available precedent sales transactions of comparable companies. The Company carefully considers numerous factors when selecting the appropriate companies whose multiples are used to value its portfolio companies. These factors include, but are not limited to, the type of organization, similarity to the business being valued, relevant risk factors, as well as size, profitability and growth expectations. In general, precedent transactions include recent rounds of financing, recent purchases made by the Company, and tender offers. Refer to “Note 2-Significant Accounting Policies-Investments at Fair Value” for more detail.

NOTE 9-INCOME TAXES
The Company elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2014, has qualified to be treated as a RIC for subsequent taxable years. The Company intends to continue to operate so as to qualify to be subject to tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and, as such, will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of taxable income (including gains) distributed as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to stockholders. Taxable income includes the Company’s taxable interest, dividend and fee income, reduced by certain deductions, as well as taxable net realized investment gains. Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as such gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized.
To qualify and be subject to tax as a RIC, the Company is required to meet certain income and asset diversification tests in addition to distributing dividends of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of its investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid, to its stockholders. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board of Directors each quarter and is based upon the annual earnings estimated by the management of the Company. To the extent that the Company’s earnings fall below the amount of dividend distributions declared, however, a portion of the total amount of the Company’s distributions for the fiscal year may be deemed a return of capital for tax purposes to the Company’s stockholders.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company declared distributions of $0.87 per share. The determination of the tax attributes of the Company’s distributions is made annually as of the end of the Company’s taxable year generally based upon its taxable income for the full taxable year and distributions paid for the full taxable year. As a result, a determination made on a by-dividend basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of the Company’s distributions for a full taxable year. If the Company had determined the tax attributes of our distributions taxable year-to-date as of December 31, 2020, 100% would be from net realized investment gains. However, there can be no certainty to stockholders that this determination is representative of what the actual tax attributes of the Company’s fiscal year of 2020 distributions to stockholders will be.
As a RIC, the Company will be subject to a 4% nondeductible U.S. federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless the Company makes distributions treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes in a timely manner to its stockholders in respect of each calendar year of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98% of our ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for each calendar year, (2) 98.2% of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the 1-year period ending October 31 of each such calendar year and (3) any ordinary income and net capital gains for preceding years, but not distributed during such years and on which the Company paid no U.S. federal income tax. The Company will not be subject to this excise tax on any amount on which the Company incurred U.S. federal corporate income tax (such as the tax imposed on a RIC’s retained net capital gains).
Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a taxable year, the Company may choose to carry over taxable income in excess of current taxable year distributions from such taxable income into the next taxable year and incur a 4% excise tax on such taxable income, as required. The maximum amount of excess taxable income that may be carried over for distribution in the next taxable year under the Code is the total amount of distributions paid in the following taxable year, subject to certain declaration and payment guidelines. To the extent the Company chooses to carry over taxable income into the next taxable year, distributions declared and paid by the Company in a taxable year may differ from the Company’s taxable income for that taxable year as such distributions may include the distribution of current taxable year taxable income, the distribution of prior taxable year taxable income carried over into and distributed in the current taxable year, or returns of capital.
The Company has taxable subsidiaries which hold certain portfolio investments in an effort to limit potential legal liability and/or comply with source-income type requirements contained in the RIC tax provisions of the Code. These taxable subsidiaries are consolidated for U.S. GAAP and the portfolio investments held by the taxable subsidiaries are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and are recorded at fair value. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, or benefit, and tax assets and liabilities as a

result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. Any income generated by these taxable subsidiaries generally would be subject to tax at normal corporate tax rates based on its taxable income.
The Company intends to timely distribute to its stockholders substantially all of its annual taxable income for each year, except that it may retain certain net capital gains for reinvestment and, depending upon the level of taxable income earned in a year, may choose to carry forward taxable income for distribution in the following year and pay any applicable U.S. federal excise tax.
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $0.0 million and $0.0 million, respectively. The Company is required to include net deferred tax provision/benefit in calculating its total expenses even though these net deferred taxes are not currently payable/receivable. Taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as such gains or losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized.
For U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, a portion of the Taxable Subsidiaries’ net operating loss carryforwards and basis differences may be subject to limitations on annual utilization in case of a change in ownership, as defined by federal and state law. The amount of such limitations, if any, has not been determined. Accordingly, the amount of such tax attributes available to offset future profits may be significantly less than the actual amounts of the tax attributes.
The Company and the Taxable Subsidiaries identified their major tax jurisdictions as U.S. federal and California and may be subject to the taxing authorities’ examination for the tax years 2017-2020 and 2016-2020, respectively. Further, the Company and the Taxable Subsidiaries accrue all interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as incurred. As of December 31, 2020, there were no material interest or penalties incurred related to uncertain tax positions.
Permanent differences between ICTI and net investment income for financial reporting purposes are reclassified among capital accounts in the consolidated financial statements to reflect their tax character. Differences in classification may also result from the treatment of short-term gains as ordinary income for tax purposes. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company reclassified for book purposes amounts arising from permanent book/tax differences related as follows:
For income tax purposes, distributions paid to stockholders are reported as ordinary income, return of capital, long term capital gains or a combination thereof. The tax character of distributions declared in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was as follows:
For federal income tax purposes, the tax cost of investments owned at December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $309,978,186 and $194,194,622, respectively. The gross unrealized appreciation and gross unrealized depreciation on investments owned at December 31, 2020 was $175,168,002 and $54,366,414, respectively, and on investments owned at December 31, 2019, was $87,999,577 and $40,608,621, respectively. The net unrealized appreciation/(depreciation) on investments owned at December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $120,801,588 and $47,390,956, respectively.

4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023
On March 28, 2018, the Company issued $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes, which bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.75% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on March 31 and September 30 of each year, commencing on September 30, 2018. The 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes mature on March 28, 2023 (the "4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023"), unless previously repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms. The Company does not have the right to redeem the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 prior to March 27, 2021. On or after March 27, 2021, the Company may redeem the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 for cash, in whole or from time to time in part, at the Company’s option if (i) the closing sale price of the Company’s common stock for at least 15 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of any 20 consecutive trading days is greater than or equal to 150% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day, (ii) no public announcement of a pending, proposed or intended fundamental change has occurred which has not been abandoned, terminated or consummated, and (iii) no event of default under the indenture governing the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, and no event that with the passage of time or giving of notice would constitute an event of default under such indenture, has occurred or exists.
The initial conversion rate for the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 was 93.2836 shares of the Company’s common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, which represented an initial conversion price of approximately $10.72 per share. As a result of the Company’s Modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer and cash dividends, the conversion rate for the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 changed to 106.1681 shares of the Company’s common stock for each $1,000 principal amount of the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, which represents a conversion price of approximately $9.42 per share as of December 31, 2020. Following certain corporate transactions that occur on or prior to the stated maturity date, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 in connection with such a corporate transaction. If a fundamental change, as defined in the indenture governing the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, occurs prior to the stated maturity date, holders may require the Company to purchase for cash all or any portion of their 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 at a fundamental change purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date.
The indenture governing the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 contains customary financial reporting requirements and contains certain restrictions on mergers, consolidations, and asset sales. The indenture also contains certain events of default, the occurrence of which may lead to the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 being due and payable before their maturity or immediately.
For the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company issued 174,888 shares of its common stock and cash for fractional shares upon the conversion of $1,785,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023. Refer to "Note 12 - Subsequent Events" for additional information.

As of December 31, 2020 the principal amount of the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 did not exceed the value of the underlying shares multiplied by the per share closing price of the Company’s common stock. If the share price of our common stock exceeds $9.42 per share it may be advantageous for note holders to convert their 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 to our common stock.
The 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 are the Company’s general, unsecured, senior obligations and rank senior in right of payment to any future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, equal in right of payment to any existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated to the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, effectively junior to any future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and structurally junior to all future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by the Company’s subsidiaries.
In connection with the issuance of the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, the Company was required under the terms of the Credit Facility (defined below) to deposit any proceeds from the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 offering into an account at Western Alliance Bank and was required to maintain at least $65.0 million (or such lesser amount to the extent such funds are used to repay or repurchase a portion of the outstanding 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 prior to their maturity and repayment in full) in an account at Western Alliance Bank until such time as the 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 were repaid in full. The 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 matured on September 15, 2018, at which time the Company repaid the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018, including accrued but unpaid interest. In addition, the Credit Facility matured on May 31, 2019. As a result, the company is no longer subject to such requirements.
Western Alliance Bank Credit Facility
The Credit Facility (defined below) matured on May 31, 2019. There were no borrowings by the Company from the Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2020.

The Credit Facility, among other things, matured on May 31, 2019 and bore interest at a per annum rate equal to the prime rate plus 3.50%. In addition, a facility fee of $60,000 was charged upon closing of the Credit Facility, and the Loan Agreement required payment of a fee for unused amounts during the revolving period in an amount equal to 0.50% per annum of the average unused portion of the Credit Facility payable quarterly in arrears.
Under the Loan Agreement, the Company made certain customary representations and warranties and was required to comply with various affirmative and negative covenants, reporting requirements, and other customary requirements for similar credit facilities, including, without limitation, restrictions on incurring additional indebtedness (with unsecured longer-term indebtedness limited to $70.0 million in the aggregate), compliance with the asset coverage requirements under the 1940 Act, a minimum net asset value requirement of at least the greater of $60.0 million or five times the amount of the Credit Facility, a limitation on the Company’s net asset value being reduced by more than 15% of its net asset value at December 31, 2016, and maintenance of RIC and BDC status. The Loan Agreement included usual and customary events of default for credit facilities of this nature, including, without limitation, nonpayment, misrepresentation of representations and warranties in a material respect, breach of covenant, cross-default to certain other indebtedness, bankruptcy, the cessation of the Investment Advisory Agreement, and the occurrence of a material adverse effect.

Such description of the Option Cancellation Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of such Option Cancellation Agreement filed as Exhibit 10.3 to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2020 filed with the SEC on May 8, 2020.
The Company follows ASC 718 to account for stock options granted. Under ASC 718, compensation expense associated with stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the vesting period. Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility, forfeiture rate, and expected option life. The time-based options granted on July 17, 2019 were ascribed a weighted-average fair value of $2.57 per share. The fair value of options granted under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan was based upon a Black Scholes option pricing model using the assumptions in the following table:

December 31, 2020
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $1,962,431 and $998,355, respectively. The stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the cancellation of all granted vested and unvested options, and the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options in 2020 and 2019 was $0 and $0, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there was $0 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options granted under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, as the options were cancelled effective April 28, 2020.
Amended and Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan
On June 19, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted, and our stockholders approved, an amendment and restatement of the Company’s 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Amended & Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan”) under which the Company is authorized to grant equity awards for up to 1,627,967 shares of its common stock. In accordance with the exemptive relief granted to the Company by the SEC on June 16, 2020 with respect to the Amended & Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, the Company is generally authorized to (i) issue restricted shares as part of the compensation package for certain of its employees, officers and all directors, including non-employee directors (collectively, the “Participants”), (ii) issue options to acquire shares of its common stock (“Options”) to certain employees, officers and employee directors as a part of such compensation packages, (iii) withhold shares of the Company’s common stock or purchase shares of common stock from the Participants to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to the vesting of restricted shares or the exercise of Options granted to the certain Participants pursuant to the Amended & Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, and (iv) permit the Participants to pay the exercise price of Options granted to them with shares of the Company’s common stock.
Under the Amended & Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, each non-employee director will receive an annual grant of $50,000 worth of restricted shares of common stock (based on the closing stock price of the common stock on the grant date). Each grant of $50,000 in restricted shares will vest, in full, if the non-employee director is in continuous service as a director of the Company through the anniversary of such grant (or, if earlier, the annual meeting of the Company’s stockholders that is closest to the anniversary of such grant).
Other than such restricted shares granted to non-employee directors, the Company’s Compensation Committee may determine the time or times at which Options and restricted shares granted to other Participants will vest or become payable or exercisable, as applicable. The exercise price of each Option will not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date the option is granted. However, any optionee who owns more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of the Company’s outstanding common stock (a “10% Stockholder”), will not be eligible for the grant of an incentive stock option unless the exercise price of the incentive stock option is at least 110% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Generally, no Option will be exercisable after the expiration of ten years from the date of grant. In the case of an Option granted to a 10% Stockholder, the term of an incentive stock option will be for no more than five years from the date of grant.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company granted 21,760 restricted shares to its non-employee directors pursuant to the Amended & Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan. The Company determined that the fair values, based on the

grant date close price, of such restricted shares granted under the Amended & Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan during the year ended December 31, 2020 were approximately $200,000 in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately $200,000 of total unrecognized compensation costs related to the restricted share grants. These costs related to the annual grants to non-employee directors are expected to be recognized upon vesting, which is approximately one year from the date of grant.
The following table summarizes the activities for the Company’s restricted share grants for the year ended December 31, 2020 under the Amended & Restated 2019 Equity Incentive Plan:

COVID-19
The Company has been closely monitoring the COVID-19 pandemic, its broader impact on the global economy and the more recent impacts on the U.S. economy. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related effect on the U.S. and global economies, may have adverse consequences for the business operations of some of the Company’s portfolio companies and, as a result, may have adverse effects on the Company’s operations. The ultimate economic fallout from the pandemic, and the long-term impact on economies, markets, industries and individual issuers, remain uncertain. The operational and financial performance of the issuers of securities in which the Company invests depends on future developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, and such uncertainty may in turn adversely affect the value and liquidity of the Company’s investments and negatively impact the Company’s performance.
As of March 11, 2021, there is no indication of a reportable subsequent event impacting the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company continues to observe and respond to the evolving COVID-19 environment and its potential impact on areas across its business.

NOTE 14-SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA
Summarized Financial Information of Unconsolidated Subsidiaries
In accordance with the SEC’s Regulation S-X and GAAP, the Company is not permitted to consolidate any subsidiary or other entity that is not an investment company, including those in which the Company has a controlling interest; however, the Company must disclose certain financial information related to any subsidiaries or other entities that are considered to be “significant subsidiaries” under the applicable rules of Regulation S-X. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had investments in at least one portfolio company considered to be a significant subsidiary under SEC Regulation S-X Rule 10-01(b)(1) and Regulation S-X Rule 4-08(g).
In May 2020, the SEC adopted rule amendments that will impact the requirement of investment companies, including BDCs, to disclose the financial statements of certain of their portfolio companies or acquired funds (the “Final Rules”). The Final Rules adopted a new definition of “significant subsidiary” set forth in Rule 1-02(w)(2) of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act. Rules 3-09 and 4-08(g) of Regulation S-X require investment companies to include separate financial statements or summary financial information, respectively, in such investment company’s periodic reports for any portfolio company that meets the definition of “significant subsidiary.” The Final Rules amend the definition of “significant subsidiary” in a manner that is intended to more accurately capture those portfolio companies that are more likely to materially impact the financial condition of an investment company. The Final Rules will be effective on January 1, 2021, but voluntary compliance is permitted in advance of the effective date. The Company has elected to comply in advance of the effective date for the year ended December 31, 2020. The adoption of this rule has an impact on the consolidated financial statements in that far fewer subsidiaries require disclosure under the Final Rules as compared to the previous rules.
As a result of the new definition of a “significant subsidiary” set forth in Rule 1-02(w)(2) the Company’s only “subsidiary” as of December 31, 2020, SPBRX, INC. (f/k/a GSV Sustainability Partners, Inc.) does not meet the definition of a “significant subsidiary” set forth in Rule 1-02(w)(2). For comparability purposes the Company has omitted the previously disclosed summarized financial information of the Company’s significant subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2019 as the Company’s significant subsidiaries would not have been considered significant subsidiaries under the Final Rules.
