MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management of South State Corporation (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting using the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisitions, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
On June 7, 2020, the Company completed the merger with CenterState Bank Corporation (“CSFL”). The Company is in the process of evaluating the existing controls and procedures of CSFL and integrating CSFL into the internal control over financial reporting. In accordance with the SEC Staff guidance permitting a company to exclude an acquired business from management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year in which the acquisition is completed, the Company has excluded CSFL from the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. CSFL represented 41.4% of the Company’s total assets as of December 31, 2020. The scope of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020 includes all of the Company’s consolidated operations except for those disclosure controls and procedures of CSFL that are included in the internal control over financial reporting.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Based on the testing performed using the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), management of the Company believes that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.
The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Shareholders and the Board of Directors
South State Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited South State Corporation and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, South State Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of South State Corporation and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and our report dated February 26, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.
Basis for Opinion
The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
As described in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, the scope of management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has excluded CenterState Bank Corporation (“CSFL”) acquired on June 7, 2020. We have also excluded CSFL from the scope of our audit of internal control over financial reporting. CSFL represented 41.4 percent of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2020.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Shareholders and the Board of Directors
South State Corporation
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of South State Corporation and Subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Adoption of New Accounting Standard
As discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2020, the Company changed its method of accounting for credit losses due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to
accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Allowance for Credit Losses
As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s loan portfolio was $24.7 billion and the associated allowance for credit loss (“ACL”) was $457.3 million. As described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses on January 1, 2020.
The Company’s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects management’s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The ACL is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist and the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method is utilized for each loan in a pool, and the results are aggregated at the pool level. A periodic tendency to default (“PD”) and absolute loss given default (“LGD”) are applied to a projective model of the loan’s cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects. Management determined that the loss experience of the Company provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses. Management applies reasonable and supportable forecasts based on macroeconomic data in estimating expected credit losses with a reversion to the long term mean of historical factors. Included in the Company’s methodology to determine its ACL, management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e., formulaic model results). Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework.
We identified the Company’s estimate of the ACL as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for that determination included the high degree of judgement and subjectivity relating to management’s selection and application of the macroeconomic data in the forecast and the identification and measurement of the qualitative factors. This required a high degree of auditor effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment in evaluating the estimated credit losses for the loan portfolios.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
●We obtained an understanding of the Company’s process for establishing the ACL, including the selection and application of forecasts and the basis for development and related adjustments of the qualitative factor components of the ACL.
●We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to management’s determination of the ACL, including controls over:
oManagement’s process for selection of forecasts and the basis for development of qualitative factors of the ACL.
oManagement’s review of reliability and accuracy of data used to calculate and estimate the various components of the ACL, including accuracy of the calculation and validation procedures over the Models.
oManagement’s process to review the reasonableness of the forecasts and the qualitative factors, including any adjustments.
●We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s application of qualitative factor adjustments to the ACL, including the comparison of factors considered by management to third party or internal sources as well as evaluated the appropriateness and level of the qualitative factor adjustments.
●We evaluated the mathematical accuracy of the ACL, including the mathematical application of the qualitative adjustments on the loan segments.
●We assessed the overall trends in credit quality, including adjustments for the qualitative factors by comparing the overall ACL to those recorded by the Company’s peer institutions.
●We involved DHG’s valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of model inputs and assumptions and testing the design of the model calculation through a re-performance of the discounted cash flow on a selection of loans.
●We evaluated subsequent events and transactions and considered whether they corroborated or contradicted the Company’s conclusion.
CenterState Bank Corporation Merger - Valuation of Acquired Loans
As described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, CenterState Bank Corporation (CSFL) merged with South State Corporation on June 7, 2020. As part of the merger, surviving South State Corporation applied purchase accounting for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In the acquisition, the Company acquired $13.0 billion of loans at fair value, net of $239.5 million, or 1.82%, estimated discount to the outstanding principal balance. In management’s determination of the fair value of loans acquired from CSFL, management determined which loans exhibited evidence of credit deterioration (PCD loans) within the portfolio at the time of the merger and loans which did not meet PCD loan criteria (performing loans).
We identified the Company’s estimate of the fair value of acquired loans as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for that determination included the high degree of judgement and subjectivity relating to the valuation methodology, particularly as it relates to evaluating the inputs and assumptions used to develop the fair value estimate of acquired loans, including the segmentation between PCD and performing loans.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
●We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the valuation of acquired loans including controls over:
oManagement's review of the completeness of data inputs, as well as accuracy and reasonableness of the final valuation.
oManagement's review of the reasonableness of the judgments and assumptions used to develop the analysis.
●We tested the completeness and accuracy of the loan data and segmentations used in the analysis, including:
oThe completeness and accuracy of loans determined to have credit deterioration at acquisition and evaluated the reasonableness of the criteria utilized by management in the determination.
oThe accuracy of the data utilized in the acquisition date fair value by confirming, on a sample basis, select data.
●Utilizing a valuation specialist, we evaluated the significant assumptions and methods utilized in developing the fair value of the loan portfolio, including:
oEvaluating the reasonableness of the Bank’s third-party valuation methodology, expected cash flow calculations, and review of significant assumptions.
oTesting the Company’s calculation of fair value of the loan portfolio acquired and certain significant assumptions, including among other assumptions, loss rates, prepayment speeds and discount rates.
Provision (Benefit) For Income Taxes
As described in Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements, The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act legislation enacted in March 2020, provides taxpayers the ability to carry back net operating losses (“NOLs”) generated in 2018 through 2020 for five years, which was previously disallowed under The Tax Reform Act. Due to differences in tax and GAAP accounting rules and standards, which relate to a tax method change to fair value for loans, the Company filed a short-period tax return as of the merger date, which generated a NOL. This loss was carried back to the 2013 through 2015 tax years at a 35% tax rate, generating one time income tax benefit of $31.5 million.
We identified the Company’s estimate of the fair value of the legacy South State Corporation loan portfolio, for tax purposes as of June 7, 2020, to be a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for that determination included the high degree of judgement and subjectivity relating to the loan segmentation and valuation methodology, particularly as it relates to the inputs and assumptions used to develop the fair value estimate of loans.
The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:
●We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to managements controls over the valuation of loans including controls over:
oManagement's review of the completeness of data inputs, as well as accuracy and reasonableness of the final valuation.
oManagement's review of the reasonableness of the judgments and assumptions used to develop the analysis.
●We tested the completeness and accuracy of the loan data and segmentations used in the analysis, including:
oThe completeness and accuracy of loans determined to have credit deterioration.
oThe accuracy of the data utilized in the valuation by reconciling back to the relevant systems.
●Utilizing a valuation specialist, we evaluated the significant assumptions and methods utilized in developing the fair value of the loan portfolio, including:
oEvaluating the reasonableness of the Bank’s third-party valuation methodology, expected cash flow calculations and review of significant assumptions.
oTesting the Company’s calculation of fair value of the loan portfolio acquired and certain significant assumptions, including among other assumptions, loss rates, prepayment speeds and discount rates.

Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Nature of Operations
South State Corporation (the “Company”) is a financial holding company whose principal activity is the ownership and management of its wholly owned subsidiary, South State Bank, National Association (the “Bank”). The Bank operates South State Advisory, Inc. (formerly First Southeast 401k Fiduciaries, Inc.), a wholly-owned registered investment advisor. We merged Minis & Co., Inc., another registered investment advisor that was wholly-owned by the Bank, with and into South State Advisory, Inc. effective January 1, 2019. We will continue to use the name Minis & Company as a Doing Business As (DBA) going forward. Through the merger with CenterState Bank Corporation (“CSFL”) in the second quarter of 2020, the Bank also owns CBI Holding Company, LLC (“CBI”), which in turn owns Corporate Billing, LLC (“Corporate Billing”), a transaction-based finance company headquartered in Decatur, Alabama that provides factoring, invoicing, collection and accounts receivable management services to transportation companies and automotive parts and service providers nationwide. Also, through the merger with CSFL in the second quarter of 2020, the holding company operates R4ALL, Inc., which manages a troubled loan purchased from the Bank to its eventual disposition and SSB Insurance Corp., a captive insurance subsidiary pursuant to Section 831(b) of the U.S. Tax Code. The Company also operates a correspondent banking division within the national bank subsidiary, of which the majority of its bond salesmen, traders and operational personnel are housed in facilities located in Birmingham, Alabama and Atlanta, Georgia. The Bank provides general banking services within 28 counties in South Carolina, 32 counties in Florida, 9 counties in North Carolina, 25 counties in Georgia, 5 counties in Alabama, and 4 counties in Virginia.
The accounting and reporting policies of the Company and its consolidated subsidiary conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (‘U.S. GAAP”). There are 20 unconsolidated subsidiaries of the Company that were established for the purpose of issuing in the aggregate of approximately $153.5 million of trust preferred securities. See Note 12-Other Borrowings for further detailed descriptions of our trust preferred securities.
Unless otherwise mentioned or unless the context requires otherwise, references herein to "South State," the "Company" "we," "us," "our" or similar references mean South State Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. References to the “Bank” means South State Bank, National Association.
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and other entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Assets held by the Company in trust are not assets of the Company and are not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Segments
The Company, through its Bank subsidiary, provides a broad range of financial services to individuals and companies in South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Georgia and Virginia. These services include demand, time and savings deposits; lending and credit card servicing; ATM processing; mortgage banking services; correspondent banking services and wealth management and trust services. While the Company’s decision makers monitor the revenue streams of the various financial products and services, operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on an organization-wide basis. Accordingly, the Company’s banking and finance operations are not considered by management to constitute more than one reportable operating segment.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for credit losses for loans and investment securities held-to-maturity, fair value of financial instruments, fair values of assets
and liabilities acquired in business combinations, loss estimates related to loans and other real estate acquired, evaluating impairment of investment securities, goodwill impairment tests and valuation of deferred tax assets.
In connection with the determination of the allowance for credit losses, management has identified specific loans as well as adopted a policy of providing amounts for loan valuation purposes which are not identified with any specific loan but are derived from models based on macroeconomic factors and forecasts. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses is adequate. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic forecasts. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of the examination process, periodically review the banking subsidiary’s allowance for credit losses. Such agencies may require additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination.
Concentrations of Credit Risk
The Company’s Bank subsidiary grants agribusiness, commercial, and residential loans to customers throughout South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Virginia and Georgia. Although the subsidiary has a diversified loan portfolio, a substantial portion of their borrowers’ abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Virginia, Georgia and the surrounding regions.
The Company considers concentrations of credit to exist when, pursuant to regulatory guidelines, the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents 25% of total Tier 1 capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the Company, or $841.1 million at December 31, 2020. Based on this criteria, the Company had five such credit concentrations at December 31, 2020, including loans on hotels and motels of $969.9 million, loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings (except mini-warehouses) of $3.7 billion, loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings of $3.1 billion, loans to lessors of residential buildings (investment properties and multi-family) of $1.1 billion and loans secured by 1st mortgage 1-4 family owner occupied residential property of $3.6 billion. The risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time. The loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard ACL methodology.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the purpose of presentation in the consolidated statements of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in process of collection, amounts due from banks including restricted pledged cash, interest bearing deposits with banks, purchases of securities under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold. Due from bank balances are maintained at other financial institutions. Federal funds sold are generally purchased and sold for one-day periods, but may, from time to time, have longer terms.
The Company enters from time to time into purchases of securities under agreements to resell substantially identical securities. When the Company enters into such repurchase agreements, the securities purchased under agreements to resell generally consist of U.S. government-sponsored entities and agency mortgage-backed securities. The Company may elect to use other asset classes at its discretion. It is the Company’s practice to take possession of securities purchased under agreements to resell. The securities are delivered into the Company’s account maintained by a third-party custodian designated by the Company under a written custodial agreement that explicitly recognizes the Company’s interest in the securities. The Company monitors the market value of the underlying securities, including accrued interest, which collateralizes the related receivable on agreements to resell. Historically, these agreements were considered to be cash equivalents with maturities of three months or less. The Company held no securities under agreements to resell at December 31, 2020.
Trading Securities
The Company has a trading securities portfolio where the Company engages in trading activities for its own account. Securities classified as trading are held principally for resale in the near term are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value included in earnings. For this portfolio, interest income is included in the net interest margin and realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in correspondent banking and capital market income, a component
of Non-interest Income in our “Consolidated Statements of Income.” Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal securities and are held for short periods of time.
Investment Securities
Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as “held-to-maturity” and carried at amortized cost. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity, including equity securities with readily determinable fair values, are classified as “available-for-sale” and carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income.
Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using methods approximating the interest method over the terms of the securities. Gains and losses realized on sales of securities available-for-sale are determined using the specific identification method.
Management no longer evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment, otherwise referred to herein as OTTI, as ASC Subtopic 326-30, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses-Available-for-Sale Debt Securities, changes the accounting for recognizing impairment on available-for-sale debt securities. Each quarter Management evaluates impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value. Management considers the nature of the collateral, potential future changes in collateral values, default rates, delinquency rates, third-party guarantees, credit ratings, interest rate changes since purchase, volatility of the security’s fair value and historical loss information for financial assets secured with similar collateral among other factors. Credit losses are calculated individually, rather than collectively, using a discounted cash flow method, whereby Management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. The credit loss component would be recognized through the provision for credit losses in the Statements of Income. (see Note 4-Investment Securities).
Other investments include stock acquired for regulatory purposes, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and other nonmarketable investment securities. Stock acquired for regulatory purposes include Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB”) stock and Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”) stock. These securities do not have a readily determinable fair value because their ownership is restricted and they lack a market for trading. As a result, these securities are carried at cost and are periodically evaluated for impairment. Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries represent a minority investment in SCBT Capital Trust I, SCBT Capital Trust II, SCBT Capital Trust III, TSB Statutory Trust I, SAVB Capital Trust I, SAVB Capital Trust II, Southeastern Bank Financial Statutory Trust I, Southeastern Bank Financial Statutory Trust II, Provident Community Bancshares Capital Trust I, FCRV Statutory Trust I, Community Capital Statutory Trust I, CSBC Statutory Trust I, Provident Community Bancshares Capital Trust II, CenterState Banks of Florida Statutory Trust I, Valrico Capital Statutory Trust, Federal Trust Statutory Trust I, Gulfstream Bancshares Capital Trust II, Homestead Statutory Trust I, BSA Financial Statutory Trust I and MRCB Statutory Trust II. These investments are recorded at cost and the Company receives quarterly dividend payments on these investments. Other nonmarketable investment securities consist of Business Development Corporation stock and stock in Banker’s Banks. These investments also do not have a readily determinable fair value because their ownership is restricted and they lack a market for trading. As a result, these securities are carried at cost and are periodically evaluated for impairment.
Loans Held for Sale
Loans originated and intended for sale are carried at the estimated fair value in the aggregate. Estimated fair value is determined on the basis of existing forward commitments, or the current market value of similar loans. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to income. Loans held-for-sale are sold to investors either under guaranteed delivery or with the best effort intent and ability to sell loans as long as they meet the underwriting standards of the potential investor.
Loans
Loans that management has originated and has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay off generally are reported at their unpaid principal balances, less unearned income and net of any deferred loan fees and costs. Unearned income on installment loans is recognized as income over the terms of the loans by methods that generally approximate the interest method. Interest on other loans is calculated by using the simple interest method on daily balances of the principal amount outstanding.
We place non acquired loans and acquired loans on nonaccrual once reasonable doubt exists about the collectability of all principal and interest due. Generally, this occurs when principal or interest is 90 days or more past due, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.
A loan is evaluated individually for loss when it is on nonaccrual and has a net book balance over $1 million. Large pools of homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for loss and given a general reserve. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as nonaccrual, provided that management expects to collect all amounts due, including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay.
Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”)
The Bank measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably-expected TDR, the Company factors the reasonably-expected TDR into the current expected credit losses estimate. For consumer loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the borrower’s application for a modification (i.e., the borrower qualifies for the TDR) or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. For commercial loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the loan for modification or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a TDR to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the ACL.
A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company’s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession meets the criteria as defined under the CARES Act.
Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”)
On January 1, 2020, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, sometimes referred to herein as ASU 2016-13. Topic 326 was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses; ASU No. 2019-05, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses; and ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. This standard applies to all financial assets measured at amortized cost and off balance sheet credit exposures, including loans, investment securities and unfunded commitments. We applied the standard’s provisions using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2020. With this transition method, we did not have to restate comparative prior periods presented in the financial statements related to Topic 326, but will present comparative prior periods disclosures using the previous accounting guidance for the allowance for loan losses. This adoption method is considered a change in accounting principle requiring additional disclosure of the nature of and reason for the change, which is solely a result of the adoption of the required standard.
ACL - Investment Securities
Management uses a systematic methodology to determine its ACL for investment securities held-to-maturity. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the held-to-maturity portfolio. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the portfolio. The Company’s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, Management’s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. Management monitors the held-to-maturity portfolio to determine whether a valuation account would need to be recorded. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had $955.5 million of held-to-maturity securities and no related valuation account.
Management no longer evaluates available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment, otherwise referred to herein as OTTI, as ASC Subtopic 326-30, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses-Available-for-Sale Debt Securities, changes the accounting for recognizing impairment on available-for-sale debt securities. Each quarter Management evaluates impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of an available-for-sale security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value. Management considers the nature of the collateral, potential future changes in collateral values, default rates, delinquency rates, third-party guarantees, credit ratings, interest rate changes since purchase, volatility of the security’s fair value and historical loss information for financial assets secured with similar collateral among other factors. Credit losses are calculated individually, rather than collectively, using a discounted cash flow method, whereby Management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. The credit loss component would be recognized through the provision for credit losses in the Statements of Income.
Management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the investment securities and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of December 31 2020, the accrued interest receivable for investment securities available-for-sale recorded in Other Assets was $13.1 million.
ACL - Loans
The ACL reflects Management’s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. The Company established the incremental increase in the ACL at adoption through equity and subsequent adjustments through a provision for credit losses charged to earnings. The Company records loans charged off against the ACL and subsequent recoveries, if any, increase the ACL when they are recognized.
Management uses systematic methodologies to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company’s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, Management’s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. The Company’s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects Management’s best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for Management’s current estimate of expected credit losses. The Company’s ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans.
The Company merged with CSFL on June 7, 2020. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2020, given the proximity of the merger date to the quarter end, Management evaluated loans from each legacy loan portfolio utilizing pre-existing methodologies implemented prior to the merger and aggregated the result. During the third quarter, Management consolidated the two methodologies into one to arrive at the ACL recorded at December 31, 2020.
The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. Loans with similar risk characteristics are grouped into homogenous segments, or pools, for analysis. The Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method is utilized for each loan in a pool, and the results are aggregated at the pool level. A periodic tendency to default and absolute loss given default are applied to a projective model of the loan’s cash flow while considering prepayment and principal curtailment effects. The analysis produces expected cash flows for each instrument in the pool by pairing loan-level term information (e.g., maturity date, payment amount, interest rate, etc.) with top-down pool assumptions (e.g., default rates and prepayment speeds). The Company has identified the following portfolio segments: Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Non Owner-Occupied Commercial Real Estate, Multifamily, Municipal, Commercial and Industrial, Commercial Construction and Land Development, Residential Construction, Residential Senior Mortgage, Residential Junior Mortgage, Revolving Mortgage, and Consumer and Other.
In determining the proper level of the ACL, Management has determined that the loss experience of the Bank provides the best basis for its assessment of expected credit losses. It therefore utilized its own historical credit loss experience by each loan segment over an economic cycle, while excluding loss experience from certain acquired institutions (i.e., failed banks). For most of the segment models for collectively evaluated loans, the Company incorporated two or more macroeconomic drivers using a statistical regression modeling methodology.
Management considers forward-looking information in estimating expected credit losses. The Company subscribes to a third-party service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the United States economy. The baseline, along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios, is used by Management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses. The baseline forecast incorporates a 50% probability of the United States economy performing better than this projection and the same as the probability that it will perform worse. Management has evaluated the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and has made adjustments as needed. For the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straight-line approach. The Company generally utilizes a four-quarter forecast and a four-quarter reversion period.
Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL, Management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e., formulaic model results). Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework that includes the following: 1) Lending Policy; 2) Economic conditions not captured in models; 3) Volume and Mix of Loan Portfolio; 4) Past Due Trends; 5) Concentration Risk; 6) External Factors; and 7) Model Limitations.
When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with its segment, the asset is assessed to determine whether it should be included in another pool or should be individually evaluated. The Company consolidated the ACL models and due to the size of the combined company, elected to increase the threshold for individually-evaluated loans to all non-accrual loans with a net book balance in excess of $1.0 million. Management will monitor the credit environment and make adjustments to this threshold in the future if warranted. Based on the threshold above, consumer financial assets will generally remain in pools unless they meet the dollar threshold. The expected credit losses on individually-evaluated loans will be estimated based on discounted cash flow analysis unless the loan meets the criteria for use of the fair value of collateral, either by virtue of an expected foreclosure or through meeting the definition of collateral-dependent. Financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and that the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset.
Management measures expected credit losses over the contractual term of a loan. When determining the contractual term, the Company considers expected prepayments but is precluded from considering expected extensions, renewals, or modifications, unless the Company reasonably expects it will execute a troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) with a borrower. In the event of a reasonably-expected TDR, the Company factors the reasonably-expected TDR into the current expected credit losses estimate. For consumer loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the borrower’s application for a modification (i.e., the borrower qualifies for the TDR) or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. For commercial loans, the point at which a TDR is reasonably expected is when the Company approves the loan for modification or when the Credit Administration department approves loan concessions on substandard loans. The Company uses a discounted cash flow methodology for a TDR to calculate the effect of the concession provided to the borrower within the ACL.
A restructuring that results in only a delay in payments that is insignificant is not considered an economic concession. In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in order to provide borrowers with flexibility with respect to repayment terms. The Company’s payment relief assistance includes forbearance, deferrals, extension and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession meets the criteria as defined under the CARES Act. or purchased credit-deteriorated, otherwise referred to herein as PCD, assets are defined as acquired individual financial assets (or acquired groups of financial assets with similar risk characteristics) that, as of the date of acquisition, have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as determined by the Company’s assessment. The Company records acquired PCD loans by adding the expected credit losses (i.e., allowance for credit losses) to the purchase price of the financial assets rather than recording through the provision for credit losses in the income statement. The expected credit loss, as of the acquisition day, of a PCD loan is added to the allowance for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is the difference between the unpaid principal balance and the amortized cost basis as of the acquisition date. Subsequent to the acquisition date, the change in the ACL on PCD loans is recognized through the provision for credit losses. The non-credit discount or premium is accreted or amortized, respectively, into interest income over the remaining life of the PCD loan on a level-yield basis. In accordance with the transition requirements within the standard, the Company’s acquired credit-impaired loans (i.e., ACI
or Purchased Credit Impaired) were treated as PCD loans.
The Company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status. Therefore, Management excludes the accrued interest receivable balance from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the portfolio and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. As of December 31, 2020, the accrued interest receivable for loans recorded in Other Assets was $93.9 million.
The Company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an off-balance sheet exposure. These primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit. The expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet with an offsetting income statement expense. Management has determined that a majority of the Company’s off-balance-sheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable. As part of the new combined ACL methodology implemented during 2020, Management completed a funding study based on historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments. Management applied this funding rate, along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment, to unfunded loan commitments, excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit, to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments. As of December 31, 2020, the liability recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments was $43.4 million. The current adjustment to the ACL for unfunded commitments is recognized through the provision for credit losses in the Statements of Income.
Other Real Estate Owned and Bank Property Held For Sale
Other real estate owned (“OREO”) consists of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans. Prior to the merger with CSFL, the Company classified former branch sites as held for sale OREO. During the second quarter of 2020 and with the merger with CSFL, the Company elected to reclassify these assets as bank property held for sale and report on a separate line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both OREO and bank property held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and the fair value was determined on the basis of current valuations obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs. At the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral, for OREO, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the ACL. At the time a bank property is no longer in service and is moved to held for sale, any excess of the current book value over fair value is recorded as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Subsequent adjustments to this value are described in the following paragraph.
The Company report subsequent declines in the fair value of OREO and bank properties held for sale below the new cost basis through valuation adjustments. Significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of these properties, and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility. In response to market conditions and other economic factors, Management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy. As a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition, the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from the current valuations used to determine the fair value of these properties. Management reviews the value of these properties periodically and adjusts the values as appropriate. Revenue and expenses from OREO operations as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value are recorded as OREO expense and loan related expense, a component of non-interest expense.
Business Combinations and Method of Accounting for Loans Acquired
The Company accounts for its acquisitions under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting. All identifiable assets acquired, including loans, are recorded at fair value. We adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, on January 1, 2020 which now requires us to record purchased financial assets with credit deterioration (PCD assets), defined as a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance, at the purchase price plus the allowance for credit losses expected at the time of acquisition. Under this method, there is no credit loss expense affecting net income on acquisition of PCD assets. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as credit loss expense (or reversal of credit loss expense) in subsequent periods as they arise. Any non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration shall be
allocated to each individual asset. At the acquisition date, the initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis shall be allocated to individual assets to appropriately allocate any non-credit discount or premium. The non-credit discount or premium, after the adjustment for the allowance for credit losses, shall be accreted to interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date.
A purchased financial asset that does not qualify as a PCD asset is accounted for similar to an originated financial asset. Generally, this means that an entity recognizes the allowance for credit losses for non-PCD assets through net income at the time of acquisition. In addition, both the credit discount and non-credit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets that do not qualify as PCD assets shall be allocated to each individual asset. This combined discount or premium shall be accreted to interest income using the effective yield method.
For further discussion of our loan accounting and acquisitions, see Note 2-Mergers and Acquisitions, Note 5-Loans and Note 6-Allowance for Credit Losses to the audited condensed consolidated financial statements.
Premises and Equipment
Land is carried at cost. Office equipment, furnishings, and buildings are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation computed principally on the declining-balance and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the terms of the related leases including lease renewals only when the Company is reasonably assured of the aggregate term of the lease. Additions to premises and equipment and major replacements are added to the accounts at cost. Maintenance and repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense when incurred. Gains and losses on routine dispositions are reflected in current operations.
Leases (Topic 842) and Method of Adoption
On January 1, 2019, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Topic 842 was subsequently amended by ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical Expedient for Transition to Topic 842; ASU No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases; ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements; and ASU No. 2019-01, Codification Improvements to Topic 842 Leases. The purpose of the update was to increase transparency and comparability between organizations that enter into lease agreements. The key difference between the previous guidance and the update is the recognition of a right-of-use asset (ROU) and lease liability on the statement of financial position for those leases previously classified as operating leases under the old guidance. Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 842 defines a lease as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment (an identified asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration. In applying this standard, we reviewed our material contracts to determine if they included a lease by this new definition and did not identify any new leases. Our lease agreements in which ASC Topic 842 has been applied are primarily for real estate properties, including retail branch locations, operations and administration locations and stand-alone ATM locations. These leases have lease terms from greater than 12 months to leases with options of more than 24 years. Related to lease payment terms, some are fixed payments or based on a fixed annual increases while others are variable and the annual increases are based on market rates. The Company performed an analysis on equipment leases for the implementation of ASC Topic 842 and determined the number and dollar amount of our equipment leases was not material.
A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. An entity may choose to use either (1) its effective date or (2) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. We chose the transition method of adoption provided by ASU 2018-11, Leases (Topic 842) - Targeted Improvements, where we initially apply the new lease standard at the effective date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption if applicable. Therefore, we applied this standard to all existing leases as of the adoption date of January 1, 2019, recording a ROU asset and a lease liability in an equal amount. We did not have a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. With this transition method, we did not have to restate comparative prior periods presented in the financial statements related to ASC Topic 842, but will present comparative prior periods disclosures using the previous accounting guidance for leases. This adoption method is considered a change in accounting principle requiring additional disclosure of the nature of and reason for the change,
which is solely a result of the adoption of the required standard.
ASC Topic 842 provides a package of practical expedients in applying the lease standard that had to be chosen at the date of adoption. We chose to elect this package of practical expedients. With this election, we do not have to reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain a lease, do not have to reassess the classification of any expired or existing leases, do not have to separate lease and non-lease components and can account for both as a single lease component, and do not have to reassess initial direct costs or cash incentives for any existing leases due to immateriality. In addition, we chose not to apply ASC Topic 842 to short-term leases (leases with terms of 12 months or less) and not to record an underlying ROU asset or lease liability based on the uncertainty around the renewal of these leases. The Company will recognize lease expense for such leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We determined that we do not have any leases classified as finance leases and that all of our leases are operating leases at adoption. Two finance leases were acquired through the merger with CSFL, though these leases are immaterial. ROU assets and liabilities for operating leases are recognized at commencement date based on present value of lease payments not yet paid, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the lease commencement date over the lease term. For operating leases, lease expense is determined by the sum of the lease payments to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Based on the transition method that we chose to follow, the commencement date of the lease term for all existing leases is January 1, 2019. The lease term used for the calculation of the initial ROU asset and lease liability will include the initial lease term in addition to any renewal options or termination costs in the lease that we think are reasonably certain to be exercised or incurred. We received input from several levels of management and our corporate real estate department in determining which options were reasonably certain to be exercised. A discount rate is also needed in the calculation of the initial ROU assets and lease liability. ASC Topic 842 requires that the implicit rate within the lease agreement be used if available. If not available, we should use its incremental borrowing rate in effect at the time of the lease commencement date. We looked at the incremental borrowing rate from several of our borrowing sources to determine an average rate to be used in the calculation of the initial ROU asset and lease liability. The Company also considered the term of the borrowings as they relate to the terms of the leases.
The adoption of the new standard had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet, with the recording of ROU asset and lease liability of $82.2 million at the commencement date of January 1, 2019. We did not have a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at commencement. As of December 31, 2020, we had ROU assets of $113.4 million recorded within premises and equipment on the balance sheet and a lease liability of $118.3 million recorded within other liabilities on the balance sheet. The adoption of ASC Topic 842 did not have a material impact on our consolidated income statement.
Bank Owned Life Insurance
Bank owned life insurance (BOLI) are comprised of long-term life insurance contracts on the lives of certain current and past employees where the insurance policy benefits and ownership are retained by the employer. Its cash surrender value is an asset that the Company uses to partially offset the future cost of employee benefits. The cash value accumulation on BOLI is permanently tax deferred if the policy is held to the insured person’s death and certain other conditions are met.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets consist of goodwill, core deposit intangibles, client list intangibles, and noncompetition agreement (“noncompete”) intangibles that result from the acquisition of other banks or branches from other financial institutions. Core deposit intangibles represent the value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions. Client list intangibles represent the value of long-term client relationships for the wealth and trust management business. Noncompete intangibles represent the value of key personnel relative to various competitive factors such as ability to compete, willingness or likelihood to compete, and feasibility based upon the competitive environment, and what the Bank could lose from competition. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the balance of goodwill was $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An
impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by requiring impairment charges to be based on Step 1 of the previous accounting guidance’s two-step impairment test under ASC Topic 350. Under the new guidance, if a reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference. The impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The new standard eliminates the requirement to calculate a goodwill impairment charge using Step 2 which involved calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment. The standard does not change the guidance on completing Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity will still be able to perform today’s optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment before determining whether to proceed to the quantitative step of determining whether the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds it fair value. This guidance was effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020.
The Company evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of April 30, 2020, our annual test date, considering the effects of COVID-19 and determined that no impairment charge was necessary.
Core deposit intangibles, client list intangibles, and noncompetition (“noncompete”) intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks. This includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions. Core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long-term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions. Core deposit intangibles, included in core deposit and other intangibles, are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the deposit accounts acquired (generally 10 to 13 years) on either (1) the straight-line method or (2) an accelerated basis method which reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from the accounts. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. Client list intangibles represent the value of long-term client relationships for the correspondent banking and wealth and trust management business. Client list intangibles, included in core deposit and other intangibles, are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the client lists acquired (generally 15 years) on the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. Noncompete intangibles represent the value of key personnel relative to various competitive factors such as ability to compete, willingness or likelihood to compete, and feasibility based upon the competitive environment, and what the Bank could lose from competition. Noncompete intangibles, included in core deposit and other intangibles are amortized over the life of the underlying noncompete agreements (generally 2 to 3 years) on the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness.
Mortgage Servicing Rights
The Company has a mortgage loan servicing portfolio with related mortgage servicing rights. Mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) represent the present value of the future net servicing fees from servicing mortgage loans. Servicing assets and servicing liabilities must be initially measured at fair value, if practicable. For subsequent measurements, an entity can choose to measure servicing assets and liabilities either based on fair value or lower of cost or market. The Company uses the fair value measurement option for MSRs.
The methodology used to determine the fair value of MSRs is subjective and requires the development of a number of assumptions, including anticipated prepayments of loan principal. Fair value is determined by estimating the present value of the asset’s future cash flows utilizing estimated market based prepayment rates and discount rates, interest rates and other economic factors and assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and with the use of independent third party appraisals. Risks inherent in the MSRs valuation include higher than expected prepayment rates and/or delayed receipt of cash flows. The value of MSRs is significantly affected by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. In general, during periods of declining interest rates, the value of mortgage servicing rights declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage refinance activity. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the value of servicing rights generally increases due to reduced refinance activity. MSRs are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income each period in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company also uses derivative instruments to mitigate the income statement effect of changes in fair value due to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions of its MSRs.
Transfer of Financial Assets
Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over the transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when: (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity. The Company reviews all sales of loans by evaluating specific terms in the sales documents and believes that the criteria discussed above to qualify for sales treatment have been met as loans have been transferred for cash and the notes and mortgages for all loans in each sale are endorsed and assigned to the transferee. As stated in the commitment document, the Buyer has no recourse with these loans except in the case of fraud. In certain sales, mortgage servicing rights may be retained and in other programs potential loss exposure from the credit enhancement obligation may be retained, both of which are evaluated and appropriately measured at the date of sale.
The Company packages fixed rate conforming mortgage loans as securities to investors issued through Fannie Mae and sold to third party investors or sells them to satisfy cash forward mandatory commitments to Fannie Mae. The Company records loan securitizations or cash forwards as a sale when the transferred loans are legally isolated from its creditors and the accounting criteria for a sale are met. Gains or losses recorded on loan securitizations and cash forwards depend in part on the net carrying amount of the loans sold, which is allocated between the loans sold and retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of sale. The Company generally retains mortgage servicing rights on residential mortgage loans sold in the secondary market. Loans transferred to “held-for-sale” with the intention of disposal through a bulk loan sale will be sold with servicing released. Since quoted market prices are not typically available, the fair value of retained interests is estimated through the services of a third party service provider to determine the net present value of expected future cash flows. Such models incorporate management’s best estimates of key variables, such as prepayment speeds and discount rates that would be used by market participants and are appropriate for the risks involved. Gains and losses incurred on loans sold to third party investors are included in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Method of Adoption
On January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASU Topic 606”). The majority of our revenue is derived primarily from interest income from receivables (loans) and securities. Other revenues are derived from fees received in connection with deposit accounts, mortgage banking activities including gains from the sale of loans and loan origination fees, correspondent banking activities including revenue from the sale of fixed income securities and fees from hedging services, and trust and investment advisory services. The core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
The Company adopted ASU Topic 606 using the retrospective transition approach which requires restatement of prior periods. The Company selected this method even though there were no material changes in the timing of revenue recognition due to the fact that ASU Topic 606 requires us to report network costs associated with debit card and ATM transactions netted against the related fees from such transactions. Previously, such network costs were reported as a component of other noninterest expense. The Company restated prior periods for this reclassification. For years 2020, 2019, and 2018, gross interchange and debit card transaction fees totaled $30.2 million, $24.5 million and $33.0 million, respectively while related network costs totaled $16.5 million, $11.9 million and $12.1 million, respectively. On a net basis, the Company reported $13.7 million, $12.6 million and $20.9 million, respectively, as interchange and debit card transactions fees in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income as noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. This adoption method is considered a change in accounting principle requiring additional disclosure of the nature of and reason for the change, which is solely a result of the adoption of the required standard. When applying the retrospective approach under ASU Topic 606, the Company has elected, as a practical expedient, to apply the revenue standard only to contracts that are not completed as of January 1, 2018. A completed contract is considered to be a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized in accordance with revenue guidance that was in effect before January 1, 2018. There were no uncompleted contracts as of January 1, 2018 for which application of the new standard required an adjustment to retained earnings.
The following disclosures related to ASU Topic 606 involve income derived from contracts with customers.
Within the scope of ASU Topic 606, the Company maintains contracts to provide services, primarily for investment advisory and/or custody of assets. Through the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, the Bank, and South State Advisory, Inc., the Company contracts with its customers to perform IRA, Trust, and/or Custody and Agency advisory services. Total revenue recognized from these contracts with customers was $29.4 million, $29.2 million and $30.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Bank contracts with its customers to perform deposit account services. Total revenue recognized from these contracts with customers is $85.7 million, $76.4 million and $82.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Due to the nature of our relationship with the customers that we provide services, we do not incur costs to obtain contracts and there are no material incremental costs to fulfill these contracts that should be capitalized.
Disaggregation of Revenue - The portfolio of services provided to the Company’s customers which generates revenue for which the revenue recognition standard applies consists of approximately 1.1 million active contracts at December 31, 2020. the Company haves disaggregated revenue according to the timing of the transfer of service. Total revenue derived from contracts in which services are transferred at a point in time was $182.8 million, $104.3 million and $113.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Total revenue derived from contracts in which services are transferred over time was $17.9 million, $19.0 million and $19.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Revenue is recognized as the services are provided to the customers. Economic factors impacting the customers could affect the nature, amount, and timing of these cash flows, as unfavorable economic conditions could impair the customers’ ability to provide payment for services. This risk is mitigated as we generally deduct payments from customers’ accounts as services are rendered.
Contract Balances - The timing of revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable on our balance sheet. Most contracts call for payment by a charge or deduction to the respective customer account but there are some that require a receipt of payment from the customer. For fee per transaction contracts, the customers are billed as the transactions are processed. For hourly rate and monthly service contracts related to trust and some investment revenues, the customers are billed monthly (generally as a percentage basis point of the market value of the investment account). In some cases, specific to South State Advisory, Inc., customers are billed in advance for quarterly services to be performed based on the past quarter’s average account balance. These do create contract liabilities or deferred revenue, as the customers pay in advance for service. Neither the contract liabilities nor the accounts receivables balances are material to the Company’s balance sheet.
Performance Obligations - A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of account in ASU Topic 606. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The performance obligations for these contracts are satisfied as the service is provided to the customer (either over time or at a point in time). The payment terms of the contracts are typically based on a basis point percentage of the investment account market value, fee per hour of service, or fee for service incurred. There are no significant financing components in the contracts. Excluding deposit services revenues which are mostly billed at a point in time as a fee for services incurred, all other contracts within the scope of ASU Topic 606 contain variable consideration in that fees earned are derived from market values of accounts or from hours worked for services performed which determines the amount of consideration to which we are entitled. The variability is resolved when the hours are incurred or services are provided. The contracts do not include obligations for returns, refunds, or warranties. The contracts are specific to the amounts owed to the Company for services performed during a period should the contracts be terminated.
Significant Judgments - All of the contracts create performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time excluding the contracts billed in advance through South State Advisory, Inc. and some immaterial deposit revenues. Revenue is recognized as services are billed to the customers. Variable consideration does exist for contracts related to our trust and investment services as revenues are based on market values and services performed. The Company has adopted the right-to-invoice practical expedient for trust management contracts through South State Bank which we contract with our customers to perform IRA, Trust, and/or Custody services.
Advertising Costs
The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred and advertising communication costs the first time the advertising takes place. The Company may establish accruals for anticipated advertising expenses within the course of a fiscal year.
Comprehensive Income
Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as (1) unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities (2) unrealized gains and losses on effective portions of derivative financial instruments accounted for as cash flow hedges and (3) net change in unrecognized amounts related to pension and post-retirement benefits, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet. Such items, along with net income, are components of total comprehensive income (see Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income on page).
Employee Benefit Plans
The Company’s defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 715, Compensation-Retirement Benefits, which requires the Company to recognize the funded status in its statement of financial position. See Note 18 for information regarding the defined benefit pension plan and Note 19 for information regarding our post-retirement benefit plans. The Company terminated its defined benefit pension plan in 2019. The expected costs of the post retirement benefit plans are being expensed over the period that employees provide service.
The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) allows for a look-back option which establishes the purchase price as an amount based on the lesser of the stock’s market price at the grant date or its market price at the exercise (or purchase) date. For the shares issued in exchange for employee services under the plan, the Company accounts for the plan under the FASB ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, in which the fair value measurement method is used to estimate the fair value of the equity instruments, based on the share price and other measurement assumptions at the grant date. See Note 20 for the amount the Company recognized as expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the tax basis and financial statement basis of gains on acquisitions, available-for-sale securities, allowance for credit losses, write downs of OREO properties, accumulated depreciation, net operating loss carryforwards, accretion income, deferred compensation, intangible assets, mortgage servicing rights, and pension plan and post-retirement benefits. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued relative to unrecognized tax benefits in its respective federal or state income tax accounts. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no material accruals for uncertain tax positions. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Additionally, income tax returns are filed by the Company or its subsidiaries in the state of South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, Florida, Virginia, Alabama, and Mississippi, Tennessee, California, Colorado, Texas, New York, and New York City. Generally, the Company’s federal and state income tax returns are no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years prior to 2017.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) represents income available to common shareholders divided by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share reflects additional shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential shares had been issued. Potential shares that may be issued by the Company relate solely to outstanding stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units (non-vested shares), and warrants, and are determined using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the number of incremental shares is determined by assuming the issuance of stock for the outstanding stock options and warrants, reduced by the number of shares assumed to be repurchased from the issuance proceeds, using the average market price
for the year of the Company’s stock. Weighted-average shares for the basic and diluted EPS calculations have been reduced by the average number of unvested restricted shares.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company’s interest rate risk management strategy incorporates the use of a derivative financial instrument, specifically an interest rate swap, to essentially convert a portion of its variable-rate debt to a fixed rate. Cash flows related to variable-rate debt will fluctuate with changes in an underlying rate index. When effectively hedged, the increases or decreases in cash flows related to the variable-rate debt will generally be offset by changes in cash flows of the derivative instrument designated as a hedge. This strategy is referred to as a cash flow hedge. For derivatives designated as hedging exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge), the derivative’s entire gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings or when the hedge is terminated. For derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately.
The Company also maintains loan swaps which are accounted for as a fair value hedge. This derivative protects the Company from interest rate risk caused by changes in the LIBOR curve in relation to a certain designated fixed rate loan. Fair value hedges convert the fixed rate to a floating rate (see Note 29-Derivative Financial Instruments).
The Company’s risk management strategy for its mortgage banking activities incorporates derivative instruments used to hedge both the value of the mortgage servicing rights and the mortgage pipeline. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedges and are not speculative in nature. The derivative instruments that are used to hedge the value of the mortgage servicing rights include financial forwards, futures contracts, and options written and purchased. When-issued securities and mandatory cash forward trades are typically used to hedge the mortgage pipeline. These instruments derive their cash flows, and therefore their values, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate.
The Company’s risk management strategy also incorporates the use of interest rate swap contracts that help in managing interest rate risk within the loan portfolio and foreign currency exchange. These derivatives are not designated as hedges and are not speculative, and result from a service the Company provides to certain customers. The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. Those interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings (See Note 29-Derivative Financial Instruments).
By using derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to credit and market risk. If the counterparty fails to perform, credit risk is equal to the fair value gain in a derivative. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, this situation generally indicates that the counterparty is obligated to pay the Company, and, therefore, creates a repayment risk for the Company. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, the Company is obligated to pay the counterparty and, therefore, has no repayment risk. The Company minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties that are reviewed periodically by the Company.
The Company’s derivative activities are monitored by its Asset-Liability Management Committee as part of that committee’s oversight of the Company’s asset/liability and treasury functions. The Company’s Asset-Liability Management Committee is responsible for implementing various hedging strategies that are developed through its analysis of data from financial simulation models and other internal and industry sources. The resulting hedging strategies are then incorporated into the overall interest-rate risk management process.
The Company recognizes the fair value of derivatives as assets or liabilities in the financial statements. The accounting for the changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative instrument at inception. The change in fair value of the effective portion of cash flow hedges is accounted for in other comprehensive income rather than net income. Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are not intended as a hedge are accounted for in the net income in the period of the change (see Note 29-Derivative Financial Instruments for further disclosure).
Reclassification
Certain amounts previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on net income and shareholders’ equity.
Subsequent Events
The Company has evaluated subsequent events for accounting and disclosure purposes through the date the financial statements are issued. See Note 32-Subsequent Events for further information.
Recent Accounting and Regulatory Pronouncements
Accounting Standards Adopted in 2020
In February 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2020-02, Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section of Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update adds the content of SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 119 to the FASB Codification. SAB No.119 provides interpretive guidance on methodologies and supporting documentation for measuring credit losses, with a focus on the documentation the staff would normally expect registrants engaged in lending transactions to prepare and maintain to support estimates of current expected credit losses for loan transactions. The ASU also updates the SEC section of the FASB Codification for the delay in the effective date of Topic 842 for public business entities that otherwise would not meet the definition of a public business entity except for a requirement to include its financial information in another entity’s filing with the SEC. The clarification related to SAB No. 119 was adopted in the first quarter of 2020 when ASU 2016-13 was adopted. See ASU 2016-13 below for overall effect of Topic 326 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses on our consolidated financial statements. The change in the effective date for ASU 2016-02 - Leases did not affect the Company in that we adopted the standard in 2019.
In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815. This update, related to ASU 2016-01, clarifies certain aspects brought to the Account Standards Board attention by stakeholders related to these ASUs, but does not change the core principles of these standards. The areas of improvement clarified in this update are related to 1) expected recoveries for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration, 2) transition relief for troubled debt restructurings, 3) disclosures related to accrued interest receivables, 4) financial assets secured by collateral maintenance provisions and 5) conforming amendment to Subtopic 805-20. This clarification was adopted in the first quarter of 2020 when the overall standard was adopted. See ASU 2016-13 below for overall effect of Topic 326 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses on our consolidated financial statements.
In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-05, Targeted Transition Relief (Topic 326 - Financial Instruments-Credit Losses). This update provides entities that have certain instruments within the scope of Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses- Measured at Amortized Cost, with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option in Subtopic 825-10 applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis for eligible instruments, upon adoption of Topic 326. The fair value option election does not apply to held-to-maturity debt securities. An entity that elects the fair value option should subsequently apply the guidance in Subtopics 820-10, Fair Value Measurement-Overall, and 825-10. This update was adopted in the first quarter of 2020 when the overall standard was adopted. See ASU 2016-13 below for overall effect of Topic 326 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses on our consolidated financial statements.
In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments. This update related to ASU 2016-01, ASU 2017-12 and ASU 2016-13 clarifies certain aspects brought to the Account Standards Board attention by stakeholders related to these ASUs, but does not change the core principles of these standards. The clarifications related to ASU 2016-01 and 2017-12 were adopted in the second quarter of 2019 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The clarifications related to ASU 2016-13 were adopted in the first quarter of 2020 when the overall standard was adopted. See ASU 2016-13 below for overall effect of Topic 326 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses on our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820). ASU 2018-13 removes, modifies, and adds certain disclosure requirements in ASC 820 related to Fair Value Measurement on the basis of the concepts in the FASB Concepts Statement Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting - Chapter 8: Notes to Financial Statements. ASU 2018-13 was effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. The ASU requires application of the prospective method of transition (for only the most recent interim or annual period presented in the initial fiscal year of adoption) to the new disclosure requirement additions. The ASU also requires prospective application to any modifications to disclosures made because of the change to the requirements for the narrative description of measurement uncertainty. The effects of all other amendments made by the ASU must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented. This update did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangible-Goodwill and other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. ASU 2017-04 simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by requiring impairment charges to be based on the first step in today’s two-step impairment test under ASC Topic 350 and eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. As amended, the goodwill impairment test consists of one step comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize a goodwill impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. The guidance was effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years. Based on effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and on our stock price, the Company began evaluating its goodwill on a quarterly basis per ASU 2017-04. The most recent analysis as of December 31, 2020 determined there was no impairment of goodwill or other intangibles. The Company will continue to monitor if a triggering event occurs that requires goodwill to be evaluated again.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 requires an entity to utilize a new impairment model known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model to estimate its lifetime “expected credit loss” and record an ACL that, when deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, presents the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The CECL model is expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses for loans, investment securities portfolio, and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Account Policies - Allowance for Credit Losses for further discussion. We adopted the new standard as of January 1, 2020. This standard did not have a material impact on our investment securities portfolio at implementation. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, the Company recorded additional ACL for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. See table below for impact of ASU 2016-13 on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion.
A - The Company did not have any held-to maturity securities as of January 1, 2020. Per our analysis we determined that no ACL was necessary for investment securities - available-for-sale.
B - Accrued interest receivable from acquired credit impaired loans of $1,677 was reclassified to other assets and was offset by the reclass of the grossed up credit discount on acquired credit impaired loans of $3,408 that was moved to the ACL for the purchased credit deteriorated loans.
C - This is the calculated adjustment to the ACL related to the adoption of ASC 326. Additional reserve related to non-acquired loans was $34,049, to acquired loans was $16,981 and to purchased credit deteriorated loans was $3,408.
D - This is the effect of deferred tax assets related to the adjustment to the ACL from the adoption of ASC 326 using a 22% tax rate.
E - This is the adjustment to the reserve for unfunded commitments related to the adoption of ASC 326.
F - This is the net adjustment to retained earnings related to the adoption of ASC 326.
Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards
In March 2020, FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848 - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and subsequently expanded the scope of ASU No. 2020-04 with the issuance of ASU No. 2021-01. These updates provide companies with optional guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. The amendments in this Update provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments in this update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments in this update were effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. An entity may elect to apply the amendments in this update to eligible hedging relationships existing as of the beginning of the interim period that includes March 12, 2020 and to new eligible hedging relationships entered into after the beginning of the interim period that includes March 12, 2020. An entity may elect to apply the amendments for contract modifications as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or prospectively from a date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, up to the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. Once elected, the amendments in this update must be applied prospectively for all eligible contract modifications and hedging relationships. The Company has established a LIBOR Committee and various subcommittees which are continuing to evaluate the impact of adopting ASU 2020-04 on the consolidated financial statements including evaluating all of its contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that will be affected by reference rates that are being discontinued.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The amendments in this update simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. The amendments also improve consistent application of and simplify GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying the amending existing guidance. Some of the simplification items included are 1) simplification for intra-period tax allocations where entities will determine the tax effect of pre-tax income or loss from continuing operations without consideration of the tax effect of other items that are not included in continuing operations, 2) simplification for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year allowing an entity to record a benefit for year-to-date loss in excess of its forecasted loss, and 3) simplify the accounting for income taxes by requiring that an entity recognize a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income as an income-based tax and account for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based tax. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments related to franchise taxes that are partially based on income should be applied on either a retrospective basis for all periods presented or a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. The Company does not believe this update will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans (Subtopic 715-20. ASU 2018-14 amends ASC 715-20 to add, remove, and clarify disclosure requirements for employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. For public business entities, ASU 2018-14 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020 and requires entities to apply the amendment on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not believe that this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
Note 2-Mergers and Acquisitions
CenterState Bank Corporation
On June 7, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of CenterState Bank Corporation (“CSFL”), of Winter Haven, Florida, the bank holding company for CenterState Bank, N.A. (“CSB”), in a stock transaction. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) CSFL merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation (the “Merger”), and (ii) immediately following the Merger, South State Bank (“SSB”), a South Carolina banking corporation and wholly owned bank subsidiary of the Company, merged with and into CSB, a national banking association and wholly owned bank subsidiary of CSFL, with CSB continuing as the surviving bank (the “Bank Merger”). In connection with the Bank Merger, CSB changed its name to “South State Bank, National Association” (hereinafter referred to as the “Bank”). CSFL common shareholders received 0.3001 shares of the Company’s common stock in exchange for each share of CSFL stock resulting in the Company issuing 37,271,069 shares of its common stock. In total, the purchase price for CSFL was recorded at $2.26 billion during the second quarter of 2020 including the value of the conversion of CSFL’s outstanding warrants, stock options and restricted stock units totaling $15.5 million. Subsequently, during the fourth quarter, the purchase price (consideration transferred) decreased by $5.2 million due to an update to the value for stock options assumed and converted in the merger. The stock options assumed reflect their intrinsic value based upon a Black Scholes valuation.
In the acquisition, the Company acquired $13.0 billion of loans, including PPP loans, at fair value, net of $239.5 million, or 1.82%, estimated discount, including a fair value adjustment of $29.8 million recorded during the third quarter, to the outstanding principal balance, representing 113.9% of the Company’s total loans at December 31, 2019. Of the total loans acquired, Management identified $3.1 billion that had more than insignificantly deteriorated since origination and were thus determined to be PCD loans.
In its assumption of the deposit liabilities, the Company believed the deposits assumed from the acquisition have an intangible value. The Company applied ASC Topic 805, which prescribes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles, in a business combination. The Company determined the estimated fair value of the core deposit intangible asset totaled $125.9 million, which will be amortized utilizing a sum-of-the-years’-digit method over an estimated economic life not to exceed ten years. In determining the valuation amount, deposits were analyzed based on factors such as type of deposit, deposit retention, interest rates and age of deposit relationships. During the third quarter, the Company identified an additional intangible related to its correspondent banking business acquired in the CSFL merger of approximately $10.0 million. As a result of the various measurement period adjustments identified during the current year, goodwill was reduced by $39.4 million to $561.0 million.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred approximately $83.0 million of acquisition costs related to this transaction. There were no expenses incurred related to this acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2019. These acquisition costs are reported in merger and branch consolidation related expenses on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income.
The CSFL transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Fair values are preliminary and subject to refinement for up to a year after the closing date of the acquisition.
Explanation of fair value adjustments
(a)- Represents the reversal of CSFL's existing fair value adjustments of $40.7 million and the adjustment to record securities at fair value (premium) totaling $46.2 million (includes reclassification of all securities held as HTM to AFS totaling $175.7 million).
(b)- Represents approximately 2.04%, or $269.1 million, total mark of the loan portfolio including a 1.97%, or $259.7 million credit mark, based on a third party valuation. Also, includes the reversal of CSFL's ending allowance for credit losses of $158.2 million and fair value adjustments of $62.6 million. Fair value was subsequently adjusted by $29.8 million due to a reduction in the loan mark (discount).
(c)- Represents the MTM adjustment of $4.0 million on leased assets partially offset by the write-off of de minimis fixed assets of $1.6 million. Subsequently, the fair value on certain bank premises was adjusted by $2.9 million based on updated appraisals received.
(d)- Represents approximately a 1.28% core deposit intangible, or $125.9 million from a third party valuation. This amount is net of $84.9 million existing core deposit intangible and $1.2 billion of existing goodwill from CSFL’s prior transactions that was reversed. Approximately $10.0 million in a customer list intangible related to the correspondent banking business was subsequently identified and recorded in the third quarter of 2020.
(e)- Represents the reversal of prior valuation reserves of $878,000 and recorded new valuation reserves of $1.7 million on both OREO and other repossessed assets. The fair value was subsequently adjusted based on gains and losses recognized from sales of OREO and other repossessed assets.
(f)- Represents deferred tax assets related to fair value adjustments measured using an estimated tax rate of 22.0%. This includes an adjustment from the CSFL tax rate to our tax rate. The difference in tax rates relates to state income taxes. Additional deferred tax liability related to subsequent fair value adjustments identified and an updated estimated tax rate of 23.78% was approximately $8.2 million.
(g)- Represents a valuation reserve of bank property held for sale of $3.2 million and a fair value adjustment of a lease receivable of $116,000. These amounts are offset by positive fair value adjustment for investment in low income housing of $3.3 million.
(h)- Represents estimated premium for fixed maturity time deposits of $20.2 million partially offset by the reversal of existing CSFL fair value adjustments related to time deposit marks from other merger transactions of $546,000.
(i)- Represents the recording of a discount of $12.5 million on TRUPs from a third party valuation partially offset by the reversal of the existing CSFL discount on TRUPs and other debt of $5.1 million.
(j)- Represents the reversal of an existing $7.1 million unfunded commitment reserve at purchase date partially offset by a fair value adjustment to increase lease liabilities associated with leased facilities totaling $2.5 million. The discount rate applied to the bank owned life insurance split dollar liability was subsequently adjusted resulting in an increase in the other liability of $857,000.
(k)-The purchase price, or the fair value of total consideration transferred, decreased by $5.2 million to $2.9 million for stock options assumed and converted in the merger. The stock options assumed reflect their intrinsic value based upon a Black Sholes valuation.
Comparative and Pro Forma Financial Information for the CSFL Acquisition
Pro-forma data for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 listed in the table below presents pro-forma information as if the CSFL acquisition occurred at the beginning of 2019. These results combine the historical results of CSFL in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Income and, while certain adjustments were made for the estimated impact of certain fair value adjustments and other acquisition-related activity, they are not indicative of what would have occurred had the acquisition taken place on January 1, 2019.
Merger-related costs of $83.0 Million from the CSFL acquisition were incurred during 2020 and were excluded from pro forma information above. In addition, no adjustments have been made to the pro-formas to eliminate the provision for loan losses in 2019 of CSFL in the amount of $3.8 million. Pro-forma data for the year 2020 eliminated the non-PCD provision recorded on the acquisition date of $119.1 million. If the CSFL acquisition had occurred at the beginning of 2019, the acquisition date loan loss reserve amount would have been recorded directly through retained earnings upon adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020. No adjustments have been made to reduce the impact of any OREO write downs, investment securities sold or repayment of borrowings recognized by CSFL in either 2020 or 2019. Expenses related to systems conversions and other costs of integration are expected to be recorded during 2020 and 2021 for the CSFL merger. The Company expects to achieve further operating cost savings and other business synergies as a result of the acquisitions which are not reflected in the pro forma amounts above. The total revenues presented above represent pro-forma net interest income plus pro-forma noninterest income:
The disclosures regarding the results of operations for CSFL subsequent to the acquisition date are omitted as this information is not practical to obtain. Although the Company has not converted CSFL’s core system, the majority of the fixed costs and purchase accounting entries were booked on the Company’s core system making it impractical to
determine CSFL’s results of operation on a stand-alone basis.
Note 3-Trading Securities
Realized and unrealized gains and losses are included in trading revenue, a component of noninterest income. Securities purchased for this portfolio have primarily been municipal securities.
The trading portfolio is related to the Correspondent Banking Division that was acquired during the merger with CSFL on June 7, 2020. A list of the activity in this portfolio since June 7, 2020 is summarized below.
Note 4-Investment Securities
The following is the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities held-to-maturity:
The following is the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities available-for-sale:
* The Company’s government-sponsored entities holdings are comprised of debt securities offered by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) or Freddie Mac, Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”) or Fannie Mae, FHLB, and Federal Farm Credit Banks (“FFCB”).
** All of the mortgage-backed securities are issued by government-sponsored entities; there are no private-label holdings. Also included in the Company’s government-sponsored entities are debt securities offered by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”), which have the full faith and credit backing of the United States Government.
The following is the amortized cost and carrying value of other investment securities:
The Company’s other investment securities consist of non-marketable equity securities that have no readily determinable market value. Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has determined that there was no impairment on its other investment securities.
The amortized cost and fair value of debt and equity securities at December 31, 2020 by contractual maturity are detailed below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.
The following table summarizes information with respect to sales of available-for-sale securities:
There was a net realized gain of $50,000 on the sale of securities for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to a net realized gain of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and a net realized loss of $655,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The net realized gain of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes net realized gains totaling $5.4 million from the sale of VISA Class B shares in the first and second quarters of 2019. If the gains from the VISA Class B share are excluded in 2019, the Company would have had a net realized loss of $2.7 million on the sale of available-for-sale securities for the year ended December 31, 2019.
There were no sales of held-to-maturity securities for years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.
The Company had 86 securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2020. Information pertaining to securities with gross unrealized losses at December 31, 2020 and 2019, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position follows:
Management evaluates securities for impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Credit losses are calculated individually, rather than collectively, using a discounted cash flow method, whereby Management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. The credit loss component would be recognized through the provision for credit losses. Consideration is given to (1) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer including looking at default and delinquency rates, (2) the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the investments, (3) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (4) our intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value or for a debt security whether it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovering its fair value, (5) the anticipated outlook for changes in the general level of interest rates, (6) credit ratings, (7) third party guarantees, and (8) collateral values. In analyzing an issuer’s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the results of reviews of the issuer’s financial condition, and the issuer’s anticipated ability to pay the contractual cash flows of the investments. The Company performed an analysis that determined that the following securities have a zero expected credit loss: U.S. Treasury Securities, Agency-Backed Securities including securities issued by GNMA, FNMA, FHLB, FFCB and SBA. All of the U.S. Treasury and Agency-Backed Securities have the full faith and credit backing of the United State Government or one of its agencies. Municipal securities and all other securities that do not have a zero expected credit loss are evaluated quarterly to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with a decline in fair value. All debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020 continue to perform as scheduled and we do not believe that there is a credit loss or that a provision for credit losses is necessary. Also, as part of our evaluation of our intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market, we consider our investment strategy, cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy and interest rate risk position. We do not currently intend to sell the securities within the portfolio and it is not more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the debt securities. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Account Policies for further discussion
Management continues to monitor all of our securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of its securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, investment securities with a carrying value of $2.1 billion and $726.1 million, respectively, were pledged to secure public funds deposits and for other purposes required and permitted by law. At
December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying amount of the securities pledged to collateralize repurchase agreements was $515.9 million and $242.2 million, respectively.
Note 5-Loans
The following is a summary of total loans:
(1)Construction and land development includes loans for both commercial construction and development, as well as loans for 1-4 family construction and lot loans.
(2)Consumer owner occupied includes loans on both 1-4 family owner occupied property, as well as 1-4 family investment rental property.
In accordance with the adoption of ASU 2016-13, the above table reflects the loan portfolio at the amortized cost basis for the year ended December 31, 2020, to include net deferred fees of $35.6 million and unamortized discount total related to loans acquired of $97.7 million. Accrued interest receivable (AIR) of $93.9 million is accounted for separately and reported in other assets. The allowance for credit losses in the comparative periods includes the day 2 valuation allowance on the acquired credit impaired loans, which was $5.1 million at December 31, 2019.
The comparative periods in the above table reflect the loan portfolio prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. Prior periods were reported as shown in the below tables, with the acquired loans being net of unearned income and of related discounts, which includes the credit discount on the acquired credit impaired loans.
The following is a summary of non-acquired loans for comparative periods, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13:
The following is a summary of acquired non-credit impaired loans accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-20, net of related discount, for comparative periods, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13:
The unamortized discount related to the acquired non-credit impaired loans totaled $20.3 million at December 31, 2019.
In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 310-30, we aggregated acquired loans that have common risk characteristics into pools of loan categories as described in the table below. The following is a summary of acquired credit impaired loans accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-30 (identified as credit impaired at the time of acquisition), net of related discount, for comparative periods, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13:
The Company has purchased loans through its acquisition of CSFL, for which there was, at acquisition, evidence of more than insignificant deterioration of credit quality since origination. The carrying amount of those loan, at acquisition, is as follows:
The following three tables are presented for comparative periods, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13, in which accounting rules were different, therefore unrelated to the current reporting period:
Contractual loan payments receivable, estimates of amounts not expected to be collected, other fair value adjustments and the resulting carrying values of total acquired credit impaired loans as of December 31, 2019 are as follows:
Income on acquired credit impaired loans that are not impaired at the acquisition date is recognized in the same manner as loans impaired at the acquisition date. A portion of the fair value discount on acquired non-impaired loans has been ascribed as an accretable yield that is accreted into interest income over the estimated remaining life of the loans. The remaining nonaccretable difference represents cash flows not expected to be collected.
The following are changes in the carrying value of acquired credit impaired loans:
The following are changes in the carrying amount of accretable yield for acquired credit impaired loans:
The table above reflects the changes in the carrying amount of accretable yield for the acquired credit impaired loans and shows both the contractual interest income and incremental accretion for each year. In 2019, the accretable yield balance declined by $34.7 million as total contractual interest and accretion income of $44.3 million was recognized. This was partially offset by improved expected cash flows of $9.8 million. The improved cash flows for previous years were adjusted to accurately reflect the split between income types.
As of December 31, 2019, the table above excludes $1.8 billion ($1.8 billion in contractual principal less a $20.3 million discount) in acquired loans which are accounted for under FASB ASC Topic 310-20. These loans were identified as either performing with no discount related to the credit or as a revolving lines of credit (commercial or consumer) at acquisition. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of these acquired loans totaled $2.6 billion ($2.6 billion in contractual principal less a $33.4 million remaining discount).
As part of the ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of our loan portfolio, Management tracks certain credit quality indicators, including trends related to (i) the level of classified loans, (ii) net charge-offs, (iii) non-performing loans (see details below), and (iv) the general economic conditions of the markets that we serve.
The Company utilizes a risk grading matrix to assign a risk grade to each commercial loan. Classified loans are assessed at a minimum every six months. A description of the general characteristics of the risk grades is as follows:
•Pass-These loans range from minimal credit risk to average, however, still acceptable credit risk.
•
Special mention-A special mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve Management’s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or the institution’s credit position at some future date.
•
Substandard-A substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. A substandard loan is characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
•
Doubtful-A doubtful loan has all of the weaknesses inherent in one classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of the currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.
Construction and land development loans in the following table are on commercial and speculative real estate. Consumer owner occupied loans are on investment or rental 1-4 properties.
The following table presents the credit risk profile by risk grade of commercial loans by origination year:
For the consumer segment, delinquency of a loan is determined by past due status. Consumer loans are automatically placed on nonaccrual status once the loan is 90 days past due. Construction and land development loans are on 1-4 properties and lots. The following table presents the credit risk profile by past due status of consumer loans by origination year:

The following is a summary of information pertaining to nonaccrual loans by class, including restructured loans:
(1)- Greater than 90 days accruing and non-accrual with no allowance loans at December 31, 2020.
There is no interest income recognized during the period on nonaccrual loans. The Company follows its nonaccrual policy by reversing contractual interest income in the income statement when the Company places a loan on nonaccrual status. Loans on nonaccrual status in which there is no allowance assigned are individually evaluated loans that do not carry a specific reserve. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further detailed on individually evaluated loans. The increase in the nonaccrual balance in the above schedule, compared to December 31, 2019, is mainly due to the addition of nonaccrual loans of $69.3 million through the merger with CSFL in the second quarter. The increase was also partially due to the addition of $21.0 million of PCD loans, formerly accounted for as credit impaired loans, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13. These loans were previously excluded from nonaccrual loans. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 resulted in the discontinuation of the pool-level accounting for acquired credit impaired loans and replaced it with loan-level evaluation for nonaccrual status.
The following is a summary of information pertaining to non-acquired nonaccrual loans by class, including restructured loans, for comparative periods, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13:
The following is a summary of information pertaining to acquired non-credit impaired nonaccrual loans by class, including restructured loans, for comparative periods, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13:
The following is a summary of collateral dependent loans, by type of collateral, and the extent to which they are collateralized during the period:
The Bank designates individually evaluated loans (excluding TDRs) on non-accrual with a net book balance exceeding the designated threshold as collateral dependent loans. Collateral dependent loans are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. These loans do not share common risk characteristics and are not included within the collectively evaluated loans for determining ACL. Under ASC 326-20-35-6, the Bank has adopted the collateral maintenance practical expedient to measure the ACL based on the fair value of collateral. The ACL is calculated on an individual loan basis based on the shortfall between the fair value of the loan's collateral, which is adjusted for selling costs, and amortized cost. If the fair value of the collateral exceeds the amortized cost, no allowance is required. During the second quarter of 2020, the Bank increased the threshold limit for loans individually evaluated from $500,000 to $1.0 million. The significant changes above in collateral percentage are due to appraisal value updates or changes in the number of loans within the asset class and collateral type. Due to the threshold limit change, some of the loans with high collateral value have been removed. Overall collateral dependent loans decreased by $14.9 million from December 31, 2019 compared to the balance at December 31, 2020. Although additional collateral dependent loans of $17.6 million were assumed through the CSFL merger in June 2020, the increase was mostly offset by a reduction in collateral dependent loans, which was resulted from the change in the threshold limit.
In the course of resolving delinquent loans, the Bank may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans. Any loans that are modified are reviewed by the Bank to determine if a TDR, sometimes referred to herein as a restructured loan, has occurred. The Bank designates loan modifications as TDRs when it grants a concession to a borrower that it would not otherwise consider due to the borrower experiencing financial difficulty (FASB ASC Topic 310-40). The concessions granted on TDRs generally include terms to reduce the interest rate, extend the term of the debt obligation, or modify the payment structure on the debt obligation. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for how such modifications are factored into the determination of the ACL.
Loans on nonaccrual status at the date of modification are initially classified as nonaccrual TDRs. Loans on accruing status at the date of concession are initially classified as accruing TDRs if the note is reasonably assured of repayment and performance is expected in accordance with its modified terms. Such loans may be designated as nonaccrual loans subsequent to the concession date if reasonable doubt exists as to the collection of interest or principal under the restructuring agreement. Nonaccrual TDRs are returned to accruing status when there is economic substance to the restructuring, there is documented credit evaluation of the borrower’s financial condition, the remaining balance is reasonably assured of repayment in accordance with its modified terms, and the borrower has demonstrated sustained repayment performance in accordance with the modified terms for a reasonable period of time (generally a minimum of six months). In prior periods, our TDR levels were deemed to be immaterial, therefore no comparative data is shown.
The Company elected the accounting policy in the CARES Act to not apply TDR accounting to loans modified for borrowers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic if the concession meets the criteria stipulated in the CARES Act. Details in regards to the Company’s implemented loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic under the CARES Act is disclosed under the Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
The following table presents loans designated as TDRs segregated by class and type of concession that were restructured during the year ended December 31, 2020.
At December 31, 2020, the balance of accruing TDRs was $14.6 million. The Company had $576,493 remaining availability under commitments to lend additional funds on restructured loans at December 31, 2020. The amount of specific reserve associated with restructured loans was $1.2 million at December 31, 2020.
The following table presents the changes in status of loans restructured within the previous 12 months as of December 31, 2020 by type of concession. The subsequent default in this case had no impact on the expected credit losses.
Note 6-Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL)
See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for credit losses.
The following table presents a disaggregated analysis of activity in the allowance for credit losses as follows:
(1)- Additional provision for credit losses of $43.4 million was recorded during 2020 for the allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments that is not considered in the above table. Of this amount, $9.6 million was from the initial impact from the merger with CSFL.
(2)- The ACL for the C&I segment does not include reserve for PPP loans, which are government guaranteed.
An aggregated analysis of the changes in allowance for loan losses, for comparative periods, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is as follows:
The following tables present a disaggregated analysis of activity in the allowance for loan losses and loan balances for non-acquired loans, for comparative periods, prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-13:

* The carrying value of acquired credit impaired loans includes a non-accretable difference which is primarily associated with the assessment of credit quality of acquired loans.
Note 7-Other Real Estate Owned and Bank Premises Held for Sale
The following is a summary of the changes in the carrying value of OREO and Bank Premises Held for Sale:
At December 31, 2020, there were a total of 42 properties included in OREO which compares to 47 properties included in OREO, at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, there were a total of 33 properties included in bank premises held for sale which compares to 12 properties included in premises held for sale, at December 31, 2019. During the second quarter of 2020, a reclassification was made so that bank property held for sale is now separately disclosed on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $804,000 in residential real estate included in OREO and $5.0 million in residential real estate consumer mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure.
Note 8-Premises and Equipment
Premises and equipment consisted of the following:
Depreciation expense charged to operations was $25.3 million, $18.2 million, and $18.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The overall increase in premises and equipment and depreciation from prior year was due the merger with CSFL in June 2020 when $330.3 million in premises and equipment was acquired.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, computer software with an original cost of $37.4 million and $13.7 million, respectively, were being amortized using the straight-line method over thirty-six months. Amortization expense totaled
$2.4 million, $1.2 million, and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. There were $2.9 million in capitalized implementation costs at December 31, 2020 related to internal use software following the guidance of ASU No. 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. Of this amount, $2.1 million was related to a new digital banking platform and $743,000 was related to a new public website. These costs are being held in a suspense account classified as other assets on the balance sheet until the project is complete when they will then begin to be depreciated.
See Note 22-Lease Commitments for further details on lease right of use asset.
Note 9-Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets
The Company evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of April 30, 2020, its annual test date, and obtained a third-party valuation during the fourth quarter of 2020 and concluded that no impairment charge was necessary. The Company will continue to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’ business, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition. The following is a summary of changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill:
The Company’s other intangible assets, consisting of core deposit intangibles, noncompete intangibles, and client list intangibles are included on the face of the balance sheet. The following is a summary of gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of other intangible assets:
Amortization expense totaled $27.0 million and $13.1 million and $14.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Other intangibles are amortized using either the straight-line method or an accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives, with lives generally between 2 and 15 years. Estimated amortization expense for other intangibles for each of the next five years is as follows:
Note 10-Deposits
The Company’s total deposits are comprised of the following:
At December 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company had $814.2 million and $303.2 million in certificates of deposits of $250,000 and greater, respectively. At December 31, 2020 the Company held $600.0 million of traditional, out-of-market brokered deposits. At December 31, 2019, there were no traditional, out-of-market brokered deposits.
At December 31, 2020, the scheduled maturities of time deposits (includes $5.3 million of other time deposits) of all denominations are as follows:
Note 11-Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
Federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase generally mature within one to three days from the transaction date, but may have maturities as long as nine months per our policies. Certain of the borrowings have no defined maturity date. Information concerning federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are below:
Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”) represent funds received from customers, generally on an overnight or continuous basis, which are collateralized by investment securities owned or, at times, borrowed and re-hypothecated by the Company. Repurchase agreements are subject to terms and conditions of the master repurchase agreements between the Company and the client and are accounted for as secured borrowings. The Company monitors the fair value of the underlying securities on a daily basis. Some securities underlying these agreements include arrangements to resell securities from broker-dealers approved by the Company. Repurchase
agreements are reflected at the amount of cash received in connection with the transaction and included in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase on the consolidated balance sheets.
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company’s repurchase agreements totaled $394.9 million and $242.2 million, respectively. All of the Company’s repurchase agreements were overnight or continuous (until-further-notice) agreements at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. These borrowings were collateralized with government, government-sponsored enterprise, or state and political subdivision-issued securities with a carrying value of $515.9 million and $242.2 million at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Declines in the value of the collateral would require the Company to increase the amounts of securities pledged.
Note 12-Other Borrowings
The Company’s other borrowings were as follows:
(1) All of the junior subordinated debt above is adjustable rate based on three-month LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 140 bps to 305 bps.
(2) The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.0% per year, from, and including, May 19, 2016, to, but excluding, June 1, 2021. On June 1, 2021, the Notes convert to a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 479 bps. The Notes may be redeemed by the Company after June 1, 2021.
(3) The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.5% per year, to, but excluding, June 30, 2022. On June 30, 2022, the Notes convert to a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus 467 bps. The Notes may be redeemed by the Company after June 30, 2022.
(4) The $200 million in Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.75% per year, to, but excluding, June 1, 2025. On June 1, 2025, the Notes convert to a floating rate equal to SOFR plus 562 bps. The Notes may be redeemed by the Company after June 1, 2025. The carrying balance of this debt is $196.9 million when netted against debt issuance costs of $3.1 million.
(5) These subordinated notes are not classified as Tier 2 Capital for regulatory capital purposes.
Short-Term Borrowings
The Company has from time-to-time entered into borrowing agreements with the FHLB and FRB. Borrowings under these agreements are collateralized by stock in the FHLB, qualifying first and second mortgage residential loans, investment securities, and commercial real estate loans under a blanket-floating lien.
As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding Short-Term borrowings. At December 31, 2019, there was $700.0 million in outstanding Short-Term FHLB advances. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the average balance for short-term borrowings was $745.9 million and $538.6 million, respectively. There were no short-term borrowings at December 31, 2020, but the year-to-date weighted average cost for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 0.63%. The weighted average cost of the short-term borrowing at period end December 31, 2019 was 1.73% and the weighted average cost year to date for the year ended December 31, 2019 was 2.35%. Net eligible loans of the Company pledged via a blanket lien to the FHLB for advances and letters of credit at December 31, 2020, were approximately $3.6 billion and investment securities pledged were approximately $346.6 million. This allows the Company a total borrowing capacity at the FHLB of approximately $2.8 billion. After accounting for letters of credit totaling $12.2 million, the Company had unused net credit available with the FHLB in the amount of approximately $2.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The Company also has a total borrowing capacity at the FRB of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2020 secured by a blanket lien on $2.0 billion in net eligible loans of the Company. The Company had no outstanding borrowings with the FRB at December 31, 2020.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, we paid-off early our FHLB advances of $700.0 million and terminated the interest rate swaps related to these advances at a cost of $38.8 million reflected in noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Junior Subordinated Debt
The obligations of the Company with respect to the issuance of the capital securities constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by the Company of the trusts’ obligations with respect to the capital securities. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, the Company may elect from time to time to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debt securities, which would result in a deferral of distribution payments on the related capital securities.
All of the Company’s junior subordinated debt is callable after five years from issuance. Therefore, all of the junior subordinated debt is callable at December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, the sole assets of the trusts were an aggregate of $144.3 million of the Company’s junior subordinated debt securities with like maturities and like interest rates to the trust preferred securities.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a $144.3 million liability for the junior subordinated debt securities, net of a $14.1 million discount recorded on Southeastern Bank Financial Statutory Trust I and II, Citizens South Banking Corporation Statutory Trust I, Community Capital Statutory Trust I, FCRV Statutory Trust I, Provident Community Bancshares Capital Trust I and II, CenterState Banks of Florida Statutory Trust I, Federal Trust Statutory Trust I, Gulfstream Bancshares Capital Trust II, Homestead Statutory Trust I, BSA Financial Statutory Trust I, and MRCB Statutory Trust II. The Company, as issuer, can call any of these subordinated debt securities without penalty. If the Company were to call the securities, the amount paid to the holders would be $158.4 million and the Company would fully amortize any remaining discount into interest expense. The remaining discount is being amortized over either a one and one-half year period, a five-year period or a fourteen and one-half year period depending on the merger acquired.
As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, there was $144.3 million (net of discount of $14.1 million) and $115.8 million (net of discount of $2.7 million), respectively, in junior subordinated debt. The weighted average cost of the junior subordinated debt at period end December 31, 2020 was 2.05% and the weighted average cost year to date for the year ended December 31, 2020 of 2.51%. This does not take into account the discount. If the discount were taken into account, the weighted average cost year to date would be 3.56%. This compares to a weighted average cost of the junior subordinated debt at period end December 31, 2019 of 3.60% and the weighted average cost year to date for the year ended December 31, 2019 of 4.20%. If the discount were taken into account, the weighted average cost year to date would be 4.88% in 2019.
Pursuant to the Basel III rules adopted by the bank regulatory agencies in July 2013, financial institutions with less than $15 billion in total assets may continue to include their trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 in Tier 1 capital, but cannot include in Tier 1 capital any trust preferred securities issued after such date. A financial institution may continue to include its trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital if it exceeds $15 billion in total assets through organic growth, but if it exceeds $15 billion in total assets through an acquisition or enters into an acquisition after exceeding $15 billion in total assets through organic growth, then the trust preferred securities would no longer be included in Tier 1 capital. Therefore, upon closing on the merger with CSFL in 2020, total trust preferred securities of $158.4 million of the combined Company would no longer be included in Tier 1 capital. Following the merger, these trust preferred securities are now only included in Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes.
Subordinated Debt and Notes
As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a $245.9 million liability for the subordinated debt, which was net of $3.1 million in debt issuance costs recorded on the CenterState subordinated debt issuance of $200.0 million. The remaining balance of the debt issuance costs are being amortized over an eight and one-half year period. There was no subordinated debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 as all this debt was acquired in the merger with CSFL in June 2020.
The weighted average cost of the subordinated debt at period end December 31, 2020 was 5.78% and the weighted average cost year to date for the year ended December 31, 2020 of 5.69%. This does not take into account the amortization of the debt issuance costs. If the debt issuance costs were taken into account, the weighted average cost year to date would be 5.93%.
Qualifying subordinated debt can be included in Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes. Of our subordinated debt, the amounts for the National Bank of Commerce, Landmark Bancshares and CenterState Bank Corporation totaling $238.0 million qualify for Tier 2 capital. The subordinated notes for Residential Warranty Corp. and Messiah College totaling $11.0 million do not qualify for Tier 2 capital purposes.
Line of Credit
On November 15, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to its Credit Agreement (the “Agreement”) with U.S. Bank National Association (the “Lender”). The Agreement provides for a $100 million unsecured line of credit by the Lender to the Company. The maturity date of the Agreement is November 15, 2021, provided that the Agreement may be extended subject to the approval of the Lender. Borrowings by the Company under the Agreement will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 2.00% plus the greater of 0.00% or one-month LIBOR. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and there was no outstanding balance associated with the line of credit.
Principal maturities of other borrowings are summarized below:
Note 13-Income Taxes
The provision for income taxes consists of the following:
The provision for income taxes differs from that computed by applying the federal statutory income tax rate of 21% in 2020, 2019 and 2018 to income before provision for income taxes, as indicated in the following analysis:
Tax Reform Act of 2017, among other things, lowered the maximum corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. The deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. As a result of the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its deferred tax assets and liabilities through the provision for income taxes.
The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 in December 2017 to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. The Company recognized a provisional tax impact of $26.6 million as additional income tax expense related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included that amount in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition to that, during 2018, the Company finalized its calculation for the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and recorded that impact in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The CARES Act was passed in March, 2020 in response to the global pandemic. As a result of the legislation, tax law changed to include the ability to carry back net operating losses ("NOLs") generated in 2018 through 2020 for five years, which was previously disallowed under The Tax Reform Act. Due to differences in tax and GAAP accounting rules, which relates to a tax method change to fair value for loans, the Company filed a short period tax return as of the merger date, which generated a NOL. This loss was carried back to the 2013 through 2015 tax years at a 35% tax rate, generating one time income tax benefit of $31.5 million.
The components of the net deferred tax asset are as follows:
The Company had federal net operating loss (“NOL”) and realized built-in loss carryforwards of $91.9 million and $31.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which expire in varying amounts between 2026 to 2036. All of the Company’s loss carryforwards are subject to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, which places an annual limitation on the amount of federal net operating loss carryforwards which the Company may utilize after a change in control, and also limits the Company’s ability to utilize certain tax deductions (Realized Built-in Losses or RBIL) due to the existence of a Net Unrealized Built-in Loss (“NUBIL”) at the time of the change in control. The Company is allowed to carry forward any such limited RBIL under terms similar to those related to NOLs.
The Company acquired federal net operating loss carryforwards of $62.9 million in the 2020 merger with CSFL. These acquired NOLs are subject to a combined annual Section 382 limitation of $16.0 million. In total, the combined allowable deduction for all loss carryforwards on an annual basis is $20.7 million.
The Company also has acquired state net operating losses in Georgia, Florida and Alabama. These are also subject to annual limitations under Section 382, similar to the federal NOLs. The Company expects all Section 382 limited carryforwards to be realized within the applicable carryforward period.
The Company has state net operating loss carryforwards of $222.9 million and $108.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, most of which expire in varying amounts through 2038. There is a valuation allowance of $7.1 million that relates to the parent company’s state operating loss carryforwards for which realizability is uncertain. The change in the valuation allowance for the current year was $3.2 million and for years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the change was immaterial.
During 2020, there were two events that impacted deferred taxes, but were not recorded through deferred tax expense (continuing operations); the impact of the adoption of CECL booked through retained earnings and recording of
deferred taxes acquired as part of the CenterState merger. The combined impact of those items in 2020 was $48.8 million.
In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowance at December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company has no material unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties. It is the Company’s policy to account for interest and penalties accrued relative to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.
Generally, the Company’s federal and state income tax returns are no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years prior to 2017.
Note 14-Other Expense
The following is a summary of the components of other noninterest expense:
Note 15-Earnings Per Common Share
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share:
The calculation of diluted earnings per common share excludes outstanding stock options for which the results would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method as follows:
Note 16-Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)
The changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, were as follows:
The table below presents the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax:
Note 17-Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends, Loans, or Advances
The Company pays cash dividends to shareholders from its assets, which are mainly provided by dividends from its banking subsidiary. However, certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of its subsidiary to transfer funds to
the Company in form of cash dividends, loans or advances. Prior to the merger with CSFL, the Bank was required to get the approval of the South Carolina Board of Financial Institutions (“SCBFI”) to pay dividends that exceeds 100% of net income in any calendar year. With the merger with CSFL, the Bank became a national bank regulated by the OCC. The approval of the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus. The federal banking agencies have issued policy statements which provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally pay dividends only out of current earnings.
During first quarter of 2020, the Bank paid special dividends to the Company totaling $24.7 million for which SCBFI approval was not required. These funds were used to repurchase Company stock on the open market totaling $24.7 million during the first quarter of 2020. The Bank also paid a special dividend of $33.0 million during the first quarter of 2020 to provide the Company more general operating liquidity during the COVID pandemic. The Bank paid approximately $32 million to fund quarterly shareholder divided payments. During 2019, the Bank paid special dividends to the Company totaling $157.0 million for which SCBFI approval was required. The Bank received approval from the SCBFI in June 2019 to pay an additional $60.0 million above current year net income in dividends to the Company. These funds were used to repurchase Company stock on the open market totaling $156.9 million during 2019. In 2018, the Bank paid special dividends to the Company totaling $66.6 million for which SCBFI approval was not required. These funds were used to repurchase Company stock on the open market totaling $68.4 million in the third and fourth quarters of 2018.
Under Federal Reserve regulations, the bank is also limited as to the amount it may lend to the Company. The maximum amount available for transfer from the bank to the Company in the form of loans or advances was approximately $479.5 million and $246.4 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Note 18-Retirement Plans
The Company and its subsidiary had a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan covering all employees hired on or before December 31, 2005, who have attained age 21, and who have completed one year of eligible service. The Company’s funding policy on the pension plan was based principally, among other considerations, on contributing an amount necessary to satisfy the Internal Revenue Service’s funding standards. Effective July 1, 2009, the Company suspended the accrual of benefits for pension plan participants under the non-contributory defined benefit plan. The plan was terminated in the second quarter of 2019.
During 2018, we made the decision to terminate the non-contributory defined benefit pension plan. We received approval from the IRS through a determination letter in the fourth quarter of 2018 to proceed with the termination. The termination of the pension plan was recorded during the second quarter of 2019 and distributions of assets from the plan were fully paid out by the fourth quarter of 2019. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a charge of $9.5 million related to the termination of the pension plan in the consolidated statement of income. This cost was the result of the recognition of the pre-tax losses from the pension plan that were recorded and held in accumulated other comprehensive income of $7.7 million and the write-off of the pension plan asset of $1.8 million. Participants had the option to be fully paid out in a lump sum or be paid through an annuity over time. If the participant chose the annuity, the funds were placed in an annuity product with a third party.
The following sets forth the pension plan’s funded status and amounts recognized in the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements:
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no net losses recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income excluding related income tax effects.
The components of net periodic pension cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are as follows:
Due to the termination of the pension plan in 2019, there was no benefit obligation or plan assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic pension cost are as follows:
For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the discount rate of 4.10% and 3.50%, respectively, was determined by matching the projected benefit obligation cash flows of the plan to an independently derived yield curve, to arrive at the single equivalent rate.
The policy, as established by the Investment Committee of the Defined Benefit Pension Plan, sought to maximize return within reasonable and prudent levels of risk. The overall long-term objective of the Plan was to achieve a rate of return that exceeds the actuarially assumed rate of return. The investment policy was reviewed on a regular basis and revised when appropriate based on the legal or regulatory environment, market trends, or other fundamental factors. In determining the long-term rate of return for the pension plan, the Company considered historical rates of return and the nature of the plan’s investments. Prior to making the decision to terminate the Plan, the Plan assets were divided among various investment classes with allowable allocation percentages as follows: Equities 55 - 65%, Fixed Income 20 - 40%, Cash Equivalents 0 - 35%. During 2019 before the termination of the pension plan, approximately 98% of pension plan assets were invested with Fixed Income Assets, and approximately 2% of pension plan assets were held in cash equivalents. When the decision was made to terminate the plan, the Investment Committee and the Company made the decision to move the Plan assets into less risky investments of Cash Equivalents and Fixed Income Assets and out of Equities. At December 31, 2018, the Plan did not include any of the Company’s common stock. The plan made no purchases of the Company’s stock during 2020, 2019 and 2018. The difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets was accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affects the recognized expenses in such future periods.
Expenses incurred and charged against operations with regard to all of the Company’s retirement plans were as follows:
The Company and its subsidiaries have a Safe Harbor plan. Under the plan, electing employees are eligible to participate after attaining age 18. Plan participants elect to contribute portions of their annual base compensation in any combination of pre-tax deferrals or Roth post-tax deferrals subject to the annual IRS limit. Employer contributions may be made from current or accumulated net profits. Participants may elect to contribute 1% to 50% of annual base compensation as a before tax contribution. Employees participating in the plan receive a 100% matching of their 401(k) plan contribution, up to 4% of salary. Effective January 1, 2018, employees are eligible for an additional 2% discretionary matching contribution contingent upon achievement of the Company’s annual financial goals and payable the first quarter of the following year. Based on our financial performance in 2020, we do not expect to pay a discretionary matching contribution in the first quarter of 2021. As a result of the merger with CSFL, all former CSFL employees became eligible to participate in the Company’s 401(k) plan as of legal close. CSFL’s existing 401(k) plan balances were merged into the Company’s 401(k) plan at the end of the current year.
Employees hired on January 1, 2006 or thereafter will not participate in the defined benefit pension plan, but are eligible to participate in the employees’ savings plan.
Employees can enter the savings plan on or after the first day of each month. The employee may enter into a salary deferral agreement at any time to select an alternative deferral amount or to elect not to defer in the Plan. If the employee does not elect an investment allocation, the plan administrator will select a retirement-based portfolio according to the employee’s number of years until normal retirement age. The plan’s investment valuations are generally provided on a daily basis.
Note 19-Post-Retirement Benefits
At December 31, 2020, the Company and its subsidiary have two post-retirement health and life insurance benefit plans, South State Bank Retiree Medical Plan (the “retiree medical plan”) and the First Federal Retiree Welfare Plan (the “retiree welfare plan”).
Retiree Medical Plan
Under the retiree medical plan, post-retirement health and life insurance benefits are provided to eligible employees, such benefits being limited to those employees of the Company eligible for early retirement under the pension plan on or before December 31, 1993, and former employees who are currently receiving benefits. The plan was unfunded at December 31, 2020, and the liability for future benefits has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
The following sets forth the retiree medical plan’s funded status and amounts recognized in the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements:
Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are as follows:
Components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are as follows:
There is no estimated net loss for the retiree medical plan that will be amortized from other comprehensive income into periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year.
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the post-retirement benefit plan. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects at the end of 2020:
Estimated future benefit payments (including expected future service as appropriate):
The Company expects to contribute approximately $27,000 to the retiree medical plan in 2021.
Retiree Welfare Plan
Under the retiree welfare plan, post-retirement health and life insurance benefits are provided to eligible employees, such benefits being limited to retired First Financial Holdings, Inc. employees who are currently receiving benefits. The plan was unfunded at December 31, 2020, and the liability for future benefits has been recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
The following sets forth the retiree welfare plan’s funded status and amounts recognized in the Company’s accompanying consolidated financial statements:
Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost are as follows:
Components of net periodic benefit cost and other amounts recognized in other comprehensive income are as follows:
The estimated net loss for the retiree welfare plan that will be amortized from other comprehensive income into periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is $174,000.
Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the post-retirement benefit plan. A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects at the end of 2020:
Estimated future benefit payments (including expected future service as appropriate):
The Company expects to contribute approximately $243,000 to the retiree welfare plan in 2021.
Note 20-Share-Based Compensation
Compensation cost is recognized for stock options and restricted stock awards issued to employees. Compensation cost is measured as the fair value of these awards on their date of grant. A Black-Scholes model is utilized to estimate the fair value of stock options, while the market price of the Company’s common stock at the date of grant is used as the fair value of restricted stock awards. Compensation cost is recognized over the required service period, generally defined as the vesting period for stock option awards and as the restriction period for restricted stock
awards. For awards with graded vesting, compensation cost is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.
Our 2004, 2012, 2019 and 2020 share-based compensation plans are long-term retention plans intended to attract, retain, and provide incentives for key employees and non-employee directors in the form of incentive and non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, and restricted stock units (“RSUs”). Our 2020 plan was adopted by our shareholders at our annual meeting on October 29, 2020. The Company assumed the obligations of CSFL under various equity incentive plans pursuant to the merger of CSFL on June 7, 2020.
Stock Options
With the exception of non-qualified stock options granted to directors under the 2004 and 2012 plans, which in some cases may be exercised at any time prior to expiration and in some other cases may be exercised at intervals less than a year following the grant date, incentive stock options granted under our 2004, 2012, 2019 and 2020 plans may not be exercised in whole or in part within a year following the date of the grant, as these incentive stock options become exercisable in 25% increments pro ratably over the four-year period following the grant date. The options are granted at an exercise price at least equal to the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant and expire ten years from the date of grant. No options were granted under the 2004 plan after January 26, 2012, and the 2004 plan is closed other than for any options still unexercised and outstanding. No options were granted under the 2012 plan after February 1, 2019, and the 2012 plan is closed other than for any options still unexercised and outstanding. No options were granted under the 2019 plan after October 29, 2020, and the 2019 plan is closed other than for any options still unexercised and outstanding. The 2020 plan is the only plan from which new share-based compensation grants may be issued. It is the Company’s policy to grant options out of the 2,072,245 shares registered under the 2020 plan.
Activity in the Company’s stock option plans is summarized in the following table. All information has been retroactively adjusted for stock dividends and stock splits.
The aggregate intrinsic value of 256,425, 176,888, and 213,866 stock options outstanding at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $4.6 million, $3.7 million, and $1.9 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of 256,425, 131,216, and 140,115 stock options exercisable at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $4.6 million, $3.6 million, and $1.9 million, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of 52,331, 36,978, and 33,424 stock options exercised for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $2.0 million, $1.4 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
Information pertaining to options outstanding at December 31, 2020, is as follows:
The fair value of options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and expensed over the options’ vesting periods. The following weighted-average assumptions were used in valuing options issued:
As of December 31, 2020, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option grants under the plans. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $1.4 million, $799,000, and $700,000, respectively. Compensation expense of $720,000, $641,000, and $751,000 was recorded in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Of the expense in 2020, approximately $481,000 was recognized in June 2020 due to the acceleration of vesting of stock options through the merger with CSFL.
Restricted Stock
We from time-to-time also grant shares of restricted stock to key employees and non-employee directors. These awards help align the interests of these employees and directors with the interests of our shareholders by providing economic value directly related to increases in the value of our stock. The value of the stock awarded is established as the fair market value of the stock at the time of the grant. We recognize expenses, equal to the total value of such awards, ratably over the vesting period of the stock grants. Restricted stock grants to employees typically “cliff vest” after four years. Grants to non-employee directors typically vest within a 12-month period.
All restricted stock agreements are conditioned upon continued employment, or service in the case of directors. Termination of employment prior to a vesting date, as described below, would terminate any interest in non-vested shares. Prior to vesting of the shares, as long as employed by the Company, the key employees and non-employee directors will have the right to vote such shares and to receive dividends paid with respect to such shares. All restricted shares will fully vest in the event of change in control of the Company or upon the death of the recipient. Due to the merger between the Company and CSFL effective June 7, 2020, a total of 29,303 restricted stock awards became fully vested.
Non-vested restricted stock for the year ended December 31, 2020 is summarized in the following table. All information has been retroactively adjusted for stock dividends and stock splits.
The Company granted 9,145, 8,934, and 7,836 shares for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The weighted-average- grant-date fair value of restricted shares granted in 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $55.96, $73.34, and $87.37, respectively. Compensation expense of $1.5 million, $1.7 million, and $2.5 million was recorded in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Of the expense in 2020, approximately $704,000 was recognized in June 2020 due to the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock awards through the merger with CSFL.
The vesting schedule of these shares as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:
As of December 31, 2020, there was $537,000 thousand of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock granted under the plans. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.61 years as of December 31, 2020. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was approximately $4.6 million, $3.0 million, and $2.5 million, respectively.
Restricted Stock Units (“RSU”)
We, from time-to-time, also grant performance RSUs and time-vested RSUs to key employees. These awards help align the interests of these employees with the interests of our shareholders by providing economic value directly related to our performance. Some performance RSU grants contain a three-year performance period while others contain a one-year performance period and a time-vested requirement (generally four years from the grant date). We communicate threshold, target, and maximum performance RSU awards and performance targets to the applicable key employees at the beginning of a performance period. Due to the merger with CSFL, all legacy and assumed performance based restricted stock units converted to a time-vesting requirement. Dividends are not paid in respect to the awards during the performance or time-vested period. The value of the RSUs awarded is established as the fair market value of the stock at the time of the grant. We recognize expenses on a straight-line basis typically over the performance and vesting/or time-vesting periods based upon the probable performance target, as applicable, that will be met. For the year ended December 31 2020, we accrued for 100.0% of the RSUs granted. Due to the merger between the Company and CSFL effective June 7, 2020, a total of 242,018 restricted stock units became fully vested.
Nonvested RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2020 is summarized in the following table.
The nonvested shares of 750,821 at December 31, 2020 includes 61,123 shares that have met their three year vesting period, however, there is still a two year hold on these shares. These shares should be fully vested with the hold lifted by 2023. The Company granted 382,205, 159,521, and 113,270 shares for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of restricted stock units granted in 2020 was $61.27. Compensation expense of $21.0 million, $6.4 million, and $5.5 million was recorded in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Of the expense in 2020, approximately $7.5 million was recognized in June 2020 due to the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock units through the merger with CSFL.
As of December 31, 2020, there was $27.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs granted under the plan. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years as of December 31, 2020. The total fair value of restricted stock units that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was approximately $23.6 million, $5.8 million, and $5.7 million, respectively.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan
The Company has registered 363,825 shares of common stock in connection with the establishment of an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. At the annual shareholders meeting on October 29, 2020, a proposal was adopted that increased the shares of common stock that may be issued under the plan by up to 1,400,000 shares. The plan is available to all employees who have attained age 21 and completed six months of service. The Company currently has more than 1.4 million shares available for issuances under the plan. The price at which common stock may be purchased for each quarterly option period is the lesser of 95% of the common stock’s fair value on either the first or last day of the quarter.
The 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan permits eligible employees to purchase Company stock at a discounted price. Beginning July 1, 2009, the 15% discount was reduced to 5%. The Company recognized $81,000, $75,000 and $82,000 in share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Note 21-Stock Repurchase Program
In February 2004, we announced a program with no formal expiration date to repurchase up to 250,000 of our common shares. In March 2017, the Board of Directors approved and reset the number of shares available to be repurchased under the 2004 stock repurchase program to 1,000,000, all of which had been repurchased as of December 31, 2018. In January 2019, the Board of Directors approved a new program (“2019 repurchase program”) to repurchase up to an additional 1,000,000 of our common shares, all of which had been repurchased as of June 30, 2019. In June 2019, the Board of Directors authorized an additional 2,000,000 of our common shares to be repurchased under the 2019 repurchase program, however we are not obligated to repurchase any additional shares under the 2019 repurchase program. As of December 31, 2020, we have repurchased 1,485,000 shares of the 2,000,000 approved in June 2019 at an average price per share of $75.26 per share (excluding commission expense). In 2020, the Company repurchased a total of 320,000 shares for $24.7 million or $77.23 per share (excluding commission expense). In 2019, the Company repurchased a total of 2,165,000 shares for $156.9 million or $72.49 per share (excluding commission expense). The remaining 515,000 shares (authorized in June of 2019) have expired. See Note 32-Subsequent Events for discussion of the “New Repurchase Program”.
Under other arrangements where directors or officers surrendered currently owned shares to the Company to acquire proceeds for exercising stock options or paying taxes on currently vesting restricted stock, the Company repurchased 122,708, 35,674, and 25,251 shares at a cost of $7.7 million, $2.5 million, and $2.2 million in 2020, 2019,
and 2018, respectively. Of the amounts in 2020, 86,263 shares at a cost of $5.2 million were related to the vesting of restricted stock due to the merger with CSFL.
Note 22-Lease Commitments
On January 1, 2019, we adopted the requirements of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The purpose of the update was to increase transparency and comparability between organizations that enter into lease agreements. The key difference between the previous guidance and the update is the recognition of a right-of-use asset (ROU) and lease liability on the statement of financial position for those leases previously classified as operating leases under the old guidance. Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”). Our lease agreements in which ASC Topic 842 has been applied are primarily for real estate properties, including retail branch locations, operations and administration locations and stand-alone ATM locations. We performed an analysis on equipment leases for the implementation of ASC Topic 842 and determined the number and dollar amount of our equipment leases was not material.
A modified retrospective transition approach is required, applying the new standard to all leases existing at the date of initial application. An entity may choose to use either (1) its effective date or (2) the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements as its date of initial application. We chose the transition method of adoption where we initially apply the new lease standard at the effective date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption if applicable. Therefore, we applied this standard to all existing leases as of the adoption date of January 1, 2019, recording a ROU asset and a lease liability in an equal amount. We recorded a ROU asset and lease liability of $82.2 million at the commencement date of January 1, 2019. We did not have a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at commencement and the adoption of ASC Topic 842 did not have a material impact on our consolidated income statement.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had operating ROU assets of $113.4 million and $87.4 million, respectively, and operating lease liabilities of $118.3 million and $88.8 million, respectively. We maintain operating leases on land and buildings for our operating centers, branch facilities and ATM locations. Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms extending up to 25 years. The exercise of renewal options is based on the sole judgment of management and what they consider to be reasonably certain given the environment today. Factors in determining whether an option is reasonably certain of exercise include, but are not limited to, the value of leasehold improvements, the value of renewal rate compared to market rates, and the presence of factors that would cause a significant economic penalty to us if the option is not exercised. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and instead are recognized in lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We do not sublease any portion of these locations to third parties.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company also holds a small number of finance leases assumed in connection to the CSFL merger. These leases are all real estate leases. Terms and conditions are similar to those real estate operating leases described above. Lease classifications from the acquired institutions were retained. At December 31, 2020, we do not maintain any leases with related parties, and we determined that the number and dollar amount of our equipment leases was immaterial. As of December 31, 2020, we have an additional operating lease that has not yet commenced of $3.5 million. This operating lease will commence in fiscal year 2021 with a lease term of 10 years.
See further discussion in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies on page on accounting for leases.
Note 23-Contingent Liabilities
The Company has been named as defendant in various legal actions, arising from its normal business activities, in which damages in various amounts are claimed. The Company is also exposed to litigation risk related to the prior business activities of banks acquired through whole bank acquisitions. Although the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to such matters cannot be determined, in the opinion of management, any such liability will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
The Company and its subsidiary are involved at times in certain litigation arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management as of December 31, 2020, there is no pending or threatened litigation that will have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.
Note 24-Related Party Transactions
During 2020 and 2019, the Company’s banking subsidiary had loan and deposit relationships with certain related parties, principally directors and executive officers, their immediate families and their business interests. All of these relationships were in the ordinary course of business at rates and terms substantially consistent with similar transactions with unrelated parties. Loans outstanding to this group (including immediate families and business interests) totaled $28.7 million and $37.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively. During 2020, $12.4 million of new loans were made to this group while repayments of $17.7 million were received during the year. There were also additions to related party loans of $31.8 million due to the addition of new related parties through the acquisition of CSFL and there were reductions to related party loans of $35.3 million due to the removal of related parties through the acquisition of CSFL. Related party deposits totaled approximately $18.8 million and $21.8 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Note 25-Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk
The Company’s subsidiary is a party to credit related financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of their customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate, or liquidity risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The contract amounts of these instruments express the extent of involvement the subsidiary has in particular classes of financial instruments.
The subsidiary’s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and financial guarantees is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The subsidiary uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the following financial instruments, whose contract amounts represent credit risk, were outstanding:
As of December 31, 2020, the subsidiary had recorded a liability for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments, excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit, of $43.4 million and which was recorded in Other Liabilities on the Balance Sheet. See Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for discussion of liability recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments.
Commitments to Extend Credit
Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements. The Bank evaluates each customer’s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer. Collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment, and personal guarantees. Unfunded commitments under commercial lines-of-credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. These lines-of-credit are uncollateralized and usually do not contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn to the extent to which the banking subsidiary is committed.
Standby Letters of Credit and Financial Guarantees
Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are conditional commitments issued by the banking subsidiary to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those letters of credit and guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. Essentially, all standby letters of credit have expiration dates within one year. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary, is based on management’s credit evaluation of the customer.
Note 26-Fair Value
FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. FASB ASC 820 clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions.
The Company utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. Available-for-sale and trading securities, derivative contracts, and mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans, OREO, and certain other assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets.
FASB ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
Level 1
Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
Level 2
Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
Level 3
Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
The following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets recorded at fair value.
Trading Securities
The fair values of trading securities are determined as follows: (1) for those securities that have traded prior to the date of the consolidated balance sheet but have not settled (date of sale) until after such date, the sales price is used as the fair value; and, (2) for those securities which have not traded as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet, the fair value was determined by broker price indications of similar or same securities.
Investment Securities
Securities available-for-sale are valued on a recurring basis at quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable securities. Level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange and The NASDAQ Stock Market. Level 2 securities include mortgage-backed securities and debentures issued by government sponsored entities, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities, or U.S. Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. Securities held-to-maturity are valued at quoted market prices or dealer quotes similar to securities available-for-sale. The carrying value of FHLB and FRB stock approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions.
Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the fair market value with changes in fair value recognized in current period earnings. The fair values of mortgage loans held for sale are based on commitments on hand from investors
within the secondary market for loans with similar characteristics. As such, the fair value adjustments for mortgage loans held for sale are recurring Level 2.
Loans
We do not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, a loan may be considered impaired and an ACL may be established. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is identified as individually impaired, Management measures impairment using estimated fair value methodologies. The fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value, market value of similar debt, enterprise value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. At December 31, 2020, approximately half of the impaired loans were evaluated based on the fair value of the collateral because such loans were considered collateral dependent. Impaired loans, where an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral; require classification in the fair value hierarchy. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, we consider the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or Management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, we consider the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 3.
Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”)
Typically, OREO, consisting of properties obtained through foreclosure or in satisfaction of loans, is reported at fair value, determined on the basis of current appraisals, comparable sales, and other estimates of value obtained principally from independent sources, adjusted for estimated selling costs (Level 2). However, OREO is considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because management has qualitatively applied a discount due to the size, supply of inventory, and the incremental discounts applied to the appraisals. Management also considers other factors, including changes in absorption rates, length of time the property has been on the market, and anticipated sales values, which have resulted in adjustments to the collateral value estimates indicated in certain appraisals. At the time of foreclosure, any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the allowance for loan losses. Gains or losses on sale and generally any subsequent adjustments to the value are recorded as a component of OREO expense.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Fair value is estimated using pricing models of derivatives with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models where future floating cash flows are projected and discounted back; and accordingly, these derivatives are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 29-Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information.
Mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”)
The estimated fair value of MSRs is obtained through an independent derivatives dealer analysis of future cash flows. The evaluation utilizes assumptions market participants would use in determining fair value including market discount rates, prepayment speeds, servicing income, servicing costs, default rates and other market driven data, as well as the market’s perception of future interest rate movements. MSRs are classified as Level 3.
Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
The tables below present the recorded amount of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
There were no financial instruments transferred between Level 1 and Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Changes in Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, the determination is based upon the significance of the unobservable factors to the overall fair value measurement. However, since Level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or Level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources), the gains and losses below include changes in fair value due in part to observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology.
There were no changes in hierarchy classifications of Level 3 assets or liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of Level 3 assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:
There were no unrealized losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to Level 3 financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 or 2019.
See Note 30-Loan Servicing, Mortgage Obligation, and Loans Held for Sale for information about recurring Level 3 fair value measurements of mortgage servicing rights.
Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
The tables below present the recorded amount of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:
Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those models are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement
of the instrument. The use of different methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. The fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Such amounts have not been revalued for purposes of these consolidated financial statements since those dates and, therefore, current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:
Cash and Cash Equivalents-The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value.
Trading Securities - The fair values of trading securities are determined as follows: (1) for those securities that have traded prior to the date of the consolidated balance sheet but have not settled (date of sale) until after such date, the sales price is used as the fair value; and, (2) for those securities which have not traded as of the date of the consolidated balance sheet, the fair value was determined by broker price indications of similar or same securities.
Investment Securities-Securities held-to-maturity are valued at quoted market prices or dealer quotes. The carrying value of FHLB stock approximates fair value based on the redemption provisions. The carrying value of the Company’s investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries approximates fair value. See Note 4-Investment Securities for additional information, as well as page regarding fair value.
Loans held for sale - The fair values disclosed for loans held for sale are based on commitments from investors for loans with similar characteristics.
Loans - ASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments - Overall - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities became effective for us on January 1, 2018. This accounting standard requires us to calculate the fair value of our loans for disclosure purposes based on an estimated exit price. With ASU 2016-01, to estimate an exit price, all loans (fixed and variable) are being valued with a discounted cash flow analyses for loans that includes our estimate of future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans. Fair values for certain mortgage loans (e.g., one-to-four family residential) and other consumer loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on our current rates offered for new loans of the same type, structure and credit quality. Fair values for other loans (e.g., commercial real estate and investment property mortgage loans, commercial and industrial loans) are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses-using interest rates we currently offer for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. Fair values for non-performing loans are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis.
Deposit Liabilities-The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-interest bearing checking, passbook savings, and certain types of money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). The carrying amounts of variable-rate, fixed-term money market accounts, and certificates of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.
Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase-The carrying amount of federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements, and other short-term borrowings maturing within ninety days approximate their fair values.
Other Borrowings-The fair value of other borrowings is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis on the Company’s current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments.
Accrued Interest-The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value.
Derivative Financial Instruments-The fair value of derivative financial instruments (including interest rate swaps) is estimated using pricing models of derivatives with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models where future floating cash flows are projected and discounted back .
Commitments to Extend Credit, Standby Letters of Credit and Financial Guarantees-The fair values of commitments to extend credit are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into
account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair values of guarantees and letters of credit are based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated costs to terminate them or otherwise settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date.
The estimated fair value, and related carrying amount, of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:
Note 27-Regulatory Matters
The Company is subject to regulations with respect to certain risk-based capital ratios. These risk-based capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and off-balance sheet risks. The values of both balance sheet and off-balance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk. In addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy. The leverage ratio is equal to Tier 1 capital divided by total consolidated on-balance sheet assets (minus amounts deducted from Tier 1 capital). The leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets.
Under current regulations, the Company and the Bank are subject to a minimum ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital (“CET1”) to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%. and a minimum required ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6%. The minimum required leverage ratio is 4%. The minimum required total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio is 8%.
In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executives, under the new rules a covered banking organization is also required to maintain a “capital conservation buffer” in addition to its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer is required to consist solely of CET1, and the buffer applies to all three risk-based measurements (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer became fully phased-in on January 1, 2019 and consists of an additional amount of Tier 1 common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.
The Bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized) and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three risk-based regulatory capital ratios (CET1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) and for the leverage ratio.
The following table presents actual and required capital ratios as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 for the Company and the Bank under the current capital rules. Capital levels required to be considered well capitalized are based upon prompt corrective action regulations.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the capital ratios of the Company and the Bank were well in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements and exceeded the thresholds for the “well capitalized” regulatory classification.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 which required an entity to utilize a new impairment model known as the CECL model to estimate its lifetime “expected credit loss.” This standard was adopted and became effective on January 1, 2020 and the Company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. Related to the implementation of ASU 2016-13, we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of $54.4 million, deferred tax assets of $12.6 million, an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of $6.4 million and an adjustment to retained earnings of $44.8 million. Instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from ASU 2016-13 at adoption, the Company initially elected the option for recognizing the day 1 effects on the Company’s regulatory capital calculations over a three-year phase-in. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the regulatory agencies provided an additional transitional method option of a two-year deferral for the start of the three year phase-in of the recognition of the Day 1 effects of ASU 2016-13 along with an option to defer the current impact on regulatory capital calculations of ASU 2016-13 during the first two years (“5 year method”). Under this 5-year method, the Company would recognize an estimate of the previous incurred loss method for determining the allowance for credit losses in regulatory capital calculations and the difference from the CECL method would be deferred for two years. After two years, the effects from Day 1 and the deferral difference from the first two years of applying CECL would be phased-in over three years using the straight-line method. The regulatory rules provide a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2020 for covered banking organizations to choose its transition option for CECL. The Company chose the 5-year method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from Day 1 and the CECL difference from the first two years of application.

Note 29-Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses certain derivative instruments to meet the needs of its customers as well as to manage the interest rate risk associated with certain transactions. The following table summarizes the derivative financial instruments utilized by the Company:
Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk in the course of its business operations and manages a portion of this risk through the use of derivative financial instruments, in the form of interest rate swaps. The Company accounts for its interest rate swap that is classified as a cash flow hedge in accordance with FASB ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which requires that all derivatives be recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value. For more information regarding the fair value of the Company’s derivative financial instruments, see Note 26-Fair Value, to these financial statements.
During 2020 and 2019, the Company utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk related to funding through short term FHLB advances. In March 2019, we entered into three-month FHLB advances for $350 million and $150 million which were continuously renewed. At the same time, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $350 million and $150 million to manage the interest rate risk related to these FHLB advances. In June 2019, we entered into a three-month FHLB advance for $200 million which was continuously renewed. At the same time, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $200 million to manage the interest rate risk related to this FHLB advance. With our plan to continually renew and reprice the FHLB advances every three months, we were treating this funding as variable rate funding and hedging the cash flows from these FHLB advances against future interest rate increases by using an interest rate swap that effectively fixed the rate on the debt. The notional amount on which the interest payments were based was not exchanged related to these interest rate swaps. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company made the decision to repay the FHLB advances and terminate the interest rate swap agreements due to the current low interest rate environment and the expectation that interest rates will remain low during the average life of these interest rate swaps. As a result, in December 2020, the Company recorded through earnings termination costs of $40.8 million related to the interest rate swaps which included $2.0 million in interest expense on the interest rate swap hedges.
For derivatives designated as hedging exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction (cash flow hedge), the derivative’s entire gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings or when the hedge is terminated. For derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately. For designated hedging relationships, we have a third party perform retrospective and prospective effectiveness testing on a quarterly basis using quantitative methods to determine if the hedge is still highly effective. Hedge accounting ceases on transactions that are no longer deemed highly effective, or for which the derivative has been terminated or de-designated.
The Company recognized an after-tax unrealized gain on its cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $10.8 million, compared to a $10.7 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2019. During 2020, at the time of the termination of the cash flow hedges, the Company reclassified into current earnings the unrealized loss on the cash flow hedge of $38.8 million ($30.3 million after-tax). The Company did not maintain any cash flow hedges on the balance sheet at December 31, 2020. The Company maintained a $13.8 million cash flow hedge liability for the year ended December 31, 2019. There was no ineffectiveness in the cash flow hedges during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. (See Note 16-Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income for activity in accumulated comprehensive income (loss) and the amounts reclassified into earnings related the cash flow hedges.)
Credit risk related to the derivative arises when amounts receivable from the counterparty (derivatives dealer) exceed those payable. We control the risk of loss by only transacting with derivatives dealers that are national market makers whose credit ratings are strong. Each party to the interest rate swap is required to provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to the counterparty when the counterparty’s exposure to a mark-to-market replacement value exceeds certain negotiated limits. These limits are typically based on current credit ratings and vary with ratings changes. At December 31, 2020, there was no collateral pledged for cash flow hedges with the hedges being terminated in the fourth quarter of 2020. At December 31, 2019, collateral on the cash flow hedges on the FHLB advances was included in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as deposits in other financial institutions (restricted cash). Also, we have a netting agreement with the counterparties.
Balance Sheet Fair Value Hedge
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company maintained loan swaps, with an aggregate notional amount of $16.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, accounted for as a fair value hedge in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. This derivative protects the company from interest rate risk caused by changes in the LIBOR curve in relation to a certain designated fixed rate loan. The derivative converts the fixed rate loan to a floating rate. Settlement occurs in any given period where there is a difference in the stated fixed rate and variable rate. The fair value of this hedge is recorded in other assets or in other liabilities. All changes in fair value are recorded through earnings as noninterest income. There was no gain or loss recorded on this derivative in 2020 or 2019.
Non-designated Hedges of Interest Rate Risk
Customer Swaps
The Company maintains interest rate swap contracts with customers that are classified as non-designated hedges and are not speculative in nature. These agreements are designed to convert customer’s variable rate loans with the Company to fixed rate. These interest rate swaps are executed with loan customers to facilitate a respective risk management strategy and allow the customer to pay a fixed rate of interest to the Company. These interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by executing offsetting interest rate swaps with unrelated market counterparties to minimize the net risk exposure to the Company resulting from the transactions and allow the Company to receive a variable rate of interest. The interest rate swaps pay and receive interest based on a floating rate based on one month LIBOR plus credit spread, with payments being calculated on the notional amount. The interest rate swaps are settled monthly with varying maturities.
As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet the strict hedge accounting requirements, changes in the fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the interest rate swaps had an aggregate notional amount of approximately $18.6 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of the interest rate swap derivatives was recorded in other assets at $802.8 million and other liabilities at $802.7 million for a net asset position of $17,000. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of the interest rate swap derivatives was recorded in other assets at $15.3 million and other liabilities at $16.5 million for a net liability position of $1.1 million. All changes in fair value are recorded through earnings as noninterest income. As of December 31, 2020, we provided $663.5 million of cash collateral on the counterparty swaps which is included in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as deposits in other financial institutions (restricted cash). The Company also provided $554.7 million in investment securities at market value as collateral on the counterparty swaps which is included in investment securities - available-for-sale.
Foreign Exchange
The Company also enters into foreign exchange contracts with customers to accommodate their need to convert certain foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars. To offset the foreign exchange risk, the Company has entered into substantially identical agreements with an unrelated market counterparty to hedge these foreign exchange contracts. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no outstanding contracts or agreements related to foreign currency. If there were foreign currency contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the fair value of these contracts would be included in other assets and other liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet. All changes in fair value are recorded as other noninterest income. There was no gain or loss recorded related to the foreign exchange derivative for the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Mortgage Banking
The Company also has derivatives contracts that are not classified as accounting hedges to mitigate risks related to its mortgage banking activities. These instruments may include financial forwards, futures contracts, and options written and purchased, which are used to hedge mortgage servicing rights; while forward sales commitments are typically used to hedge the mortgage pipeline. Such instruments derive their cash flows, and therefore their values, by reference to an underlying instrument, index or referenced interest rate. The Company does not elect hedge accounting treatment for any of these derivative instruments and as a result, changes in fair value of the instruments (both gains and losses) are recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of income in mortgage banking income.
Mortgage Servicing Rights
Derivatives contracts related to mortgage servicing rights are used to help offset changes in fair value and are written in amounts referred to as notional amounts. Notional amounts provide a basis for calculating payments between counterparties but do not represent amounts to be exchanged between the parties, and are not a measure of financial risk. On December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $149.0 million and $133.0 million related to mortgage servicing rights, respectively. The estimated net fair value of the open contracts related to the mortgage servicing rights was recorded as a gain of $119,000 at December 31, 2020 compared to a loss of $789,000 at December 31, 2019.
The following table presents the Company’s notional value of forward sale commitments and the fair value of those obligations along with the fair value of the mortgage loan pipeline.
Note 30-Loan Servicing, Mortgage Origination, and Loans Held for Sale
The portfolio of residential mortgages serviced for others, which are not included in the accompanying balance sheets, was $5.1 billion and $3.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Servicing loans for others generally consists of collecting mortgage payments, maintaining escrow accounts and disbursing payments to investors. The amounts of contractually specified servicing fees earned by the Company during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $9.8 million and $7.8 million, respectively. Servicing fees are recorded in mortgage banking income in the Company’s consolidated statements of income.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, MSRs were $43.8 million and $30.5 million, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. MSRs are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The market value adjustments related to MSRs recorded in mortgage banking income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were a loss of $7.4 million and a loss of $7.0 million, respectively. The Company has used various free standing derivative instruments to mitigate the income statement effect of changes in fair value due to changes in market value adjustments and to changes in valuation inputs and assumptions related to MSRs.
The following table presents the changes in the fair value of MSRs and its offsetting hedge.
The fair value of MSRs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions and fair value is determined by estimating the present value of the asset’s future cash flows utilizing market-based prepayment rates, discount rates and other assumptions validated through comparison to trade information, industry surveys and with the use of independent third party appraisals. Changes in prepayment speed assumptions have the most significant impact on the fair value of MSRs. Generally, as interest rates decline, mortgage loan prepayments accelerate due to increased refinance activity, which results in a decrease in the fair value of the MSR. Measurement of fair value is limited to the conditions existing and the assumptions utilized as of a particular point in time, and those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at a different time. See Note 26-Fair Value for additional information regarding fair value.
The characteristics and sensitivity analysis of the MSRs are included in the following table.
The sensitivity calculations above are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future performance. Changes in fair value based on adverse changes in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the changes in assumptions to fair value may not be linear. Also, in this table, the effects of an adverse variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated without changing any other assumptions, while in reality, changes in one factor may result in changing another, which may magnify or contract the effect of the change.
Custodial escrow balances maintained in connection with the loan servicing were $26.6 million and $16.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Whole loan sales were $3.2 billion and $812.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, of which $2.7 billion and $660.6 million or 85.1% and 81.3% were sold with the servicing rights retained by the Company.
Loans held for sale have historically been comprised of residential mortgage loans awaiting sale in the secondary market, which generally settle in 15 to 45 days. At December 31, 2020, loans held for sale were $290.5 million, compared with $59.4 million at December 31, 2019.
Note 31-Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects
The Company has investments in qualified affordable housing projects (“QAHPs”) that provide low income housing tax credits and operating loss benefits over an extended period. The tax credits and the operating loss tax benefits that are generated by each of the properties are expected to exceed the total value of the investment made by the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2020, tax credits and other tax benefits of $11.2 million and amortization of $12.9 million were recorded. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded tax credits and other tax benefits of $5.9 million and amortization of $6.0 million. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s carrying value of QAHPs was $105.6 million and $76.9 million, respectively, with an original investment of $137.1 million. The Company has $42.7 million and $35.7 million in remaining funding obligations related to these QAHPs recorded in liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. None of the original investment will be repaid. The investment in QAHPs is being accounted for using the equity method.
Note 32-Subsequent Events
On January 27, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved the authorization of a new 3.5 million share Company stock repurchase plan (the “New Repurchase Program”). The New Repurchase Plan replaces the Company’s prior stock repurchase plan announced on June 13, 2019 in its entirety. The repurchases under the New Repurchase Program will be made from time to time by the Company in the open market as conditions allow and the repurchase plan has made available for two years, unless shortened or extended by the Company’s Board of Directors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specified number of shares of its common stock. The shares may be purchased in open market or negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated share repurchase transactions or pursuant to one or more trading plans established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1. Open market purchases will
be conducted in accordance with the limitations set forth in Rule 10b-18 of the Securities and Exchange and Commission and other applicable legal requirements. The number, price and timing of the repurchases, if any, will be at the Company’s sole discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, liquidity needs and other factors and there is no assurance that the Company will purchase any shares under the program.
On February 1, 2021, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Duncan-Williams, Inc., a 52-year-old family- and employee-owned registered broker-dealer, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee, serving primarily institutional clients across the U.S. in the fixed income business. Duncan-Williams firm became an operating subsidiary of South State Bank immediately following the transaction. The transaction provides the Company with a seasoned team of revenue producers as well as an expanded platform through which the Correspondent Banking Division can leverage additional opportunities. The transaction represents an attractive capital deployment opportunity for the company and the ability to grow its fee-based businesses.
