Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Global Indemnity Group, LLC
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Global Indemnity Group, LLC (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 12, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.
Valuation of Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
Description of the Matter
At December 31, 2020, the Company’s liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses was $663 million, of which a significant portion represents incurred but not reported reserves. As described in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents the Company’s best estimate of future amounts needed to pay losses and related settlement expenses with respect to events insured by the Company. The difference between the estimated ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses and the case incurred loss (paid loss plus case reserve) is considered to be incurred but not reported. There is significant uncertainty inherent in determining management’s best estimate of the ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses, requiring the use of informed actuarially based estimates and management’s judgment. In particular, the Company’s long-tail reserve categories (such as general liability, construction defect and environmental exposures) are influenced by factors that are subject to significant variation over a long period of time or have high potential severities within the selection and weighting of actuarial methods and assumptions. Assumptions fundamental to the reserving process include claims frequency and severity as well as the review of historical payment and claim reporting patterns.
Auditing management’s best estimate of the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses was complex and involved the use of our actuarial specialists due to the significant estimation uncertainty associated with evaluating management’s methods and assumptions in determining the Company’s recorded loss and loss adjustment reserves.
How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit
We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the process for estimating loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. This included, among others, the review and approval processes management has in place for the methods and assumptions used in estimating the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves.
To test the Company’s estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, our audit procedures included among others, the assistance of our actuarial specialists to evaluate the assumptions used in the actuarial methods, by comparing the significant assumptions, including severity, frequency, payment patterns and expected loss ratios to the Company’s historical experience. In addition, we evaluated the selection and the weighting of actuarial methods used by management with those methods used in prior periods and those used in the industry. We developed a range of reasonable reserve estimates which included performing independent projections for a sample of lines of business and compared the range of reserve estimates to the Company’s recorded reserves. We also performed a review of historical results of the development of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves related to prior years.

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
Global Indemnity Group, LLC (“Global Indemnity”), a Delaware limited liability company formed on June 23, 2020, replaced Global Indemnity Limited, incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability, as the ultimate parent company of the Global Indemnity group of companies as a result of a redomestication transaction completed on August 28, 2020. This transaction resulted in the redomestication of the Company and its Bermuda subsidiary, Global Indemnity Reinsurance Company, Ltd. (“Global Indemnity Reinsurance”), to the United States. Global Indemnity Group, LLC’s class A common shares are publicly traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol GBLI. Global Indemnity Group, LLC’s predecessors have been publicly traded since 2003. See Note 2 below for additional information regarding the redomestication.
During the first quarter of 2019, the Company re-evaluated its Personal Lines segment and determined that Personal Lines should be bifurcated into two reportable segments: Specialty Property and Farm, Ranch & Stable. This is the result of changing how Specialty Property and Farm, Ranch & Stable are managed and reported. Specialty Property is managed out of the Company’s Scottsdale, Arizona office; whereas, Farm, Ranch & Stable is managed out of the Company’s Omaha, Nebraska office. In the past, Farm, Ranch & Stable reported to the Scottsdale, Arizona office and now it reports directly to the Company’s main headquarters in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Results for Specialty Property and Farm, Ranch & Stable are separately measured, resources are separately allocated to each of these lines, and employees in each line are now being rewarded based on each line’s separate results. Accordingly, the Company now reports Specialty Property and Farm, Ranch & Stable as two separate reportable segments. In addition, the Company has changed the name of its Commercial Lines segment to Commercial Specialty to better align with its key product offerings. The segment results for the year ended December 31, 2018 have been revised to reflect these changes. See Note 21 for additional information regarding segments.
The Company manages its business through four business segments: Commercial Specialty, Specialty Property, Farm, Ranch & Stable, and Reinsurance Operations. The Company’s Commercial Specialty segment offers specialty property and casualty insurance products in the excess and surplus lines marketplace. The Company manages Commercial Specialty by differentiating them into four product classifications: 1) Penn-America, which markets property and general liability products to small commercial businesses through a select network of wholesale general agents with specific binding authority; 2) United National, which markets insurance products for targeted insured segments, including specialty products, such as property, general liability, and professional lines through program administrators with specific binding authority; 3)Diamond State, which markets property, casualty, and professional lines products, which are developed by the Company’s underwriting department by individuals with expertise in those lines of business, through wholesale brokers and also markets through program administrators having specific binding authority; and 4) Vacant Express, which primarily insures dwellings which are currently vacant, undergoing renovation, or are under construction and is marketed through aggregators, brokers, and retail agents. These product classifications comprise the Company’s Commercial Specialty business segment and are not considered individual business segments because each product has similar economic characteristics, distribution, and coverage. The Company’s Specialty Property segment offers specialty personal lines property and casualty insurance products through general and specialty agents with specific binding authority. The Company’s Farm, Ranch & Stable segment provides specialized property and casualty coverage including Commercial Farm Auto and Excess/Umbrella Coverage for the agriculture industry as well as specialized insurance products for the equine mortality and equine major medical industry. These insurance products are sold through wholesalers and retail agents, with a selected number having specific binding authority. Collectively, the Company’s insurance subsidiaries are licensed in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Commercial Specialty, Specialty Property, and Farm, Ranch & Stable segments comprise the Company’s Insurance Operations (“Insurance Operations”). The Company’s Reinsurance Operations segment provides reinsurance solutions through brokers and primary writers including insurance and reinsurance companies. Prior to the redomestication transactions, the Company’s Reinsurance Operations consisted solely of the operations of its Bermuda-based wholly-owned subsidiary, Global Indemnity Reinsurance. As part of the redomestication transactions, Global Indemnity Reinsurance was merged with and into Penn-Patriot Insurance Company ("Penn-Patriot"), with Penn-Patriot surviving, resulting in the assumption of Global Indemnity Reinsurance's business by the Global Indemnity group of companies’ existing U.S. insurance company subsidiaries.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with United States of America generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), which differs in certain respects from those principles followed in reports to insurance regulatory authorities. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Global Indemnity and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Redomestication
At 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on August 28, 2020 (the "Effective Time"), Global Indemnity Limited, incorporated in the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability, completed a scheme of arrangement and amalgamation under Sections 86 and 87 of the Cayman Islands Companies Law (2020 Revision) (the "Scheme of Arrangement") that effected certain transactions (the "Redomestication") that resulted in the shareholders of Global Indemnity Limited becoming the holders of all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Global Indemnity Group, LLC.
As a result, any references to class A common shares or class B common shares after the Effective Time refer to Global Indemnity Group, LLC class A common shares or class B common shares and any references to class A common shares or class B common shares prior to the Effective Time refers to Global Indemnity Limited A ordinary shares or B ordinary shares.
The Redomestication was approved by Global Indemnity Limited’s shareholders at a special meeting and an extraordinary general meeting held on August 25, 2020, convened by Order of the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands dated July 22, 2020. The terms and conditions of the issuance of the securities in connection with the Redomestication were sanctioned by the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands pursuant to an Order granted on August 26, 2020 after a hearing upon the fairness of such terms and conditions at which all holders of Global Indemnity Limited ordinary shares had a right to appear and of which adequate notice had been given.
Following completion of the Scheme of Arrangement, Global Indemnity Group, LLC survived as the ultimate parent company of the Global Indemnity group of companies. Additionally, as part of the Redomestication transactions, Global Indemnity Reinsurance Company was merged with and into Penn-Patriot, with Penn-Patriot surviving, resulting in the assumption of Global Indemnity Reinsurance’s business by the Global Indemnity group of companies’ existing U.S. insurance company subsidiaries (the "GI Bermuda Transaction" and, together with the Redomestication and the other transactions described in Global Indemnity Limited's Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 23, 2020 (the "Redomestication Proxy Statement"), the "Transactions").
Prior to the Redomestication, the Global Indemnity Limited A ordinary shares were listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ("Nasdaq") under the symbol "GBLI" and registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). At the Effective Time, Global Indemnity Group, LLC’s class A common shares were deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) under the Exchange Act. The issuance of the class A common shares by Global Indemnity Group, LLC in the Redomestication was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), by virtue of Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act. The Company’s class A common shares began trading on Nasdaq under the symbol "GBLI," the same symbol under which the Global Indemnity Limited ordinary shares previously traded, at the commencement of trading on Nasdaq on August 28, 2020.
On August 27, 2020, Global Indemnity Group, LLC issued 4,000 series A cumulative fixed rate preferred interests. Following the Effective Time, all of the issued and outstanding series A fixed rate preferred interests were unaffected by the Scheme of Arrangement. See Note 14 for additional information regarding the issuance of these preferred interests. The issuance of series A preferred interests was made pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The series A preferred interests are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or property of Global Indemnity Group, LLC.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Investments
The Company’s investments in fixed maturities, which are classified as available for sale, and equity securities are carried at their fair value. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair values of the Company's fixed maturities and equity securities are determined on the basis of quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company uses third party pricing services to assist in determining fair value. In many instances, these services examine the pricing of similar instruments to estimate fair value. The Company purchases bonds with the expectation of holding them to their maturity; however, changes to the portfolio are sometimes required to assure it is appropriately matched to liabilities. In addition, changes in financial market conditions and tax considerations may cause the Company to sell an investment before it matures. The difference between amortized cost and fair value of the Company’s fixed maturity portfolio, net of the effect of deferred income taxes, is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity and, accordingly, has no effect on net income (loss) other than for the credit loss component of impairments and losses recognized as a result of the intent to sell. Equity securities are measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in net income (loss).
For investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies where the ownership interest is less than 3%, the Company carries these investments at fair value, and the change in the difference between cost and the fair value of these interests, net of the effect of deferred income taxes, is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity and, accordingly, has no effect on net income (loss). The Company uses the equity method to account for investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies where its ownership interest exceeds 3%. The equity method of accounting for an investment in a limited partnership and limited liability company requires that its cost basis be updated to account for the income or loss earned on the investment. The income or loss associated with the limited partnerships and limited liability companies is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations, and the adjusted cost basis approximates fair value.
The Company’s investments in other invested assets were valued at $97.0 million and $47.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts relate to investments in limited partnerships and limited liability companies whose carrying value approximates fair value.
Net realized gains and losses on investments are determined based on the first-in, first-out method.
The Company implemented new accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 related to the measurement of expected credit losses on financial instruments. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses are still measured similar to the old guidance; however, the new guidance requires that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down of the amortized cost basis of the impaired security and allows for the reversal of credit losses in the current period net income (loss). Any impairments related to factors other than credit losses and the intent to sell continue to be recorded through other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
The Company regularly performs various analytical valuation procedures with respect to its investments, including reviewing each available for sale debt security in an unrealized loss position to assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. In assessing whether a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security to the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for expected credit losses is recorded. Subsequent changes in the allowances are recorded in the period of change as either credit loss expense or reversal of credit loss expense. Any impairments related to factors other than credit losses and the intent to sell are recorded through other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
For fixed maturities, the factors considered in reaching the conclusion that a credit loss exists include, among others, whether:
(1)
the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis;
(2)
the issuer is in financial distress;
(3)
the investment is secured;
(4)
a significant credit rating action occurred;
(5)
scheduled interest payments were delayed or missed;
(6)
changes in laws or regulations have affected an issuer or industry;
(7)
the investment has an unrealized loss and was identified by the Company’s investment manager as an investment to be sold before recovery or maturity;
(8)
the investment failed cash flow projection testing to determine if anticipated principal and interest payments will be realized; and
(9)
changes in US Treasury rates and/or credit spreads since original purchase to identify whether the unrealized loss is simply due to interest rate movement.
According to accounting guidance for debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company is required to assess whether it has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before the anticipated recovery. If either of these conditions is met, any allowance for expected credit losses is written off and the amortized cost basis is written down to the fair value of the fixed maturity security with any incremental impairment reported in earnings. That new amortized cost basis shall not be adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.
The Company elected the practical expedient to exclude accrued interest from both the fair value and the amortized cost basis of the available for sale debt securities for the purposes of identifying and measuring an impairment and to not measure an allowance for expected credit losses for accrued interest receivables. Accrued interest receivable is written off through net realized investment gains (losses) at the time the issuer of the bond defaults or is expected to default on payment. The Company made an accounting policy election to present the accrued interest receivable balance with other assets on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position.
Variable Interest Entities
A Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) refers to an investment in which an investor holds a controlling interest that is not based on the majority of voting rights. Under the VIE model, the party that has the power to exercise significant management influence and maintain a controlling financial interest in the entity’s economics is said to be the primary beneficiary, and is required to consolidate the entity within their results. Other entities that participate in a VIE, for which their financial interests fluctuate with changes in the fair value of the investment entity’s net assets but do not have significant management influence and the ability to direct the VIE’s significant economic activities are said to have a variable interest in the VIE but do not consolidate the VIE in their financial results.
The Company has variable interests in four VIEs for which it is not the primary beneficiary. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as their ownership interest exceeds 3% of their respective investments.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company has a cash management program that provides for the investment of excess cash balances primarily in short-term money market instruments. Generally, bank balances exceed federally insured limits. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had approximately $58.0 million and $35.8 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents that was invested in a diversified portfolio of high quality short-term debt securities.
Valuation of Premium Receivable
The Company evaluates the collectability of premium receivable based on a combination of factors. In instances in which the Company is aware of a specific circumstance where a party may be unable to meet its financial obligations to the Company, a specific allowance for expected credit losses against amounts due is recorded to reduce the net receivable to the amount reasonably believed by management to be collectible. For all remaining balances, the allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of key aspects of amounts outstanding, including but not limited to, length of collection periods, direct placement with collection agencies, solvency of insured or agent, terminated agents, and other relevant factors. The allowance for expected credit losses was $2.9 million and $2.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The Company tests for impairment of goodwill at least annually and more frequently as circumstances warrant in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Accounting guidance allows for the testing of goodwill for impairment using both qualitative and quantitative factors. Impairment of goodwill is recognized only if the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit. The amount of the impairment loss would be equal to the excess carrying value of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Based on the qualitative assessment performed, there was no impairment of goodwill as of December 31, 2020.
Impairment of intangible assets with an indefinite useful life is tested at least annually and more frequently as circumstances warrant in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Accounting guidance allows for the testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment using both qualitative and quantitative factors. Impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible assets exceeds the fair value of said assets. The amount of the impairment loss would be equal to the excess carrying value of the assets over the fair value of said assets. Based on the qualitative assessment performed, there were no impairments of indefinite lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2020.
Intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The carrying amounts of definite lived intangible assets are regularly reviewed for indicators of impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is in excess of its undiscounted projected cash flows. The impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the asset. As of December 31, 2020, there were no triggering events that occurred during the year that would result in an impairment of definite lived intangible assets.
See Note 7 for additional information on goodwill and intangible assets.
Reinsurance
In the normal course of business, the Company seeks to reduce the loss that may arise from events that cause unfavorable underwriting results by reinsuring certain levels of risk from various areas of exposure with reinsurers. Amounts receivable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the reinsured policy and the reinsurance contract.
The Company regularly reviews the collectability of reinsurance receivables. An allowance for uncollectible reinsurance receivable is recognized based upon the Company’s ongoing review of key aspects of amounts outstanding, including but not limited to, length of collection periods, disputes, applicable coverage defenses, insolvent reinsurers, financial strength of solvent reinsurers based on AM Best Ratings and other relevant factors. Any changes in the allowance resulting from this review are included in net losses and loss adjustment expenses on the consolidated statements of operations during the period in which the determination is made. The allowance for expected credit losses was $9.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The applicable accounting guidance requires that the reinsurer must assume significant insurance risk under the reinsured portions of the underlying insurance contracts and that there must be a reasonably possible chance that the reinsurer may realize a significant loss from the transaction. The Company has evaluated its reinsurance contracts and concluded that each contract qualifies for reinsurance accounting treatment pursuant to this guidance.
Income Taxes
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.
A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The deferred tax asset balance is analyzed regularly by management. This assessment requires significant judgment and considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies and/or actions. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations can generate sufficient taxable income to realize the remaining deferred income tax assets, and accordingly, the Company has not established any valuation allowances.
Deferred Acquisition Costs
The costs of acquiring new and renewal insurance and reinsurance contracts include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs that are directly related to the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance and reinsurance contracts. The excess of the Company’s costs of acquiring new and renewal insurance and reinsurance contracts over the related ceding commissions earned from reinsurers is capitalized as deferred acquisition costs and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned.
The amortization of deferred acquisition costs for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $140.9 million, $132.3 million, and $118.0 million, respectively.
Premium Deficiency
A premium deficiency is recognized if the sum of expected loss and loss adjustment expenses and unamortized acquisition costs exceeds related unearned premium after consideration of investment income. This evaluation is done at a distribution and product line level in Insurance Operations and at a treaty level in Reinsurance Operations. Any future expected loss on the related unearned premium is recorded first by impairing the unamortized acquisition costs on the related unearned premium followed by an increase to loss and loss adjustment expense reserves on additional expected loss in excess of unamortized acquisition costs. No premium deficiency reserve existed as of December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Derivative Instruments
The Company uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to cash flow variability from interest rate risk and limit exposure to severe equity market changes. The derivative instruments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value and included in other assets and other liabilities. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments and the periodic net interest settlements under the derivatives instruments are recognized as net realized investment gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations.
Margin Borrowing Facility
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet represent the outstanding borrowings. The outstanding borrowings are due on demand; therefore, the cash receipts and cash payments related to the margin borrowing facility are shown net in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Subordinated Notes
The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet represent the outstanding balances, net of deferred issuance cost. See Note 12 for details.
Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
The liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represents the Company’s best estimate of future amounts needed to pay losses and related settlement expenses with respect to events insured by the Company. This liability is based upon the accumulation of individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of the accounting period with respect to direct business, estimates received from ceding companies with respect to assumed reinsurance, and estimates of unreported losses.
The process of establishing the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment is complex, requiring the use of informed actuarially based estimates and management’s judgment. In some cases, significant periods of time, up to several years or more, may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss and the reporting of that loss to the Company. To establish this liability, the Company regularly reviews and updates the methods of making such estimates and establishing the resulting liabilities. Any resulting adjustments are recorded in consolidated statements of operations during the period in which the determination is made.
Retirement of Treasury Stock
Upon the formal retirement of treasury stock, Global Indemnity Group, LLC offsets the par value of the treasury stock that is being retired against common shares and reflects any excess of cost over par value as a deduction from Additional Paid-in Capital.
Share Redemptions
When shares are redeemed, Global Indemnity Group, LLC offsets the par value of the redeemed shares against common shares and reflects any excess of cost over par value as a deduction from Retained Earnings.
Premiums
Premiums are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the respective policies and treaties. Unearned premiums are computed on a pro rata basis to the day of expiration.
Mandatory reinstatement premiums assessed on reinsurance policies are earned in the period of the loss event that gave rise to the reinstatement premiums.
Contingent Commissions
Certain professional general agencies of the Insurance Operations are paid special incentives, referred to as contingent commissions, when results of business produced by these agencies are more favorable than predetermined thresholds. Similarly, in some circumstances, companies that cede business to the Reinsurance Operations are paid profit commissions based on the profitability of the ceded portfolio. These commissions are charged to other underwriting expenses when incurred.
Share-Based Compensation
The Company accounts for stock options and other equity based compensation using the modified prospective application of the fair value-based method permitted by the appropriate accounting guidance. See Note 17 for details.
Earnings per Share
Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding. In periods of net income, diluted earnings per share have been calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the sum of the weighted-average common shares outstanding and the weighted-average common share equivalents outstanding, which include options and other equity awards. In periods of net loss, diluted earnings per share is the same as basic earnings per share. See Note 19 for details.
Foreign Currency
At times, the Company maintains investments and cash accounts in foreign currencies related to the operations of its business. At period-end, the Company re-measures non-U.S. currency financial assets to their current U.S. dollar equivalent. The resulting gain or loss for foreign denominated fixed maturity investments, if any, is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders’ equity; whereas, the gain or loss on foreign denominated cash accounts and equity securities is reflected in income during the period. Financial liabilities, if any, are generally adjusted within the reserving process. However, for known losses on claims to be paid in foreign currencies, the Company re-measures the liabilities to their current U.S. dollar equivalent each period end with the resulting gain or loss reflected in income during the period. Net transaction gains and losses, primarily comprised of re-measurement of known losses on claims to be paid in foreign currencies, were a gain of $0.1 million, a gain of $0.3 million, and a loss of $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Leases
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease right-of-use assets (“ROU”) are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and lease liabilities are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate; therefore, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The ROU asset is calculated using the initial lease liability amount, plus any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, minus any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred. Lease expenses for minimum lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Company’s lease agreements may contain both lease and non-lease components which are accounted separately. The Company elected the practical expedient on not separating lease components from non-lease components for its equipment leases.
Other Income
Other income is primarily comprised of fee income and foreign exchange gains and losses.

Investments
The Company implemented new accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 related to the measurement of expected credit losses on financial instruments. For financial assets held at amortized cost basis, the new guidance requires a forward-looking methodology for in-scope financial assets that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of information for credit loss estimates, including historical experience, current economic conditions and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses are still measured similar to the old guidance; however, the new guidance requires that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down of the amortized cost basis of the impaired security and allows for the reversal of credit losses in the current period net income (loss). Any impairments related to factors other than credit losses or the intent to sell continue to be recorded through other comprehensive income, net of taxes.
The Company elected the practical expedient to exclude accrued interest from both the fair value and the amortized cost basis of the available for sale debt securities for the purposes of identifying and measuring an impairment and to not measure an allowance for expected credit losses for accrued interest receivables. Accrued interest receivable is written off through net realized investment gains (losses) at the time the issuer of the bond defaults or is expected to default on payment. The Company made an accounting policy election to present the accrued interest receivable balance with other assets on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial position. Accrued interest receivable was $5.7 million and $7.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed maturities securities were as follows as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company’s investments in equity securities consist of the following:
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company held Fannie Mae mortgage pools that totaled as much as 3.9% and 4.2% of shareholders’ equity, respectively. Excluding the Fannie Mae pools, U.S. treasuries, agency bonds, index funds, and limited liability companies and limited partnerships, the Company did not hold any debt or equity investments in a single issuer in excess of 2% and 3% of shareholders' equity at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the Company’s fixed maturities portfolio classified as available for sale at December 31, 2020, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.
The following table contains an analysis of the Company’s fixed income securities with gross unrealized losses that are not deemed to have credit losses, categorized by the period that the securities were in a continuous loss position as of December 31, 2020. The fair value amounts reported in the table are estimates that are prepared using the process described in Note 6.
The following table contains an analysis of the Company’s fixed income securities with gross unrealized losses, categorized by the period that the securities were in a continuous loss position as of December 31, 2019. The fair value amounts reported in the table are estimates that are prepared using the process described in Note 6.
Subject to the risks and uncertainties in evaluating the potential impairment of a security’s value, the impairment evaluation conducted by the Company as of December 31, 2020 concluded the unrealized losses discussed above are non-credit losses on securities where management does not intend to sell, and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be forced to sell the security before recovery. The impairment evaluation process is discussed in the “Investment” section of Note 3 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”).
The following is a description, by asset type, of the methodology and significant inputs that the Company used to measure the amount of credit loss recognized in earnings, if any:
U.S. treasury and agency obligations - As of December 31, 2020, gross unrealized losses related to U.S. treasury and agency obligations were $1.089 million. To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, macroeconomic and market analysis is conducted in evaluating these securities. Consideration is given to the interest rate environment, duration and yield curve management of the portfolio, sector allocation and security selection. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not recognize a credit loss on U.S. treasury and agency obligations during the period.
Obligations of states and political subdivisions - As of December 31, 2020, gross unrealized losses related to obligations of states and political subdivisions were $0.067 million. To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, elements that may influence the performance of the municipal bond market are considered in evaluating these securities such as investor expectations, supply and demand patterns, and current versus historical yield and spread relationships. The analysis relies on the output of fixed income credit analysts, as well as dedicated municipal bond analysts who perform extensive in-house fundamental analysis on each issuer, regardless of their rating by the major agencies. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not recognize a credit loss on obligations of states and political subdivisions during the period.
Mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) - As of December 31, 2020, gross unrealized losses related to mortgage-backed securities were $0.551 million. To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, mortgage-backed securities are modeled to project principal losses under downside, base, and upside scenarios for the economy and home prices. The primary assumption that drives the security and loan level modeling is the Home Price Index (“HPI”) projection. These forecasts incorporate not just national macro-economic trends, but also regional impacts to arrive at the most granular and accurate projections. These assumptions are incorporated into the model as a basis to generate delinquency probabilities, default curves, loss severity curves, and voluntary prepayment curves at the loan level within each deal. The model utilizes HPI-adjusted current LTV, payment history, loan terms, loan modification history, and borrower characteristics as inputs to generate expected cash flows and principal loss for each bond under various scenarios. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not recognize a credit loss on mortgage-backed securities during the period.
Asset backed securities (“ABS”) - As of December 31, 2020, gross unrealized losses related to asset backed securities were $0.646 million. The weighted average credit enhancement for the Company’s asset backed portfolio is 33.6. This represents the percentage of pool losses that can occur before an asset backed security will incur its first dollar of principal losses. To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, every ABS transaction is analyzed on a stand-alone basis. This analysis involves a thorough review of the collateral, prepayment, and structural risk in each transaction. Additionally, the analysis includes an in-depth credit analysis of the originator and servicer of the collateral. The analysis projects an expected loss for a deal given a set of assumptions specific to the asset type. These assumptions are used to calculate at what level of losses the deal will incur its first dollar of principal loss. The major assumptions used to calculate this ratio are loss severities, recovery lags, and no advances on principal and interest. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not recognize a credit loss on asset backed securities during the period.
Commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) - As of December 31, 2020, gross unrealized losses related to the CMBS portfolio were $0.644 million. The weighted average credit enhancement for the Company’s CMBS portfolio is 39.5. This represents the percentage of pool losses that can occur before a mortgage-backed security will incur its first dollar of principal loss. To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, a loan level analysis is utilized where every underlying CMBS loan is re-underwritten based on a set of assumptions reflecting expectations for the future path of the economy. Each loan is analyzed over time using a series of tests to determine if a credit event will occur during the life of the loan. Inherent in this process are several economic scenarios and their corresponding rent/vacancy and capital market states. The five primary credit events that frame the analysis include loan modifications, term default, balloon default, extension, and ability to pay off at balloon. The resulting output is the expected loss adjusted cash flows for each bond under the base case and distressed scenarios. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not recognize a credit loss on commercial mortgage-backed securities during the period.
Corporate bonds - As of December 31, 2020, gross unrealized losses related to corporate bonds were $0.373 million. To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, analysis for this asset class includes maintaining detailed financial models that include a projection of each issuer’s future financial performance, including prospective debt servicing capabilities, capital structure composition, and the value of the collateral. The analysis incorporates the macroeconomic environment, industry conditions in which the issuer operates, the issuer’s current competitive position, its vulnerability to changes in the competitive and regulatory environment, issuer liquidity, issuer commitment to bondholders, issuer creditworthiness, and asset protection. Part of the process also includes running downside scenarios to evaluate the expected likelihood of default as well as potential losses in the event of default. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not recognize a credit loss on corporate bonds during the period.
Foreign bonds - As of December 31, 2020, gross unrealized losses related to foreign bonds were $0.027 million. To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, detailed financial models are maintained that include a projection of each issuer’s future financial performance, including prospective debt servicing capabilities, capital structure composition, and the value of the collateral. The analysis incorporates the macroeconomic environment, industry conditions in which the issuer operates, the issuer’s current competitive position, its vulnerability to changes in the competitive and regulatory environment, issuer liquidity, issuer commitment to bondholders, issuer creditworthiness, and asset protection. Part of the process also includes running downside scenarios to evaluate the expected likelihood of default as well as potential losses in the event of default. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not recognize a credit loss on foreign bonds during the period.
The Company has evaluated its investment portfolio and has determined that an allowance for credit losses on its investments is not required.

The fair values were as follows as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Variable Interest Entities
A Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) refers to an investment in which an investor holds a controlling interest that is not based on the majority of voting rights. Under the VIE model, the party that has the power to exercise significant management influence and maintain a controlling financial interest in the entity’s economics is said to be the primary beneficiary, and is required to consolidate the entity within their results. Other entities that participate in a VIE, for which their financial interests fluctuate with changes in the fair value of the investment entity’s net assets but do not have significant management influence and the ability to direct the VIE’s significant economic activities are said to have a variable interest in the VIE but do not consolidate the VIE in their financial results.
The Company has variable interests in four VIE’s for which it is not the primary beneficiary. These investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as their ownership interest exceeds 3% of their respective investments.
The carrying value of one of the Company’s VIE’s, which invests in distressed securities and assets, was $10.8 million and $13.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from this VIE, which factors in future funding commitments, was $25.0 million and $27.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The carrying value of a second VIE that also invests in distressed securities and assets was $15.7 million and $24.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from this VIE, which factors in future funding commitments, was $32.7 million and $41.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The carrying value of a third VIE that invests in REIT qualifying assets was $10.5 million and $9.8 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from this VIE, which factors in future funding commitments, was $10.5 million and $10.3 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the 4th quarter, the Company made a $60.0 million investment in a fourth VIE that invests in a broad portfolio of non-investment grade loans. As of December 31, 2020, the carry value and maximum exposure to loss from this VIE were $60.0 million. The Company’s investment in VIEs is included in other invested assets on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in carrying value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.

Derivative Instruments
Derivatives are used by the Company to reduce risks from changes in interest rates and limit exposure to severe equity market changes. The Company has interest rate swaps with terms to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts as calculated by reference to an agreed notional amount. In 2019, the Company began to utilize exchange-traded futures contracts, which give the holder the right and obligation to participate in market movements at a future date, to allow the Company to react faster to market conditions. The Company posts collateral and settles variation margin in cash on a daily basis equal to the amount of the futures contracts’ change in value scaled by a multiplier.
The Company accounts for the interest rate swaps and futures as non-hedge instruments and recognizes the fair value of the interest rate swaps in other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets with the changes in fair value recognized as net realized investment gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company is ultimately responsible for the valuation of the interest rate swaps. To aid in determining the estimated fair value of the interest rate swaps, the Company relies on the forward interest rate curve and information obtained from a third party financial institution.
The following table summarizes information on the location and the gross amount of the derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
(1)
Futures are settled daily such that their fair value is not reflected in the consolidated statements of financial position
(2)
The derivatives are held by GBLI Holdings, LLC and are guaranteed by Global Indemnity Group, LLC
The following table summarizes the net gains (losses) included in the consolidated statements of operations for changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the periodic net interest settlements under the derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company is due $2.8 million and $3.0 million, respectively, for funds it needed to post to execute the swap transaction and $17.5 million and $12.5 million, respectively, for margin calls made in connection with the interest rate swaps. These amounts are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company posted initial margin of $0.5 million and $3.0 million, respectively, in securities for trading futures contracts and has a mark-to-market receivable of less than $0.1 million and $0.3 million, respectively, in connection with the futures contracts. Variation margin is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
6.
Fair Value Measurements
The accounting standards related to fair value measurements define fair value, establish a framework for measuring fair value, outline a fair value hierarchy based on inputs used to measure fair value, and enhance disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. These standards do not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value. The Company has determined that its fair value measurements are in accordance with the requirements of these accounting standards.
The Company’s invested assets and derivative instruments are carried at their fair value and are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy:
•
Level 1 - inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
•
Level 2 - inputs utilize other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for similar assets, either directly or indirectly.
•
Level 3 - inputs are unobservable for the asset, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset.
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset.
The following table presents information about the Company’s invested assets and derivative instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value.
The securities classified as Level 1 in the above table consist of U.S. Treasuries and equity securities actively traded on an exchange.
The securities classified as Level 2 in the above table consist primarily of fixed maturity securities and derivative instruments. Based on the typical trading volumes and the lack of quoted market prices for fixed maturities, security prices are derived through recent reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. If there are no recent reported trades, matrix or model processes are used to develop a security price where future cash flow expectations are developed based upon collateral performance and discounted at an estimated market rate. Included in the pricing of asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and mortgage-backed securities are estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the remaining life of the securities. Such estimates are derived based on the characteristics of the underlying structure and prepayment speeds previously experienced at the interest rate levels projected for the underlying collateral. The estimated fair value of the derivative instruments, consisting of interest rate swaps, is obtained from a third party financial institution that utilizes observable inputs such as the forward interest rate curve.
For the Company’s material debt arrangements, the current fair value of the Company’s debt at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:
(1)
The Margin Borrowing Facility was fully paid down in August 2020.
(2)
As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value and fair value of the 7.75% Subordinated Notes due 2045 are net of unamortized debt issuance cost of $3.1 million. In August 2020, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 7.75% subordinated notes due 2045 and unamortized debt issuance cost of $3.1 million was written off and included in the consolidated statements of operations as loss on the extinguishment of debt.
(3)
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value and fair value of the 7.875% Subordinated Notes due 2047 are net of unamortized debt issuance cost of $3.7 million and $3.9 million, respectively.
The fair value of the margin borrowing facility approximates its carrying value due to the facility being due on demand. The subordinated notes due 2045 and 2047 are publicly traded instruments and are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.
Fair Value of Alternative Investments
Other invested assets consist of limited liability companies and limited partnerships whose carrying value approximates fair value.
The following table provides the fair value and future funding commitments related to these investments at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(1)
This limited partnership invests in distressed securities and assets through senior and subordinated, secured and unsecured debt and equity, in both public and private large-cap and middle-market companies. The Company does not have the ability to sell or transfer its limited partnership interest without consent from the general partner. The Company does not have the contractual option to redeem its limited partnership interest but receives distributions based on the liquidation of the underlying assets.
(2)
This limited partnership invests in stressed and distressed securities and structured products. The Company does not have the ability to sell or transfer its limited partnership interest without consent from the general partner. The Company does not have the contractual option to redeem its limited partnership interest but receives distributions based on the liquidation of the underlying assets.
(3)
This limited partnership invests in REIT qualifying assets such as mortgage loans, investor property loans, and commercial mortgage loans. The Company does not have the ability to sell or transfer its limited partnership interest without consent from the general partner. The Company does not have the contractual option to redeem its limited partnership interest but receives distributions based on the liquidation of the underlying assets.
(4)
This limited liability company invests in a broad portfolio of non-investment grade loans, secured and unsecured corporate debt, credit default swaps, reverse repurchase agreements and synthetic indices. The Company does have the ability to sell its interest by providing notice to the fund.
Limited Liability Companies and Limited Partnerships with ownership interest exceeding 3%
The Company uses the equity method to account for investments in limited liability companies and limited partnerships where its ownership interest exceeds 3%. The equity method of accounting for an investment in a limited liability companies and limited partnership requires that its cost basis be updated to account for the income or loss earned on the investment. The investment income
associated with these limited liability companies and limited partnerships, which is booked on a one quarter lag, is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations in the amounts of $(6.2) million, less than $0.1 million, and $6.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Pricing
The Company’s pricing vendors provide prices for all investment categories except for investments in limited liability companies and limited partnerships. Two primary vendors are utilized to provide prices for equity and fixed maturity securities.
The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used by the Company’s pricing vendors for investment securities carried at fair value:
•
Equity security prices are received from primary and secondary exchanges.
•
Corporate and agency bonds are evaluated by utilizing a spread to a benchmark curve. Bonds with similar characteristics are grouped into specific sectors. Inputs for both asset classes consist of trade prices, broker quotes, the new issue market, and prices on comparable securities.
•
Data from commercial vendors is aggregated with market information, then converted into an option adjusted spread (“OAS”) matrix and prepayment model used for collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”). CMOs are categorized with mortgage-backed securities in the tables listed above. For asset-backed securities, spread data is derived from trade prices, dealer quotations, and research reports. For both asset classes, evaluations utilize standard inputs plus new issue data, and collateral performance. The evaluated pricing models incorporate cash flows, broker quotes, market trades, historical prepayment speeds, and dealer projected speeds.
•
For obligations of state and political subdivisions, an attribute-based modeling system is used. The pricing model incorporates trades, market clearing yields, market color, and fundamental credit research.
•
U.S. treasuries are evaluated by obtaining feeds from a number of live data sources including primary and secondary dealers as well as inter-dealer brokers.
•
For mortgage-backed securities, various external analytical products are utilized and purchased from commercial vendors.
The Company performs certain procedures to validate whether the pricing information received from the pricing vendors is reasonable, to ensure that the fair value determination is consistent with accounting guidance, and to ensure that its assets are properly classified in the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s procedures include, but are not limited to:
•
Reviewing periodic reports provided by the Investment Manager that provides information regarding rating changes and securities placed on watch. This procedure allows the Company to understand why a particular security’s market value may have changed or may potentially change.
•
Understanding and periodically evaluating the various pricing methods and procedures used by the Company’s pricing vendors to ensure that investments are properly classified within the fair value hierarchy.
•
On a quarterly basis, the Company corroborates investment security prices received from its pricing vendors by obtaining pricing from a second pricing vendor for a sample of securities.
During 2020 and 2019, the Company has not adjusted quotes or prices obtained from the pricing vendors.
7.Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill
As a result of acquisitions in 2015 and 2010, the Company has goodwill, within the Specialty Property and Farm, Ranch & Stable segments, of $6.5 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the Company’s best estimate of the fair value of the assets acquired. Impairment testing performed in 2020 and 2019 did not result in impairment of the goodwill acquired.
Intangible assets
The following table presents details of the Company’s intangible assets as of December 31, 2020:

Allowance for Expected Credit Losses - Premiums Receivable and Reinsurance Receivables
The Company implemented new accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 related to the measurement of expected credit losses on financial instruments. Please see Note 23 for further discussion on this new accounting guidance.
For premiums receivables, the allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of key aspects of amounts outstanding, including but not limited to, length of collection periods, direct placement with collection agencies, solvency of insured or agent, terminated agents, and other relevant factors.
For reinsurance receivables, the allowance is based upon the Company’s ongoing review of key aspects of amounts outstanding, including but not limited to, length of collection periods, disputes, applicable coverage defenses, insolvent reinsurers, financial strength of solvent reinsurers based on AM Best Ratings and other relevant factors.
The following table is an analysis of the allowance for expected credit losses related to the Company's premiums receivable and reinsurance receivables for the year ended December 31, 2020:
9.
Reinsurance
The Company cedes risk to unrelated reinsurers on a pro rata (“quota share”) and excess of loss basis in the ordinary course of business to limit its net loss exposure on insurance contracts. Reinsurance ceded arrangements do not discharge the Company of primary liability. Moreover, reinsurers may fail to pay the Company due to a lack of reinsurer liquidity, perceived improper underwriting, and losses for risks that are excluded from reinsurance coverage and other similar factors, all of which could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.
The Company had the following reinsurance balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:
The reinsurance receivables above are net of a purchase accounting adjustment related to discounting acquired loss reserves to their present value and applying a risk margin to the discounted reserves. This adjustment was $0.4 million at December 31, 2019. There was no adjustment at December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company had one aggregate unsecured reinsurance receivables that exceeded 3% of shareholders’ equity from the following reinsurer. Unsecured reinsurance receivables include amounts receivable for paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, less amounts secured by collateral.
The effect of reinsurance on premiums written and earned is as follows:
(1)
Includes ceded written premiums of less than $0.1 million, ($0.3) million, and ($2.1) million and ceded earned premiums of $1.6 million, $2.3 million and $7.3 million to American Bankers Insurance Company for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

As of December 31, 2020, the statutory income tax rates of the countries where the Company conducts or conducted business are 21% in the United States, 0% in Bermuda, 0% in the Cayman Islands, 19% in the United Kingdom and 25% on non-trading income, 33% on capital gains and 12.5% on trading income in the Republic of Ireland. The statutory income tax rate of each country is applied against the expected annual taxable income of the Company in each country to estimate the annual income tax expense.
The Company’s income (loss) before income taxes from its non-U.S. subsidiaries and U.S. subsidiaries for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were as follows:
The following table summarizes the components of income tax expense (benefit):
The weighted average expected tax provision has been calculated using income (loss) before income taxes in each jurisdiction multiplied by that jurisdiction’s applicable statutory tax rate.
The following table summarizes the differences between the tax provision for financial statement purposes and the expected tax provision at the weighted average tax rate:
The effective income tax benefit rate for 2020 was 27.8%, compared with an effective income tax expense rate of 14.4% and an effective income tax benefit rate of 25.3% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax benefit for 2020 is primarily due to a pre-tax loss of the Company’s U.S. subsidiaries in 2020 as compared to pre-tax income in 2019. In addition, the income tax benefit for 2020 was also impacted by a change in tax status which is the income tax benefit recognized on net insurance liabilities that were redomiciled from Bermuda at a 0% tax rate to the United States at a 21% tax rate. The increase in the effective income tax expense rate in 2019 compared to 2018 is due to higher pretax income in the U.S. in 2019.
The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are presented below:
The deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities listed in the table above relate to temporary differences between the Company’s accounting and tax carrying values and carryforwards for its companies in the United States. Management believes it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be completely utilized in future years. As a result, the Company has not recorded a valuation allowance at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The Company has a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward of $26.2 million as of December 31, 2020, which begins to expire in 2036 based on when the original NOL was generated. The Company’s NOL carryforward as of December 31, 2019 was $21.9 million.
The Company has a Section 163(j) (“163(j)”) carryforward of $5.6 million and $9.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which can be carried forward indefinitely. The 163(j) carryforward relates to the limitation on the deduction for business interest expense paid or accrued.
The Company had an alternative minimum tax (“AMT”) credit carryforward of $11.0 million as of December 31, 2019. Under the provisions of the CARES Act, the Company filed a request for a full refund in 2020. The Company received $11.0 million of the AMT credit carryforward during the year ended December 31, 2020.
The Company and some of its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various U.S. states and certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal tax examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2017.
The Company applies a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties whereby it only recognizes those tax benefits that have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon examination by relevant taxing authorities. All tax benefits recognized by the Company in 2020, 2019, and 2018 have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon examination by relevant taxing authorities.
The Company classifies all interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. The Company did not incur any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not record any liabilities for tax-related interest and penalties on its consolidated balance sheets.

Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses
Consolidated Activity
Activity in the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is summarized as follows:
When analyzing loss reserves and prior year development, the Company considers many factors, including the frequency and severity of claims, loss trends, case reserve settlements that may have resulted in significant development, and any other additional or pertinent factors that may impact reserve estimates.
During 2020, the Company reduced its prior accident year loss reserves by $31.5 million, which consisted of a $17.6 million decrease related to Commercial Specialty, a $6.6 million decrease related to Specialty Property, a $2.3 million decrease related to Farm, Ranch & Stable, and a $5.0 million decrease related to Reinsurance Operations.
The $17.6 million reduction of prior accident year loss reserves related to Commercial Specialty primarily consisted of the following:
•
General Liability: A $20.4 million reduction in aggregate with $6.6 million of favorable development in the construction defect reserve category and $13.8 million of favorable development in the other general liability reserve categories. The reduction in the construction defect reserve category primarily recognizes lower than expected claims frequency and severity in the 2005 through 2009, 2012, 2015 and 2017 accident years, slightly offset by an increase in the 2016 accident year. For the other general liability reserve categories, lower than anticipated claims severity was the main driver of the favorable development primarily in the 2005 through 2015 accident years, partially offset by increases in the 2016 through 2019 accident years.
•
Professional Liability: A $1.8 million decrease mainly in the 2007 through 2010 and 2019 accident years recognizes lower than expected claims severity, partially offset by an increase in the 2006 accident year.
•
Commercial Auto Liability: A $1.0 million reduction primarily in the 2010 and 2012 through 2016 accident years recognizes lower than anticipated claims severity.
•
Property: A $5.8 million increase primarily recognizes higher than expected claims severity mainly in the 2013 and 2015 through 2018 accident years, partially offset by a decrease in the 2014 accident year. The bulk of the increase was in the 2018 accident year which reflects a higher estimated ultimate for Hurricane Michael. The increase in ultimate resulted from receiving additional information during the year for a Property Brokerage claim.
•
Workers Compensation: A $0.2 million decrease primarily in loss adjustment expense reserves in the 2012 accident year and accident years prior to 2005.
The $6.6 million reduction of prior accident year loss reserves related to Specialty Property primarily consisted of the following:
•
Property: A $4.5 million decrease reflects a decrease in the 2017 accident year catastrophe reserve categories for subrogation recoveries from the California wildfires and mainly recognizes lower than anticipated claims severity in the 2015 through 2018 accident years, partially offset by an increase in the 2019 accident year due to higher than expected claims severity.
•
General Liability: A $2.1 million decrease primarily recognizes lower than expected claims severity mainly in the 2015 through 2019 accident years.
The $2.3 million reduction of prior accident year loss reserves related to Farm, Ranch & Stable primarily consisted of the following:
•
Property: A $2.0 million decrease mainly reflects lower than anticipated claims severity in the 2016 through 2018 accident years and a reduction in the catastrophe reserve category in the 2017 accident year for subrogation recoveries from the California wildfires, partially offset by an increase in the 2019 accident year.
•
Liability: A $0.3 million decrease primarily recognizes lower than expected claims severity mainly in the 2009 and 2015 through 2019 accident years, mostly offset by increases in the 2007 and 2013 accident years due to higher than anticipated claims severity.
The $5.0 million decrease in prior accident year loss reserves related to Reinsurance Operations were primarily based on a review of the experience reported from cedants. There was a $2.9 million decrease in the property lines in the 2009 through 2018 accident years, partially offset by an increase in the 2019 accident year. In addition, there was a reduction of $1.7 million in the professional lines in the 2014 and 2015 accident years and a reduction of $0.4 million in the liability & workers compensation lines in the 2009 through 2012 accident years.
During 2019, the Company reduced its prior accident year loss reserves by $32.8 million, which consisted of a $18.4 million decrease related to Commercial Specialty, $10.8 million decrease related to Specialty Property, $5.5 million decrease related to Farm, Ranch & Stable, and a $1.9 million increase related to Reinsurance Operations.
The $18.4 million reduction of prior accident year loss reserves related to Commercial Specialty primarily consisted of the following:
•
General Liability: A $14.5 million reduction in aggregate with $3.5 million of favorable development in the construction defect reserve category and $11.0 million of favorable development in the other general liability reserve categories. The favorable development in the construction defect reserve category recognizes better than expected claims frequency and severity in the 2004 through 2009, 2011 through 2015, 2017 and 2018 accident years, partially offset by increases in the 2010 and 2016 accident years which reflects higher than anticipated claims severity. The decreases in the other general liability reserve categories primarily recognizes lower than anticipated claims severity in the 1999 through 2014, 2016 and 2017 accident years, partially offset by an increase in the 2015 accident year which was impacted by higher than expected claims severity.
•
Commercial Auto Liability: A $2.0 million decrease primarily driven by better than expected claims severity in the 2000 through 2002, 2010 through 2013, 2015 and 2016 accident years.
•
Professional Liability: A $1.9 million reduction primarily in the 2007 through 2011 accident years recognizes better than expected claims severity.
•
Property: A $0.9 million decrease in aggregate mainly due to lower than anticipated claims severity in the 2012 through 2016 accident years, partially offset by increases in the 2010, 2017 and 2018 accident years which were impacted by higher than expected claims severity.
•
Reinsurance: A $1.0 million increase was recognized based on a review of expected ceded recoverables by reinsurer. The increase was primarily in the general liability reserve categories and older accident years.
The $10.8 million reduction of prior accident year loss reserves related to Specialty Property primarily consisted of the following:
•
Property: A $10.2 million decrease in aggregate primarily recognizes a reduction in the catastrophe reserve category for subrogation recoveries from the California Camp wildfire loss in the 2018 accident year. There also was favorable development in accident years 2015 through 2017 reflecting better than expected claims severity.
•
General Liability: A $0.6 million decrease primarily recognizes lower than expected claims severity in the 2014 through 2016 and 2018 accident years, partially offset by increases in the 2010 and 2017 accident years, recognizing higher than expected claims severity.
The $5.5 million reduction of prior accident year loss reserves related to Farm, Ranch & Stable primarily consisted of the following:
•
Property: A $3.9 million decrease in aggregate in the 2015 through 2018 accident years primarily reflects lower than expected claims severity. Also, there were ceded recoveries from a second accident quarter catastrophe in the 2018 accident year leading to favorable development in that year.
•
Liability: A $1.6 million decrease primarily in the 2015 through 2017 accident years recognizes lower than anticipated claims severity, partially offset by increases in the 2013, 2014, and 2018 accident years which reflects higher than expected claims severity.
The $1.9 million increase in prior accident year loss reserves related to Reinsurance Operations primarily consisted of the following:
•
Property: A $5.0 million increase primarily in the 2016 through 2018 accident years partially offset by favorable development in the 2011 through 2015 accident years based on a review of the experience reported from the cedants. The 2018 accident year was adversely impacted by $9.0 million of development from Typhoon Jebi.
•
Professional Liability: A $3.1 million decrease was recognized in the 2008, 2010 and 2013 through 2015 accident years, partially offset by an increase in the 2007 accident year based on a review of the experience reported from the cedants.
During 2018, the Company reduced its prior accident year loss reserves by $28.8 million, which consisted of a $7.3 million decrease related to Commercial Specialty, $7.9 million decrease related to Specialty Property, $4.7 million decrease related to Farm, Ranch & Stable, and a $8.9 million decrease related to Reinsurance Operations.
The $7.3 million reduction of prior accident year loss reserves related to Commercial Specialty primarily consisted of the following:
•
General Liability: A $1.3 million reduction in reserve categories excluding construction defect. Lower than expected claims severity was the primary driver of the favorable development, mainly in the 2002 through 2004, 2006 through 2010, and 2012 through 2014 accident years which was partially offset by increases in the 2011 and 2015 through 2017 accident years.
•
Commercial Auto Liability: A $3.2 million decrease in the aggregate primarily due to a reduction in the 2010, 2012 and 2013 accident years resulting from lower than anticipated claims severity partially offset by an increase in the 2015 and 2017 accident years.
•
Professional Liability: A $0.9 million decrease reflects lower than expected claims severity mainly in the 2008, 2011, and 2014 accident years.
•
Property: A $1.9 million decrease in the aggregate recognizes lower than anticipated claims severity primarily in the 2007, 2014, 2015, and 2017 accident years partially offset by an increase in the 2016 accident year.
The $7.9 million reduction of prior accident year loss reserves related to Specialty Property primarily consisted of the following:
•
Property: A $5.7 million reduction in the property reserve categories. The decrease reflects lower than anticipated claims severity primarily in the 2014 through 2017 accident years.
•
General Liability: A $2.2 million decrease primarily in the 2011 through 2014 and 2016 through 2017 accident years, which recognizes lower than expected claims severity, partially offset by an increase in the 2015 accident year which reflects higher than expected claims severity.
The $4.7 reduction of prior accident year loss reserves related to Farm, Ranch & Stable primarily consisted of the following:
•
Property: A $1.3 million reduction primarily in the 2014 through 2017 accident years mainly reflects lower than expected claims severity.
•
Liability: A $3.4 million decrease reflects lower than expected claims severity primarily in the 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2017 accident years, partially offset by increases in the 2007 and 2013 accident years recognizing higher than anticipated claims severity.
The $8.9 million reduction of prior accident year loss reserves related to Reinsurance Operations was from the property lines for accident years 2007, 2009 through 2012, 2015, and 2016 partially offset by increases in the 2013, 2014, and 2017 accident years. The accident year changes were based on a review of the experience reported from cedants.
Prior to 2001, the Company underwrote multi-peril business insuring general contractors, developers, and sub-contractors primarily involved in residential construction that has resulted in significant exposure to construction defect (“CD”) claims. The Company’s reserves for CD claims are established based upon management’s best estimate in consideration of known facts, existing case law and generally accepted actuarial methodologies. However, due to the inherent uncertainty concerning this type of business, the ultimate exposure for these claims may vary significantly from the amounts currently recorded. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, gross reserves for CD claims were $31.4 million and $36.9 million, respectively, and net reserves for CD claims were $29.8 million and $35.4 million, respectively.
The Company has exposure to asbestos and environmental (“A&E”) claims. The asbestos exposure primarily arises from the sale of product liability insurance, and the environmental exposure arises from the sale of general liability and commercial multi-peril insurance. In establishing the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses related to A&E exposures, management considers facts currently known and the current state of the law and coverage litigation. Liabilities are recognized for known claims (including the cost of related litigation) when sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy, and management can reasonably estimate its liability. In addition, liabilities have been established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims. Estimates of the liabilities are reviewed and updated regularly. Case law continues to evolve for such claims, and uncertainty exists about the outcome of coverage litigation and whether past claim experience will be representative of future claim experience. Included in net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were IBNR reserves of $27.3 million, $27.1 million, and $27.4 million, respectively, and case reserves of approximately $1.4 million, $2.0 million, and $2.1 million, respectively, for known A&E-related claims.
The following table shows the Company’s gross reserves for A&E losses:
The following table shows the Company’s net reserves for A&E losses:
Establishing reserves for A&E and other mass tort claims involves more judgment than other types of claims due to, among other things, inconsistent court decisions, an increase in bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos-related liabilities, and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage. The insurance industry continues to receive a substantial number of asbestos-related bodily injury claims, with an increasing focus being directed toward other parties, including installers of products containing asbestos rather than against asbestos manufacturers. This shift has resulted in significant insurance coverage litigation implicating applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including but not limited to, determinations as to whether or not an asbestos-related bodily injury claim is subject to aggregate limits of liability found in most comprehensive general liability policies.
As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the survival ratio on a gross basis for the Company’s open A&E claims was 35.5 years, 32.1 years, and 24.2 years, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the survival ratio on a net basis for the Company’s open A&E claims was 59.5 years, 47.8 years, and 35.7 years, respectively. The survival ratio, which is the ratio of gross or net reserves to the 3-year average of annual paid claims, is a financial measure that indicates how long the current amount of gross or net reserves are expected to last based on the current rate of paid claims.

Commercial Specialty
Property and Casualty Methodologies
Commercial Specialty’s internal actuarial reserve reviews were completed for loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses (“ALAE”) separately for property excluding catastrophe experience, property catastrophes, and casualty reserve categories. The internal actuarial reserve reviews were completed with data through December, 2020. Actuarial methodologies, such as the Loss Development and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods, were employed to develop estimates of ultimate Loss & ALAE for most reserve categories. Additional actuarial methodologies were employed to develop estimates of ultimate Loss & ALAE for mass tort and constructions defect reserve categories due to the unique characteristics of the exposures involved. Management’s ultimate selections considered the internal actuarial review and a third party actuarial review completed during the 4th quarter of 2020. Case incurred is subtracted from the management selected ultimates to obtain the booked IBNR reserves. These methodologies are consistent with last year.
Commercial Specialty’s cumulative claim frequency has been calculated at the claim level and includes claims closed without payment.

Reinsurance Lines
Property & Casualty Methodologies
Reinsurance Operations’ internal reserve reviews were completed for loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE) combined for run off treaties and the current book of business. The current book of business is constituted of professional liability portfolios and retrocessions from Bermuda based companies for property catastrophe, marine and casualty business. The reserve reviews were completed based on the latest data reported from the cedants which is typically on a quarter lag. Paid loss, ALAE and Case reserves, shown in the reinsurance category tables below, which are originally based in a foreign currency, are remeasured in U.S. dollars based on the Foreign Exchange (FX) rate at the end of the period. Management’s ultimate selections were based on a review of ultimates reported from the cedants, including loss emergence during the reporting period, and consideration of the internal actuarial review and a third party actuarial review completed during the 4th quarter of 2020. Case incurred is subtracted from the management selected ultimates to obtain the booked IBNR reserves. These methodologies are consistent with last year.
The Company does not have direct access to claim frequency information underlying certain reinsurance contracts. As a result, the Company does not believe providing claim frequency information is practicable.

(2)
The payout patterns are calculated using simple averages consistent with last year’s calculation methodology. However, these payout patterns based on simple averages look unusual given the change in estimate of ultimate losses for accident years 2013 through 2015 during the year and due to very minimal yet volatile payment activity for those accident years. Using a weighted average approach would produce smoother payout patterns as less weight is given to the accident years with minimal paid losses. The resulting volume weighted ten year annual payout pattern, for ages one through ten would be 11.7%, 19.5%, 14.4%, 16.9%, 4.8%, 1.7%, 0.2%, 0.5%, 0.4%, and 0.5%, respectively.
The reconciliation of the net incurred and paid claims development tables to the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 is as follows:
Loss indemnification related to Purchase of American Reliable
On March 8, 2018, the Company settled its final reserve calculation which resulted in $41.5 million being due to Global Indemnity Group, LLC in accordance with the Stock Purchase Agreement between Global Indemnity Group, LLC and American Bankers Insurance Group, Inc. for the purchase of American Reliable. The settlement is comprised of (i) receipt of $38.8 million for loss and loss adjustment expenses paid on or after January 1, 2015 or payable as of December 31, 2017 with respect to losses incurred prior to January 1, 2015, (ii) receipt of $6.2 million for accrued interest and (iii) payment of $3.5 million for the difference between the agreed upon purchase price and actual settlement on January 1, 2015. These amounts, which were included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017, were received on March 9, 2018.

Debt
The Company’s outstanding debt consisted of the following at December 31, 2020 and 2019:
Margin Borrowing Facility
The Company has available a margin borrowing facility. The borrowing rate for this facility is tied to the Fed Funds Effective rate and was approximately 0.8% and 1.9% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This facility is due on demand. The borrowings are subject to maintenance margin, which is a minimum account balance that must be maintained. A decline in market conditions could require an additional deposit of collateral. The Company did not have any securities that were deposited as collateral at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $88.2 million in securities were deposited as collateral to support borrowings. The amount borrowed against the margin account may fluctuate as routine investment transactions, such as dividends received, investment income received, maturities and pay-downs, impact cash balances. The margin facility contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, insolvency, failure to make required payments, failure to comply with any representations or warranties, failure to adequately assure future performance, and failure of a guarantor to perform under its guarantee. The amount outstanding on the Company’s margin borrowing facility was $73.6 million as of December 31, 2019. The Company did not have any amounts outstanding on the margin borrowing facility as of December 31, 2020.
The Company recorded interest expense related to the Margin Borrowing Facility of approximately $0.5 million, $1.8 million, and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
7.75% Subordinated Notes due 2045
In August 2020, GBLI Holdings and Global Indemnity Limited redeemed the entire outstanding $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.75% Subordinated Notes due 2045 (“2045 Notes”). In connection with the redemption, the Company wrote off deferred issuance costs of $3.1 million which was recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt in its consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Interest expense, including amortization of deferred issuance costs through the date of redemption, recognized on the 2045 Notes was $4.9 million, $7.9 million, and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
7.875% Subordinated Notes due 2047
On March 23, 2017, Global Indemnity Limited issued Subordinated Notes due in 2047 in the aggregate principal amount of $120.0 million through an underwritten public offering (the “2047 Notes”). Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, Global Indemnity Limited granted the underwriters a 30 day option to purchase up to an additional $18 million aggregate principal amount of the 2047 Notes solely to cover over-allotments, if any. On March 30, 2017, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in the amount of $10 million principal amount of the 2047 Notes. As a result, the aggregate principal amount of the 2047 Notes increased to $130.0 million. The sale of the 2047 Notes pursuant to the over-allotment option closed on March 30, 2017.
The 2047 Notes bear interest at an annual rate equal to 7.875%, payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each year, commencing July 15, 2017. The 2047 Notes mature on April 15, 2047. The Company has the right to redeem the 2047 Notes in $25 increments, in whole or in part, on and after April 15, 2022, or on any interest payment date thereafter, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2047 Notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. If the Company redeems only a portion of the 2047 Notes on any date of redemption, the Company may subsequently redeem additional 2047 Notes.
The 2047 Notes are subordinated unsecured obligations and rank (i) senior to the Company’s existing and future capital stock, (ii) senior in right of payment to future junior subordinated debt, (iii) equally in right of payment with any existing unsecured, subordinated debt that the Company has issued or may issue in the future that ranks equally with the 2047 Notes, and (iv) subordinate in right of payment to any of the Company’s future senior debt. In addition, the 2047 Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations of the Company’s subsidiaries including the Company’s margin borrowing facility.
The 2047 Notes do not require the maintenance of any financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity, and do not contain provisions that would afford holders of the 2047 Notes protection in the event of a sudden and dramatic decline in the Company’s credit quality resulting from any highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar transaction involving the Company that may adversely affect holders. The 2047 Notes do not restrict the Company in any way, now or in the future, from incurring additional indebtedness, including senior indebtedness that would rank senior in right of payment to the 2047 Notes. There is no right of acceleration of maturity of the 2047 Notes in the case of default in the payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest on the 2047 Notes or in the performance of any other obligation of the Company under the notes or if the Company defaults on any other debt securities. Holders may accelerate payment of indebtedness on the 2047 Notes only upon the Company’s bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization.
The Company incurred $4.2 million in deferred issuance costs associated with the 2047 Notes, which is being amortized over the term of the 2047 Notes. Interest expense, including amortization of deferred issuance costs, recognized on the 2047 Notes was $10.4 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
The following table represents the amounts recorded for the subordinated notes as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:

Leases
Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted new accounting guidance which increased transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance using the optional transition method. Under this method, the Company applied the new leases standard at the adoption date and recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of less than $0.1 million to the opening balance sheet of retained earnings. The Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard. In addition, the Company elected the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term for existing leases.
The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. For leases with a term of greater than 12 months, lease right-of-use assets (“ROU”) are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and lease liabilities are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
Lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate; therefore, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The ROU assets are calculated using the initial lease liability amount, plus any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, minus any lease incentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred.
The Company’s lease agreements may contain both lease and non-lease components which are accounted separately. The Company elected the practical expedient on not separating lease components from non-lease components for its equipment leases.
The Company leases office space and equipment under various operating lease arrangements. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms ranging from 3 months to 10 years. Some building leases have options to extend, terminate, or retract the leased area. The Company did not factor in term extension, terminations, or space retractions into the lease terms used to calculate the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities since it was uncertain as to whether these options would be executed.
The Company is also party to certain service contracts. These agreements will continue to be accounted for as service contracts and expensed in the period the services have been provided. As contracts are signed, renewed, or renegotiated, they will be evaluated using the criteria set forth in the new lease guidance to determine if these contracts contain a lease and will be accounted for properly depending upon the terms and language in the contract.
Lease expenses for minimum lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The components of lease expenses were as follows:
Prior to the adoption of the new accounting guidance, rental expense under operating leases was $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.
There was no sublease income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:
Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:

Shareholders’ Equity

On August 27, 2020, Global Indemnity Group, LLC issued and sold to Wyncote LLC (“Wyncote”), an affiliate of Fox Paine & Company, LLC, 4,000 Series A Preferred Interests at a price of $1,000 per Series A Preferred Interest, for the aggregate purchase price of $4,000,000. The issuance of Series A Preferred Interests to Wyncote was made pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Series A Preferred Interests are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or property of Global Indemnity Group, LLC. The preferred shares are redeemable at the discretion of Global Indemnity Group, LLC after five years or at the discretion of the holders upon the occurrence of a change in control of Global Indemnity Group, LLC. While the preferred shares are non-voting, the preferred shareholders are entitled to appoint two additional members to Global Indemnity Group, LLC’s Board of Directors whenever the “Unpaid Targeted Priority Return” (as defined in the applicable Share Designation) with respect to the preferred shares exceed zero immediately following six or more “Distribution Dates” (as defined in the applicable Share Designation), whether or not such Distribution Dates occur consecutively and Global Indemnity Group, LLC’s Board of Directors is obligated to take, and cause Global Indemnity Group, LLC’s officers to take, any necessary actions to effectuate such appointments, including expanding the size of the Board of Directors, in connection with any exercise of the foregoing provisions.
Following the effective time of the Redomestication (the “Effective Time”), all of the issued and outstanding Series A Preferred Interests sold to Wyncote remain outstanding as "Series A Cumulative Fixed Rate Preferred Shares", unaffected by the Scheme of Arrangement and subject to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Global Indemnity Group, LLC (the “LLCA”) and that certain Share Designation, effective as of the Effective Time, that sets forth the designation, rights, preferences, powers, duties, restrictions, limitations and obligations of the Series A Cumulative Fixed Rate Preferred Shares from and after the Effective Time.
Distribution Restrictions
The ability of Global Indemnity Group, LLC to pay distributions is subject to applicable federal and state laws and Global Indemnity Group, LLC’s LLCA. Distributions of cash or other assets of Global Indemnity Group, LLC may be paid to Global Indemnity Group, LLC’s shareholders out of Global Indemnity Group, LLC’s assets legally available therefor only when, and if determined by the Board.

All such distributions shall be made pro rata in relation to each such Series A Preferred Share’s Unpaid Priority Return.

Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
The Company is, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The Company maintains insurance and reinsurance coverage for such risks in amounts that it considers adequate. However, there can be no assurance that the insurance and reinsurance coverage that the Company maintains is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. The Company does not believe that the resolution of any currently pending legal proceedings, either individually or taken as a whole, will have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.
There is a greater potential for disputes with reinsurers who are in runoff. Some of the Company’s reinsurers’ have operations that are in runoff, and therefore, the Company closely monitors those relationships. The Company anticipates that, similar to the rest of the insurance and reinsurance industry, it will continue to be subject to litigation and arbitration proceedings in the ordinary course of business.

Share-Based Compensation Plans
The fair value method of accounting recognizes share-based compensation to employees and non-employee directors in the consolidated statements of operations using the grant-date fair value of the stock options and other equity-based compensation expensed over the requisite service and vesting period.
For the purpose of determining the fair value of stock option awards, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company elected a policy to accrue for compensation cost based on the number of awards that are expected to vest. An estimation of forfeitures is required when recognizing compensation expense which is then adjusted over the requisite service period should actual forfeitures differ from such estimates. Changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized through a cumulative adjustment to compensation in the period of change.
Excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies associated with share-based payment awards are required to be recognized as an income tax benefit or expense in net income (loss) with the corresponding cash flows recognized as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow.
In connection with the Redomestication, the 2018 Share Incentive Plan was amended and restated to reflect Global Indemnity Group, LLC’s assumption of the sponsorship of the plan and other changes deemed necessary and appropriate to reflect the completion of the Redomestication.

Chief Executive Officer
On March 6, 2018, the Company entered into a Chief Executive Agreement (the “Employment Agreement”) with Cynthia Y. Valko, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. In accordance with the Employment Agreement, the vesting schedule for the 300,000 stock options issued in 2014 (“Tranche 2 Options”) was modified. 100,000 of the Tranche 2 Options were related to the attainment of Return on Equity criteria for 2018 and were scheduled to vest on December 31, 2018. These options were forfeited on December 31, 2018 because the Return on Equity criteria was not met. 100,000 of the Tranche 2 Options were related to the attainment of Return on Equity criteria for 2020 and were scheduled to vest on December 31, 2020. These options were forfeited on December 31, 2020 because the Return on Equity criteria was not met. The remaining 100,000 options vested on December 31, 2019. These options are subject to remeasurement of 2019 bonus year results after the third full calendar year following the bonus year.
Under the terms of the Employment Agreement, Ms. Valko was also granted an additional 300,000 Time-Based Options (“Tranche 3 Options”) with an exercise price of $50 per share. 100,000 of the Tranche 3 Options each vested on December 31, 2018, December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2020.

On December 10, 2020, the Company entered into a new Chief Executive Agreement (the “Chief Executive Agreement”) with Ms. Valko. The Chief Executive Agreement grants Ms. Valko 300,000 options (“Tranche 4 Options”) to buy Shares, which are in addition to the 900,000 stock options previously granted by the Company to Ms. Valko. 100,000 of the Tranche 4 Options shall have an exercise price equal to the greater of the book value per share of the Company’s Shares on December 31, 2020 and the closing per-share price of the Company’s shares on the last NASDAQ trading day prior to the effective date of the Chief Executive Agreement (“Tranche 4-I Options”). 100,000 of the Tranche 4 Options shall have an exercise price equal to the exercise price of the Tranche 4-I Options, plus $3.09 (“Tranche 4-II Options”). 100,000 of the Tranche 4 Options shall have an exercise price equal to the exercise price of the Tranche 4-II Options, plus $3.33 (“Tranche 4-III Options”).

19.
Earnings Per Share
Earnings per share have been computed using the weighted average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the period.
The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:
(1)
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, “weighted average shares outstanding - basic” was used to calculate “diluted earnings per share” due to a net loss for these periods.
If the Company had not incurred a loss in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018, 14,458,008 and 14,325,276 weighted average shares, respectively, would have been used to compute the diluted loss per share calculations. In addition to the basic shares, weighted average shares for the diluted calculations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018 would have included 17,470 and 76,568 shares of non-vested restricted stock, respectively, 57,456 and 0 restricted stock units, respectively, and 91,816 and 159,825 share equivalents for options, respectively.
The weighted average shares outstanding used to determine dilutive earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2020 did not include 700,000 options and 66,957 restricted stock units which were deemed to be anti-dilutive. The weighted average shares outstanding used to determine dilutive earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 do not include 500,000 options which were deemed to be anti-dilutive.

Statutory Financial Information
GAAP differs in certain respects from Statutory Accounting Principles (“SAP”) as prescribed or permitted by the various U.S. state insurance departments. The principal differences between SAP and GAAP are as follows:
•
Under SAP, investments in debt securities are primarily carried at amortized cost, while under GAAP the Company records its debt securities at estimated fair value.
•
Under SAP, policy acquisition costs, such as commissions, premium taxes, fees and other costs of underwriting policies are charged to current operations as incurred, while under GAAP such costs are deferred and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period covered by the policy.
•
Under SAP, certain assets designated as "Non-admitted assets" (such as prepaid expenses) are charged against surplus.
•
Under SAP, net deferred income tax assets are admitted following the application of specified criteria, with the resulting admitted deferred tax amount being credited directly to surplus.
•
Under SAP, certain premium receivables are non-admitted and are charged against surplus based upon aging criteria.
•
Under SAP, the costs and related receivables for guaranty funds and other assessments are recorded based on management's estimate of the ultimate liability and related receivable settlement, while under GAAP such costs are accrued when the liability is probable and reasonably estimable and the related receivable amount is based on future premium collections or policy surcharges from in-force policies.
•
Under SAP, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums are reported net of the effects of reinsurance transactions, whereas under GAAP, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums are reported gross of reinsurance.
•
Under SAP, a provision for reinsurance is charged to surplus based on the authorized status of reinsurers, available collateral, and certain aging criteria, whereas under GAAP, an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is established based on management’s best estimate of the collectability of reinsurance receivables.
•
Under SAP, the tax impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017 is recorded through surplus, whereas under GAAP, the tax impact is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) issues model laws and regulations, many of which have been adopted by state insurance regulators, relating to: (a) risk-based capital ("RBC") standards; (b) codification of insurance accounting principles; (c) investment restrictions; and (d) restrictions on the ability of insurance companies to pay dividends.
The Company’s insurance subsidiaries are required by law to maintain certain minimum surplus on a statutory basis, and are subject to regulations under which payment of a dividend from statutory surplus is restricted and may require prior approval of regulatory authorities. Applying the current regulatory restrictions as of December 31, 2020, the maximum amount of distributions that could be paid in 2021 by Penn-Patriot Insurance Company, the United National insurance companies, the Penn-America insurance companies, and American Reliable under applicable laws and regulations without regulatory approval is approximately $34.3 million, $17.4 million, $8.1 million, and $10.0 million, respectively. The Penn-America insurance companies limitation includes $2.7 million that would be distributed to United National Insurance Company or its subsidiary, Penn Independent Corporation, based on the December 31, 2020 ownership percentages. The Company’s insurance subsidiaries did not declare or pay any dividends in 2020.
The NAIC's RBC model provides a tool for insurance regulators to determine the levels of statutory capital and surplus an insurer must maintain in relation to its insurance and investment risks, as well as its reinsurance exposures, to assess the potential need for regulatory attention. The model provides four levels of regulatory attention, varying with the ratio of an insurance company's total adjusted capital to its authorized control level RBC ("ACLRBC"). If a company’s total adjusted capital is:
(a)
less than or equal to 200%, but greater than 150% of its ACLRBC (the "Company Action Level"), the company must submit a comprehensive plan to the regulatory authority proposing corrective actions aimed at improving its capital position;
(b)
less than or equal to 150%, but greater than 100% of its ACLRBC (the "Regulatory Action Level"), the regulatory authority will perform a special examination of the company and issue an order specifying the corrective actions that must be followed;
(c)
less than or equal to 100%, but greater than 70% of its ACLRBC (the "Authorized Control Level"), the regulatory authority may take any action it deems necessary, including placing the company under regulatory control; and
(d)
less than or equal to 70% of its ACLRBC (the "Mandatory Control Level"), the regulatory authority must place the company under its control.
Based on the standards currently adopted, the Company reported in its 2020 statutory filings that the capital and surplus of the insurance companies are above the prescribed Company Action Level RBC requirements.
The following is selected information for the Company’s insurance companies, net of intercompany eliminations, where applicable, as determined in accordance with SAP:
Prior to Global Indemnity Reinsurance’s merger into Penn-Patriot on August 28, 2020, Global Indemnity Reinsurance was required to also prepare annual statutory financial statements. The Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 (the “Insurance Act”) prescribes rules for the preparation and substance of these statutory financial statements which include, in statutory form, a balance sheet, an income statement, a statement of capital and surplus and notes thereto. The statutory financial statements are not prepared in accordance with GAAP or SAP and are distinct from the financial statements prepared for presentation to Global Indemnity Reinsurance's shareholders and under the Bermuda Companies Act 1981 (the “Companies Act”), which financial statements will be prepared in accordance with GAAP.
The principal differences between statutory financial statements prepared under the Insurance Act and GAAP are as follows:
•
Under the Insurance Act, policy acquisition costs, such as commissions, premium taxes, fees and other costs of underwriting policies are charged to current operations as incurred, while under GAAP such costs are deferred and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period covered by the policy.
•
Under the Insurance Act, prepaid expenses and intangible assets are charged to current operations as incurred, while under GAAP such costs are deferred and amortized on a pro rata basis.
•
Under the Insurance Act, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums are reported net of the effects of reinsurance transactions, whereas under GAAP, unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses and unearned premiums are reported gross of reinsurance.
Under the Companies Act, Global Indemnity Reinsurance may only declare or pay a dividend if it has no reasonable grounds for believing that it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or if the realizable value of its assets would not be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts. Global Indemnity Reinsurance is also prohibited, without the approval of the BMA, from reducing by 15% or more its total statutory capital or 25% or more of its total statutory capital and surplus as set out in its previous year’s statutory financial statements, and any application for such approval must include such information as the BMA may require. In June, 2020, Global Indemnity Reinsurance declared and paid a dividend of $226.0 million to its parent company, Global Indemnity Limited. On August 26, 2020, Global Indemnity Reinsurance merged into Penn-Patriot Insurance Company.
The following is selected information for Global Indemnity Reinsurance, net of intercompany eliminations, where applicable, as determined in accordance with the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978:
As a result of the merger, the Company no longer has any subsidiaries which are Bermuda licensed companies and is not required to prepare annual statutory financial statements in accordance with the Bermuda Insurance Act 1978 for 2020.

New Accounting Pronouncements
Accounting Standards Adopted in 2020
In March 2020, the SEC amended Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X regarding financial disclosure requirements for registered debt offerings involving subsidiaries as either issuers or guarantors and affiliates whose securities are pledged as collateral. This new guidance narrows the circumstances that require separate financial statements of subsidiary issuers and guarantors and streamlines the alternative disclosures required in lieu of those statements. This rule is effective January 4, 2021 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this new standard in the fourth quarter of 2020. Accordingly, summarized financial information has been presented only for the parent and subsidiary co-obligor of the Company’s registered debt securities for the most recent fiscal year. The location of the required disclosures has been moved outside the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is provided in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources - Co-obligor Financial Information” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition’ in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
In March, 2020, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that affected a variety of topics in the Codification. The amendments in this update are meant to make the Codification easier to understand and easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarification. This guidance is effective for all fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this new accounting guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
In August, 2018, the FASB issued new accounting guidance which removed, modified, and added certain disclosures related to Topic 820, Fair Value. The affected disclosures are related to transfers between fair value levels, level 3 assets, and investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value. This guidance is effective for all fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this new accounting guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
In January, 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance that simplifies how an entity is required to test goodwill for impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (i.e. Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test). Under the new amendments, an entity may still first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If determined to be necessary, the quantitative impairment test shall be used to identify goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized, if any. A goodwill impairment loss is recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. This guidance is effective for public business entities’ annual or interim goodwill impairment testing in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this new accounting guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
In June, 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance addressing the measurement of expected credit losses on financial instruments. The new guidance requires financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes but are not limited to premiums receivable and reinsurance receivables, to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected over the life of the asset using an allowance for expected credit losses. Changes in the allowance are charged to earnings. The measurement of expected credit losses should consider relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current information, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the financial assets. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured similar to the old guidance; however, the new guidance requires that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down of the amortized cost basis of the impaired securities and allows for the reversal of credit losses in the current period net income. In addition, the Company made certain accounting policy elections related to accrued interest receivables which are described in Note 3. The Company adopted this new accounting guidance on January 1, 2020 using a modified-retrospective approach. The adoption of this new accounting guidance and the impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is described primarily within Note 3 and Note 6.
Recently Issued Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In December, 2019, the FASB issued updated guidance related to the accounting for income taxes. The updated guidance is intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing several exceptions contained in existing guidance and amending other existing guidance to simplify several other income tax accounting matters. The updated guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of this new accounting guidance to have a material impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
