Item 1A.
Risk Factors
Investing in our securities may be speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully the risks described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes and the schedules and exhibits to this Annual Report. The risks set forth below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us may also impair our operations and performance. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, our NAV and the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.
SUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS
The following is a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us:
•
As an internally managed BDC, we are subject to certain restrictions that may adversely affect our business and are dependent upon the availability of key management personnel for our future success. If we are not able to hire and retain qualified personnel, or if we lose any member of our senior management team, our ability to implement our business strategy could be significantly harmed.
•
Our business model depends (to a significant extent) upon strong referral relationships with venture capital and private equity fund sponsors, and our inability to develop or maintain these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business.
•
We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.
•
Regulations governing our operations as a BDC may affect our ability to, and the manner in which, we raise additional capital. If additional funds are unavailable or not available on favorable terms, our ability to grow will be impaired.
•
Our operating flexibility and financial condition could be negatively affected if we fail to qualify as a BDC or RIC.
•
Because we have substantial indebtedness, there could be increased risk in investing in our company.
•
There is a risk that you may not receive distributions or that our distributions may not grow over time.
•
We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates.
•
The discontinuation of LIBOR may affect the value of the financial obligations to be held or issued by us that are linked to LIBOR.
•
Our financial results could be negatively affected if a significant portfolio investment fails to perform as expected.
•
Our investments may be in portfolio companies that have limited operating histories and resources.
•
Our investment strategy focuses on technology-related companies, which are subject to many risks, including volatility, intense competition, shortened product life cycles, changes in regulatory and governmental programs and periodic downturns, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
•
Price declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets could adversely affect the fair value of our portfolio investments, reducing our NAV through increased net unrealized depreciation.
•
Economic recessions or slowdowns could impair the ability of our portfolio companies to repay loans, which, in turn, could increase our non-performing assets, decrease the value of our portfolio, reduce our volume of new loans and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
•
Our portfolio companies may be unable to repay or refinance outstanding principal on their loans at or prior to maturity, and rising interest rates may make it more difficult for portfolio companies to make periodic payments on their loans.
•
Any unrealized depreciation we experience on our investment portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce our income available for distribution and could impair our ability to service our borrowings.
•
A lack of IPO or merger and acquisition opportunities may cause companies to stay in our portfolio longer, leading to lower returns, unrealized depreciation, or realized losses.
•
The majority of our portfolio companies will need multiple rounds of additional financing to repay their debts to us and continue operations. Our portfolio companies may not be able to raise additional financing, which could harm our investment returns.
•
If the assets securing the loans that we make decrease in value, then we may lack sufficient collateral to cover losses. We may suffer a loss if a portfolio company defaults on a loan and the underlying collateral is not sufficient.
•
An investment strategy focused on privately-held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel, and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns.
•
If our portfolio companies are unable to protect their intellectual property rights or are required to devote significant resources to protecting their intellectual property rights, then our investments could be harmed.
•
We generally will not control our portfolio companies.
•
The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business and, if we need to sell any of our investments, we may not be able to do so at a favorable price.
•
Our warrant and equity-related investments are highly speculative, and we may not realize gains from these investments.
•
Prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on equity.
•
Our common stock may trade below its NAV per share, which limits our ability to raise additional equity capital.
•
Our common stock price has been and continues to be volatile and may decrease substantially.
•
The effects of the outbreak of COVID-19 have negatively affected the global economy and the United States economy, and may disrupt our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
•
We may be the target of litigation.
•
Changes in laws or regulations governing our business could negatively affect the profitability of our operations.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
Risks Related to our Business Structure
As an internally managed BDC, we are subject to certain restrictions that may adversely affect our business.
As an internally managed BDC, the size and categories of our assets under management is limited, and we are unable to offer as wide a variety of financial products to prospective portfolio companies and sponsors (potentially limiting the size and diversification of our asset base). We therefore may not achieve efficiencies of scale and greater management resources available to externally managed business development companies. In addition, if we fail to comply with restrictions applicable to an internally managed BDC, for example with respect to the portion of our assets representing qualifying assets, we may be subject to further restrictions that could have a negative impact on our business. See “Item 1. Business - Regulation.”
Additionally, as an internally managed BDC, our ability to offer more competitive and flexible compensation structures, such as offering both a profit-sharing plan and an equity incentive plan, is subject to the limitations imposed by the 1940 Act, which limits our ability to attract and retain talented investment management professionals. As such, these limitations could inhibit our ability to grow, pursue our business plan and attract and retain professional talent, any or all of which may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
As an internally managed BDC, we are dependent upon the availability of key management personnel for our future success, particularly Scott Bluestein, and if we are not able to hire and retain qualified personnel, or if we lose any member of our senior management team, our ability to implement our business strategy could be significantly harmed.
As an internally managed BDC, our ability to achieve our investment objectives and to make distributions to our stockholders depends upon the performance of our senior management. We depend upon the members of our senior management, particularly Mr. Bluestein, as well as other key personnel for the identification, final selection, structuring, closing and monitoring of our investments. These employees have critical industry experience and relationships on which we rely to implement our business plan. If we lose the services of Mr. Bluestein or any senior management members, we may not be able to operate the business as we expect, and our ability to compete could be harmed, which could cause our operating results to suffer. Furthermore, we do not have an employment agreement with Mr. Bluestein or our senior management that restricts them from creating new investment vehicles subject to compliance with applicable law. We believe our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to identify, attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees. If we do not succeed in identifying, attracting and retaining such personnel, we may not be able to operate our business as we expect. In connection with our recruiting, branding and marketing efforts, we may, among other things, make charitable contributions in amounts we believe to be immaterial and that do not exceed $500,000 in the aggregate in any year. We believe that many of these contributions help us raise our profile in the communities and benefit us in attracting and retaining talent and investment opportunities.
As an internally managed BDC, our compensation structure is determined and set by our Board of Directors. This structure currently includes salary and bonus and incentive compensation, which is issued through grants and subsequent vesting of restricted stock. We are not generally permitted by the 1940 Act to employ an incentive compensation structure that directly ties performance of our investment portfolio and results of operations to compensation owing to our granting of restricted stock as incentive compensation.
Members of our senior management may receive offers of more flexible and attractive compensation arrangements from other companies, particularly from investment advisers to externally managed BDCs that are not subject to the same limitations on incentive-based compensation that we, as an internally managed BDC are subject to. We do not currently have agreements with certain members of our senior management that prohibit them from leaving and competing with our business and certain States limit our ability to have such agreements. A departure by one or more members of our senior management could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business model depends to a significant extent upon strong referral relationships with venture capital and private equity fund sponsors, and our inability to develop or maintain these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business.
We expect that members of our management team will maintain their relationships with venture capital and private equity firms, and we will rely to a significant extent upon these relationships to provide us with our deal flow. If we fail to maintain our existing relationships, our relationships become strained as a result of enforcing our rights with respect to non-performing portfolio companies in protecting our investments or we fail to develop new relationships with other firms or sources of investment opportunities, then we will not be able to grow our investment portfolio. In addition, persons with whom members of our management team have relationships are not obligated to provide us with investment opportunities and, therefore, there is no assurance that such relationships will lead to the origination of debt or other investments.
We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, and we may not be able to compete effectively.
A number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we plan to make in prospective portfolio companies. We compete with a large number of venture capital and private equity firms, as well as with other investment funds, business development companies, investment banks and other sources of financing, including traditional financial services companies such as commercial banks and finance companies. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and/or access to funding sources that are not available to us. This may enable some competitors to make loans with interest rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates that we typically offer.
A significant increase in the number and/or the size of our competitors, including traditional commercial lenders and other financing sources, in technology-related industries could force us to accept less attractive investment terms. We may be unable to capitalize on certain opportunities if we do not match competitors’ pricing, terms and structure. If we do match competitors’ pricing, terms or structure, we may experience decreased net interest income and increased risk of credit losses. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, establish more relationships and build their market shares. An increasing number of competitors may also have the effect of compressing our margins, which could harm our ability to retain employees, increase our operating costs, and decrease the amount and frequency of future distributions. Furthermore, many potential competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or that the Code imposes on us as a RIC. If we are not able to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected. As a result of this competition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and take advantage of attractive investment opportunities, or that we will be able to fully invest our available capital.
If we are unable to manage our future growth effectively, we may be unable to achieve our investment objective, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cause the value of your investment to decline.
Our ability to achieve our investment objective will depend on our ability to sustain growth. Sustaining growth will depend, in turn, on our senior management team’s ability to identify, evaluate, finance and invest in suitable companies that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of our marketing capabilities, our management of the investment process, our ability to provide efficient services and our access to financing sources on acceptable terms. Organizational growth and scale-up of our investments could strain our existing managerial, investment, financial and other resources. Management of our growth could divert financial resources from other projects. Failure to manage our future growth effectively could lead to a decrease in our future distributions and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Because we intend to distribute substantially all of our income to our stockholders in order to qualify as a RIC, we will continue to need additional capital to finance our growth. If additional funds are unavailable or not available on favorable terms, our ability to grow will be impaired.
In order to satisfy the tax requirements applicable to a RIC and to minimize or avoid being subject to income and excise taxes, we intend to make distributions to our stockholders treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally of an amount at least equal to substantially all of our net ordinary income and realized net capital gains except for certain realized net capital gains, which we may retain, pay applicable income taxes with respect thereto and elect to treat as deemed distributions to our stockholders. As a BDC, we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings and other senior securities, which includes all of our borrowings and any preferred stock that we may issue in the future, of at least 150%, subject to certain disclosure requirements. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. This limitation may prevent us from incurring debt (including under any of our existing revolving credit facilities) and require us to raise additional equity at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. We cannot assure you that debt and equity financing will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, and debt financings may be restricted by the terms of any of our outstanding borrowings. If we are unable to incur additional debt, we may be required to raise additional equity at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so. In addition, shares of closed-end investment companies, including BDCs, have recently traded at discounts to their NAV.
This characteristic of closed-end investment companies, including BDCs, is separate and distinct from the risk that our NAV per share may decline. We cannot predict whether shares of our common stock will trade above, at or below our NAV. If our common stock trades below its NAV, we generally will not be able to issue additional shares of our common stock at its market price without first obtaining the approval for such issuance from our stockholders and our independent directors. If additional funds are not available to us, we could be forced to curtail or cease new lending and investment activities, and our NAV could decline. In addition, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.
Because most of our investments typically are not in publicly-traded securities, there is uncertainty regarding the value of our investments, which could adversely affect the determination of our NAV.
At December 31, 2020, portfolio investments, whose fair value is determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, were approximately 89.7% of our total assets. We expect our investments to continue to consist primarily of securities issued by privately-held companies, the fair value of which is not readily determinable. In addition, we are not permitted to maintain a general reserve for anticipated loan losses. Instead, we are required by the 1940 Act to specifically value each investment and record an unrealized gain or loss for any asset that we believe has increased or decreased in value.
There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. We value these securities at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors, based on the recommendations of our Audit Committee. In making a good faith determination of the value of these securities, we generally start with the cost basis of each security, which includes the amortized OID and PIK interest, if any. The Audit Committee uses its best judgment in arriving at the fair value of these securities. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while applying a valuation process for the types of investments we make, which includes but is not limited to deriving a hypothetical exit price.
However, the Board of Directors retains ultimate authority as to the appropriate valuation of each investment. Because such valuations are inherently uncertain and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ materially from the values that would be assessed if a ready market for these securities existed. We adjust quarterly the valuation of our portfolio to reflect the Board of Directors’ determination of the fair value of each investment in our portfolio. Any changes in fair value are recorded in our statements of operations as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Our NAV could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such securities.
Recently passed legislation allows us to incur additional leverage, which may increase the risk of investing with us.
Historically, the 1940 Act generally prevented us, as BDC, from incurring indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing we had an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 200% (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 50% of the value of our assets). The SBCAA, which was signed into law in March 2018, modifies this section of the 1940 Act and decreases this percentage from 200% to 150% (subject to either stockholder approval or approval of both a majority of the board of directors and a majority of directors who are not interested persons). On September 4, 2018 and December 6, 2018, our Board of Directors, including a “required majority” (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) and our stockholders, respectively, approved the application to us of the 150% minimum asset coverage ratio set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. As a result, as of December 7, 2018, we are able to incur additional indebtedness, subject to certain disclosure requirements and, therefore, your risk of an investment in us may increase. Rating agencies may also decide to review our credit ratings and those of other business development companies in light of this new law as well as any corresponding changes to asset coverage ratios and consider downgrading such ratings, including a downgrade from an investment grade rating to a non-investment grade rating. Such a downgrade in our credit ratings may adversely affect our securities. See “-A downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the credit rating assigned by a rating agency to us or our debt securities, if any, or change in the debt markets could cause the liquidity or market value of our debt securities to decline significantly.”
Because we have substantial indebtedness, there could be increased risk in investing in our company.
Lenders have fixed dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of stockholders, and we have granted, and may in the future grant, lenders a security interest in our assets in connection with borrowings. In the case of a liquidation event, those lenders would receive proceeds before our stockholders. In addition, borrowings, also known as leverage, magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and, therefore, increase the risks associated with investing in our securities. Leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique. If the value of our assets increases, then leverage would cause the NAV attributable to our common stock to increase more than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged. Conversely, if the value of our assets decreases, leverage would cause the NAV attributable to our common stock to decline more than it otherwise would have had we not used leverage. Similarly, any increase in our revenue in excess of interest expense on our borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would without the leverage. Any decrease in our revenue would cause our net income to decline more than it would have had we not borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to make distributions on common stock. Our ability to service any debt that we incur will depend largely on our financial performance and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. We and, indirectly, our stockholders will bear the cost associated with our leverage activity. If we are not able to service our substantial indebtedness, our business could be harmed materially.
Our secured credit facilities with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC, or the Wells Facility, and MUFG Union Bank, N.A., or the Union Bank Facility and, together with the Wells Facility, our Credit Facilities, our 2022 Notes, our July 2024 Notes, our February 2025 Notes, our April 2025 Notes, our June 2025 Notes, our March 2026 A Notes, our 2033 Notes, our 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, our 2028 Asset-Backed Notes, and our 2022 Convertible Notes (as each term is defined below) contain financial and operating covenants that could restrict our business activities, including our ability to declare dividend distributions if we default under certain provisions.
As of December 31, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Wells Facility and the Union Bank Facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $99.0 million of indebtedness outstanding incurred by our SBIC subsidiary, approximately $150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% notes due 2022, or the 2022 Notes, approximately $105.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.77% notes due 2024, or the July 2024 Notes, approximately $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.28% notes due February 2025, or the February 2025 Notes, approximately $75.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% notes due April 2025, or the April 2025 Notes, approximately $70.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.31% notes due June 2025, or the June 2025 Notes, approximately $50.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.50% notes due March 2026, or the March 2026 A notes, approximately $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.25% notes due 2033, or the 2033 Notes, approximately $181.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed rate asset-backed notes issued in November 2018, or the 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, approximately $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed rate asset-backed notes issued in January 2019, or the 2028 Asset-Backed Notes, and approximately $230.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.375% convertible notes due 2022, or the 2022 Convertible Notes.
There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining any additional debt capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to obtain debt capital, then our equity investors will not benefit from the potential for increased returns on equity resulting from leverage to the extent that our investment strategy is successful and we may be limited in our ability to make new commitments or fundings to our portfolio companies.
As discussed in the previous risk factor, we are only permitted to incur indebtedness if immediately after such borrowing we have an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 150%. In addition, we may not be permitted to declare any cash distribution on our outstanding common shares, or purchase any such shares, unless, at the time of such declaration or purchase, we have asset coverage of at least 150% after deducting the amount of such distribution or purchase price. If this ratio declines below 150%, we may not be able to incur additional debt and may need to sell a portion of our investments to repay debt when it is disadvantageous to do so, and we may not be able to make distributions. As of December 31, 2020, our asset coverage ratio under our regulatory requirements as a BDC was 207.5% excluding our SBIC debentures as a result of our exemptive order from the SEC that allows us to exclude all SBA leverage from our asset coverage ratio and was 199.3% when including all SBA leverage.
Based on assumed leverage equal to 100.6% of our net assets as of December 31, 2020, our investment portfolio would have been required to experience an annual return of at least 2.5% to cover annual interest payments.
Illustration. The following table illustrates the effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock assuming that we employ (1) our actual asset coverage ratio as of December 31, 2020, (excluding our SBA debentures as permitted by our exemptive relief), (2) a hypothetical asset coverage ratio of 200% (excluding our SBA debentures as permitted by our exemptive relief), and (3) a hypothetical asset coverage ratio of 150% (excluding our SBA debentures as permitted by our exemptive relief), each at various annual returns on our portfolio as of December 31, 2020, net of expenses.
The calculations in the table below are hypothetical, and actual returns may be higher or lower than those appearing in the table below.
(1)
Assumes $2.6 billion in total assets, $1.3 billion in debt outstanding, $1.3 billion in stockholders’ equity, and an average cost of funds of 5.1%, which is the approximate average cost of borrowed funds, including our SBA debentures, 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, 2028 Asset-Backed Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, and Credit Facilities for the period ended December 31, 2020. Actual interest payments may be different.
(2)
Assumes $2.7 billion in total assets including debt issuance costs on a pro forma basis, $1.4 billion in debt outstanding, $1.3 billion in stockholders’ equity, and an average cost of funds of 5.1%, which is the approximate average cost of borrowed funds, including our SBA debentures, 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, 2028 Asset-Backed Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, and Credit Facilities for the period ended December 31, 2020, along with the hypothetical estimated incremental cost of debt that would be incurred on offering the maximum permissible debt under the 200% asset coverage. Actual interest payments may be different.
(3)
Assumes $4.0 billion in total assets including debt issuance costs on a pro forma basis, $2.7 billion in debt outstanding, $1.3 billion in stockholders’ equity, and an average cost of funds of 5.1%, which is the approximate average cost of borrowed funds, including our SBA debentures, 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, 2028 Asset-Backed Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, and Credit Facilities for the period ended December 31, 2020, along with the hypothetical estimated incremental cost of debt that would be incurred on offering the maximum permissible debt under the 150% asset coverage. Actual interest payments may be different.
It is likely that the terms of any current or future long-term or revolving credit or warehouse facility we may enter into in the future could constrain our ability to grow our business.
Under our borrowings and our Credit Facilities, current lenders have, and any future lender or lenders may have, fixed dollar claims on our assets that are senior to the claims of our stockholders and, thus, will have a preference over our stockholders with respect to our assets pledged as collateral under the Credit Facilities. Our Credit Facilities and borrowings also subject us to various financial and operating covenants, including, but not limited to, maintaining certain financial ratios and minimum tangible net worth amounts. Future credit facilities and borrowings will likely subject us to similar or additional covenants. In addition, we may grant a security interest in our assets in connection with any such credit facilities and borrowings.
Our Credit Facilities generally contain customary default provisions such as a minimum net worth amount, a profitability test, and a restriction on changing our business and loan quality standards. In addition, our Credit Facilities require or are expected to require the repayment of all outstanding debt on the maturity date which may disrupt our business and potentially the business of our portfolio companies that are financed through the facilities. An event of default under these facilities would likely result, among other things, in termination of the availability of further funds under the facilities and accelerated maturity dates for all amounts outstanding under the facilities, which would likely disrupt our business and, potentially, the business of the portfolio companies whose loans we finance through the facilities. This could reduce our revenues and, by delaying any cash payment allowed to us under our facilities until the lender has been paid in full, reduce our liquidity and cash flow and impair our ability to grow our business and our ability to make distributions sufficient to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC.
The terms of future available financing may place limits on our financial and operation flexibility. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital in the future, we may be forced to reduce or discontinue our operations, not be able to make new investments, or otherwise respond to changing business conditions or competitive pressures.
In addition to regulatory requirements that restrict our ability to raise capital, our 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, and Credit Facilities contain various covenants which, if not complied with, could require accelerated repayment under the facility or require us to repurchase the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, or 2022 Convertible Notes thereby materially and adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions.
The credit agreements governing our 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, and Credit Facilities require us to comply with certain financial and operational covenants. These covenants require us to, among other things, maintain certain financial ratios, including asset coverage, debt to equity and interest coverage. Our ability to continue to comply with these covenants in the future depends on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. There are no assurances that we will be able to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants would result in a default which, if we were unable to obtain a waiver from the lenders under our Credit Facilities and could accelerate repayment under the facilities or the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, or 2022 Convertible Notes and thereby have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay a sufficient amount of distributions and maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases. See “Note 5 - Borrowings”.
The Wells Facility and the Union Bank Facility mature in January 2023 and February 2024, respectively, and any inability to renew, extend or replace our Credit Facilities could adversely impact our liquidity and ability to find new investments or maintain distributions to our stockholders.
As of December 31, 2020, we had two available secured credit facilities, the Wells Facility and the Union Bank Facility, which mature in January 2023 and February 2024, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew, extend or replace our Credit Facilities upon maturity on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. Our ability to renew, extend or replace the Credit Facility will be constrained by then-current economic conditions affecting the credit markets. In the event that we are not able to renew, extend or replace either Credit Facility at the time of its maturity, this could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to fund new investments, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and our ability to qualify as a RIC.
We are subject to certain risks as a result of our interests in connection with the Debt Securitizations and our equity interest in the Securitization Issuers.
On November 1, 2018, in connection with the 2018 Debt Securitization and the offering of the 2027 Asset-Backed Notes by Hercules Capital Funding Trust 2018-1, or the 2018 Securitization Issuer, we sold and/or contributed to Hercules Capital Funding 2018-1 LLC, as trust depositor, or the 2018 Trust Depositor, certain senior loans made to certain of our portfolio companies, or the 2018 Loans, which the 2018 Trust Depositor in turn sold and/or contributed to the 2018 Securitization Issuer in exchange for 100% of the equity interest in the 2018 Securitization Issuer, cash proceeds and other consideration. Following these transfers, the 2018 Securitization Issuer, and not the 2018 Trust Depositor or us, held all of the ownership interest in the 2018 Loans.
On January 22, 2019, in connection with the 2019 Debt Securitization and the offering of the 2028 Asset-Backed Notes by Hercules Capital Funding Trust 2019-1, or the 2019 Securitization Issuer and, together with the 2018 Securitization Issuer, the Securitization Issuers, we sold and/or contributed to Hercules Capital Funding 2019-1 LLC, as trust depositor, or the 2019 Trust Depositor and, together with the 2018 Trust Depositor, the Trust Depositors, certain senior loans made to certain of our portfolio companies, or the 2019 Loans and, together with the 2018 Loans, the Securitization Loans, which the 2019 Trust Depositor in turn sold and/or contributed to the 2019 Securitization Issuer in exchange for 100% of the equity interest in the 2019 Securitization Issuer, cash proceeds and other consideration. Following these transfers, the 2019 Securitization Issuer, and not the 2019 Trust Depositor or us, held all of the ownership interest in the 2019 Loans.
As a result of the Debt Securitizations, we hold, indirectly through the Trust Depositors, 100% of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers. As a result, we consolidate the financial statements of the Trust Depositors and the Securitization Issuers, as well as our other subsidiaries, in our consolidated financial statements. Because each of the Trust Depositors and the Securitization Issuers is disregarded as an entity separate from its owners for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the sale or contribution by us to the Trust Depositors, and by the Trust Depositors to the Securitization Issuers, as applicable, did not constitute a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the IRS were to take a contrary position, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Further, a failure of either of the Securitization Issuers to be treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes would constitute an event of default pursuant to the applicable indenture under the Debt Securitizations, upon which the trustee under the 2018 Debt Securitization, or the 2018 Trustee, or the 2019 Debt Securitization, or the 2019 Trustee and, together with the 2018 Trustee, the Securitization Trustees, as applicable, may and will at the direction of a supermajority of the holders of the 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, or the 2027 Noteholders, or the holders of the 2028 Asset-Back Notes, or the 2028 Noteholders and, together with the 2027 Noteholders, the Securitization Noteholders, as the case may be, declare the applicable Asset-Backed Notes, to be immediately due and payable and exercise remedies under the applicable indenture, including (i) to institute proceedings for the collection of all amounts then payable on the applicable Asset-Backed Notes, or under the applicable indenture, enforce any judgment obtained, and collect from the applicable Securitization Issuer and any other obligor upon the applicable Asset-Backed Notes monies adjudged due; (ii) institute proceedings from time to time for the complete or partial foreclosure of the applicable indenture with respect to the property of the applicable Securitization Issuer; (iii) exercise any remedies as a secured party under the relevant Uniform Commercial Code and take other appropriate action under applicable law to protect and enforce the rights and remedies of the applicable Securitization Trustee and the applicable Securitization Noteholders; or (iv) sell the property of the applicable Securitization Issuer or any portion thereof or rights or interest therein at one or more public or private sales called and conducted in any matter permitted by law. Any such exercise of remedies could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
An event of default in connection with the Debt Securitizations could give rise to a cross-default under our other material indebtedness.
The documents governing our other material indebtedness contain customary cross-default provisions that could be triggered if an event of default occurs in connection with either of the Debt Securitizations. An event of default with respect to our other indebtedness could lead to the acceleration of such indebtedness and the exercise of other remedies as provided in the documents governing such other indebtedness. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and may result in our inability to make distributions sufficient to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC.
We may not receive cash distributions in respect of our indirect ownership interests in the Securitization Issuers.
Apart from fees payable to us in connection with our role as servicer of the Securitization Loans and the reimbursement of related amounts under the documents governing the Debt Securitizations, we receive cash in connection with the Debt Securitizations only to the extent that the Trust Depositors receive payments in respect of their equity interests in the Securitization Issuers. The respective holders of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers are the residual claimants on distributions, if any, made by the applicable Securitization Issuer after the respective Securitization Noteholders and other claimants have been paid in full on each payment date or upon maturity of the applicable Asset-Backed Notes, subject to the priority of payments under the documents governing the Debt Securitizations. To the extent that the value of a Securitization Issuer’s portfolio of loans is reduced as a result of conditions in the credit markets (relevant in the event of a liquidation event), other macroeconomic factors, distressed or defaulted loans or the failure of individual portfolio companies to otherwise meet their obligations in respect of the loans, or for any other reason, the ability of either Securitization Issuer to make cash distributions in respect of the applicable Trust Depositor’s equity interests would be negatively affected and consequently, the value of the equity interests in such Securitization Issuer would also be reduced. In the event that we fail to receive cash indirectly from the Securitization Issuers, we could be unable to make distributions, if at all, in amounts sufficient to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC.
The interests of the Securitization Noteholders may not be aligned with our interests.
The Asset-Backed Notes are debt obligations ranking senior in right of payment to the rights of the holders of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers, as residual claimants in respect of distributions, if any, made by the Securitization Issuers. As such, there are circumstances in which the interests of the Securitization Noteholders may not be aligned with the interests of holders of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers. For example, under the terms of the documents governing the Debt Securitizations, the Securitization Noteholders have the right to receive payments of principal and interest prior to holders of the equity interests.
For as long as the Asset-Backed Notes remain outstanding, the respective Securitization Noteholders have the right to act in certain circumstances with respect to the applicable Securitization Loans in ways that may benefit their interests but not the interests of the respective holders of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers, including by exercising remedies under the documents governing the Debt Securitizations.
If an event of default occurs, the applicable Securitization Noteholders will be entitled to determine the remedies to be exercised, subject to the terms of the documents governing the Debt Securitizations. For example, upon the occurrence of an event of default with respect to the Asset-Backed Notes, the applicable Securitization Trustee may and will at the direction of the holders of a supermajority of the applicable Asset-Backed Notes declare the principal, together with any accrued interest, of the notes to be immediately due and payable. This would have the effect of accelerating the principal on such notes, triggering a repayment obligation on the part of the applicable Securitization Issuer. The applicable Asset-Backed Notes then outstanding will be paid in full before any further payment or distribution on the equity interest is made. There can be no assurance that there will be sufficient funds through collections on the Securitization Loans or through the proceeds of the sale of the Securitization Loans in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency to repay in full the obligations under the Asset-Backed Notes, or to make any distribution to holders of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers.
Remedies pursued by the Securitization Noteholders could be adverse to our interests as the indirect holder of the equity interests in the Securitization Issuers. The Securitization Noteholders have no obligation to consider any possible adverse effect on such other interests. Thus, there can be no assurance that any remedies pursued by the Securitization Noteholders will be consistent with the best interests of the Trust Depositors or that we will receive, indirectly through the Trust Depositors, any payments or distributions upon an acceleration of the Asset-Backed Notes. Any failure of the Securitization Issuers to make distributions in respect of the equity interests that we indirectly hold, whether as a result of an event of default and the acceleration of payments on the Asset-Backed Notes or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and may result in our inability to make distributions sufficient to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC.
Certain events related to the performance of Securitization Loans could lead to the acceleration of principal payments on the Asset-Backed Notes.
The following constitute rapid amortization events, or Rapid Amortization Events, under the documents governing the Debt Securitizations: (i) the aggregate outstanding principal balance of delinquent Securitization Loans, and restructured Securitization Loans that would have been delinquent Securitization Loans had such loans not become restructured loans, in the portfolio of Securitization Loans held by the applicable Securitization Issuer exceeds 10% of the current aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Securitization Loans held by such Securitization Issuer for a period of three consecutive months; (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal balance of defaulted Securitization Loans in the portfolio of Securitization Loans held by the applicable Securitization Issuer exceeds 5% of the initial outstanding principal balance of the Securitization Loans held by such Securitization Issuer determined as of November 1, 2018 (in the case of the 2027 Loans) or January 22, 2019 (in the case of the 2028 Loans) for a period of three consecutive months; (iii) the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the 2027 Asset-Backed Notes or the 2028 Asset-Backed Notes, as applicable, exceeds the applicable borrowing base for a period of three consecutive months; (iv) either Securitization Issuer’s pool of Securitization Loans contains Securitization Loans to ten or fewer obligors, as applicable; and (v) the occurrence of an event of default under the applicable documents governing the Debt Securitizations. After a Rapid Amortization Event has occurred, subject to the priority of payments under the documents governing the Debt Securitizations, principal collections on the applicable Securitization Loans will be used to make accelerated payments of principal on the applicable Asset-Backed Notes until the principal balance of such Asset-Backed Notes is reduced to zero. Such an event could delay, reduce or eliminate the ability of the applicable Securitization Issuer to make distributions in respect of the equity interests that we indirectly hold, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and may result in our inability to make distributions sufficient to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC.
We have certain repurchase obligations with respect to the Securitization Loans transferred in connection with the Debt Securitizations.
As part of each Debt Securitization, we entered into a sale and contribution agreement and a sale and servicing agreement under which we would be required to repurchase any Securitization Loan (or participation interest therein) which was sold to the applicable Securitization Issuer in breach of certain customary representations and warranties made by us or by the applicable Trust Depositor with respect to such Securitization Loan or the legal structure of the applicable Debt Securitization. To the extent that there is a breach of such representations and warranties and we fail to satisfy any such repurchase obligation, the applicable Securitization Trustee may, on behalf of the applicable Securitization Issuer, bring an action against us to enforce these repurchase obligations.
Our investments in a portfolio company, whether debt, equity, or a combination thereof, may lead to our receiving material non-public information, or MNPI, or obtaining ‘control’ of the target company. Our ability to exit an investment where we have MNPI or control could be limited and could result in a realized loss on the investment.
If we receive MNPI, or a controlling interest in a portfolio company, our ability to divest ourselves from a debt or equity investment could be restricted. Causes of such restriction could include market factors, such as liquidity in a private stock, or limited trading volume in a public company’s securities, or regulatory factors, such as the receipt of MNPI or insider blackout periods, where we are under legal obligation not to sell. Additionally, we may choose not to take certain actions to protect a debt investment in a control investment portfolio company. As a result, we could experience a decrease in the value of our portfolio company holdings and potentially incur a realized loss on the investment.
Regulations governing our operations as a BDC may affect our ability to, and the manner in which, we raise additional capital, which may expose us to risks.
Our business requires a substantial amount of capital. We may acquire additional capital from the issuance of senior securities, including borrowings, securitization transactions or other indebtedness, or the issuance of additional shares of our common stock. However, we may not be able to raise additional capital in the future on favorable terms or at all. We may issue debt securities, other evidences of indebtedness or preferred stock, and we may borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as “senior securities,” up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. As discussed above, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to incur indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing we have an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 150%. In addition, we may not be permitted to declare any cash distribution on our outstanding common shares, or purchase any such shares, unless, at the time of such declaration or purchase, we have asset coverage of at least 150% after deducting the amount of such distribution or purchase price. Our ability to pay distributions or issue additional senior securities would be restricted if our asset coverage ratio were not at least 150%.
If the value of our assets decline, we may be unable to satisfy this test. If that happens, we may be required to liquidate a portion of our investments and repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such transaction may be disadvantageous. As a result of
issuing senior securities, we would also be exposed to risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss. If we issue preferred stock, the preferred stock would rank “senior” to common stock in our capital structure, preferred stockholders would have separate voting rights and might have rights, preferences, or privileges more favorable than those of our common stockholders and the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in your best interest. It is likely that any senior securities or other indebtedness we issue will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility. Additionally, some of these securities or other indebtedness may be rated by rating agencies, and in obtaining a rating for such securities and other indebtedness, we may be required to abide by operating and investment guidelines that further restrict operating and financial flexibility.
To the extent that we are constrained in our ability to issue debt or other senior securities, we will depend on issuances of common stock to finance operations. We have received the approval from our stockholders to issue shares of our common stock at a price below its then current NAV per share, subject to certain limitations and with the approval of our independent directors. The approval expires on June 12, 2021. In connection with such approval, we will limit the number of shares that we issue at a price below NAV per share pursuant to the shareholder authorization so that the aggregate dilutive effect on our then outstanding shares will not exceed 20%; however, our Board of Directors, subject to its fiduciary duties and regulatory requirements, has the discretion to determine the amount of the discount. As a result, the discount could be up to 100% of NAV per share. If we raise additional funds by issuing more common stock or senior securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, then the percentage ownership of our stockholders at that time will decrease, and you might experience dilution. Moreover, we can offer no assurance that we will be able to issue and sell additional equity securities in the future, on favorable terms or at all.
Our executive officers and employees, through the Adviser Subsidiary, are expected to manage other investment funds or accounts, including External Parties, that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do, which may result in significant conflicts of interest.
Our executive officers and employees, through the Adviser Subsidiary, are expected to manage other investment funds that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do, and which funds may be invested in by us and/or our executive officers and employees. Accordingly, they may have obligations to such other entities, the fulfillment of which obligations may not be in the interests of us or our stockholders. Our relationship with External Parties may require us to commit resources to achieving the External Parties’ investment objectives, while such resources were previously solely devoted to achieving our investment objective. Our investment objective and investment strategies may be very similar to those of External Parties and it is likely that an investment appropriate for us or External Parties would be appropriate for the other entity. Because the Adviser Subsidiary may receive performance-based fee compensation from External Parties, this may provide an incentive to allocate opportunities to External Parties instead of us. Accordingly, we and the Adviser Subsidiary will establish policies and procedures governing the allocation investment opportunities between us and External Parties. We may be limited in or unable to participate in certain investments based upon such allocation policy. Although we will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner, we may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and External Parties managed by the Adviser Subsidiary.
When we are a debt or minority equity investor in a portfolio company, we may not be in a position to control the entity, and management of the company may make decisions that could decrease the value of our portfolio holdings.
We make both debt and minority equity investments; therefore, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the stockholders and management of such company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests. As a result, a portfolio company may make decisions that could decrease the value of our portfolio holdings.
If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could fail to qualify as a BDC or be precluded from investing according to our current business strategy.
As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than “qualifying assets” as defined under the 1940 Act, unless, at the time of and after giving effect to such acquisition, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets. See “Item 1. Business -Regulation.”
We believe that most of the senior loans we make will constitute qualifying assets. However, we may be precluded from investing in what we believe are attractive investments if such investments are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 1940 Act. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could lose our status as a BDC, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a rise in the equity markets may result in increased market valuations of certain of our existing and prospective portfolio companies, which may lead to new investments with such companies being qualified as non-eligible portfolio company assets and would require that we invest in qualified assets going forward. Similarly, these rules could prevent us from making follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies (which could result in the dilution of our position) or could require us to dispose of investments at inopportune times in order to comply with the 1940 Act. If we need to dispose of such investments quickly, it would be difficult to dispose of such investments on favorable terms. For example, we may have difficulty in finding a buyer and, even if we do find a buyer, we may have to sell the investments at a substantial loss. Although we are exploring alternatives, such as entering into joint venture arrangements, to increase our flexibility to make investments in assets that are not qualifying assets, there can be no assurance that we will ultimately pursue such alternatives or that such alternatives will achieve this goal.
A failure on our part to maintain our qualification as a BDC would significantly reduce our operating flexibility.
If we fail to continuously qualify as a BDC, we might be subject to regulation as a registered closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act, which would significantly decrease our operating flexibility, and lead to situations where we might have to restrict our borrowings, reduce our leverage, sell securities and pursue other activities that we are allowed to engage in as a BDC. In addition, failure to comply with the requirements imposed on business development companies by the 1940 Act could cause the SEC to bring an enforcement action against us. For additional information on the qualification requirements of a BDC, see “Item 1. Business - Regulation.”
To the extent OID and PIK interest constitute a portion of our income, we will be exposed to risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of cash representing such income.
Our investments may include OID instruments and contractual PIK interest arrangements, which represents contractual interest added to a loan balance and due at the end of such loan’s term. To the extent OID or PIK interest constitute a portion of our income, we are exposed to risks associated with such income being required to be included in taxable and accounting income prior to receipt of cash, including the following:
•
The higher interest rates of OID and PIK instruments reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with these instruments, and OID and PIK instruments generally represent a significantly higher credit risk than coupon loans.
•
Even if the accounting conditions for income accrual are met, the borrower could still default when our actual collection is supposed to occur at the maturity of the obligation, which could lead to future losses.
•
OID and PIK instruments may have unreliable valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral. OID and PIK income may also create uncertainty about the source of our cash distributions.
•
For accounting purposes, any cash distributions to stockholders representing OID and PIK income are not treated as coming from paid-in capital, even though the cash to pay them comes from the offering proceeds. As a result, despite the fact that a distribution representing OID and PIK income could be paid out of amounts invested by our stockholders, the 1940 Act does not require that stockholders be given notice of this fact by reporting it as a return of capital.
•
The deferral of PIK interest may have a negative impact on our liquidity as it represents non-cash income that may require cash distributions to our stockholders in order to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC.
•
Tax rules require that income be recognized for tax purposes no later than when recognized for financial reporting purposes.
If we are unable to satisfy Code requirements for qualification as a RIC, then we will be subject to corporate-level income tax, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
We elected to be treated as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes with the filing of our federal corporate income tax return for 2006. We will not qualify for the tax treatment allowable to RICs if we are unable to comply with the source of income, asset diversification and distribution requirements contained in Subchapter M of the Code, or if we fail to maintain our election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any reason and become subject to a corporate-level income tax, the resulting taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution to our stockholders and the actual amount of our distributions. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us, the NAV of our common stock and the total return, if any, earned from your investment in our common stock.
We may have difficulty paying our required distributions under applicable tax rules if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income.
In accordance with U.S. federal tax requirements, we are required to include in income for tax purposes certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as OID and contractual PIK interest arrangements, which represent contractual interest added to a loan balance and due at the end of such loan’s term. In addition to the cash yields received on our loans, in some instances, our loans generally include one or more of the following: exit fees, balloon payment fees, commitment fees, success fees or prepayment fees. In some cases our loans also include contractual PIK interest arrangements. The increases in loan balances as a result of contractual PIK arrangements are included in income for the period in which such PIK interest was accrued, which is often in advance of receiving cash payment, and are separately identified on our statements of cash flows. We also may be required to include in income for tax purposes certain other amounts prior to receiving the related cash. Also, tax rules require that income be recognized for tax purposes no later than when recognized for financial reporting purposes.
Any warrants that we receive in connection with our debt investments will generally be valued as part of the negotiation process with the particular portfolio company. As a result, a portion of the aggregate purchase price for the debt investments and warrants will be allocated to the warrants that we receive. This will generally result in OID for tax purposes, which we must recognize as ordinary income, increasing the amount that we are required to distribute in order to be subject to tax as a RIC. Because these warrants generally will not produce distributable cash for us at the same time as we are required to make distributions in respect of the related OID, if ever, we would need to obtain cash from other sources or to pay a portion of our distributions using shares of newly issued common stock, consistent with IRS guidelines and the Code, to satisfy such distribution requirements.
Other features of the debt instruments that we hold may also cause such instruments to generate OID in excess of current cash interest received. Since in certain cases we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we may have difficulty meeting the RIC tax requirement to make distributions each taxable year to our stockholders treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes generally of an amount equal to at least 90% of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. Under such circumstances, we may have to sell some of our assets, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources and are otherwise unable to satisfy such distribution requirements, we may fail to qualify to be subject to tax as a RIC and, thus, become subject to a corporate-level income tax on all our taxable income (including any net realized securities gains).
Furthermore, we may invest in the equity securities of non-U.S. corporations (or other non-U.S. entities classified as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that could be treated under the Code and U.S. Treasury regulations as PFICs and/or CFCs. The rules relating to investment in these types of non-U.S. entities are designed to ensure that U.S. taxpayers are either, in effect, taxed currently (or on an accelerated basis with respect to corporate level events) or taxed at increased tax rates at distribution or disposition. In certain circumstances, these rules also could require us to recognize taxable income or gains where we do not receive a corresponding payment in cash. Income derived by us either from a PFIC with respect to which we have made a certain U.S. tax election or from a CFC would generally constitute qualifying income for purposes of determining our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC if the PFIC or CFC respectively makes distributions of that income to us or if the income is derived with respect to our business of investing in stocks and securities. As such, we may be restricted in our ability to make qualified electing fund (“QEF”) elections with respect to our holdings in issuers that could either be treated as PFICs or CFCs in order to limit our tax liability or maximize our after-tax return from these investments.
Our portfolio investments may present special tax issues.
Investments in below-investment grade debt instruments and certain equity securities may present special tax issues for us. U.S. federal income tax rules are not entirely clear about issues such as when we may cease to accrue interest, OID or market discount, when and to what extent deductions may be taken for bad debts or worthless debt in equity securities, how payments received on obligations in default should be allocated between principal and interest income, as well as whether exchanges of debt instruments in a
bankruptcy or workout context are taxable. Such matters could cause us to recognize taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, even in the absence of cash or economic gain, and require us to make taxable distributions to our stockholders to maintain our RIC status or preclude the imposition of either U.S. federal corporate income or excise taxation. Additionally, because such taxable income may not be matched by corresponding cash received by us, we may be required to borrow money or dispose of other investments to be able to make distributions to our stockholders. These and other issues will be considered by us, to the extent determined necessary, in order that we minimize the level of any U.S. federal income or excise tax that we would otherwise incur. See “Item 1. Business-Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations-Taxation as a Regulated Investment Company.”
There is a risk that you may not receive distributions or that our distributions may not grow over time.
We intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results, or our business may not perform in a manner that will allow us to make a specified level of distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions. Also, our Credit Facilities limit our ability to declare distributions to our stockholders if we default under certain provisions of our Credit Facilities. Furthermore, while we may have undistributed earnings, those earnings may not yield distributions because we may incur unrealized losses or otherwise be unable to distribute such earnings.
We have and may in the future choose to pay distributions in our own stock, in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive.
Under applicable Treasury regulations and other general guidelines issued by the IRS, RICs are permitted to treat certain distributions payable in their stock, as taxable dividends that will satisfy their annual distribution obligations for U.S. federal income tax and excise tax purposes provided that stockholders have the opportunity to elect to receive all or a portion of such distribution in cash. Taxable stockholders receiving distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary income (or as long-term capital gain to the extent such distribution is properly reported as a capital gain dividend) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such distributions in excess of any cash received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives as a distribution in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the distribution, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. federal income tax with respect to such distributions, including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution that is payable in stock. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on such distributions, then such sales may put downward pressure on the trading price of our stock. We may in the future determine to distribute taxable distributions that are partially payable in our common stock.
We are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, including fluctuations in interest rates which could adversely affect our profitability or the value of our portfolio.
General interest rate fluctuations may have a substantial negative impact on our investments and investment opportunities, and, accordingly, may have a material adverse effect on our investment objective and rate of return on investment capital. A portion of our income will depend upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the interest rate on the debt securities in which we invest. Because we will borrow money to make investments and may issue debt securities, preferred stock or other securities, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds or pay interest or dividends on such debt securities, preferred stock or other securities and the rate at which we invest these funds. Typically, we anticipate that our interest-earning investments will accrue and pay interest at both variable and fixed rates, and that our interest-bearing liabilities will generally accrue interest at fixed rates.
A significant increase in market interest rates could harm our ability to attract new portfolio companies and originate new loans and investments. In addition to potentially increasing the cost of our debt, increasing interest rates may also have a negative impact on our portfolio companies’ ability to repay or service their loans, which could enhance the risk of loan defaults. We expect that most of our current initial investments in debt securities will be at floating rate with a floor. However, in the event that we make investments in debt securities at variable rates, a significant increase in market interest rates could also result in an increase in our non-performing assets and a decrease in the value of our portfolio because our floating-rate loan portfolio companies may be unable to meet higher payment obligations. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 96.9% of our loans were at floating rates or floating rates with a floor and 3.1% of the loans were at fixed rates.
In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, resulting in a decrease in our net investment income. In addition, a decrease in interest rates may reduce net income, because new investments may be made at lower rates despite the increased demand for our capital that the decrease in interest rates may produce. We may, but will not be required to, hedge against the risk of adverse movement in interest rates in our short-term and long-term borrowings relative to our portfolio of assets. If we engage in hedging activities, it may limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged portfolio. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The discontinuation of LIBOR may affect the value of the financial obligations to be held or issued by us that are linked to LIBOR.
In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will phase out the use of LIBOR by December 31, 2021. To identify a successor rate for U.S. dollar LIBOR, the Federal Reserve System, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as its preferred alternative rate for LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. Although there have been a few transactions utilizing SOFR or the Sterling Overnight Index Average, or SONIA, an alternative reference rate that is based on transactions, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether either of these alternative reference rates will attain market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool or the effect of any such changes as the establishment of alternative reference rates or other reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United States, United Kingdom or elsewhere.
On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR (the “IBA”), announced its intention to continue publication of overnight and one-, three-, six- and 12-month USD LIBOR rates through June 30, 2023. However, it is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. Concurrent with the IBA’s announcement, the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation released a statement that (i) encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts that use US dollar LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and in any event by December 31, 2021, (ii) indicated that new contracts entered into before December 31, 2021 should either utilize a reference rate other than US dollar LIBOR or have robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate after US dollar LIBOR’s discontinuation and (iii) explained that extending the publication of certain US dollar LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023 would allow most legacy US dollar LIBOR contracts to mature before LIBOR experiences disruptions. It is possible that the IBA and the panel banks could continue to produce LIBOR after June 30, 2023, or the FCA could deem LIBOR to be no longer representative of its underlying market prior to that date, but no assurance can be given that LIBOR will survive in its current form, or at all.
In anticipation of the cessation of LIBOR, we are reviewing our loan and credit facility agreements and are working with counsel on making any necessary amendments to such agreements. We may need to renegotiate any credit agreements with our prospective portfolio companies that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established and we may also need to renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities. Any such renegotiations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including as a result of changes in interest rates payable to us by our portfolio companies or payable by us under our credit facilities. Any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of any LIBOR-linked securities, loans, and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Alteration of the terms of a debt instrument or a modification of the terms of other types of contracts to replace an interbank offered rate with a new reference rate could result in a taxable exchange and the realization of income and gain/loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS has issued proposed regulations regarding the tax consequences of the transition from interbank offered rates to new reference rates in debt instruments and non-debt contracts. Under the proposed regulations, to avoid such alteration or modification of the terms of a debt instrument being treated as a taxable exchange, the fair market value of the modified instrument or contract must be substantially equivalent to its fair market value before the qualifying change was made. The IRS may withdraw, amend or finalize, in whole or part, these proposed regulations and/or provide additional guidance, with potential retroactive effect.
We may expose ourselves to risks if we engage in hedging transactions.
If we engage in hedging transactions, we may expose ourselves to risks associated with such transactions. We may utilize instruments such as forward contracts, currency options and interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors to seek to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. Hedging against a decline in the values of our portfolio positions does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the values of such positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline. However, such hedging can establish other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thereby offsetting the decline in the value of such portfolio positions. Such hedging transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the values of the underlying portfolio positions should increase. It may not be possible to hedge against an exchange rate or interest rate fluctuation that is so generally anticipated that we are not able to enter into a hedging transaction at an acceptable price. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we may not seek to establish a perfect correlation between such hedging instruments and there can be no assurance that any such hedging arrangements will achieve the desired effect. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not engage in any hedging activities.
Two of our wholly owned subsidiaries are licensed by the U.S. SBA, and as a result, we will be subject to SBA regulations, which could limit our capital or investment decisions.
Our wholly owned subsidiaries HT III and HC IV are licensed to act as SBICs and are regulated by the SBA. HT III holds approximately $201.2 million in assets and it accounted for approximately 7.7% of the Company’s total assets, prior to consolidation at December 31, 2020. HC IV has no material assets other than cash of approximately $19.1 million from the regulatory capital provided.
The SBIC licenses allow our SBIC subsidiaries to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to the issuance of a capital commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. On July 13, 2018, we completed repayment of the remaining outstanding HT II debentures and subsequently surrendered the SBA license with respect to our wholly owned subsidiary HT II.
The SBA regulations require that a licensed SBIC be periodically examined and audited by the SBA to determine its compliance with the relevant SBA regulations. The SBA prohibits, without prior SBA approval, a “change of control” of an SBIC or transfers that would result in any person (or a group of persons acting in concert) owning 10.0% or more of a class of capital stock of a licensed SBIC. If our SBIC subsidiaries fail to comply with applicable SBA regulations, the SBA could, depending on the severity of the violation, limit or prohibit our SBIC subsidiaries’ use of debentures, declare outstanding debentures immediately due and payable, and/or limit HT III or HC IV from making new investments. Such actions by the SBA would, in turn, negatively affect us because HT III and HC IV are our wholly owned subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2020, HC IV has not drawn any debentures.
HT III was in compliance with the terms of the SBIC’s leverage as of December 31, 2020 as a result of having sufficient capital as defined under the SBA regulations. Compliance with SBA requirements may cause our SBIC subsidiaries to forego attractive investment opportunities that are not permitted under SBA regulations. See “Item 1. Business - Regulation-Small Business Administration Regulations.”
SBA regulations limit the outstanding dollar amount of SBA guaranteed debentures that may be issued by an SBIC or group of SBICs under common control.
The SBA regulations currently limit the dollar amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that can be issued by any one SBIC to $175.0 million or to a group of SBICs under common control to $350.0 million. An SBIC may not borrow an amount in excess of two times (and in certain cases, up to three times) its regulatory capital. As of December 31, 2020, we have $99.0 million in SBA-guaranteed debentures in HT III. Under our existing license, $149.0 million is the maximum capacity for HT III to issue SBA-guaranteed debentures. As of December 31, 2020, HC IV has not drawn any debentures. During times that we reach the maximum dollar amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures permitted, and if we require additional capital, our cost of capital is likely to increase, and there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.
Moreover, the current status of HT III and HC IV as SBICs does not automatically assure that our SBIC subsidiaries will continue to receive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding. Receipt of SBA leverage funding is dependent upon our SBIC subsidiaries continuing to be in compliance with SBA regulations and policies and available SBA funding. The amount of SBA leverage funding available to a SBIC is dependent upon annual Congressional authorizations and in the future may be subject to annual Congressional appropriations. There can be no assurance that there will be sufficient debenture funding available at the times desired by our SBIC subsidiaries.
The debentures guaranteed by the SBA have a maturity of ten years and require semi-annual payments of interest. HT III has debentures outstanding with maturity dates scheduled between September 2021 and March 2023. HT III will need to generate sufficient cash flow to make required interest payments on the debentures. If our HT III is unable to meet its financial obligations under the debentures, the SBA, as a creditor, will have a superior claim to our SBIC subsidiary’s assets over our stockholders in the event we liquidate our SBIC subsidiary or the SBA exercises its remedies under such debentures as the result of a default by us.
Our wholly owned SBIC subsidiaries may be unable to make distributions to us that will enable us to maintain RIC status, which could result in the imposition of an entity-level tax.
In order for us to continue to qualify for RIC tax treatment and to minimize corporate-level taxes, we will be required to distribute substantially all of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, and net capital gains, including income from certain of our subsidiaries, which includes the income from our SBIC subsidiaries. We will be partially dependent on our SBIC subsidiaries for cash distributions to enable us to meet the RIC distribution requirements. Our SBIC subsidiaries may be limited by the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, and SBA regulations governing SBICs, from making certain distributions to us that may be necessary to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We may have to request a waiver of the SBA’s restrictions for our SBIC subsidiaries to make certain distributions to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure you that the SBA will grant such waiver. If our SBIC subsidiaries are unable to obtain waivers, compliance with the SBA regulations may result in loss of RIC tax treatment and a consequent imposition of an entity-level tax on us.
Our Board of Directors may change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval, the effects of which may be adverse.
Our Board of Directors has the authority, except as otherwise provided in the 1940 Act, to modify or waive certain of our operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval. However, absent stockholder approval, we may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current operating policies and strategies would have on our business, operating results and the market price of our common stock. Nevertheless, any such changes could materially and adversely affect our business and impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
Risks Related to Current Economic and Market Conditions
Depending on funding requirements, we may need to raise additional capital to meet our unfunded commitments through additional borrowings.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $179.8 million of available unfunded commitments, including undrawn revolving facilities, which were available at the request of the portfolio company and unencumbered by milestones.
Our unfunded contractual commitments may be significant from time to time. A portion of these unfunded contractual commitments are dependent upon the portfolio company reaching certain milestones before the debt commitment becomes available. Furthermore, our credit agreements contain customary lending provisions which allow us relief from funding obligations for previously made commitments in instances where the underlying company experiences materially adverse events that affect the financial condition or business outlook for the company. These commitments will be subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Closed commitments generally fund 70-80% of the committed amount in aggregate over the life of the commitment. We believe that our assets provide adequate cover to satisfy all of our unfunded commitments and we intend to use cash flow from normal and early principal repayments and proceeds from borrowings and notes to fund these commitments. However, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient capital available to fund these commitments as they come due, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation in the market and our ability to generate incremental lending activity and subject us to lender liability claims.
Our ability to secure additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to the prevailing general economic and credit market conditions, including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally, and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The prolonged continuation or worsening of current economic and capital market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure financing on favorable terms, if at all.
Risks Related to Our Investments
Our investments are concentrated in certain industries and in a number of technology-related companies, which subjects us to the risk of significant loss if any of these companies default on their obligations under any of their debt securities that we hold, or if any of the technology-related industry sectors experience a downturn.
We have invested and intend to continue investing in a limited number of technology-related companies. A consequence of this limited number of investments is that the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if a small number of investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one investment. Beyond the asset diversification requirements to which we are subject as a BDC and a RIC, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification or limitations on the size of our investments in any one portfolio company and our investments could be concentrated in relatively few issuers. In addition, we have invested in and intend to continue investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the value of our total assets (including the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes) in technology-related companies.
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 87.2% of the fair value of our portfolio was composed of investments in three industries: 33.1% was composed of investments in the "Software" industry, 32.2% was composed of investments in the "Drug Discovery & Development" industry, and 21.9% was composed of investments in the "Internet Consumer & Business Services" industry.
As a result, a downturn in technology-related industry sectors and particularly those in which we are heavily concentrated could materially adversely affect our financial condition.
We are a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, and therefore we generally are not limited with respect to the proportion of our assets that may be invested in securities of a single issuer.
We are classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, which means that we are not limited by the 1940 Act with respect to the proportion of our assets that we may invest in securities of a single issuer, excluding limitations on investments in other investment companies. To the extent that we assume large positions in the securities of a small number of issuers, our NAV may fluctuate to a greater extent than that of a diversified investment company as a result of changes in the financial condition or the market’s assessment of the issuer. We may also be more susceptible to any single economic or regulatory occurrence than a diversified investment company. Beyond the asset diversification requirements to which we are subject as a BDC and a RIC, we do not have fixed guidelines for portfolio diversification, and our investments could be concentrated in relatively few portfolio companies or industries. Although we are classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, we maintain the flexibility to operate as a diversified investment company and have done so for an extended period of time. To the extent that we operate as a non-diversified investment company in the future, we may be subject to greater risk.
Our financial results could be negatively affected if a significant portfolio investment fails to perform as expected.
Our total investment in companies may be significant individually or in the aggregate. As a result, if a significant investment in one or more companies fails to perform as expected, our financial results could be more negatively affected, and the magnitude of the loss could be more significant than if we had made smaller investments in more companies.
The following table shows the fair value of the totals of investments held in portfolio companies at December 31, 2020 that represent greater than 5% of our net assets:
•
BridgeBio Pharma LLC is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops drugs for patients with genetic diseases.
•
EverFi, Inc. is a technology company that offers a web-based media platform to teach and certify students in the core concepts of financial literacy, from student loan defaults and sub-prime mortgages to credit card debt and rising bankruptcy rates.
•
Tricida, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the discovery and clinical development of novel therapeutics to address renal, metabolic, and cardiovascular diseases.
Our financial results could be materially adversely affected if these portfolio companies or any of our other significant portfolio companies encounter financial difficulty and fail to repay their obligations or to perform as expected.
Our investments may be in portfolio companies that have limited operating histories and resources.
We expect that our portfolio will continue to consist of investments that may have relatively limited operating histories. These companies may be particularly vulnerable to U.S. and foreign economic downturns may have more limited access to capital and higher funding costs, may have a weaker financial position and may need more capital to expand or compete. These businesses also may experience substantial variations in operating results. They may face intense competition, including from larger, more established companies with greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Furthermore, some of these companies do business in regulated industries and could be affected by changes in government regulation applicable to their given industry. Accordingly, these factors could impair their cash flow or result in other events, such as bankruptcy, which could limit their ability to repay their obligations to us, and may adversely affect the return on, or the recovery of, our investment in these companies. We cannot assure you that any of our investments in our portfolio companies will be successful. We may lose our entire investment in any or all of our portfolio companies.
Investing in publicly traded companies can involve a high degree of risk and can be speculative.
We have invested, and expect to continue to invest, a portion of our portfolio in publicly traded companies or companies that are in the process of completing their IPO. As publicly traded companies, the securities of these companies may not trade at high volumes, and prices can be volatile, particularly during times of general market volatility, which may restrict our ability to sell our positions and may have a material adverse impact on us.
Our ability to invest in public companies may be limited in certain circumstances.
To maintain our status as a BDC, we are not permitted to acquire any assets other than “qualifying assets” specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions).
Subject to certain exceptions for follow-on investments and distressed companies, an investment in an issuer that has outstanding securities listed on a national securities exchange may be treated as a qualifying asset only if such issuer has a market capitalization that is less than $250.0 million at any point in the 60 days prior to the time of such investment and meets the other specified requirements.
Our investment strategy focuses on technology-related companies, which are subject to many risks, including volatility, intense competition, shortened product life cycles, changes in regulatory and governmental programs and periodic downturns, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
We have invested and will continue investing primarily in technology-related companies, many of which may have narrow product lines and small market shares, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors’ actions and market conditions, as well as to general economic downturns. The revenues, income (or losses), and valuations of technology-related companies can and often do fluctuate suddenly and dramatically. In addition, technology-related industries are generally characterized by abrupt business cycles and intense competition. Overcapacity in technology-related industries, together with cyclical economic downturns, may result in substantial decreases in the market capitalization of many technology-related companies. Such decreases in market capitalization may occur again, and any future decreases in technology-related company valuations may be substantial and may not be temporary in nature. Therefore, our portfolio companies may face considerably more risk of loss than do companies in other industry sectors.
Because of rapid technological change, the average selling prices of products and some services provided by technology-related companies have historically decreased over their productive lives. As a result, the average selling prices of products and services offered by technology-related companies may decrease over time, which could adversely affect their operating results, their ability to meet obligations under their debt securities and the value of their equity securities. This could, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our investments in sustainable and renewable technology companies are subject to substantial operational risks, such as underestimated cost projections, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses, loss of government subsidies, and inability to deliver cost-effective alternative energy solutions compared to traditional energy products. In addition, sustainable and renewable technology companies employ a variety of means of increasing cash flow, including increasing utilization of existing facilities, expanding operations through new construction or acquisitions, or securing additional long-term contracts. Thus, some energy companies may be subject to construction risk, acquisition risk or other risks arising from their specific business strategies. Furthermore, production levels for solar, wind and other renewable energies may be dependent upon adequate sunlight, wind, or biogas production, which can vary from market to market and period to period, resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. Demand for sustainable and renewable technology is also influenced by the available supply and prices for other energy products, such as coal, oil and natural gases. A change in prices in these energy products could reduce demand for alternative energy.
A natural disaster may also impact the operations of our portfolio companies, including our technology-related portfolio companies. The nature and level of natural disasters cannot be predicted and may be exacerbated by global climate change. A portion of our technology-related portfolio companies rely on items assembled or produced in areas susceptible to natural disasters, and may sell finished goods into markets susceptible to natural disasters. A major disaster, such as an earthquake, tsunami, flood or other catastrophic event could result in disruption to the business and operations of our technology-related portfolio companies.
We will invest in technology-related companies that are reliant on U.S. and foreign regulatory and governmental programs. Any material changes or discontinuation, due to change in administration or U.S. Congress or otherwise could have a material adverse effect on the operations of a portfolio company in these industries and, in turn, impair our ability to timely collect principal and interest payments owed to us to the extent applicable.
We have invested in and may continue investing in technology-related companies that do not have venture capital or private equity firms as equity investors, and these companies may entail a higher risk of loss than do companies with institutional equity investors, which could increase the risk of loss of your investment.
Our portfolio companies will often require substantial additional equity financing to satisfy their continuing working capital and other cash requirements and, in most instances, to service the interest and principal payments on our investment. Portfolio companies that do not have venture capital or private equity investors may be unable to raise any additional capital to satisfy their obligations or to raise sufficient additional capital to reach the next stage of development. Portfolio companies that do not have venture capital or private equity investors may be less financially sophisticated and may not have access to independent members to serve on their boards, which means that they may be less successful than portfolio companies sponsored by venture capital or private equity firms. Accordingly, financing these types of companies may entail a higher risk of loss than would financing companies that are sponsored by venture capital or private equity firms.
Sustainable and renewable technology companies are subject to extensive government regulation and certain other risks particular to the sectors in which they operate and our business and growth strategy could be adversely affected if government regulations, priorities and resources impacting such sectors change or if our portfolio companies fail to comply with such regulations.
As part of our investment strategy, we plan to invest in portfolio companies in sustainable and renewable technology sectors that may be subject to extensive regulation by foreign, U.S. federal, state and/or local agencies. Changes in existing laws, rules or regulations, or judicial or administrative interpretations thereof, or new laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse impact on the business and industries of our portfolio companies. In addition, changes in government priorities or limitations on government resources could also adversely impact our portfolio companies. We are unable to predict whether any such changes in laws, rules or regulations will occur and, if they do occur, the impact of these changes on our portfolio companies and our investment returns. Furthermore, if any of our portfolio companies fail to comply with applicable regulations, they could be subject to significant penalties and claims that could materially and adversely affect their operations, which would also impact our ability to realize value since our exit from the investment may be subject to the portfolio company obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. Our portfolio companies may be subject to the expense, delay and uncertainty of the regulatory approval process for their products and, even if approved, these products may not be accepted in the marketplace.
In addition, there is considerable uncertainty about whether foreign, U.S., state and/or local governmental entities will enact or maintain legislation or regulatory programs that mandate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions or provide incentives for sustainable and renewable technology companies. Without such regulatory policies, investments in sustainable and renewable technology companies may not be economical and financing for sustainable and renewable technology companies may become unavailable, which could materially adversely affect the ability of our portfolio companies to repay the debt they owe to us. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect the operations and financial condition of a portfolio company and, in turn, the ability of the portfolio company to repay the debt they owe to us.
Cyclicality within the energy sector may adversely affect some of our portfolio companies.
Industries within the energy sector are cyclical with fluctuations in commodity prices and demand for, and production of commodities driven by a variety of factors. The highly cyclical nature of the industries within the energy sector may lead to volatile changes in commodity prices, which may adversely affect the earnings of energy companies in which we may invest and the performance and valuation of our portfolio.
Our investments in the life sciences industry are subject to extensive government regulation, litigation risk, and certain other risks particular to that industry.
We have invested and plan to continue investing in companies in the life sciences industry that are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and to a lesser extent, other federal, state, and other foreign agencies. If any of these portfolio companies fail to comply with applicable regulations, they could be subject to significant penalties and claims that could materially and adversely affect their operations. Portfolio companies that produce medical devices or drugs are subject to the expense, delay and uncertainty of the regulatory approval process for their products and, even if approved, these products may not be accepted in the marketplace. In addition, governmental budgetary constraints effecting the regulatory approval process, new laws, regulations or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations might adversely affect a portfolio company in this industry. Portfolio companies in the life sciences industry may also have a limited number of suppliers of necessary components or a limited number of manufacturers for their products, and therefore face a risk of disruption to their manufacturing process if they are unable to find alternative suppliers when needed. Any of these factors could materially and adversely affect the operations of a portfolio company in this industry and, in turn, impair our ability to timely collect principal and interest payments owed to us.
Our investments in the drug discovery industry are subject to numerous risks, including competition, extensive government regulation, product liability, and commercial difficulties.
Our investments in the drug discovery industry are subject to numerous risks. The successful and timely implementation of the business model of our drug discovery portfolio companies depends on their ability to adapt to changing technologies and introduce new products. As competitors continue to introduce competitive products, the development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy, safety, patient’s and clinician’s ease of use and cost-effectiveness are important to the success of such portfolio companies. The success of new product offerings will depend on many factors, including the ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, develop and manufacture products in an economic and timely manner, obtain or maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property, and differentiate products from those of competitors. Failure by our portfolio companies to introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce products on schedule could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Further, the development of products by drug discovery companies requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including the ability to innovate, develop and manufacture new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the U.S. and abroad, or gain and maintain market approval of products. In addition, regulatory review processes by U.S. and foreign agencies may extend longer than anticipated as a result of decreased funding and tighter fiscal budgets. Further, patents attained by others can preclude or delay the commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that any products now in development will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval, or gain market acceptance. Failure can occur at any point in the development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, failure to achieve market adoption, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or the infringement of intellectual property rights of others.
Future legislation, and/or regulations and policies adopted by the FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory authorities may increase the time and cost required by some of our portfolio companies to conduct and complete clinical trials for the product candidates that they develop, and there is no assurance that these companies will obtain regulatory approval to market and commercialize their products in the U.S. and in foreign countries.
The FDA has established regulations, guidelines and policies to govern the drug development and approval process, as have foreign regulatory authorities, which affect some of our portfolio companies. Any change in regulatory requirements due to the adoption by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities of new legislation, regulations, or policies may require some of our portfolio companies to amend existing clinical trial protocols or add new clinical trials to comply with these changes. Such amendments to existing protocols and/or clinical trial applications or the need for new ones, may significantly impact the cost, timing and completion of the clinical trials.
In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA’s and other authorities’ approval processes may significantly delay or prevent regulatory approval, as well as impose more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. Foreign regulatory authorities may also increase their scrutiny of approval processes resulting in similar delays. Increased scrutiny and approvals processes may limit the ability of our portfolio companies to market and commercialize their products in the U.S. and in foreign countries.
Life sciences companies, including drug development companies, device manufacturers, service providers and others, are also subject to material pressures when there are changes in the outlook for healthcare insurance markets. The ability for individuals, along with private and public insurers, to account for the costs of paying for healthcare insurance can place strain on the ability of new technology, devices and services to enter those markets, particularly when they are new or untested. As a result, it is not uncommon for changes in the insurance marketplace to lead to a slower rate of adoption, price pressure and other forces that may materially limit the success of companies bringing such technologies to market. Changes in the health insurance sector might then have an impact on the value of companies in our portfolio or our ability to invest in the sector generally.
Changes in healthcare laws and other regulations, or the enforcement or interpretation of such laws or regulations, applicable to some of our portfolio companies’ businesses may constrain their ability to offer their products and services.
Changes in healthcare or other laws and regulations, or the enforcement or interpretation of such laws or regulations, applicable to the businesses of some of our portfolio companies may occur that could increase their compliance and other costs of doing business, require significant systems enhancements, or render their products or services less profitable or obsolete, any of which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations. There has also been an increased political and regulatory focus on healthcare laws in recent years, and new legislation could have a material effect on the business and operations of some of our portfolio companies.
Additionally, because of the possibility of additional changes to healthcare laws and regulations under the new U.S. presidential administration, we cannot quantify or predict with any certainty the likely impact on our portfolio companies, our business model, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. We also anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislation on certain of our portfolio companies, our business model, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.
Price declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets could adversely affect the fair value of our portfolio investments, reducing our NAV through increased net unrealized depreciation.
As a BDC, we are required to carry our investments at market value or, if no market value is ascertainable, at fair market value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board of Directors. As part of the valuation process, we may take into account the following types of factors, if relevant, in determining the fair value of our investments: the enterprise value of a portfolio company (an estimate of the total fair value of the portfolio company’s debt and equity), the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company’s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, a comparison of the portfolio company’s securities to similar publicly traded securities, changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made in the future and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation. While most of our investments are not publicly traded, applicable accounting standards require us to assume as part of our valuation process that our investments are sold in a principal market to market participants (even if we plan on holding an investment through its maturity). As a result, volatility in the capital markets can also adversely affect our investment valuations. Decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments are recorded as unrealized depreciation. The effect of all of these factors on our portfolio can reduce our NAV by increasing net unrealized depreciation in our portfolio.
Depending on market conditions, we could incur substantial realized losses and may suffer substantial unrealized depreciation in future periods, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Economic recessions or slowdowns could impair the ability of our portfolio companies to repay loans, which, in turn, could increase our non-performing assets, decrease the value of our portfolio, reduce our volume of new loans and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Many of our portfolio companies may be susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions in both the U.S. and foreign countries, and may be unable to repay our loans during such periods. Therefore, during such periods, our non-performing assets are likely to increase and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease. Adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. Economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could prevent us from increasing investments and harm our operating results.
In particular, intellectual property owned or controlled by our portfolio companies may constitute an important portion of the value of the collateral of our loans to our portfolio companies. Adverse economic conditions may decrease the demand for our portfolio companies’ intellectual property and consequently its value in the event of a bankruptcy or required sale through a foreclosure proceeding. As a result, our ability to fully recover the amounts owed to us under the terms of the loans may be impaired by such events.
A portfolio company’s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of the portfolio company’s loans and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize the portfolio company’s ability to meet its obligations under the debt securities that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company.
Our portfolio companies may be unable to repay or refinance outstanding principal on their loans at or prior to maturity, and rising interest rates may make it more difficult for portfolio companies to make periodic payments on their loans.
Our portfolio companies may be unable to repay or refinance outstanding principal on their loans at or prior to maturity. This risk and the risk of default is increased to the extent that the loan documents do not require the portfolio companies to pay down the outstanding principal of such debt prior to maturity. In addition, if general interest rates rise, there is a risk that our portfolio companies will be unable to pay escalating interest amounts, which could result in a default under their loan documents with us. Any failure of one or more portfolio companies to repay or refinance its debt at or prior to maturity or the inability of one or more portfolio companies to make ongoing payments following an increase in contractual interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The disposition of our investments may result in contingent liabilities.
We currently expect that a portion of our investments will involve private securities. In connection with the disposition of an investment in private securities, we may be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of the portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. We may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations turn out to be inaccurate or with respect to certain potential liabilities. These arrangements may result in contingent liabilities that ultimately yield funding obligations that must be satisfied through our return of certain distributions previously made to us.
The health and performance of our portfolio companies could be adversely affected by political and economic conditions in the countries in which they conduct business.
Some of the products of our portfolio companies are developed, manufactured, assembled, tested or marketed outside the U.S. Any conflict or uncertainty in these countries, including due to natural disasters, public health concerns, political unrest or safety concerns, among other things, could harm their business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if the government of any country in which their products are developed, manufactured or sold sets technical or regulatory standards for products developed or manufactured in or imported into their country that are not widely shared, it may lead some of their customers to suspend imports of their products into that country, require manufacturers or developers in that country to manufacture or develop products with different technical or regulatory standards and disrupt cross-border manufacturing, marketing or business relationships which, in each case, could harm their businesses.
Any unrealized depreciation we experience on our investment portfolio may be an indication of future realized losses, which could reduce our income available for distribution and could impair our ability to service our borrowings.
As a BDC, we are required to carry our investments at market value or, if no market value is ascertainable, at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments will be recorded as unrealized depreciation. Any unrealized depreciation in our investment portfolio could be an indication of a portfolio company’s inability to meet its repayment obligations to us with respect to the affected investments. This could result in realized losses in the future and ultimately in reductions of our income available for distribution in future periods and could materially adversely affect our ability to service our outstanding borrowings.
A lack of IPO or merger and acquisition opportunities may cause companies to stay in our portfolio longer, leading to lower returns, unrealized depreciation, or realized losses.
A lack of IPO or merger and acquisition, or M&A, opportunities for venture capital-backed companies could lead to companies staying longer in our portfolio as private entities still requiring funding. This situation may adversely affect the amount of available funding for early-stage companies in particular as, in general, venture-capital firms are being forced to provide additional financing to late-stage companies that cannot complete an IPO or M&A transaction. In the best case, such stagnation would dampen returns, and in the worst case, could lead to unrealized depreciation and realized losses as some companies run short of cash and have to accept lower valuations in private fundings or are not able to access additional capital at all. A lack of IPO or M&A opportunities for venture capital-backed companies can also cause some venture capital firms to change their strategies, leading some of them to reduce funding of their portfolio companies and making it more difficult for such companies to access capital and to fulfill their potential, which can result in unrealized depreciation and realized losses in such companies by other companies such as ourselves who are co-investors in such companies.
The majority of our portfolio companies will need multiple rounds of additional financing to repay their debts to us and continue operations. Our portfolio companies may not be able to raise additional financing, which could harm our investment returns.
The majority of our portfolio companies will often require substantial additional equity financing to satisfy their continuing working capital and other cash requirements and, in most instances, to service the interest and principal payments on our investment. Each round of venture financing is typically intended to provide a company with only enough capital to reach the next stage of development. We cannot predict the circumstances or market conditions under which our portfolio companies will seek additional capital. It is possible that one or more of our portfolio companies will not be able to raise additional financing or may be able to do so only at a price or on terms unfavorable to us, either of which would negatively impact our investment returns. Some of these companies may be unable to obtain sufficient financing from private investors, public capital markets or traditional lenders. This may have a significant impact if the companies are unable to obtain certain federal, state or foreign agency approval for their products or the marketing thereof, of if regulatory review processes extend longer than anticipated, and the companies need continued funding for their operations during these times.
Accordingly, financing these types of companies may entail a higher risk of loss than would financing companies that are able to utilize traditional credit sources.
If the assets securing the loans that we make decrease in value, then we may lack sufficient collateral to cover losses.
To attempt to mitigate credit risks, we will typically take a security interest in the available assets of our portfolio companies. There is no assurance that we will obtain or properly perfect our liens.
There is a risk that the collateral securing our loans may decrease in value over time, may be difficult to sell in a timely manner, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based upon the success of the business and market conditions, including as a result of the inability of a portfolio company to raise additional capital. In some circumstances, our lien could be subordinated to claims of other creditors. Consequently, the fact that a loan is secured does not guarantee that we will receive principal and interest payments according to the loan’s terms, or that we will be able to collect on the loan should we be forced to enforce our remedies.
In addition, because we invest in technology-related companies, a substantial portion of the assets securing our investment may be in the form of intellectual property, if any, inventory and equipment and, to a lesser extent, cash and accounts receivable. Intellectual property, if any, that is securing our loan could lose value if, among other things, the company’s rights to the intellectual property are challenged or if the company’s license to the intellectual property is revoked or expires, the technology fails to achieve its intended results or a new technology makes the intellectual property functionally obsolete. Inventory may not be adequate to secure our loan if our valuation of the inventory at the time that we made the loan was not accurate or if there is a reduction in the demand for the inventory.
Similarly, any equipment securing our loan may not provide us with the anticipated security if there are changes in technology or advances in new equipment that render the particular equipment obsolete or of limited value, or if the company fails to adequately maintain or repair the equipment. Any one or more of the preceding factors could materially impair our ability to recover earned interest and principal in a foreclosure.
In most cases, we collateralize our investments by obtaining a first priority security interest in a portfolio company’s assets, which may include its intellectual property. In other cases, we may obtain a negative pledge covering a company’s intellectual property. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 84.2% of our debt investments were in a senior secured first lien position, with 43.5% secured by a first priority security in all of the assets of the portfolio company, including its intellectual property, 31.0% secured by a first priority security in all of the assets of the portfolio company and the portfolio company was prohibited from pledging or encumbering its intellectual property. 0.6% of our debt investments were senior secured by the equipment of the portfolio company, and 9.1% were in a first lien “last-out” senior secured position with security interest in all of the assets of the portfolio company, whereby the “last-out” loans will be subordinated to the “first-out” portion of the unitranche loan in a liquidation, sale or other disposition. Another 15.1% of our debt investments were secured by a second priority security interest in all of the portfolio company’s assets, and 0.7% were unsecured.
We may suffer a loss if a portfolio company defaults on a loan and the underlying collateral is not sufficient.
In the event of a default by a portfolio company on a secured loan, we will only have recourse to the assets collateralizing the loan. If the underlying collateral value is less than the loan amount, we will suffer a loss. In addition, we sometimes make loans that are unsecured, which are subject to the risk that other lenders may be directly secured by the assets of the portfolio company. In the event of a default, those collateralized lenders would have priority over us with respect to the proceeds of a sale of the underlying assets. In cases described above, we may lack control over the underlying asset collateralizing our loan or the underlying assets of the portfolio company prior to a default, and as a result the value of the collateral may be reduced by acts or omissions by owners or managers of the assets.
In the event of bankruptcy of a portfolio company, we may not have full recourse to its assets in order to satisfy our loan, or our loan may be subject to “equitable subordination.” This means that depending on the facts and circumstances, including the extent to which we actually provided significant “managerial assistance,” if any, to that portfolio company, a bankruptcy court might re-characterize our debt holding and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. In addition, certain of our loans are subordinate to other debt of the portfolio company. If a portfolio company defaults on our loan or on debt senior to our loan, or in the event of a portfolio company bankruptcy, our loan will be satisfied only after the senior debt receives payment. Where debt senior to our loan exists, the presence of intercreditor arrangements may limit our ability to amend our loan documents, assign our loans, accept prepayments, exercise our remedies (through “standstill” periods) and control decisions made in bankruptcy proceedings relating to the portfolio company. Bankruptcy and portfolio company litigation can significantly increase collection losses and the time needed for us to acquire the underlying collateral in the event of a default, during which time the collateral may decline in value, causing us to suffer losses.
If the value of collateral underlying our loan declines or interest rates increase during the term of our loan, a portfolio company may not be able to obtain the necessary funds to repay our loan at maturity through refinancing. Decreasing collateral value and/or increasing interest rates may hinder a portfolio company’s ability to refinance our loan because the underlying collateral cannot satisfy the debt service coverage requirements necessary to obtain new financing. If a borrower is unable to repay our loan at maturity, we could suffer a loss which may adversely impact our financial performance.
The inability of our portfolio companies to commercialize their technologies or create or develop commercially viable products or businesses would have a negative impact on our investment returns.
The possibility that our portfolio companies will not be able to commercialize their technology, products or business concepts presents significant risks to the value of our investment. Additionally, although some of our portfolio companies may already have a commercially successful product or product line when we invest, technology-related products and services often have a more limited market or life-span than have products in other industries. Thus, the ultimate success of these companies often depends on their ability to continually innovate, or raise additional capital, in increasingly competitive markets. Their inability to do so could affect our investment return. In addition, the intellectual property held by our portfolio companies often represents a substantial portion of the collateral, if any, securing our investments. We cannot assure you that any of our portfolio companies will successfully acquire or develop any new technologies, or that the intellectual property the companies currently hold will remain viable. Even if our portfolio companies are able to develop commercially viable products, the market for new products and services is highly competitive and rapidly changing. Neither our portfolio companies nor we have any control over the pace of technology development. Commercial success is difficult to predict, and the marketing efforts of our portfolio companies may not be successful.
An investment strategy focused on privately-held companies presents certain challenges, including the lack of available information about these companies, a dependence on the talents and efforts of only a few key portfolio company personnel, and a greater vulnerability to economic downturns.
We invest primarily in privately-held companies. Generally, very little public information exists about these companies, and we are required to rely on the ability of our management and investment teams to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies. Such small, privately held companies as we routinely invest in may also lack quality infrastructures, thus leading to poor disclosure standards or control environments. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies, then we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may not receive the expected return on our investment or lose some or all of the money invested in these companies.
Also, privately-held companies frequently have less diverse product lines and a smaller market presence than do larger competitors. Privately-held companies are, thus, generally more vulnerable to economic downturns and may experience more substantial variations in operating results than do larger competitors. These factors could affect our investment returns and our results of operations and financial condition.
In addition, our success depends, in large part, upon the abilities of the key management personnel of our portfolio companies, who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our portfolio companies. Competition for qualified personnel is intense at any stage of a company’s development, and high turnover of personnel is common in technology-related companies. The loss of one or more key managers can hinder or delay a company’s implementation of its business plan and harm its financial condition. Our portfolio companies may not be able to attract and retain qualified managers and personnel. Any inability to do so may negatively impact our investment returns and our results of operations and financial condition.
If our portfolio companies are unable to protect their intellectual property rights or are required to devote significant resources to protecting their intellectual property rights, then our investments could be harmed.
Our future success and competitive position depend in part upon the ability of our portfolio companies to obtain and maintain proprietary technology used in their products and services, which will often represent a significant portion of the collateral, if any, securing our investment. The portfolio companies will rely, in part, on patent, trade secret and trademark law to protect that technology, but competitors may misappropriate their intellectual property, and disputes as to ownership of intellectual property may arise. Portfolio companies may, from time to time, be required to institute litigation in order to enforce their patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights, to protect their trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. Similarly, if a portfolio company is found to infringe upon or misappropriate a third party’s patent or other proprietary rights, that portfolio company could be required to pay damages to such third party, alter its own products or processes, obtain a license from the third party and/or cease activities utilizing such proprietary rights, including making or selling products utilizing such proprietary rights. Any of the foregoing events could negatively affect both the portfolio company’s ability to service our debt investment and the value of any related debt and equity securities that we own, as well as any collateral securing our investment.
We generally will not control our portfolio companies.
In some instances, we may control our portfolio companies or provide our portfolio companies with significant managerial assistance. However, we generally do not, and do not expect to, control the decision making in many of our portfolio companies, even though we may have board representation or board observation rights, and our debt agreements may contain certain restrictive covenants. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company in which we invest will make business decisions with which we disagree and the management of such company, as representatives of the holders of their common equity, will take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests as debt investors. Due to the lack of liquidity for our investments in non-traded companies, we may not be able to dispose of our interests in our portfolio companies as readily as we would like or at an appropriate valuation. As a result, a portfolio company may make decisions that would decrease the value of our portfolio holdings.
Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected if we are unable to recover our principal investment as a result of a negative pledge or lack of a security interest on the intellectual property of our venture growth stage companies.
In some cases, we collateralize our loans with a secured collateral position in a portfolio company's assets, which may include a negative pledge or, to a lesser extent, no security on their intellectual property. In the event of a default on a loan, the intellectual property of the portfolio company will most likely be liquidated to provide proceeds to pay the creditors of the company. There can be no assurance that our security interest, if any, in the proceeds of the intellectual property will be enforceable in a court of law or bankruptcy court or that there will not be others with senior or pari passu credit interests.
Our relationship with certain portfolio companies may expose us to our portfolio companies' trade secrets and confidential information which may require us to be parties to non-disclosure agreements and restrict us from engaging in certain transactions.
Our relationship with some of our portfolio companies may expose us to our portfolio companies' trade secrets and confidential information (including transactional data and personal data about their employees and clients) which may require us to be parties to non-disclosure agreements and restrict us from engaging in certain transactions. Unauthorized access or disclosure of such information may occur, resulting in theft, loss or other misappropriation. Any theft, loss, improper use, such as insider trading or other misappropriation of confidential information could have a material adverse impact on our competitive positions, our relationship with our portfolio companies and our reputation and could subject us to regulatory inquiries, enforcement and fines, civil litigation (which may cause us to incur significant expense or expose us to losses) and possible financial liability or costs.
Portfolio company litigation could result in additional costs, the diversion of management time and resources and have an adverse impact on the fair value of our investment.
To the extent that litigation arises with respect to any of our portfolio companies, we may be named as a defendant, which could result in additional costs and the diversion of management time and resources. Furthermore, if we are providing managerial assistance to the portfolio company or have representatives on the portfolio company’s board of directors, our costs and diversion of our management’s time and resources in assessing the portfolio company could be substantial in light of any such litigation regardless of whether we are named as a defendant. In addition, litigation involving a portfolio company may be costly and affect the operations of the portfolio company’s business, which could in turn have an adverse impact on the fair value of our investment in such company.
We may not be able to realize our entire investment on equipment-based loans, if any, in the case of default.
We may from time-to-time provide loans that will be collateralized only by equipment of the portfolio company. If the portfolio company defaults on the loan we would take possession of the underlying equipment to satisfy the outstanding debt. The residual value of the equipment at the time we would take possession may not be sufficient to satisfy the outstanding debt and we could experience a loss on the disposition of the equipment.
Our investments in foreign securities may involve significant risks in addition to the risks inherent in U.S. investments.
Our investment strategy contemplates that a portion of our investments may be in securities of foreign companies. Our total investments at value in foreign companies were approximately $126.7 million or 5.4% of total investments at December 31, 2020. Investing in foreign companies may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies.
These risks include changes in exchange control regulations, political and social instability, expropriation, imposition of foreign taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the U.S., higher transaction costs, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility, among other things.
If our investments do not meet our performance expectations, you may not receive distributions.
We intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders. We may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a BDC, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions. Also, restrictions and provisions in any future credit facilities may limit our ability to make distributions. As a RIC, if we do not distribute at least a certain percentage of our income each taxable year as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including the inability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure you that you will receive distributions at a particular level or at all.
We may not have sufficient funds to make follow-on investments. Our decision not to make a follow-on investment may have a negative impact on a portfolio company in need of such an investment or may result in a missed opportunity for us.
After our initial investment in a portfolio company, we may be called upon from time to time to provide additional funds to such company or have the opportunity or need to increase our investment in a successful situation or attempt to preserve or enhance the value of our initial investment, for example, the exercise of a warrant to purchase common stock, or a negative situation, to protect an existing investment. We have the discretion to make any follow-on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources and regulatory considerations. We may elect not to make follow-on investments or otherwise lack sufficient funds to make those investments. Any decision we make not to make a follow-on investment or any inability on our part to make such an investment may have a negative impact on a portfolio company in need of such an investment or may result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful operation and may dilute our equity interest or otherwise reduce the expected yield on our investment. Moreover, a follow-on investment may limit the number of companies in which we can make initial investments. In determining whether to make a follow-on investment, our management will exercise its business judgment and apply criteria similar to those used when making the initial investment. There is no assurance that we will make, or will have sufficient funds to make, follow-on investments and this could adversely affect our success and result in the loss of a substantial portion or all of our investment in a portfolio company.
The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business and, if we need to sell any of our investments, we may not be able to do so at a favorable price. As a result, we may suffer losses.
We generally invest in debt securities with terms of up to seven years and hold such investments until maturity, and we do not expect that our related holdings of equity securities will provide us with liquidity opportunities in the near-term. We invest and expect to continue investing in companies whose securities have no established trading market and whose securities are and will be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or whose securities are and will be less liquid than publicly traded securities. The illiquidity of these investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired. In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded these investments. As a result, we do not expect to achieve liquidity in our investments in the near-term. However, to maintain our qualification as a BDC and as a RIC, we may have to dispose of investments if we do not satisfy one or more of the applicable criteria under the respective regulatory frameworks.
Our portfolio companies may incur debt or issue equity securities that rank equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies.
We invest primarily in debt securities issued by our portfolio companies. In some cases, portfolio companies will be permitted to incur other debt, or issue other equity securities, that rank equally with, or senior to, our investment. Such instruments may provide that the holders thereof are entitled to receive payment of distributions, interest or principal on or before the dates on which we are entitled to receive payments in respect of our investments. These debt instruments would usually prohibit the portfolio companies from paying interest on or repaying our investments in the event and during the continuance of a default under such debt. Also, in the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of a portfolio company, holders of securities ranking senior to our investment in that portfolio company would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any distribution in respect of our investment. After repaying such holders, the portfolio company might not have any remaining assets to use for repaying its obligation to us. In the case of securities ranking equally with our investments, we would have to share on a pari passu basis any distributions with other security holders in the event of an insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of the relevant portfolio company.
The rights we may have with respect to the collateral securing any junior priority loans we make to our portfolio companies may also be limited pursuant to the terms of one or more intercreditor agreements that we enter into with the holders of senior debt. Under such an intercreditor agreement, at any time that senior obligations are outstanding, we may forfeit certain rights with respect to the collateral to the holders of the senior obligations. These rights may include the right to commence enforcement proceedings against the collateral, the right to control the conduct of such enforcement proceedings, the right to approve amendments to collateral documents, the right to release liens on the collateral and the right to waive past defaults under collateral documents. We may not have the ability to control or direct such actions, even if as a result our rights as junior lenders are adversely affected.
Our warrant and equity-related investments are highly speculative, and we may not realize gains from these investments. If our warrant and equity-related investments do not generate gains, then the return on our invested capital will be lower than it would otherwise be, which could result in a decline in the value of shares of our common stock.
When we invest in debt securities, we generally expect to acquire warrants or other equity-related securities as well. Our goal is ultimately to dispose of these equity interests and realize gains upon disposition of such interests. Over time, the gains that we realize on these equity interests may offset, to some extent, losses that we experience on defaults under debt and other securities that we hold. However, the equity interests that we receive may not appreciate in value and, in fact, may decline in value. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize gains from our equity interests, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity interests may not be sufficient to offset any other losses that we experience. In addition, we anticipate that approximately 50% of our warrants may not realize and exit or generate any returns. Furthermore, because of the financial reporting requirements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, of those approximately 50% of warrants that we do not realize and exit, the assigned costs to the initial warrants may lead to realized write-offs when the warrants either expire or are not exercised.
Prepayments of our debt investments by our portfolio companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on equity.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received debt investment early principal repayments and pay down of working capital debt investments of approximately $781.2 million. We are subject to the risk that the investments we make in our portfolio companies may be repaid prior to maturity. When this occurs, we will generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments, pending their future investment in new portfolio companies. These temporary investments will typically have substantially lower yields than the debt being prepaid and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. Any future investment in a new portfolio company may also be at lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our portfolio companies elect to prepay amounts owed to us. Additionally, prepayments could negatively impact our return on equity, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.
We may choose to waive or defer enforcement of covenants in the debt securities held in our portfolio, which may cause us to lose all or part of our investment in these companies.
We structure the debt investments in our portfolio companies to include business and financial covenants placing affirmative and negative obligations on the operation of the company’s business and its financial condition. However, from time to time we may elect to waive breaches of these covenants, including our right to payment, or waive or defer enforcement of remedies, such as acceleration of obligations or foreclosure on collateral, depending upon the financial condition and prospects of the particular portfolio company. These actions may reduce the likelihood of receiving the full amount of future payments of interest or principal and be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of the underlying collateral as many of these companies may have limited financial resources, may be unable to meet future obligations and may go bankrupt. This could negatively impact our ability to pay distributions, could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition and cause the loss of all or part of your investment.
We may also be subject to lender liability claims for actions taken by us with respect to a borrower’s business or instances where we exercise control over the borrower. It is possible that we could become subject to a lender’s liability claim, including as a result of actions taken in rendering significant managerial assistance or actions to compel and collect payments from the borrower outside the ordinary course of business.
Our loans could be subject to equitable subordination by a court which would increase our risk of loss with respect to such loans or we could be subject to lender liability claims.
Courts may apply the doctrine of equitable subordination to subordinate the claim or lien of a lender against a borrower to claims or liens of other creditors of the borrower, when the lender or its affiliates is found to have engaged in unfair, inequitable or fraudulent conduct. The courts have also applied the doctrine of equitable subordination when a lender or its affiliates is found to have exerted inappropriate control over a client, including control resulting from the ownership of equity interests in a client or providing of significant managerial assistance. We have made direct equity investments or received warrants in connection with loans. These investments represent approximately 11.0% of the outstanding value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020. Payments on one or more of our loans, particularly certain loans to clients in which we also hold equity interests, may be subject to claims of equitable subordination. If we were deemed to have the ability to control or otherwise exercise influence over the business and affairs of one or more of our portfolio companies resulting in economic hardship to other creditors of that company, this control or influence may constitute grounds for equitable subordination and a court may treat one or more of our loans as if it were unsecured or common equity in the portfolio company. In that case, if the portfolio company were to liquidate, we would be entitled to repayment of our loan on a pro-rata basis with other unsecured debt or, if the effect of subordination was to place us at the level of common equity, then on an equal basis with other holders of the portfolio company’s common equity only after all of its obligations relating to its debt and preferred securities had been satisfied.
In addition to these risks, in the event we elect to convert our debt position to equity, or otherwise take control of a portfolio company (such as through placing a member of our management team on its board of directors), as part of a restructuring, we face additional risks acting in that capacity. It is not uncommon for unsecured, or otherwise unsatisfied creditors, to sue parties that elect to use their debt positions to later control a company following a restructuring or bankruptcy. Apart from lawsuits, key customers and suppliers might act in a fashion contrary to the interests of a portfolio company if they were left unsatisfied in a restructuring or bankruptcy. Any combination of these factors might lead to the loss in value of a company subject to such activity and may divert the time and attention of our management team and investment team to help to address such issues in a portfolio company.
The potential inability of our portfolio companies’ in the healthcare industry to charge desired prices with respect to prescription drugs could impact their revenues and in turn their ability to repay us.
Some of our portfolio companies in the healthcare industry are subject to risks associated with the pricing for prescription drugs. It is uncertain whether customers of our healthcare industry portfolio companies will continue to utilize established prescription drug pricing methods, or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry. Legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regulators have conducted investigations into the use of prescription drug pricing methods for federal program payment, and whether such methods have inflated drug expenditures by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Any changes to the method for calculating prescription drug costs may reduce the revenues of our portfolio companies in the healthcare industry which could in turn impair their ability to timely make any principal and interest payments owed to us.
Risks Related to Our Securities
Investing in shares of our common stock involves an above average degree of risk.
The investments we make in accordance with our investment objective may result in a higher amount of risk, volatility or loss of principal than alternative investment options. Our investments in portfolio companies may be highly speculative and aggressive, and therefore, an investment in our common stock may not be suitable for investors with lower risk tolerance.
Our common stock may trade below its NAV per share, which limits our ability to raise additional equity capital.
If our common stock is trading below its NAV per share, we will generally not be able to issue additional shares of our common stock at its market price without first obtaining the approval for such issuance from our independent directors. If our common stock trades below NAV, the higher cost of equity capital may result in it being unattractive to raise new equity, which may limit our ability to grow. The risk of trading below NAV is separate and distinct from the risk that our NAV per share may decline. We cannot predict whether shares of our common stock will trade above, at or below our NAV.
Provisions of our charter and bylaws could deter takeover attempts and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.
Our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying, or making difficult a change in control of our company or the removal of our incumbent directors. Under our charter, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes serving staggered terms, which will make it more difficult for a hostile bidder to acquire control of us. In addition, our Board of Directors may, without stockholder action, authorize the issuance of shares of stock in one or more classes or series, including preferred stock. Subject to compliance with the 1940 Act, our Board of Directors may, without stockholder action, amend our charter to increase the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue. The existence of these provisions, among others, may have a negative impact on the price of our common stock and may discourage third party bids for ownership of our company. These provisions may prevent any premiums being offered to you for shares of our common stock in connection with a takeover.
Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.
Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the availability of such common stock for sale (including as a result of the conversion of our 2022 Convertible Notes, issued in January 2017, into common stock), could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our common stock, which may also lead to further dilution of our earnings per share. If this occurs and continues, it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so.
We have received the approval from our stockholders to issue shares of our common stock at prices below the then current NAV per share of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and with the approval from our independent directors. If we receive such approval from the independent directors, we may periodically issue shares of our common stock at a price below the then current NAV per share of common stock. Any such issuance could materially dilute your interest in our common stock and reduce our NAV per share.
We have received the approval from our stockholders to issue shares of our common stock at prices below the then current NAV per share of our common stock. The approval expires on June 12, 2021. Such approval has allowed and may again allow us to access the capital markets in a way that we typically are unable to do as a result of restrictions that, absent stockholder approval, apply to business development companies under the 1940 Act. Any decision to sell shares of our common stock below the then current NAV per share of our common stock is subject to the determination by our Board of Directors that such issuance and sale is in our and our stockholders’ best interests.
Any sale or other issuance of shares of our common stock at a price below NAV per share has resulted and will continue to result in an immediate dilution to your interest in our common stock and a reduction of our NAV per share. This dilution would occur as a result of a proportionately greater decrease in a stockholder’s interest in our earnings and assets and voting interest in us than the increase in our assets resulting from such issuance. Because the number of future shares of common stock that may be issued below our NAV per share and the price and timing of such issuances are not currently known, we cannot predict the actual dilutive effect of any such issuance. We also cannot determine the resulting reduction in our NAV per share of any such issuance at this time. We caution you that such effects may be material, and we undertake to describe all the material risks and dilutive effects of any offering that we make at a price below our then current NAV in the future in a prospectus supplement issued in connection with any such offering. We cannot predict whether shares of our common stock will trade above, at or below our NAV.
If we conduct an offering of our common stock at a price below NAV, investors are likely to incur immediate dilution upon the closing of the offering.
We are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below NAV per share. We may, however, sell our common stock, at a price below the current NAV of the common stock, or sell warrants, options or other rights to acquire such common stock, at a price below the current NAV of the common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders and our stockholders have approved the practice of making such sales.
In connection with the receipt of such stockholder approval, we will limit the number of shares that it issues at a price below NAV pursuant to this authorization so that the aggregate dilutive effect on our then outstanding shares will not exceed 20%. Our Board of Directors, subject to its fiduciary duties and regulatory requirements, has the discretion to determine the amount of the discount, and as a result, the discount could be up to 100% of NAV per share. If we were to issue shares at a price below NAV, such sales would result in an immediate dilution to existing common stockholders, which would include a reduction in the NAV per share as a result of the issuance. This dilution would also include a proportionately greater decrease in a stockholder’s interest in our earnings and assets and voting interest in us than the increase in our assets resulting from such issuance.
In addition, if we determined to conduct additional offerings in the future there may be even greater dilution if we determine to conduct such offerings at prices below NAV. As a result, investors will experience further dilution and additional discounts to the price of our common stock. Because the number of shares of common stock that could be so issued and the timing of any issuance is not currently known, the actual dilutive effect of an offering cannot be predicted. We did not sell any of our securities at a price below NAV during the year ended December 31, 2020.
We may allocate the net proceeds from an offering in ways with which you may not agree.
We have significant flexibility in investing the net proceeds of an offering and may use the net proceeds from an offering in ways with which you may not agree or for purposes other than those contemplated at the time of the offering.
If we issue preferred stock, debt securities or convertible debt securities, the NAV and market value of our common stock may become more volatile.
We cannot assure you that the issuance of preferred stock and/or debt securities would result in a higher yield or return to the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, debt securities or convertible debt would likely cause the NAV and market value of our common stock to become more volatile. If the distribution rate on the preferred stock, or the interest rate on the debt securities, were to approach the net rate of return on our investment portfolio, the benefit of leverage to the holders of our common stock would be reduced. If the distribution rate on the preferred stock, or the interest rate on the debt securities, were to exceed the net rate of return on our portfolio, the use of leverage would result in a lower rate of return to the holders of common stock than if we had not issued the preferred stock or debt securities. Any decline in the NAV of our investment would be borne entirely by the holders of our common stock. Therefore, if the market value of our portfolio were to decline, the leverage would result in a greater decrease in NAV to the holders of our common stock than if we were not leveraged through the issuance of preferred stock. This decline in NAV would also tend to cause a greater decline in the market price for our common stock.
There is also a risk that, in the event of a sharp decline in the value of our net assets, we would be in danger of failing to maintain required asset coverage ratios which may be required by the preferred stock, debt securities, convertible debt or units or of a downgrade in the ratings of the preferred stock, debt securities, convertible debt or our current investment income might not be sufficient to meet the distribution requirements on the preferred stock or the interest payments on the debt securities. If we do not maintain our required asset coverage ratios, we may not be permitted to declare dividend distributions. In order to counteract such an event, we might need to liquidate investments in order to fund redemption of some or all of the preferred stock, debt securities or convertible debt. In addition, we would pay (and the holders of our common stock would bear) all costs and expenses relating to the issuance and ongoing maintenance of the preferred stock, debt securities, convertible debt or any combination of these securities. Holders of preferred stock, debt securities, convertible debt or any combination of these securities may have different interests than holders of common stock and may at times have disproportionate influence over our affairs.
Holders of any preferred stock that we may issue will have the right to elect members of the Board of Directors and have class voting rights on certain matters.
The 1940 Act requires that holders of shares of preferred stock must be entitled as a class to elect two directors at all times and to elect a majority of the directors if distributions on such preferred stock are in arrears by two years or more, until such arrearage is eliminated. In addition, certain matters under the 1940 Act require the separate vote of the holders of any issued and outstanding preferred stock, including changes in fundamental investment restrictions and conversion to open-end status and, accordingly, preferred stockholders could veto any such changes. Restrictions imposed on the declarations and payment of dividends or other distributions to the holders of our common stock and preferred stock, both by the 1940 Act and by requirements imposed by rating agencies, might impair our ability to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC.
Terms relating to redemption may materially adversely affect your return on any debt securities that we may issue.
If you are holding debt securities issued by us and such securities are redeemable at our option, we may choose to redeem your debt securities at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on your debt securities. In addition, if you are holding debt securities issued by us and such securities are subject to mandatory redemption, we may be required to redeem your debt securities at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on your debt securities. In this circumstance, you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as your debt securities being redeemed.
We may redeem the 2022 Notes after September 23, 2022, the July 2024 Notes after January 16, 2024, the February 2025 Notes after August 5, 2024, the April 2025 Notes after April 30, 2021, the June 2025 Notes after December 3, 2024, the March 2026 A Notes after May 4, 2025, and the 2033 Notes after October 30, 2033 at a redemption price of 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest payments. If we choose to redeem the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, or 2033 Notes when the fair market value of the 2022 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, or 2033 Notes is above par value, you would experience a loss of any potential premium.
A downgrade, suspension, or withdrawal of the credit rating assigned by a rating agency to us or our debt securities, if any, or change in the debt markets could cause the liquidity or market value of our debt securities to decline significantly.
Our credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of our outstanding debt and equity securities and our ability to raise capital. These credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to the structure or marketing of such debt and equity securities. Credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization in its sole discretion.
Neither we nor any underwriter undertakes any obligation to maintain our credit ratings or to advise holders of our debt and equity securities of any changes in our credit ratings. There can be no assurance that a credit rating will remain for any given period of time or that such credit ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely if future circumstances relating to the basis of the credit rating, such as adverse changes in our company, so warrant. An increase in the competitive environment, inability to cover distributions, or increase in leverage could lead to a downgrade in our credit ratings and limit our access to the debt and equity markets capability impairing our ability to grow the business. The conditions of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future.
Our shares may trade at discounts from NAV or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term.
Shares of business development companies may trade at a market price that is less than the NAV that is attributable to those shares. Our shares have historically traded above and below our NAV. The possibility that our shares of common stock will trade at a discount from NAV or at a premium that is unsustainable over the long term is separate and distinct from the risk that our NAV may decrease. It is not possible to predict whether our shares will trade at, above or below NAV in the future.
Our stockholders may experience dilution upon the conversion of our 2022 Convertible Notes.
Our 2022 Convertible Notes, issued in January 2017, are convertible into shares of our common stock beginning on August 1, 2021 or, under certain circumstances, earlier. Upon conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes, we have the choice to pay or deliver, as the case may be, at our election, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock. The initial conversion price of the 2022 Convertible Notes is $16.41, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. If we elect to deliver shares of common stock upon a conversion at the time our NAV per share exceeds the conversion price in effect at such time, our stockholders may incur dilution. In addition, our stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of common stock upon our issuance of common stock in connection with the conversion of the 2022 Convertible Notes and any distributions paid on our common stock will also be paid on shares issued in connection with such conversion after such issuance.
Our stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage if they opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan.
All distributions in cash payable to stockholders that are participants in our dividend reinvestment plan are automatically reinvested in shares of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders that opt out of our dividend reinvestment plan will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of our common stock over time.
Our distribution proceeds may exceed our earnings. Therefore, portions of the distributions that we make may represent a return of capital to stockholders, which will lower their tax basis in their shares.
The tax treatment and characterization of our distributions may vary significantly from time to time due to the nature of our investments. The ultimate tax characterization of our distributions made during a taxable year generally will not finally be determined until after the end of that taxable year. We may make distributions during a taxable year that exceed our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, and net capital gains for that taxable year. In such a situation, the amount by which our total distributions exceed investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, and net capital gains generally would be treated as a return of capital up to the amount of a stockholder’s tax basis in the shares, with any amounts exceeding such tax basis generally treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of such shares. A return
of capital generally is a return of a stockholder’s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities. Moreover, we may pay all or a substantial portion of our distributions from the proceeds of the sale of shares of our common stock or from borrowings in anticipation of future cash flow, which could constitute a return of stockholders’ capital and will lower such stockholders’ tax basis in our shares, which may result in increased tax liability to stockholders when they sell such shares. The tax liability to stockholders upon the sale of shares may increase even if such shares are sold at a loss.
Our common stock price has been and continues to be volatile and may decrease substantially.
As with any company, the price of our common stock will fluctuate with market conditions and other factors, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;
•
significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of RICs, business development companies or other financial services companies;
•
any inability to deploy or invest our capital;
•
fluctuations in interest rates;
•
any shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;
•
the financial performance of specific industries in which we invest in on a recurring basis;
•
announcement of strategic developments, acquisitions, and other material events by us or our competitors, or operating performance of companies comparable to us;
•
changes in regulatory policies or tax guidelines with respect to RICs, SBICs or business development companies;
•
losing our ability to either qualify or be subject to U.S. federal income tax as a RIC;
•
actual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results, or changes in the expectations of securities analysts;
•
changes in the value of our portfolio of investments;
•
realized losses in investments in our portfolio companies;
•
general economic conditions and trends;
•
inability to access the capital markets;
•
loss of a major funded source; or
•
departure of key personnel.
In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert management’s attention and resources from our business.
We may be unable to invest a significant portion of the net proceeds from an offering or from exiting an investment or other capital on acceptable terms, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.
Delays in investing the net proceeds raised in an offering or from exiting an investment or other capital may cause our performance to be worse than that of other fully invested business development companies or other lenders or investors pursuing comparable investment strategies. We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify any investments that meet our investment objective or that any investment that we make will produce a positive return. We may be unable to invest the net proceeds of any offering or from exiting an investment or other capital on acceptable terms within the time period that we anticipate or at all, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.
We anticipate that, depending on market conditions and the amount of the capital, it may take us a substantial period of time to invest substantially all the capital in securities meeting our investment objective. During this period, we will invest the capital primarily in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less or use the net proceeds from such offerings to reduce then-outstanding debt obligations, which may produce returns that are significantly lower than the returns which we expect to achieve when our portfolio is fully invested in securities meeting our investment objective. As a result, any distributions that we pay during such period may be substantially lower than the distributions that we may be able to pay when our portfolio is fully invested in securities meeting our investment objective. In addition, until such time as the net proceeds of any offering or from exiting an investment or other capital are invested in new securities meeting our investment objective, the market price for our securities may decline. Thus, the initial return on your investment may be lower than when, if ever, our portfolio is fully invested in securities meeting our investment objective.
Your interest in us may be diluted if you do not fully exercise your subscription rights in any rights offering. In addition, if the subscription price is less than our NAV per share, then you will experience an immediate dilution of the aggregate NAV of your shares.
In the event we issue subscription rights, stockholders who do not fully exercise their subscription rights should expect that they will, at the completion of a rights offering, own a smaller proportional interest in us than would otherwise be the case if they fully exercised their rights. We cannot state precisely the amount of any such dilution in share ownership because we do not know at this time what proportion of the shares will be purchased as a result of such rights offering.
In addition, if the subscription price is less than the NAV per share of our common stock, then our stockholders would experience an immediate dilution of the aggregate NAV of their shares as a result of the offering. The amount of any decrease in NAV is not predictable because it is not known at this time what the subscription price and NAV per share will be on the expiration date of a rights offering or what proportion of the shares will be purchased as a result of such rights offering. Such dilution could be substantial.
The trading market or market value of our publicly issued debt securities may fluctuate.
Our publicly issued debt securities may or may not have, and may never develop, an established trading market. In addition to our creditworthiness, many factors may materially adversely affect the trading market for, and market value of, our publicly issued debt securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:
•
the time remaining to the maturity of these debt securities;
•
the outstanding principal amount of debt securities with terms identical to these debt securities;
•
the ratings assigned by national statistical ratings agencies;
•
the general economic environment;
•
the supply of debt securities trading in the secondary market, if any;
•
the redemption or repayment features, if any, of these debt securities;
•
the level, direction and volatility of market interest rates generally; and
•
market rates of interest higher or lower than rates borne by the debt securities. You should also be aware that there may be a limited number of buyers when you decide to sell your debt securities. This too may materially adversely affect the market value of the debt securities or the trading market for the debt securities.
The 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we have currently incurred or may incur in the future.
The 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes are not secured by any of our assets or any of the assets of our subsidiaries. As a result, while the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes remain senior in priority to our equity securities, they are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we or our subsidiaries have currently incurred and may incur in the future (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries may assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness in order to receive full payment of their indebtedness before the assets may be used to pay other creditors, including the holders of the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes.
The 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries.
The 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes are obligations exclusively of Hercules Capital, Inc. and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries are or act as guarantors of the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes. Furthermore, the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we may acquire or create in the future. Our secured indebtedness with respect to the SBA debentures is held through our SBIC subsidiary. The assets of any such subsidiary are not directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors, including holders of the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes.
Except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors (including holders of preferred stock, if any, of our subsidiaries) will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. As a result of not having a direct claim against any of our subsidiaries, the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish as financing vehicles or otherwise. In addition, our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, all of which would be structurally senior to the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes.
The respective indentures under which the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes were issued contain limited protections for the holders of the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes.
The indenture under which 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes were issued offers limited protections to the holders of the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes. The terms of the respective indentures and the 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes do not restrict our or any of our subsidiaries’ ability to engage in, or otherwise be a party to, a variety of corporate transactions, circumstances or events that could have an adverse impact on an investment in the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, or 2022 Convertible Notes. In particular, the terms of the respective indentures and the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes do not place any restrictions on our or our subsidiaries’ ability to:
•
issue securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, including (1) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be equal in right of payment to the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, or 2022 Convertible Notes, (2) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured and therefore rank effectively senior in right of payment to the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, or 2022 Convertible Notes to the extent of the values of the assets securing such debt, (3) indebtedness of ours that is guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries and which therefore would rank structurally senior to the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, or 2022 Convertible Notes and (4) securities, indebtedness or other obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior in right of payment to our equity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore would rank structurally senior in right of payment to the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, or 2022 Convertible Notes with respect to the assets of our subsidiaries, in each case other than an incurrence of indebtedness or other obligation that would cause a violation of Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, whether or not we continue to be subject to such provisions of the 1940 Act, but giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC (currently, these provisions generally prohibit us from making additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt or the sale of additional debt securities, unless our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% thereafter after such borrowings);
•
pay distributions on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities ranking junior in right of payment to the 2022 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, or 2022 Convertible Notes, in each case other than distributions, purchases, redemptions or payments that would cause a violation of Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, giving effect to (i) any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC and (ii) no-action relief granted by the SEC to another BDC (or to us if we determine to seek such similar no-action or other relief) permitting the BDC to declare any cash distribution notwithstanding the prohibition contained in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act in order to maintain the BDC’s status as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code (currently, these provisions generally prohibit us from declaring any cash dividend or distribution upon any class of our capital stock, or purchasing any such capital stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the
1940 Act, is below 150% at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the purchase and after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase);
•
sell assets (other than certain limited restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets);
•
enter into transactions with affiliates;
•
create liens (including liens on the shares of our subsidiaries) or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;
•
make investments; or
•
create restrictions on the payment of distributions or other amounts to us from our subsidiaries.
In addition, the indenture and the April 2025 Notes and 2033 Notes do not require us to purchase the April 2025 Notes or 2033 Notes in connection with a change of control or any other event.
Furthermore, the terms of the respective indentures and the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes do not protect their respective holders in the event that we experience changes (including significant adverse changes) in our financial condition, results of operations or credit ratings, as they do not require that we or our subsidiaries adhere to any financial tests or ratios or specified levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flow or liquidity, except as required under the 1940 Act.
Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes may have important consequences for their holders, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes or negatively affecting their trading value.
Certain of our current debt instruments include more protections for their respective holders than the indenture and 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes. See “-In addition to regulatory requirements that restrict our ability to raise capital, our 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, and Credit Facilities contain various covenants which, if not complied with, could require accelerated repayment under the facility or require us to repurchase the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, or 2022 Convertible Notes thereby materially and adversely affecting our liquidity, financial condition, results of operations and ability to pay distributions.” In addition, other debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its holders than the respective indentures and the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes, including additional covenants and events of default. The issuance or incurrence of any such debt with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels and prices of the 2022 Notes, April 2025 Notes, 2033 Notes, and 2022 Convertible Notes.
An active trading market for the April 2025 Notes or 2033 Notes may not develop or be sustained, which could limit the market price of the April 2025 Notes or 2033 Notes or your ability to sell them.
Although the April 2025 Notes and 2033 Notes are listed on the NYSE under the symbols “HCXZ” and “HCXY,” respectively, we cannot provide any assurances that an active trading market will develop or be sustained for the April 2025 Notes or 2033 Notes or that the April 2025 Notes or 2033 Notes will be able to be sold. At various times, the April 2025 Notes or 2033 Notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our credit ratings, general economic conditions, our financial condition, performance and prospects and other factors. To the extent an active trading market is not sustained, the liquidity and trading price for the April 2025 Notes or 2033 Notes may be harmed.
If we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we may not be able to make payments on the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, or 2028 Asset-Backed Notes.
Any default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including a default under the Wells Facility, the Union Bank Facility, 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, 2028 Asset-Backed Notes or other indebtedness to which we may be a party, that is not waived by the required lenders or holders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness, could make us unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on any of our indebtedness, including the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, or 2028 Asset-Backed Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, and 2028 Asset-Backed Notes. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under the Wells Facility and the Union Bank Facility or other debt we may incur in the future could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If our operating performance declines, we may in the future need to seek to obtain waivers from the required lenders under the Wells Facility or Union Bank Facility or the required holders of our 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, 2028 Asset-Backed Notes or other debt that we may incur in the future to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under the Wells Facility, Union Bank Facility, 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, 2028 Asset-Backed Notes or other debt and seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or holders. If this occurs, we would be in default under the Wells Facility, Union Bank Facility, 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, 2028 Asset-Backed Notes or other debt, the lenders or holders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we are unable to repay debt, lenders having secured obligations, including the lenders under the Wells Facility and the Union Bank Facility, could proceed against the collateral securing the debt. Because the Wells Facility and the Union Bank Facility have, and any future credit facilities will likely have, customary cross-default provisions, if the indebtedness under the 2022 Notes, July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, April 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, March 2026 A Notes, 2033 Notes, 2022 Convertible Notes, 2027 Asset-Backed Notes, 2028 Asset-Backed Notes, Wells Facility, Union Bank Facility or under any future credit facility is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due.
We may not be able to prepay the July 2024, February 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes, or March 2026 A Notes upon a change in control.
The Note Purchase Agreements governing the July 2024 Notes, February 2025 Notes, June 2025 Notes and March 2026 A Notes require us to offer to prepay all of the issued and outstanding notes upon a change in control and election by the holders, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A change in control under the Note Purchase Agreements occurs upon the consummation of a transaction which results in a “person” or “group” (as those terms are used in the Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of our outstanding voting stock.
Upon a change in control event, holders of the notes may require us to prepay for cash some or all of the notes at a prepayment price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of prepayment. If a change in control were to occur, we may not have sufficient funds to prepay any such accelerated indebtedness.
General Risk Factors
The effects of the outbreak of COVID-19 have negatively affected the global economy and the United States economy, and may disrupt our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The ongoing COVID-19 global and national health emergency has caused, and may continue to cause, significant disruption in the United States and global economies and financial markets. The spread of COVID-19 has caused quarantines, cancellation of
events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. The COVID-19 outbreak may disrupt our operations through its impact on our employees, our portfolio companies and their businesses, and certain industries in which our portfolio companies operate. Disruptions to our portfolio companies may impair their ability to fulfill their obligations to us and could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, declining collateral values associated with our existing loans, and impairments or losses on our loans. Further, the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak has caused severe disruptions in the United States economy and may materially disrupt financial activity generally and in the areas in which we operate. This would likely result in a decline in demand for our loans which would negatively impact our liquidity position and our growth strategy. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, consolidated financial condition, and consolidated results of operations. We are taking precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees. However, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be deemed to be adequate or appropriate, nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employees’ ability to service the portfolio. In the earlier part of the 2020, the U.S. capital markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption following the COVID-19 pandemic, which appear to have subsided and returned to pre-COVID-19 levels by the later part of the year. Nonetheless, certain economists and major investment banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the virus globally could lead to a prolonged period of world-wide economic downturn.
On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which contains provisions intended to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic. On December 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted further legislation intended to make additional funding available to mitigate the adverse economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic (the “December 2020 COVID Relief Package”). It is uncertain to what extent our portfolio companies will be able to benefit from the CARES Act, the December 2020 COVID Relief Package, or any other subsequent legislation intended to provide financial relief or assistance. The new U.S. presidential administration has demonstrated willingness to more actively address the economic effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic through government intervention, but it is unclear to what extent such intervention will occur and whether it will be successful. As a result of this disruption and the pressures on their liquidity, certain of our portfolio companies have been, or may continue to be, incentivized to draw on most, if not all, of the unfunded portion of any revolving or delayed draw term loans made by us, subject to availability under the terms of such loans.
The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened over the winter months as people in the U.S. spend more time indoors where the virus can spread more easily. In addition, more contagious, and possibly more virulent, variants of COVID-19 have emerged and are spreading within the U.S. Although the process of distributing vaccines for COVID-19 has begun, the vaccine is currently available only to certain populations as supply and distribution sites remain limited. The ultimate success of the COVID-19 vaccination rollout in the U.S. will depend on many factors beyond our control, including the coordination of federal, state and local officials and private companies; the granting of FDA Emergency Use Authorization of new vaccines and increased production of currently authorized vaccines; widespread public acceptance of vaccination programs; and the effectiveness of the vaccines against new strains of COVID-19. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, an extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption could materially affect our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend to a large extent on future developments regarding the duration and severity of the coronavirus, effectiveness of vaccination deployment and the actions taken by governments (including stimulus measures or the lack thereof) and their citizens to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control. An extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption could materially affect our business, results of operations, access to sources of liquidity and financial condition. Given the fluidity of the situation, we cannot estimate the long-term impact of COVID-19 on our business, future results of operations, financial position, or cash flows at this time.
We may be the target of litigation.
We may be the target of securities litigation in the future, particularly if the trading price of our common stock and our debt securities fluctuates significantly. We could also generally be subject to litigation, including derivative actions by our stockholders. Any litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources from our business and cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Acquisitions or investments that we may pursue could be unsuccessful, consume significant resources and require the incurrence of additional indebtedness.
We regularly consider acquisitions and investments that complement our existing business. These possible acquisitions and investments involve or may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and expenses that could have a material effect on our financial condition and operating results.
In particular, if we incur additional debt, our liquidity and financial stability could be impaired as a result of using a significant portion of available cash or borrowing capacity to finance an acquisition. Moreover, we may face an increase in interest expense or financial leverage if additional debt is incurred to finance an acquisition, which may, among other things, adversely affect our various financial ratios and our compliance with the conditions of our existing indebtedness. In addition, such additional indebtedness may be secured by liens on our assets.
Acquisitions involve numerous other risks, including:
•
diversion of management time and attention;
•
failures to identify material problems and liabilities of acquisition targets or to obtain sufficient indemnification rights to fully offset possible liabilities related to the acquired businesses;
•
difficulties integrating the operations, technologies and personnel of the acquired businesses;
•
inefficiencies and complexities that may arise due to unfamiliarity with new assets, businesses or markets;
•
disruptions to our ongoing business;
•
inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets which would reduce future reported earnings;
•
the inability to obtain required financing for the new acquisition or investment opportunities and our existing business;
•
the need or obligation to divest portions of an acquired business;
•
challenges associated with operating in new geographic regions;
•
difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects;
•
potential loss of our or the acquired business’ key employees, contractual relationships, suppliers or customers; and
•
inability to obtain required regulatory approvals.
To the extent we pursue an acquisition that causes us to incur unexpected costs or that fails to generate expected returns, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected, and our ability to service indebtedness, including our outstanding notes, may be negatively impacted.
In addition, we may fail in our pursuit of an acquisition and, instead, one of our competitors may successfully obtain the target and deprive us of an important opportunity and allow them to grow larger giving them the ability to have a lower cost of capital and competitive advantage in the market (including by being able to offer better pricing and larger loans) and, as a larger company, potentially giving them more valuable equity currency to do other transactions.
We may be unable to obtain debt capital on favorable terms or at all, in which case we would not be able to use leverage to increase the return on our investments.
If we are unable to obtain debt capital, then our equity investors will not benefit from the potential for increased returns on equity resulting from leverage to the extent that our investment strategy is successful and we may be limited in our ability to make new commitments or fundings to our portfolio companies. An inability to obtain debt capital may also limit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness, particularly during periods of adverse credit market conditions when refinancing indebtedness may not be available under interest rates and other terms acceptable to us or at all.
FATCA withholding may apply to payments made to certain foreign entities.
The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act provisions of the Code and the related Treasury Regulations and other administrative guidance promulgated thereunder, or collectively, FATCA, generally requires us to withhold U.S. tax (at a 30% rate) on payments of interest and taxable dividends made to a foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity (including such an institution or entity acting as an intermediary) unless the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity complies with certain information reporting, withholding, identification, certification and related requirements imposed by FATCA. Persons located in jurisdictions that have entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States to implement FATCA may be subject to different rules. Stockholders may be requested to provide additional information to enable us to determine whether such withholding is required.
Legislative or regulatory tax changes could adversely affect you.
At any time, the U.S. federal income tax laws governing RICs or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be amended. Any of those new laws, regulations or interpretations may take effect retroactively and could adversely affect the taxation of us or of you as a stockholder. Therefore, changes in tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations or any amendments thereto could diminish the value of an investment in our shares or the value or the resale potential of our investments.
If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.
Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations.
In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm (when undertaken, as noted below), may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our consolidated financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors and lenders to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.
Changes in laws or regulations governing our business could negatively affect the profitability of our operations.
Changes in the laws or regulations, or the interpretations of the laws and regulations, which govern business development companies, SBICs, RICs or non-depository commercial lenders could significantly affect our operations and our cost of doing business. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, in addition to applicable foreign and international laws and regulations, and are subject to judicial and administrative decisions that affect our operations, including our loan originations maximum interest rates, fees and other charges, disclosures to portfolio companies, the terms of secured transactions, collection and foreclosure procedures, and other trade practices. If these laws, regulations or decisions change, or if we expand our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent requirements than those in which we currently conduct business, then we may have to incur significant expenses in order to comply or we may have to restrict our operations. In addition, if we do not comply with applicable laws, regulations and decisions, then we may lose licenses needed for the conduct of our business and be subject to civil fines and criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business results of operations or financial condition.
Economic sanction laws in the United States and other jurisdictions may prohibit us and our affiliates from transacting with certain countries, individuals and companies.
Economic sanction laws in the United States and other jurisdictions may prohibit us or our affiliates from transacting with certain countries, individuals and companies. In the United States, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control administers and enforces laws, executive orders and regulations establishing U.S. economic and trade sanctions, which prohibit, among other things, transactions with, and the provision of services to, certain non-U.S. countries, territories, entities and individuals. These types of sanctions may significantly restrict or completely prohibit investment activities in certain jurisdictions, and if we, our portfolio companies or other issuers in which we invest were to violate any such laws or regulations, we may face significant legal and monetary penalties.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, as well as anti-boycott regulations, may also apply to and restrict our activities, our portfolio companies and other issuers of our investments. If an issuer or we were to violate any such laws or regulations, such issuer or we may face significant legal and monetary penalties. The U.S. government has indicated that it is particularly focused on FCPA enforcement, which may increase the risk that an issuer or us becomes the subject of such actual or threatened enforcement. In addition, certain commentators have suggested that private investment firms and the funds that they manage may face increased scrutiny and/or liability with respect to the activities of their underlying portfolio companies. As such, a violation of the FCPA or other applicable regulations by us or an issuer of our portfolio investments could have a material adverse effect on us. We are committed to complying with the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, as well as anti-boycott regulations, to which we are subject. As a result, we may be adversely affected because of our unwillingness to enter into transactions that violate any such laws or regulations.
Uncertainty about presidential administration initiatives could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
It is unclear whether the new U.S. presidential administration will propose or implement significant changes to U.S. trade, healthcare, immigration, foreign and government regulatory policy. In this regard, there is significant uncertainty with respect to legislation, regulation and government policy at the federal level, as well as the state and local levels. There has been a corresponding meaningful increase in the uncertainty surrounding interest rates, inflation, foreign exchange rates, trade volumes and fiscal and monetary policy. Recent events, including the 2020 U.S. presidential election, have created a climate of heightened uncertainty and introduced new and difficult-to-quantify macroeconomic and political risks with potentially far-reaching implications. To the extent the U.S. Congress or the presidential administration implements changes to U.S. policy, those changes may impact, among other things, the U.S. and global economy, international trade and relations, unemployment, immigration, corporate taxes, healthcare, the U.S. regulatory environment, inflation and other areas. Although we cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Until we know what policy changes are made and how those changes impact our business and the business of our competitors over the long term, we will not know if, overall, we will benefit from them or be negatively affected by them.
Our business is subject to increasingly complex corporate governance, public disclosure and accounting requirements that could adversely affect our business and financial results.
We are subject to changing rules and regulations of federal and state government as well as the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed. These entities, including the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the SEC and the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, have issued a significant number of new and increasingly complex requirements and regulations over the course of the last several years and continue to develop additional regulations and requirements in response to laws enacted by Congress. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Protection Act, as amended, or the Dodd-Frank Act, contains significant corporate governance and executive compensation-related provisions, and the SEC has adopted, and will continue to adopt, additional rules and regulations that may impact us. Our efforts to comply with these requirements have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, an increase in expenses and a diversion of management’s time from other business activities. While we cannot predict what effect any changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on our business as a result of recent financial reform legislation, these changes could be materially adverse to us and our stockholders.
In addition, our failure to maintain compliance with such rules, or for our management to appropriately address issues relating to our compliance with such rules fully and in a timely manner, exposes us to an increasing risk of inadvertent non-compliance. While our management team takes reasonable efforts to ensure that we are in full compliance with all laws applicable to its operations, the increasing rate and extent of regulatory change increases the risk of a failure to comply, which may result in our ability to operate our business in the ordinary course or may subject us to potential fines, regulatory findings or other matters that may materially impact our business.
We incur significant costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.
As a publicly traded company, we incur legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with the periodic reporting requirements applicable to a company whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act as well as additional corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules implemented by the SEC.
Results may fluctuate and may not be indicative of future performance.
Our operating results may fluctuate and, therefore, you should not rely on current or historical period results to be indicative of our performance in future reporting periods. Factors that could cause operating results to fluctuate include, but are not limited to, variations in the investment origination volume and fee income earned, changes in the accrual status of our debt investments, variations in timing of prepayments, variations in and the timing of the recognition of net realized gains or losses and changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation, the level of our expenses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets, and general economic conditions.
We face cyber-security risks and the failure in cyber security systems, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems and management continuity planning could impair our ability to conduct business effectively.
Our business operations rely upon secure information technology systems for data processing, storage and reporting. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation and updating, our information technology systems could become subject to cyber-attacks. Network, system, application and data breaches could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
The occurrence of a disaster such as a cyber-attack, a natural catastrophe, an industrial accident, a terrorist attack or war, events unanticipated in our disaster recovery systems, or a support failure from external providers, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those events affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval systems or destroy data. If a significant number of our managers were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct our business could be severely compromised.
We depend heavily upon computer systems to perform necessary business functions. Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our computer systems could be subject to cyber-attacks and unauthorized access, such as physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering. Like other companies, we may experience threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, system failures and disruptions. If one or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs, regulatory penalties and/or customer dissatisfaction or loss.
In addition, the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. Furthermore, cybersecurity has become a top priority for regulators around the world, and some jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify individuals of data security breaches involving certain types of personal data. If we fail to comply with the relevant laws and regulations, we could suffer financial losses, a disruption of our businesses, liability to investors, regulatory intervention or reputational damage.
Terrorist attacks, acts of war, natural disasters or pandemics may affect any market for our securities, impact the businesses in which we invest and harm our business, operating results and financial condition.
Terrorist acts, acts of war, natural disasters or pandemics may disrupt our operations, as well as the operations of the businesses in which we invest. Such acts have created, and continue to create, economic and political uncertainties and have contributed to global economic instability. Future terrorist activities, military or security operations, natural disasters or pandemics could further weaken the domestic/global economies and create additional uncertainties, which may negatively impact the businesses in which we invest directly or indirectly and, in turn, could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Losses from terrorist attacks, natural disasters and pandemics are generally uninsurable.
We are dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which may, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay distributions.
Our business is dependent on our and third parties’ communications and information systems. Any failure or interruption of those systems, including as a result of the termination of an agreement with any third-party service providers, could cause delays or other problems in our activities. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control and adversely affect our business. There could be:
•
sudden electrical or telecommunication outages;
•
natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and hurricanes;
•
disease pandemics;
•
events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and
•
cyber-attacks.
These events, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders.
We may be subject to restrictions on our ability to make distributions to our stockholders.
Restrictions imposed on the declaration of dividends or other distributions to holders of our common stock, by both the 1940 Act and by requirements imposed by rating agencies, might impair our ability to make the required distributions to our stockholders in order to be subject to tax as a RIC. While we intend to prepay our Notes and other debt to the extent necessary to enable us to distribute our income as required to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, there can be no assurance that such actions can be effected in time or in a manner to satisfy the requirements set forth in the Code.
Downgrades of the U.S. credit rating, automatic spending cuts or another government shutdown could negatively impact our liquidity, financial condition and earnings.
U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit concerns have increased the possibility of additional credit-rating downgrades and economic slowdowns, or a recession in the U.S. Although U.S. lawmakers passed legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling on multiple occasions, ratings agencies have lowered or threatened to lower the long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States. The impact of this or any further downgrades to the U.S. government’s sovereign credit rating or its perceived creditworthiness could adversely affect the U.S. and global financial markets and economic conditions. These developments could cause interest rates and borrowing costs to rise, which may negatively impact our ability to access the debt markets on favorable terms.
In addition, disagreement over the federal budget has caused the U.S. federal government to shut down for periods of time resulting in, among other things, inadequate funding for and/or the shutdown of certain government agencies, including the SEC, SBA, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, on which the operation of our business may rely. Inadequate funding for and/or the shutdown of these government agencies prevents them from performing their normal business functions, which could impact, among other things, (i) our and our portfolio companies’ ability to access the public markets and obtain necessary capital in order to, among other things, properly capitalize, continue or expand operations, or, in the case of portfolio investments held by us, liquidate such investments; (ii) our ability to originate SBA loans; and (iii) the ability of the FDA and other governmental agencies to timely review and process regulatory submissions of our portfolio companies. Continued adverse political and economic conditions, including a prolonged U.S. federal government shutdown, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder the execution of our investment strategy or impact our stock price.
Stockholder activism, which could take many forms, including making public demands that we consider certain strategic alternatives, engaging in public campaigns to attempt to influence our corporate governance and/or our management, and commencing proxy contests to attempt to elect the activists’ representatives or others to our Board of Directors, or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in the BDC industry recently. While we are currently not subject to any stockholder activism, due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may in the future become the target of stockholder activism. Stockholder activism could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and our Board of Directors’ attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such stockholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future and adversely affect our relationships with service providers and our portfolio companies. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal and other expenses related to any activist stockholder matters. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any stockholder activism.
Capital markets may experience periods of disruption and instability and we cannot predict when these conditions will occur. Such market conditions could materially and adversely affect debt and equity capital markets in the United States and abroad, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The global capital markets have experienced a period of disruption as evidenced by a lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets, write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk and the failure of certain major financial institutions. While the capital markets have improved, these conditions could deteriorate again in the future. During such market disruptions, we may have difficulty raising debt or equity capital, especially as a result of regulatory constraints.
Market conditions may in the future make it difficult to extend the maturity of or refinance our existing indebtedness and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. The illiquidity of our investments may make it difficult for us to sell such investments if required.
As a result, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we have recorded our investments. In addition, significant changes in the capital markets, including the disruption and volatility, have had, and may in the future have, a negative effect on the valuations of our investments and on the potential for liquidity events involving our investments. An inability to raise capital, and any required sale of our investments for liquidity purposes, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Various social and political tensions in the United States and around the world, including in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Russia, may continue to contribute to increased market volatility, may have long-term effects on the United States and worldwide financial markets, and may cause further economic uncertainties or deterioration in the United States and worldwide. In addition, continuing uncertainty arising from the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union, or Brexit, could lead to further market disruptions and currency volatility, potentially weakening consumer, corporate and financial confidence and resulting in lower economic growth for companies that rely significantly on Europe for their business activities and revenues. In December 2020, the United Kingdom reached the end of the transition period which followed its exit from the European Union on January 31, 2020. The new Trade and Cooperation Agreement reached between the European Union and United Kingdom in late 2020 is untested and may lead to ongoing political and economic uncertainty and periods of exacerbated volatility in both the United Kingdom and in wider European and global markets for some time. Although the United Kingdom officially left the European Union on January 31, 2020, the withdrawal agreement setting forth the terms of the United Kingdom’s departure allowed for a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020. The longer term economic, legal, political and social implications of Brexit are unclear at this stage. Brexit has led to ongoing political and economic uncertainty and periods of increased volatility in both the United Kingdom and in wider European markets for some time. We may in the future have difficulty accessing debt and equity capital markets, and a severe disruption in the global financial markets, deterioration in credit and financing conditions or uncertainty regarding U.S. government spending and deficit levels, Brexit or other global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
The broader fundamentals of the United States economy remain mixed. In the event that the United States economy contracts, it is likely that the financial results of small to mid-sized companies, like many of our portfolio companies, could experience deterioration or limited growth from current levels, which could ultimately lead to difficulty in meeting their debt service requirements and an increase in defaults. In addition, declines in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect the credit quality of our debt investments and the underlying operating performance of our equity investments in energy-related businesses.
In addition, volatility in the equity markets could impact our portfolio companies’ access to the debt and equity capital markets, which could ultimately limit their ability to grow, satisfy existing financing and other arrangements and impact their ability to perform. Volatility in the equity markets could also impact our ability to liquidate or achieve value from warrants and other equity investments we have in our portfolio companies. Consequently, we can provide no assurance that the performance of certain portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by economic cycles, industry cycles or other conditions, which could also have a negative impact on our future results.
These market and economic disruptions affect, and these and other similar market and economic disruptions may in the future affect, the U.S. capital markets, which could adversely affect our business and that of our portfolio companies. We cannot predict the duration of the effects related to these or similar events in the future on the United States economy and securities markets or on our investments. We monitor developments and seek to manage our investments in a manner consistent with achieving our investment objective, but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so.
