Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Management of V.F. Corporation (“VF”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). VF’s management conducted an assessment of VF's internal control over financial reporting based on the framework described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, VF’s management has determined that VF’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of March 28, 2020.
The effectiveness of VF’s internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2020 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of V. F. Corporation
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of V. F. Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity and of cash flows for the years ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, and for the year ended December 30, 2017, including the related notes and financial statement schedule for the years ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, and for the year ended December 30, 2017 listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)2 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended March 28, 2020 and March 30, 2019, for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, and for the year ended December 30, 2017 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 28, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Changes in Accounting Principles
As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases on March 31, 2019 and the manner in which it accounts for revenues from contracts with customers on April 1, 2018.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Goodwill Impairment Analysis - Timberland Reporting Unit
As described in Notes 1, 9 and 23 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $1,156.0 million as of March 28, 2020, and total goodwill associated with the Timberland reporting unit was $409.1 million. In the year ended March 28, 2020, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $323.2 million related to the Timberland reporting unit. Management evaluates goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be below its carrying amount. The impairment analysis involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including the goodwill assigned to that reporting unit. . As disclosed by management, the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both income-based and market-based valuation methods. Fair value of a reporting unit using the income-based method is based on management’s estimate of forecasted future cash flows, which included significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, the terminal growth rate, tax rates and the discount rate. Fair value of a reporting unit using the market-based methods includes analyzing actual transaction prices and revenue/earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit, as well as evaluating market multiples of revenues and EBITDA for a group of comparable public companies.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment analysis for the Timberland reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting unit, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort was involved in performing procedures and evaluating management’s future cash flow projections and assumptions, including revenue growth rates, the terminal growth rate, the discount rate, and market multiples of revenues and EBITDA for a group of target and comparable public companies, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment analysis, including controls over the valuation of the Company’s reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the Timberland reporting unit, evaluating the appropriateness of the income-based and market-based valuation methods, testing the completeness, accuracy and relevance of underlying data used in the methods, and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, including revenue growth rates, the terminal growth rate, the discount rate, and market multiples of revenues and EBITDA for a group of target and comparable public companies. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to revenue growth rates, the terminal growth rate, the discount rate, and market multiples of revenues and EBITDA for a group of target and comparable public companies involved assessing whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the Company’s income-based and market-based valuation methods and certain assumptions, including the discount rate and applicable market multiples of revenues and EBITDA for a group of target and comparable public companies.
Tax-Free Determination of the Divestiture of the Jeans Business
As described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on May 22, 2019, the Company completed the spin-off of its Jeans business, which included the Wrangler®, Lee® and Rock & Republic® brands, as well as the VF Outlet™ business, into an independent, publicly traded company. The spin-off was effected through a stock distribution to VF shareholders. As disclosed by management, the divestiture of the Jeans business was determined to qualify for tax-free treatment under certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code. The determination of the transaction as tax-free requires management to make significant judgments about the interpretation of tax laws and regulations. This determination is the subject of periodic U.S. and international tax audits. Unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the tax-free determination of the divestiture of the Jeans business is a critical audit matter are (i) there was significant judgment by management with regards to interpretation of the facts and the application of tax laws and regulations in order to conclude that the divestiture would qualify as a tax-free transaction, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort was involved in performing procedures and evaluating the facts and assumptions made by management in connection with the tax-free determination, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these procedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the divestiture of the
VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K
Jeans business, including controls over the key assumptions relating to the determination of the tax-free treatment of the transaction. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating the information, including opinions of third-party tax advisors, tax laws and regulations and other relevant documents, used by management to support the Company’s position that the transaction qualified for tax-free treatment and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assumptions and interpretation of the tax laws and regulations by comparing to the determinations reached for similar transactions by comparable companies. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the transaction, related assumptions and certain representations made by management, as well as management’s application of the relevant tax laws and regulations.

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business
VF Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, collectively known as “VF” or the "Company”) is a global apparel, footwear and accessories company based in the United States. VF designs, procures, produces, markets and distributes a variety of branded products, including outerwear, footwear, apparel, backpacks, luggage and accessories for consumers of all ages. Products are marketed primarily under VF-owned brand names.
Basis of Presentation
The consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of VF and its controlled subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances.
On January 21, 2020, VF announced its decision to explore the divestiture of its Occupational Workwear business. The Occupational Workwear business is comprised primarily of the following brands and businesses: Red Kap®, VF Solutions®, Bulwark®, Workrite®, Walls®, Terra®, Kodiak®, Work Authority® and Horace Small®. The business also includes certain Dickies® occupational workwear products that have historically been sold through the business-to-business channel. During the three months ended March 2020, the Company determined that the Occupational Workwear business met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria and expects to divest this business in the next twelve months. Accordingly, the Company has reported the results of the Occupational Workwear business and the related cash flows as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively. The related held-for-sale assets and liabilities have been reported as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These changes have been applied to all periods presented.
On May 22, 2019, VF completed the spin-off of its Jeans business, which included the Wrangler®, Lee® and Rock & Republic® brands, as well as the VF OutletTM business, into an independent, publicly traded company. As a result, VF reported the operating results for the Jeans business and the related cash flows as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively. In addition, the related assets and liabilities have been reported as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, through the date the spin-off was completed. These changes have been applied to all periods presented.
The Nautica® brand business sold on April 30, 2018 and the Licensing Business (which comprised the Licensed Sports Group and JanSport® brand collegiate businesses) sold during the year ended December 2017 have been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively. These changes have been applied to all periods presented.
Unless otherwise noted, discussion within these notes to the consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on discontinued operations.
Fiscal Year
VF operates and reports using a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31 of each year. VF previously used a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to December 31 of each year. VF's current fiscal year ran from March 31, 2019 through March 28, 2020 ("Fiscal 2020"). All references to the periods ended March 2020, March 2019 and December 2017 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended March 28, 2020, March 30, 2019 ("Fiscal 2019") and December 30, 2017, respectively. All references to the period ended March 2018 relate to the 13-week transition period ended March 31, 2018. Certain foreign subsidiaries reported using a December 31 year-end for the year ended December 2017 and using a March 31 year-end for Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019 due to local statutory requirements. The impact to VF's consolidated financial statements is not material.
Use of Estimates
In preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The duration and severity of the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic and its impact on VF's business is subject to uncertainty; however, the estimates and assumptions made by management include those related to the COVID-19 impact based on available information. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction
The financial statements of most foreign subsidiaries are measured using the foreign currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the period. Resulting translation gains and losses, and transaction gains and losses on long-term advances to foreign subsidiaries, are reported in other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”).
Foreign currency transactions are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a particular entity. These transactions generally result in receivables or payables that are fixed in the foreign currency. Transaction gains or losses arise when exchange rate fluctuations either increase or decrease the functional currency cash flows from the originally recorded transaction. As discussed in Note 24, VF enters into derivative contracts to manage foreign currency risk on certain of these transactions. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, net of the related hedging losses and gains, were a gain of $2.9 million in the year ended March 2020, a loss of $9.3 million in the year ended March 2019, a gain of $4.4 million in the three months ended March 2018 and a loss of $1.6 million in the year ended December 2017.
Cash and Equivalents
Cash and equivalents are demand deposits, receivables from third-party credit card processors and highly liquid investments that mature within three months of their purchase dates. Cash equivalents totaling $1.2 billion and $256.3 million at March 2020
VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K
VF CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
March 2020
and 2019, respectively, consist of money market funds and short-term time deposits.
Accounts Receivable
Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard at the beginning of Fiscal 2019, trade accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts, less contractual allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs and discounts. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, trade accounts receivable were recorded at invoiced amounts, less estimated allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs, discounts, markdowns, chargebacks and returns as discussed below in the "Revenue Recognition" section. Royalty receivables are recorded at amounts earned based on the licensees’ sales of licensed products, subject in some cases to contractual minimum royalties due from individual licensees. VF maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that will result from the inability of customers and licensees to make required payments. The allowance is determined based on review of specific customer accounts where collection is doubtful, as well as an assessment of the collectability of total receivables considering the aging of balances, historical and anticipated trends and current economic conditions. All accounts are subject to ongoing review of ultimate collectability. Receivables are written off against the allowance when it is probable the amounts will not be recovered.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined on the first-in, first-out method and is net of discounts or rebates received from vendors. Management performs an evaluation to estimate net realizable value using a systematic and consistent methodology of forecasting future demand, market conditions and selling prices less costs of disposal. If the estimated net realizable value is less than cost, VF provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold. Historically, these estimates of future demand and selling prices have not varied significantly from actual results due to VF’s timely identification and ability to rapidly dispose of these distressed inventories.
Long-lived Assets, Including Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill are initially recorded at cost. VF capitalizes improvements to property, plant and equipment that substantially extend the useful life of the asset, and interest cost incurred during construction of major assets. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
Cost for acquired intangible assets represents the fair value at acquisition date, which is generally based on the present value of expected cash flows. Trademark intangible assets represent individual acquired trademarks, some of which are registered in multiple countries. Customer relationship intangible assets are based on the value of relationships with wholesale customers in place at the time of acquisition.
Goodwill represents the excess of cost of an acquired business over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is assigned at the reporting unit level.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, ranging from 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment and up to 40 years for buildings. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements and assets under finance leases is recognized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease terms, and is included in depreciation expense.
Intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives, consisting of major trademarks and trade names, are not amortized. Other intangible assets determined to have a finite life primarily consist of customer relationships, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from 10 to 24 years using an accelerated method consistent with the timing of benefits expected to be received.
Depreciation and amortization expense related to producing or otherwise obtaining finished goods inventories is included in cost of goods sold, and other depreciation and amortization expense is included in selling, general and administrative expenses.
VF’s policy is to review property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If forecasted pre-tax undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset are not expected to recover the asset’s carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value.
VF’s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. VF may first assess qualitative factors as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative impairment testing. If VF determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an asset or reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then no further testing is required. Otherwise, the assets must be quantitatively tested for impairment.
An indefinite-lived intangible asset is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset with its carrying value. An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.
Goodwill is quantitatively evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value, including the goodwill assigned to that reporting unit. An impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.

Leases
VF determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception and determines its classification as an operating or finance lease at lease commencement. The Company leases certain retail locations, office space, distribution facilities, machinery and equipment, and vehicles. While the substantial majority of these leases are operating leases, one of VF's distribution centers is a finance lease.
Leases for real estate typically have initial terms ranging from 3 to 15 years, generally with renewal options. Leases for equipment typically have initial terms ranging from 2 to 5 years and vehicle leases typically have initial terms ranging from 1 to 8 years. In determining the lease term used in the lease right-of-use asset and lease liability calculations, the Company considers various factors such as market conditions and the terms of any renewal or termination options that may exist. When deemed reasonably certain, the renewal and termination options are included in the determination of the lease term and calculation of the lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.
Most leases have fixed rental payments. Many of the real estate leases also require additional variable payments for occupancy-related costs, real estate taxes and insurance, as well as other payments (i.e., contingent rent) owed when sales at individual retail store locations exceed a stated base amount. Variable lease payments are excluded from the measurement of the lease liability and are recognized in profit and loss in the period in which the event or conditions that triggers those payments occur.
VF estimates the amount it expects to pay to the lessor under a residual value guarantee and includes it in lease payments used to measure the lease liability only for amounts probable of being owed by VF at the commencement date.
VF calculates lease liabilities as the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Lease right-of-use assets are calculated based on the initial measurement of the respective lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made to the lessor at or before the commencement date, lease incentives received and initial direct costs incurred. When readily determinable, the Company uses the implicit rate to determine the present value of lease payments, which generally does not happen in practice. As the rate implicit in the majority of the Company's leases is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date, including the lease term, currency, country specific risk premium and adjustments for collateralized debt.
Operating lease expense is recorded as a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, right-of-use asset amortization and interest on lease liabilities are presented separately in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
The Company assesses whether a sale leaseback transaction qualifies as a sale when the transaction occurs. For transactions qualifying as a sale, VF derecognizes the underlying asset and recognizes the entire gain or loss at the time of the sale. The corresponding lease entered into with the buyer-lessor is accounted for as an operating lease. During the year ended March 2020, the Company entered into a sale leaseback transaction for certain office real estate and related assets. The transaction qualified as a sale, and thus the Company recognized a gain of
$11.3 million resulting from the transaction during the year ended March 2020.
As of March 2020, the Company has signed certain distribution center leases that have not yet commenced but will create significant rights and obligations. The leases will commence in Fiscal 2021 and have lease terms of 15 years. Other leases signed that have not yet commenced are not individually significant. The Company does not have material subleases.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses are recognized as assets and liabilities, respectively, and classified as current or noncurrent based on the derivatives’ maturity dates. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivative instruments (i.e., gains and losses) depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. To qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships must be formally documented at the inception of the hedges and must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows of hedged transactions. VF’s hedging practices are described in Note 24. VF does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Hedging cash flows are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the same category as the items being hedged.
VF formally documents hedging instruments and hedging relationships at the inception of each contract. Further, at the inception of a contract and on an ongoing basis, VF assesses whether the hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting the risk of the hedged transactions. When hedging instruments are determined to not be highly effective, hedge accounting treatment is discontinued, and any future changes in fair value of the instruments are recognized in net income. Unrealized gains or losses related to hedging instruments remain in accumulated OCI until the hedged forecasted transaction occurs and impacts earnings. If the hedged forecasted transaction is deemed probable of not occurring, any unrealized gains or losses in accumulated OCI are immediately recognized in net income.
VF also uses derivative contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk on certain assets and liabilities, and to hedge the exposure on the foreign currency denominated purchase price of acquisitions. These contracts are not designated as hedges, and are measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in fair value recognized directly in net income.
The counterparties to the derivative contracts are financial institutions having at least A-rated investment grade credit ratings. To manage its credit risk, VF continually monitors the credit risks of its counterparties, limits its exposure in the aggregate and to any single counterparty, and adjusts its hedging positions as appropriate. The impact of VF’s credit risk and the credit risk of its counterparties, as well as the ability of each party to fulfill its obligations under the contracts, is considered in determining the fair value of the derivative contracts. Credit risk has not had a significant effect on the fair value of VF’s derivative contracts. VF does not have any credit risk-related contingent features or collateral requirements with its derivative contracts.

Revenue Recognition
Upon adoption of the new revenue recognition standard at the beginning of Fiscal 2019, revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied based on the transfer of control of promised goods or services. The transfer of control typically occurs at a point in time based on consideration of when the customer has (i) an obligation to pay for, (ii) physical possession of, (iii) legal title to, (iv) risks and rewards of ownership of, and (v) accepted the goods or services. The timing of revenue recognition within the wholesale channel occurs either on shipment or delivery of goods based on contractual terms with the customer. The timing of revenue recognition in the direct-to-consumer channel generally occurs at the point of sale within VF-operated or concession retail stores and either on shipment or delivery of goods for e-commerce transactions based on contractual terms with the customer. For finished products shipped directly to customers from our suppliers, the Company's promise to the customer is a performance obligation to provide the specified goods, and thus the Company is the principal in the arrangement and revenue is recognized on a gross basis at the transaction price. For sourcing arrangements, the Company's promise to the customer is to arrange for certain goods, typically finished products, to be provided and thus the Company is acting as an agent and revenue is recognized on a net basis at the fee amount earned.
The duration of contractual arrangements with our customers in the wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels is typically less than one year. Payment terms with wholesale customers are generally between 30 and 60 days while direct-to-consumer arrangements have shorter terms. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component as it is expected, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and the customer payment for the good or service will be one year or less.
The amount of revenue recognized in both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels reflects the expected consideration to be received for providing the goods or services to the customer, which includes estimates for variable consideration. Variable consideration includes allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs, discounts, markdowns, chargebacks and product returns. Estimates of variable consideration are determined at contract inception and reassessed at each reporting date, at a minimum, to reflect any changes in facts and circumstances. The Company utilizes the expected value method in determining its estimates of variable consideration, based on evaluations of specific product and customer circumstances, historical and anticipated trends, and current economic conditions. Allowances for estimates of sales incentive programs, discounts, markdowns, chargebacks and returns are recorded as accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Certain products sold by the Company include an assurance warranty. Product warranty costs are estimated based on historical and anticipated trends, and are recorded as cost of goods sold at the time revenue is recognized.
Revenue from the sale of gift cards is deferred and recorded as a contract liability until the gift card is redeemed by the customer, factoring in breakage as appropriate.
Various VF brands maintain customer loyalty programs where customers earn rewards from qualifying purchases or activities, which are redeemable for discounts on future purchases or other rewards. For its customer loyalty programs, the Company estimates the standalone selling price of the loyalty rewards and allocates a portion of the consideration for the sale of products to the loyalty points earned. The deferred amount is recorded as a contract liability, and is recognized as revenue when the points are redeemed or when the likelihood of redemption is remote.
The Company has elected to treat all shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs and recognize the costs as selling, general and administrative expenses at the time the related revenue is recognized. Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net revenues. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected from customers and remitted directly to governmental authorities are excluded from the transaction price.
The Company has licensing agreements for its symbolic intellectual property, most of which include minimum guaranteed royalties. Royalty income is recognized as earned over the respective license term based on the greater of minimum guarantees or the licensees' sales of licensed products at rates specified in the licensing contracts. Royalty income related to the minimum guarantees is recognized using a measure of progress with variable amounts recognized only when the cumulative earned royalty exceeds the minimum guarantees.
The Company has applied the practical expedient to recognize incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that otherwise would have been recognized is one year or less.
For periods prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, revenue was recognized when (i) there was a contract or other arrangement of sale, (ii) the sales price was fixed or determinable, (iii) title and the risks of ownership had been transferred to the customer, and (iv) collection of the receivable was reasonably assured. Sales to wholesale customers were recognized when title and the risks and rewards of ownership had passed to the customer, based on the terms of sale. E-commerce sales were generally recognized when the product had been received by the customer. Sales at Company-operated and concession retail stores were recognized at the time products were purchased by consumers.
Revenue from the sale of gift cards was deferred until the gift card was redeemed by the customer or the Company determined that the likelihood of redemption was remote and that it did not have a legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift card to any jurisdiction under unclaimed property regulations.
Various VF brands maintained customer loyalty programs where customers earned rewards from qualifying purchases or activities. VF recognized revenue when (i) rewards were redeemed by the customer, (ii) points or certificates expired, or (iii) a breakage factor was applied based on historical redemption patterns.
Net revenues reflected adjustments for estimated allowances for trade terms, sales incentive programs, discounts, markdowns, chargebacks and returns. These allowances were estimated based on evaluations of specific product and customer circumstances, historical and anticipated trends and current economic conditions.

Shipping and handling costs billed to customers were included in net revenues. Sales taxes and value added taxes collected from customers and remitted directly to governmental authorities were excluded from net revenues.
Royalty income was recognized as earned based on the greater of the licensees’ sale of licensed products at rates specified in the licensing contracts or contractual minimum royalty levels.
Cost of Goods Sold
Cost of goods sold for purchased finished goods includes the purchase costs and related overhead. Cost of goods sold for VF-manufactured goods includes all materials, labor and overhead costs incurred in the production process. In both cases, overhead includes all costs related to manufacturing or purchasing finished goods, including costs of planning, purchasing, quality control, depreciation, freight, duties, royalties paid to third parties and shrinkage. For product lines with a warranty, a provision for estimated future repair or replacement costs, based on historical and anticipated trends, is recorded when these products are sold.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses include costs of product development, selling, marketing and advertising, VF-operated retail stores, concession retail stores, warehousing, distribution, shipping and handling, licensing and administration. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and totaled $756.3 million in the year ended March 2020, $700.5 million in the year ended March 2019, $152.8 million in the three months ended March 2018 and $571.2 million in the year ended December 2017. Advertising costs include cooperative advertising payments made to VF’s customers as reimbursement for certain costs of advertising VF’s products, which totaled $20.2 million in the year ended March 2020, $22.6 million in the year ended March 2019, $5.8 million in the three months ended March 2018 and $35.2 million in the year ended December 2017. Shipping and handling costs for delivery of products to customers totaled $409.4 million in the year ended March 2020, $379.4 million in the year ended March 2019, $72.6 million in the three months ended March 2018 and $256.0 million in the year ended December 2017. Expenses related to royalty income, including amortization of licensed intangible assets, were $2.1 million in the year ended March 2020, $2.8 million in the year ended March 2019, $0.5 million in the three months ended March 2018 and $2.3 million in the year ended December 2017.
Self-insurance
VF is self-insured for a significant portion of its employee medical, workers’ compensation, vehicle, property and general liability exposures. Liabilities for self-insured exposures are accrued at the present value of amounts expected to be paid based on historical claims experience and actuarial data for forecasted settlements of claims filed and for incurred but not yet reported claims. Accruals for self-insured exposures are included in current and noncurrent liabilities based on the expected periods of payment. Excess liability insurance has been purchased to limit the amount of self-insured risk on claims.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are provided on pre-tax income for financial reporting purposes. Income taxes are based on amounts of taxes payable or refundable in the current year and on expected future tax consequences of events that are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in different periods than they are recognized in tax returns. As a result of timing of recognition and measurement differences between financial accounting standards and income tax laws, temporary differences arise between amounts of pretax financial statement income and taxable income, and between reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and their respective tax bases. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect the estimated future tax impact of these temporary differences and net operating loss and net capital loss carryforwards, based on tax rates currently enacted for the years in which the differences are expected to be settled or realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income in specific jurisdictions. Valuation allowances are used to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts considered more likely than not to be realized. Accrued income taxes in the Consolidated Balance Sheets include unrecognized income tax benefits, along with related interest and penalties, appropriately classified as current or noncurrent. All deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as noncurrent in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The provision for income taxes also includes estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.
Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of potentially dilutive securities such as stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units.
Concentration of Risks
VF markets products to a broad customer base throughout the world. Products are sold at a range of price points through multiple wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. VF’s ten largest customers accounted for 17% of Fiscal 2020 total revenues. Sales to VF’s largest customer accounted for 3% of Fiscal 2020 total revenues. Sales are generally made on an unsecured basis under customary terms that may vary by product, channel of distribution or geographic region. VF continuously monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and has established internal policies regarding customer credit limits. The breadth of product offerings, combined with the large number and geographic diversity of its customers, limits VF’s concentration of risks.
Legal and Other Contingencies
Management periodically assesses liabilities and contingencies in connection with legal proceedings and other claims that may arise from time to time. When it is probable that a loss has been or will be incurred, an estimate of the loss is recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Estimates of losses are adjusted when additional information becomes available or circumstances change. A contingent liability is disclosed when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss may have been incurred. Management believes that the outcome of any outstanding or

pending matters, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Reclassifications
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the Fiscal 2020 presentation.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, a new accounting standard on leasing. The FASB subsequently issued updates to the standard to provide additional clarification on specific topics, including permitted transition methods. Collectively, the guidance is referred to as FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 842. This standard requires companies to record most leased assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, and also retains a dual model approach for assessing lease classification and recognizing expense. The Company adopted this standard on March 31, 2019, utilizing the modified retrospective method and recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard in retained earnings. The effective date of the adoption was used as the date of initial application, and thus comparative prior period financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under accounting standards in effect for those periods.
The standard provides certain optional practical expedients for transition. The Company elected the transition relief package of practical expedients by applying previous accounting conclusions under ASC Topic 840, Leases ("ASC 840"), to all leases that existed prior to the transition date. As a result, VF did not reassess (i) whether existing or expired contracts contain leases, (ii) lease classification for any existing or expired leases, or (iii) whether lease origination costs qualified as initial direct costs. The Company also elected the land easement practical expedient, which allowed the Company to apply ASC 842 prospectively to land easements after the adoption date if they were not previously accounted for under ASC 840. Certain leases contain both lease and non-lease components. For leases associated with specific asset classes, including certain real estate, vehicles, manufacturing machinery and IT equipment, VF elected the practical expedient which permits entities to account for separate lease and non-lease components as a single component. For all other lease contracts, the Company elected to account for each lease component separately from the non-lease components of the contract. When applicable, VF will measure the consideration to be paid pursuant to the agreement and allocate this consideration to the lease and non-lease components based on relative standalone prices. Further, the Company made an accounting policy election to not recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with terms of 12 months or less.
The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in a net decrease of $2.5 million in the retained earnings line item of the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2019. The adoption of ASC 842 also resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Additionally, leases previously referred to as "capital leases" are now referred to as "finance leases" under ASC 842. Refer to Note 10 for additional lease disclosures.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities", an update that amends and simplifies certain aspects of hedge accounting rules to better portray the economic results of risk management activities in the financial statements. The FASB subsequently issued updates to the standard to provide additional guidance on specific topics. This guidance became effective for VF in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, but did not impact VF's consolidated financial statements.
In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, "Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income", an update that addresses the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("U.S. Tax Act") on items within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The guidance became effective for VF in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020. The Company elected to reclassify the income tax effects of the U.S. Tax Act on items within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of $61.9 million to retained earnings, which primarily related to deferred taxes previously recorded for pension benefits. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on VF's consolidated results of operations or cash flows.
In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting", an update that expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. This guidance became effective for VF in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, but did not impact VF's consolidated financial statements.
In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-09, "Codification Improvements", an update that provides technical corrections, clarifications and other improvements across a variety of accounting topics. The transition and effective date guidance is based on the facts and circumstances of each update; however, many of them became effective for VF in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020. The guidance did not impact VF's consolidated financial statements.
In April 2020, the FASB issued a Staff Question-and-Answer ("Q&A") to clarify whether lease concessions related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic require the application of the lease modification guidance under ASC 842. In light of the guidance, management has elected to account for lease concessions related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as though enforceable rights and obligations for those concessions existed (regardless of whether those enforceable rights and obligations for the concessions explicitly exist in the lease contract), provided that the concessions result in the total payments required by the modified contract being substantially the same as or less than total payments required by the original lease contract. Lease concessions meeting this criteria are reflected within variable rent expense. The Company applied this guidance within its Fiscal 2020 consolidated financial statements; however, it did not have a material impact.
Recently Issued Accounting Standards
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments", which requires entities to use a

forward-looking approach based on expected losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. The FASB has subsequently issued updates to the standard to provide additional clarification on specific topics. This guidance will be effective for VF in the first quarter of the year ending April 3, 2021 ("Fiscal 2021"). The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on VF's consolidated financial statements.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, "Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement", an update that modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying or adding certain disclosures. The guidance will be effective for VF in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on VF's disclosures.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-14, "Compensation- Retirement Benefits-Defined Benefit Plans-General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans", an update that modifies the disclosure requirements for employers who sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans. The guidance will be effective for VF in Fiscal 2021.The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on VF's disclosures.
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud
Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract", an update that aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The guidance will be effective for VF in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on VF's consolidated financial statements.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes", an update that amends and simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions in existing guidance and providing new guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas. The guidance will be effective for VF in the first quarter of the year ending April 2, 2022 ("Fiscal 2022") with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact that adopting this guidance will have on VF's consolidated financial statements.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, "Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting", an update that provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The optional guidance is provided to ease the potential burden of accounting for reference rate reform. The guidance is effective and can be adopted no later than December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating the impact that adopting this guidance would have on VF's consolidated financial statements.
NOTE 2 - REVENUES
Performance Obligations
Disclosure is required for the aggregate transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied at the end of a reporting period, unless the optional practical expedients are applicable. VF has elected the practical expedients to not disclose the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for (i) variable consideration related to sales-based royalty arrangements, and (ii) contracts with an original expected duration of one year or less.
As of March 2020, the Company expects to recognize $70.9 million of fixed consideration related to the future minimum guarantees in effect under its licensing agreements and expects such amounts to be recognized over time through December 2029. The variable consideration related to licensing arrangements is not disclosed as a remaining performance obligation as it qualifies for the sales-based royalty exemption.
As of March 2020, there are no arrangements with transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations other than contracts for which the Company has applied the practical expedients and fixed consideration related to future minimum guarantees discussed above.
For the year ended March 2020, revenue recognized from performance obligations satisfied, or partially satisfied, in prior periods was not material.
Contract Balances
Accounts receivable represent the Company's unconditional right to receive consideration from a customer and are recorded at net invoiced amounts, less an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts.
Contract assets are rights to consideration in exchange for goods or services that have been transferred to a customer when that right is conditional on something other than the passage of time. Once the Company has an unconditional right to consideration under a contract, amounts are invoiced and contract assets are reclassified to accounts receivable. The Company's primary contract assets relate to sales-based royalty arrangements, which are discussed in more detail within Note 1.
Contract liabilities are recorded when a customer pays consideration, or the Company has a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional, before the transfer of a good or service to the customer and thus represent the Company's obligation to transfer the good or service to the customer at a future date. The Company's primary contract liabilities relate to gift cards, loyalty programs and sales-based royalty arrangements, which are discussed in more detail within Note 1, and order deposits.

(b)
Included in the accrued liabilities and other liabilities line items in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
For the year ended March 2020, the Company recognized $211.3 million of revenue that was included in the contract liability balance during the year, including amounts recorded as a contract liability and subsequently recognized as revenue as performance obligations are satisfied within the same period, such as order deposits from customers. The change in the contract asset and contract liability balances primarily results from the timing differences between the Company's satisfaction of performance obligations and the customer's payment.
Disaggregation of Revenue
The following tables disaggregate our revenues by channel and geography, which provides a meaningful depiction of how the nature, timing and uncertainty of revenues are affected by economic factors. The wholesale channel includes fees generated from sourcing activities as the customers and point-in-time revenue recognition are similar to other wholesale arrangements. We adopted the new revenue recognition standard at the beginning of Fiscal 2019 using the modified retrospective method of adoption. As a result, revenue reported for the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017 have not been presented.

NOTE 3 - ACQUISITIONS
Williamson-Dickie
On October 2, 2017, VF acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Williamson-Dickie Mfg. Co. (“Williamson-Dickie”) for $800.7 million in cash, subject to working capital and other adjustments. The purchase price was primarily funded with short-term borrowings. The purchase price decreased $2.3 million during the three months ended March 2018, related to working capital adjustments, resulting in a final purchase price of $798.4 million.
Williamson-Dickie was a privately held company based in Ft. Worth, Texas, and was one of the largest companies in the workwear sector with a portfolio of brands including Dickies®, Workrite®, Walls®, Terra® and Kodiak®. The acquisition of Williamson-Dickie brings together complementary assets and capabilities, and creates a workwear business that serves an even broader set of consumers and industries around the world.
For the six months ended September 2018, Williamson-Dickie contributed revenues of $471.9 million and net income of $33.3 million, including restructuring charges. Given the ongoing integration and change in operating nature of the acquired business, it is impracticable to determine the revenues or operating results contributed subsequent to September 2018. Williamson-Dickie contributed revenues of $233.1 million and net income of $4.9 million to VF in the three months ended March 2018, including restructuring charges. For the period from October 2, 2017 through December 30, 2017, Williamson-Dickie contributed revenues of $247.2 million and net income of $9.6 million to VF, including restructuring charges.
Total transaction expenses for the Williamson-Dickie acquisition were $15.0 million, all of which were recognized in the year ended December 2017 in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income.
On January 21, 2020, VF announced its decision to explore the divestiture of its Occupational Workwear business, which includes certain brands and businesses obtained as part of the Williamson-Dickie acquisition including Workrite®, Walls®, Terra®, Kodiak® and Work Authority®. The business also includes certain Dickies® occupational workwear products that have historically been sold through the business-to-business channel. During the three months ended March 2020, the Company determined the Occupational Workwear business met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria and expects to divest this business in the next twelve months. Accordingly, the Company has reported the results of these brands and businesses as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and presented the related held-for-sale assets and liabilities as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The disclosures above do not reflect the discontinued operations presentation for the Occupational Workwear business and thus represent the historical amounts for the acquired Williamson-Dickie business. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on discontinued operations.
The following unaudited pro forma summary presents historical consolidated information of VF as if the acquisition of Williamson-Dickie had occurred on January 3, 2016:
These pro forma amounts have been calculated after applying VF’s accounting policies and adjusting the results of Williamson-Dickie to reflect the additional depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the fair value adjustments to property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets had been applied from January 3, 2016, with related tax effects. The pro forma amounts do not reflect the discontinued operations presentation for the Occupational Workwear business discussed above or the Jeans business that was subject to the spin-off completed in Fiscal 2020. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on discontinued operations.
The pro forma financial information in the year ended December 2017 excludes $41.6 million of expense related to Williamson-Dickie’s executive compensation plans, which were terminated concurrent with the merger.
Pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of VF’s operating results if the acquisition had been effected at the date indicated, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results. Amounts do not include any marketing leverage, operating efficiencies or cost savings that VF believes are achievable.
Icebreaker
On April 3, 2018, VF acquired 100% of the stock of Icebreaker Holdings Limited ("Icebreaker") for NZ$274.4 million ($198.5 million) in cash, subject to working capital and other adjustments. The purchase price was primarily funded with short-term borrowings. The purchase price decreased NZ$1.4 million ($0.9 million) during the year ended March 2019, related to working capital adjustments, resulting in a final purchase price of NZ$273.0 million ($197.6 million).

Icebreaker was a privately held company based in Auckland, New Zealand. Icebreaker®, the primary brand, specializes in high-performance apparel based on natural fibers, including Merino wool, plant-based fibers and recycled fibers. It is an ideal complement to VF's Smartwool® brand, which also features Merino wool in its clothing and accessories. Together, the Smartwool® and Icebreaker® brands position VF as a global leader in the Merino wool and natural fiber categories.
For the year ended March 2019, Icebreaker contributed revenues of $174.2 million, representing 1.7% of VF's total revenue for the period. Icebreaker contributed net income of $14.6 million during the year ended March 2019, representing 1.7% of VF's income from continuing operations in the period.
Total transaction expenses for the Icebreaker acquisition of $7.4 million were recognized in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income, of which $4.1 million, $1.4 million and $1.9 million was recognized during the year ended March 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017, respectively. In addition, the Company recognized a $9.9 million gain on derivatives used to hedge the purchase price of Icebreaker in the other income (expense), net line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income, of which $0.3 million, $4.3 million and $5.3 million was recognized during the year ended March 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017, respectively.
Pro forma results of operations of the Company would not be materially different as a result of the Icebreaker acquisition and therefore are not presented.
Altra
On June 1, 2018, VF acquired 100% of the stock of Icon-Altra LLC, plus certain assets in Europe ("Altra"). The purchase price was $131.7 million in cash, subject to working capital and other adjustments, and was primarily funded with short-term borrowings. The purchase price decreased $0.1 million during the year ended March 2019, related to working capital adjustments, resulting in a final purchase price of $131.6 million.
Altra®, the primary brand, is an athletic and performance-based lifestyle footwear brand. Altra provides VF with a unique and differentiated technical footwear brand and a capability that, when applied across VF's footwear platforms, will serve as a catalyst for growth.
Altra contributed revenues of $50.2 million and net income of $0.8 million during the year ended March 2019.
Total transaction expenses for the Altra acquisition were $2.3 million, all of which were recognized in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income during the year ended March 2019.
Pro forma results of operations of the Company would not be materially different as a result of the Altra acquisition and therefore are not presented.
NOTE 4 - DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND OTHER DIVESTITURES
The Company continuously assesses the composition of its portfolio to ensure it is aligned with its strategic objectives and positioned to maximize growth and return to shareholders.
Discontinued Operations
Occupational Workwear Business
On January 21, 2020, VF announced its decision to explore the divestiture of its Occupational Workwear business. The Occupational Workwear business is comprised primarily of the following brands and businesses: Red Kap®, VF Solutions®, Bulwark®, Workrite®, Walls®, Terra®, Kodiak®, Work Authority® and Horace Small®. The business also includes certain Dickies® occupational workwear products that have historically been sold through the business-to-business channel.
During the three months ended March 2020, the Company determined the Occupational Workwear business met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria and expects to divest this business in the next twelve months. Accordingly, the Company has reported the results of the Occupational Workwear business and the related cash flows as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively. The related held-for-sale assets and liabilities have been reported as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The results of the Occupational Workwear business were previously reported in the Work segment. The results of the
Occupational Workwear business recorded in the income from discontinued operations, net of tax line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income were income of $91.2 million (including goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $11.1 million), $119.0 million, $22.1 million and $84.8 million for the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017, respectively.
Management performed quantitative impairment analysis over the Kodiak and Terra reporting unit goodwill and the indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets. Based on the analysis, management recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $6.1 million and an impairment charge of $5.0 million on the indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Certain corporate overhead costs and segment costs previously allocated to the Occupational Workwear business for segment reporting purposes did not qualify for classification within discontinued operations and have been reallocated to continuing operations.

Jeans Business
On May 22, 2019, VF completed the spin-off its Jeans business, which included the Wrangler®, Lee® and Rock & Republic® brands, as well as the VF OutletTM business, into an independent, publicly traded company now operating under the name Kontoor Brands, Inc. ("Kontoor Brands") and trading under the symbol "KTB" on the New York Stock Exchange. The spin-off was effected through a distribution to VF shareholders of one share of Kontoor Brands common stock for every seven shares of VF common stock held on the record date of May 10, 2019. Accordingly, the Company has reported the results of the Jeans business and the related cash flows as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively, and presented the related assets and liabilities as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, through the date the spin-off was completed.
In connection with the spin-off, Kontoor Brands entered into a credit agreement with respect to $1.55 billion in senior secured credit facilities consisting of a senior secured five-year $750.0 million term loan A facility, a senior secured seven-year $300.0 million term loan B facility and a five-year $500.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (collectively, the "Kontoor Credit Facilities"). Prior to the effective date of the spin-off, Kontoor Brands incurred $1.05 billion of indebtedness under the Kontoor Credit Facilities, which was primarily used to fund a transfer of $906.1 million to VF and its subsidiaries, net of $126.8 million of cash received from VF. As a result of the spin-off, VF divested net assets of $54.9 million, including the indebtedness under the Kontoor Credit Facilities. Also included in the net assets divested was $75.3 million of net accumulated other comprehensive losses attributable to the Jeans business, primarily related to foreign currency translation.
The results of the Wrangler®, Lee® and Rock & Republic® brands were previously reported in the Jeans segment, the results of the Wrangler® RIGGS brand were previously reported in the Work segment, and the results of the non-VF products sold in VF OutletTM stores were previously reported in the Other category included in the reconciliation of segment revenues and segment profit. The results of the Jeans business recorded in the income from discontinued operations, net of tax line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income were a loss of $40.9 million and income of $269.6 million, $110.1 million and $368.4 million in the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017, respectively.
Certain corporate overhead costs and segment costs previously allocated to the Jeans business for segment reporting purposes did not qualify for classification within discontinued operations and have been reallocated to continuing operations. The results of the Jeans business reported as discontinued operations include $59.5 million of separation and related expenses during the year ended March 2020.
In connection with the spin-off of the Jeans business, the Company entered into several agreements with Kontoor Brands that govern the relationship of the parties following the spin-off including the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement, the VF Intellectual Property License Agreement and the Employee Matters Agreement. Under the terms of the Transition Services Agreement,
the Company and Kontoor Brands agreed to provide each other certain transitional services including information technology, information management, human resources, employee benefits administration, supply chain, facilities, and other limited finance and accounting related services for periods up to 24 months. Payments and operating expense reimbursements for transition services are recorded within the reportable segments or within the corporate and other expenses line item, in the reconciliation of segment profit in Note 20, based on the function providing the service.
Nautica® Brand Business
During the three months ended December 2017, the Company reached the strategic decision to exit the Nautica® brand business, and determined that it met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. Accordingly, the Company has reported the results of the Nautica® brand business and the related cash flows as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Income Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, respectively.
On April 30, 2018, VF completed the sale of the Nautica® brand business. The Company received proceeds of $285.8 million, net of cash sold, resulting in a final after-tax loss on sale of $38.2 million, which includes a decrease of $5.4 million and an increase of $18.1 million in the estimated loss on sale included in the income from discontinued operations, net of tax line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended March 2019 and the three months ended March 2018, respectively. The year ended December 2017 includes a $25.5 million estimated loss on sale.
The results of the Nautica® brand's North America business were previously reported in the former Sportswear segment, and the results of the Asia business were previously reported in the former Outdoor & Action Sports segment. The results of the Nautica® brand business recorded in the income from discontinued operations, net of tax line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income were income of $0.8 million (including a $5.4 million decrease in the estimated loss on sale), a loss of $8.4 million (including an $18.1 million increase in the estimated loss on sale) and a loss of $95.2 million (including an estimated loss on sale of $25.5 million and a goodwill impairment charge of $104.7 million) for the year ended March 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017, respectively.
Certain corporate overhead costs and segment costs previously allocated to the Nautica® brand business for segment reporting purposes did not qualify for classification within discontinued operations and have been reallocated to continuing operations. In addition, the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2017 of $104.7 million related to the Nautica® reporting unit, previously excluded from the calculation of segment profit, was reclassified to discontinued operations.
Under the terms of the transition services agreement, the Company provided certain support services for periods up to 12 months from the closing date of the transaction. Revenue and related expense items associated with the transition services were recorded in the Other category, and operating expense reimbursements were recorded within the corporate and other expenses line item, in the reconciliation of segment revenues and segment profit in Note 20.

NOTE 12 - SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS
VF maintains a $2.25 billion senior unsecured revolving line of credit (the “Global Credit Facility”) that expires December 2023. VF may request an unlimited number of one year extensions so long as each extension does not cause the remaining life of the Global Credit Facility to exceed five years, subject to stated terms and conditions. The Global Credit Facility may be used to borrow funds in both U.S. dollar and certain non-U.S. dollar currencies, and has a $50.0 million letter of credit sublimit. In addition, the Global Credit Facility supports VF’s U.S. commercial paper program for short-term, seasonal working capital requirements and general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and acquisitions. Borrowings under the Global Credit Facility are priced at a credit spread of 81.0 basis points over the appropriate LIBOR benchmark for each currency. VF is also required to pay a facility fee to the lenders, currently equal to 6.5 basis points of the committed amount of the facility. The credit spread and facility fee are subject to adjustment based on VF’s credit ratings.
The Global Credit Facility contains certain restrictive covenants, which include maintenance of a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio, as defined therein, equal to or below 60%. If VF fails in the performance of any covenants, the lenders may terminate their obligation to make advances and declare any outstanding obligations to be immediately due and payable. As of March 2020, VF was in compliance with all covenants. In April 2020, VF entered into an amendment to the Global Credit Facility that resulted in certain changes to the restrictive covenants, including an increase to the consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio financial covenant to 70% and a revised calculation of consolidated indebtedness to be net of
unrestricted cash of VF and its subsidiaries. Refer to Note 27 for additional information.
In March 2020, VF elected to draw down $1.0 billion from the Global Credit Facility to strengthen the Company's cash position and support general working capital needs in Fiscal 2021, which was an action taken by the Company in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The borrowings have an interest rate of 1.81% and were repaid in April 2020 with proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes. Refer to Note 27 for additional information.
VF’s commercial paper program allows for borrowings of up to $2.25 billion to the extent it has borrowing capacity under the Global Credit Facility. Outstanding commercial paper borrowings totaled $215.0 million and $650.0 million at March 2020 and 2019, respectively. Borrowings under the commercial paper program had a weighted average interest rate of 1.4% and 2.7% at March 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Global Credit Facility also had $18.4 million and $15.3 million of outstanding standby letters of credit issued on behalf of VF as of March 2020 and 2019, respectively, leaving $1.0 billion and $1.6 billion as of March 2020 and 2019, respectively, available for borrowing against this facility.
VF has $97.3 million of international lines of credit with various banks, which are uncommitted and may be terminated at any time by either VF or the banks. Total outstanding balances under these arrangements were $13.8 million and $9.1 million at March 2020 and 2019, respectively. Borrowings under these arrangements had a weighted average interest rate of 16.3% and 24.6% at March 2020 and 2019, respectively.

NOTE 14 - LONG-TERM DEBT
In February 2020, VF issued €500.0 million of 0.250% euro-denominated fixed-rate notes maturing in February 2028 and €500.0 million of 0.625% euro-denominated fixed-rate notes maturing in February 2032. The 2028 notes were issued as a green bond, and thus an amount equal to the net proceeds will be used to finance projects that focus on key environmental sustainability initiatives including sustainable products and materials, sustainable operations and supply chain, and natural carbon sinks.
In February and March 2020, VF completed cash tender offers for $23.0 million and $63.1 million in aggregate principal amounts of its outstanding 2033 and 2037 notes, respectively. The cash tender offers were subject to various conditions, which resulted in premiums of $8.6 million and $31.9 million for the 2033 and 2037 notes, respectively. Additionally, in connection with the tender offers, $1.3 million of unamortized original issue discount, debt issuance costs and tender fees were recognized. The premiums, amortization and fees were recorded in the loss on debt
extinguishment line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the year ended March 2020.
In March 2020, VF completed the full redemption of $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 2021 notes. The redemption price was equal to the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date at 120 basis points, which resulted in a make-whole premium of $17.0 million. Additionally, in connection with the redemption, $1.0 million of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs were recognized. The make-whole premium and amortization were recorded in the loss on debt extinguishment line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the year ended March 2020. Also, in connection with the redemption, the Company recognized a deferred loss on an interest rate hedging contract of $8.5 million, which was recorded in the interest expense line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the year ended March 2020.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
March 2020
All notes, along with any amounts outstanding under the Global Credit Facility (Note 12), rank equally as senior unsecured obligations of VF. All notes contain customary covenants and events of default, including limitations on liens and sale-leaseback transactions and a cross-acceleration event of default. The cross-acceleration provision of the 2033 notes is triggered if more than $50.0 million of other debt is in default and has been accelerated by the lenders. For the other notes, the cross-acceleration trigger is $100.0 million. If VF fails in the performance of any covenant under the indentures that govern the respective notes, the trustee or lenders may declare the principal due and payable immediately. As of March 2020, VF was in compliance with all covenants. None of the long-term debt agreements contain acceleration of maturity clauses based solely on changes in credit ratings. However, if there were a change in control of VF and, as a result of the change in control, the 2023, 2028, 2032 and 2037 notes were rated below investment grade by recognized rating agencies, then VF would be obligated to repurchase those notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount plus any accrued interest.
VF may redeem its notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest to the redemption date, or (ii) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted to the redemption date at an adjusted treasury rate, as defined, plus 15 basis points for the 2023, 2028, 2032 and 2033 notes, and 25 basis points for the 2037 notes, plus accrued interest to the redemption date. In addition, the 2023 and 2032 notes can be redeemed at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the redemption date within the three months prior to maturity, and the 2028 notes can be redeemed at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the redemption date within two months prior to maturity.
Prior to redemption, the 2021 notes had a principal balance of $500.0 million and were recorded net of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. Interest expense on these notes was recorded at an effective annual interest rate of 4.69%, including amortization of a deferred loss on an interest rate hedging contract (Note 24), original issue discount and debt issuance costs.
The 2023, 2028 and 2032 notes have a principal balance of €850.0 million, €500.0 million and €500.0 million, respectively, and are recorded net of unamortized original issue discounts and debt issuance costs. Interest expense on the 2023, 2028 and 2032 notes is recorded at an effective annual interest rate of 0.712%, 0.388% and 0.789%, respectively, which includes amortization of original issue discount and debt issuance costs. The Company has designated these notes as a net investment hedge of VF's investment in certain foreign operations. Refer to Note 24 for additional information.
The 2033 notes have a principal balance of $277.0 million, after the cash tender for $23.0 million noted above, and are recorded net of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. Interest expense on these notes is recorded at an effective annual interest rate of 6.19%, including amortization of a deferred gain on an interest rate hedging contract (Note 24), original issue discount and debt issuance costs.
The 2037 notes have a principal balance of $286.9 million, after the cash tender for $63.1 million noted above, and are recorded net of unamortized original issue discount and debt issuance costs. Interest expense on these notes is recorded at an effective annual interest rate of 6.57%.
Interest payments are due annually on the 2023, 2028 and 2032 notes and semiannually on all other notes.

NOTE 16 - RETIREMENT AND SAVINGS BENEFIT PLANS
VF has several retirement and savings benefit plans covering eligible employees. VF retains the right to curtail or discontinue any of the plans, subject to local regulations.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans
Defined benefit plans provide pension benefits based on participant compensation and years of service. VF sponsors a noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most full-time U.S. employees employed before 2005 (the “U.S. qualified plan”) and an unfunded supplemental defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits in excess of limitations imposed by income tax regulations
(the “U.S. nonqualified plan”). The U.S. qualified plan is fully funded at the end of Fiscal 2020, and VF’s net underfunded status primarily relates to obligations under the unfunded U.S. nonqualified plan. The U.S. qualified and nonqualified plans comprise 91% of VF’s total defined benefit plan assets and 88% of VF’s total projected benefit obligations at March 2020, and the remainder relates to non-U.S. defined benefit plans. A March 31 measurement date is used to value plan assets and obligations for all pension plans.
The amounts reported in these disclosures have not been segregated between continuing and discontinued operations.
The components of pension cost for VF’s defined benefit plans were as follows:

During the year ended March 2020, the Company offered former employees in the U.S. qualified plan a lump-sum option to receive a distribution of their deferred vested benefits. Approximately 2,400 participants accepted a distribution, representing approximately 40% of offered participants and an approximate 10% reduction in the total number of plan participants. In December 2019, the plan paid approximately $130 million in lump-sum distributions to settle approximately $170 million of projected benefit obligations related to these participants. VF recorded a $23.0 million settlement charge in the other income (expense), net line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income during the year ended March 2020 to recognize the related deferred actuarial losses in accumulated OCI.
Additionally, VF reported $4.4 million of settlement charges in the other income (expense), net line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended March 2020, as well as $8.9 million for the year ended March 2019. The settlement charges related to the recognition of deferred actuarial losses resulting
from lump-sum payments of retirement benefits in the U.S. nonqualified plan.
In Fiscal 2019, VF approved a freeze of all future benefit accruals under the U.S. qualified and U.S. nonqualified plans, effective December 31, 2018. Accordingly, the Company recognized a $9.5 million pension curtailment loss in the other income (expense), net line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended March 2019.
In the year ended December 2017, the Company recorded curtailment charges of $1.7 million which comprised (i) $1.1 million within the U.S. qualified plan related to the sale of the Licensing Business (recorded in the income from discontinued operations, net of tax line item), and (ii) $0.6 million within the U.S. nonqualified plan related to restructuring initiatives (recorded in the other income (expense), net line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income).
The following provides a reconciliation of the changes in fair value of VF’s defined benefit plan assets and projected benefit obligations for each period, and the funded status at the end of each period:

Pension benefits are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as a net asset or liability based on the overfunded or underfunded status of the defined benefit plans, assessed on a plan-by-plan basis.
The amounts reported in the table above for the prior period have not been segregated between continuing and discontinued operations. The March 2019 balances include $11.0 million of pension liabilities related to the Jeans business, which were transferred in connection with the spin-off.
(a)
Rate of compensation increase is calculated as the weighted average rate of compensation increase for active plans. Frozen plans are excluded from the calculation.
Accumulated benefit obligations at any measurement date are the present value of vested and unvested pension benefits earned, without considering projected future compensation increases. Projected benefit obligations are the present value of vested and unvested pension benefits earned, considering projected future compensation increases.
Deferred actuarial gains and losses are changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the value of plan assets resulting from differences between expected amounts for a year using actuarial assumptions and the actual results for that year. These amounts are deferred as a component of accumulated OCI and amortized to pension expense in future years. For the U.S. qualified plan, amounts in excess of 20% of projected benefit obligations at the beginning of the year are amortized over five years; amounts between (i) 10% of the greater of projected benefit obligations or plan assets, and (ii) 20% of projected benefit obligations are amortized over the expected average life expectancy of all participants; and amounts less than the greater of 10% of projected benefit obligations or plan assets are not amortized. For the U.S. nonqualified plan, amounts in excess of 10% of the pension benefit obligations are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected average life expectancy of all participants.
Deferred prior service credits and costs related to plan amendments are also recorded in accumulated OCI and amortized to pension expense on a straight-line basis over the average remaining years of service for active employees.
The estimated amounts of accumulated OCI to be amortized to pension expense in Fiscal 2021 are $11.1 million of deferred actuarial losses and an insignificant amount of deferred prior service costs.
Management’s investment objectives are to invest plan assets in a diversified portfolio of securities to provide long-term growth,
minimize the volatility of the value of plan assets relative to plan liabilities, and to ensure plan assets are sufficient to pay the benefit obligations. Investment strategies focus on diversification among multiple asset classes, a balance of long-term investment return at an acceptable level of risk and liquidity to meet benefit payments. The primary objective of the investment strategies is to more closely align plan assets with plan liabilities by utilizing dynamic asset allocation targets dependent upon changes in the plan’s funded ratio, capital market expectations and risk tolerance.
Plan assets are primarily composed of common collective trust funds that invest in liquid securities diversified across equity, fixed-income, real estate and other asset classes. Fund assets are allocated among independent investment managers who have full discretion to manage their portion of the fund’s assets, subject to strategy and risk guidelines established with each manager. The overall strategy, the resulting allocations of plan assets and the performance of funds and individual investment managers are continually monitored. Derivative financial instruments may be used by investment managers for hedging purposes to gain exposure to alternative asset classes through the futures markets. There are no direct investments in VF debt or equity securities and no significant concentrations of security risk.
The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was based on an evaluation of the weighted average expected returns for the major asset classes in which the plans have invested. Expected returns by asset class were developed through analysis of historical market returns, current market conditions, inflation expectations and equity and credit risks. Inputs from various investment advisors on long-term capital market returns and other variables were also considered where appropriate.

Cash equivalents include cash held by individual investment managers of other asset classes for liquidity purposes (Level 1), and an institutional fund that invests primarily in short-term U.S. government securities measured at their daily net asset value. The fair values of insurance contracts are provided by the insurance companies and are primarily based on accumulated contributions plus returns guaranteed by the insurers (Level 2). Commodities consist of derivative commodity futures contracts (Level 1).
Equity and fixed-income securities generally represent institutional funds measured at their daily net asset value derived from quoted prices of the underlying investments. Alternative investments are primarily in funds of hedge funds (“FoHFs”), which are comprised of different and independent hedge funds with various investment strategies. The administrators of the FoHFs utilize unobservable inputs to calculate the net asset value of the FoHFs on a monthly basis.
VF makes contributions to its defined benefit plans sufficient to meet minimum funding requirements under applicable laws, plus discretionary amounts as determined by management. VF does not currently plan to make any contributions to the U.S. qualified plan during Fiscal 2021, and intends to make approximately $19.1 million of contributions to its other defined benefit plans during Fiscal 2021. The estimated future benefit payments for all of VF’s defined benefit plans, on a calendar year basis, are approximately $97.7 million in 2021, $98.7 million in 2022, $99.2 million in 2023, $99.6 million in 2024, $101.3 million in 2025 and $499.3 million for the years 2026 through 2030.
Other Retirement and Savings Plans
VF sponsors a nonqualified retirement savings plan for employees whose contributions to a 401(k) plan would be limited by provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. This plan allows participants to defer a portion of their compensation and to receive matching contributions for a portion of the deferred amounts. Participants earn a return on their deferred compensation based on their selection of a hypothetical portfolio of publicly traded mutual funds and a separately managed fixed-income fund. Changes in the fair value of the participants’ hypothetical investments are recorded as an adjustment to deferred compensation liabilities and compensation expense. Expense under this plan was $2.7 million in the year ended March 2020, $1.5 million in the year ended March
2019, $0.5 million in the three months ended March 2018 and $1.1 million in the year ended December 2017. Deferred compensation, including accumulated earnings, is distributable in cash at participant-specified dates upon retirement, death, disability or termination of employment. VF sponsors a similar nonqualified plan that permits nonemployee members of the Board of Directors to defer their Board compensation. VF also has remaining obligations under other deferred compensation plans, primarily related to acquired companies. At March 2020, VF’s liability to participants under all deferred compensation plans was $113.3 million, of which $8.8 million was recorded in accrued liabilities (Note 13) and $104.5 million was recorded in other liabilities (Note 15).
VF has purchased (i) publicly traded mutual funds and a separately managed fixed-income fund in the same amounts as most of the participant-directed hypothetical investments underlying the deferred compensation liabilities, and (ii) variable life insurance contracts that invest in institutional funds that are substantially the same as the participant-directed hypothetical investments. These investment securities and earnings thereon are intended to provide a source of funds to meet the deferred compensation obligations, and serve as an economic hedge of the financial impact of changes in deferred compensation liabilities. They are held in an irrevocable trust but are subject to claims of creditors in the event of VF’s insolvency. VF also has assets related to deferred compensation plans of acquired companies, which are primarily invested in life insurance contracts. At March 2020, the fair value of investments held for all deferred compensation plans was $139.3 million, of which $6.8 million was recorded in other current assets and $132.5 million was recorded in other assets (Note 11). Realized and unrealized gains and losses on these deferred compensation assets are recorded in compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and substantially offset losses and gains resulting from changes in deferred compensation liabilities to participants.
VF sponsors 401(k) plans as well as other domestic and foreign retirement and savings plans. Expense for these plans totaled $48.7 million in the year ended March 2020, $33.6 million in the year ended March 2019, $12.6 million in the three months ended March 2018 and $28.8 million in the year ended December 2017.

Common Stock
During the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017, the Company purchased 12.0 million, 1.9 million, 3.4 million and 22.2 million shares of Common Stock, respectively, in open market transactions for $1.0 billion, $150.0 million, $250.0 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, under its share repurchase program authorized by VF’s Board of Directors. These transactions were treated as treasury stock transactions.
Common Stock outstanding is net of shares held in treasury which are, in substance, retired. During the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended
December 2017, VF restored 12.0 million, 2.2 million, 3.4 million and 22.3 million treasury shares, including shares held by the Company's deferred compensation plans, respectively, to an unissued status, after which they were no longer recognized as shares held in treasury. There were no shares held in treasury at the end of March 2020, March 2019, March 2018 or December 2017. The excess of the cost of treasury shares acquired over the $0.25 per share stated value of Common Stock is deducted from retained earnings.
As of March 2020 and March 2019, there were no shares held in the Company's deferred compensation plans.

NOTE 18 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
Pursuant to the amended and restated 1996 Stock Compensation Plan approved by stockholders, VF is authorized to grant nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and restricted stock to officers, key employees and nonemployee members of VF’s Board of Directors. Substantially all stock-based compensation awards are classified as equity awards, which are accounted for in stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On a limited basis, cash-settled stock appreciation rights
are granted to employees in certain international jurisdictions. These awards are accounted for as liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and remeasured to fair value each reporting period until the awards are settled. Compensation cost for all awards expected to vest is recognized over the shorter of the requisite service period or the vesting period, including accelerated recognition for retirement-eligible employees. Awards that do not vest are forfeited.
Total stock-based compensation cost and the associated income tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and stock-based compensation costs included in inventory in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, on a continuing operations basis, are as follows:
At the end of March 2020, there was $34.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all stock-based compensation arrangements that will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1 year.
At the end of March 2020, there were 26,994,754 shares available for future grants of stock options and stock awards under the 1996 Stock Compensation Plan. Shares for option exercises are issued from VF’s authorized but unissued Common Stock. VF has a practice of repurchasing shares of Common Stock in the open market to offset, on a long-term basis, dilution caused by awards under equity compensation plans.
Spin-Off of Jeans Business
In connection with the spin-off of the Jeans business on May 22, 2019, the Company adjusted its outstanding equity awards in accordance with the terms of the Employee Matters Agreement between the Company and Kontoor Brands. Adjustments to the underlying shares and terms of outstanding stock options, RSUs and restricted stock were made to preserve the intrinsic value of the awards immediately before the separation. The adjustment of the underlying shares and exercise prices, as applicable, was determined using a ratio based on the relative values of the VF pre-distribution stock value and the VF post-distribution stock value as determined by the Company. The outstanding awards continue to vest over their original vesting periods. The Company will recognize
$13.0 million of total incremental compensation cost related to the adjustment of the VF equity awards, of which $12.7 million was recognized during the year ended March 2020.
In connection with the spin-off, stock options to purchase 756,709 shares of VF Common Stock, 52,018 performance-based RSUs, 79,187 nonperformance-based RSUs and 112,763 restricted shares of VF Common Stock were converted into Kontoor Brands equity awards.
Disclosures reported below have not been segregated between continuing and discontinued operations.

Stock Options
Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of VF Common Stock on the date of grant. Employee stock options vest in equal annual installments over three years, and compensation cost is recognized ratably over the shorter of the requisite service period or the vesting period. Stock options granted to nonemployee members of VF’s Board of Directors vest upon grant and become exercisable one year from the date of grant. All options have ten-year terms.
The grant date fair value of each option award is calculated using a lattice option-pricing valuation model, which incorporates a range of assumptions for inputs as follows:
Expected volatility over the contractual term of an option was based on a combination of the implied volatility from publicly traded options on VF Common Stock and the historical volatility of VF Common Stock. The expected term represents the period of time over which vested options are expected to be outstanding before exercise. VF used historical data to estimate option exercise behaviors and to estimate the number of options that would vest.
Groups of employees that have historically exhibited similar option exercise behaviors were considered separately in estimating the expected term for each employee group. Dividend yield represents expected dividends on VF Common Stock for the contractual life of the options. Risk-free interest rates for the periods during the contractual life of the option were the implied yields at the date of grant from the U.S. Treasury zero coupon yield curve.
Stock option activity for the year ended March 2020 is summarized as follows:
The total fair value of stock options that vested during the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017 was $16.6 million, $26.8 million, $28.3 million and $28.0 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017 was $120.6 million, $171.6 million, $57.3 million and $106.7 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units
VF grants performance-based RSUs that enable employees to receive shares of VF Common Stock at the end of a three-year period. Each performance-based RSU has a potential final payout ranging from zero to two shares of VF Common Stock. For performance-based RSUs granted prior to February 2018, the number of shares earned by participants, if any, is based on achievement of a three-year baseline profitability goal and annually established performance goals set by the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. For performance-based RSUs granted in the three months ended March 2018, Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2020, the number of shares earned by participants, if any, is based on achievement of three-year financial targets set by the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. For all performance-based RSUs, shares are issued to participants in the year following the conclusion of each three-year performance period.
The actual number of shares earned may also be adjusted upward or downward by 25% of the target award, based on how VF’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) over the three-year period compares to the TSR for companies included in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Consumer Discretionary Index for grants issued in the three months ended March 2018, Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2020, and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index for grants issued in the year ended December 2017. The grant date fair value of the TSR-based adjustment was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation
technique that incorporates option-pricing model inputs, and was $7.11, $4.61, $4.61 and $2.67 per share for the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three-month period ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017 performance-based RSU grants, respectively.
VF also grants nonperformance-based RSUs to certain key employees in international jurisdictions and to nonemployee members of the Board of Directors. Each nonperformance-based RSU entitles the holder to one share of VF Common Stock. The employee nonperformance-based RSUs generally vest over periods of up to four years from the date of grant. The nonperformance-based RSUs granted to nonemployee members of the Board of Directors vest upon grant and will be settled in shares of VF Common Stock one year from the date of grant.
In addition, VF grants nonperformance-based RSU to employees as part of its stock compensation program. Each nonperformance-based RSU entitles the holder to one share of VF Common Stock. These awards generally vest 50% over a two-year period and 50% over a four-year period from the date of grant.
Dividend equivalents on the RSUs accrue without compounding and are payable in additional shares of VF Common Stock when the RSUs vest. Dividend equivalents are subject to the same risk of forfeiture as the RSUs.
RSU activity for the year ended March 2020 is summarized as follows:
The weighted average fair value of performance-based RSUs granted during the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017 was $84.28, $80.39, $74.80 and $53.69 per share, respectively, which was equal to the fair market value of the underlying VF Common Stock on each grant date. The total market value of awards outstanding at the end of March 2020 was $65.9 million. Awards earned and vested for the three-year performance period ended in March 2019 and distributed in early Fiscal 2020 totaled 837,045 shares of VF Common Stock having a value of $71.6 million. Similarly, 450,175 shares of VF Common Stock having a value of $36.4 million were earned for the performance period ended in December 2017.
The weighted average fair value of nonperformance-based RSUs granted during the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017 was $84.22, $79.21, $74.80 and $57.49 per share, respectively, which was equal to the fair market value of the underlying VF Common Stock on each grant date. The total market value of awards outstanding at the end of March 2020 was $31.0 million.

Restricted Stock
VF grants restricted shares of VF Common Stock to certain members of management. The fair value of the restricted shares, equal to the fair market value of VF Common Stock at the grant date, is recognized ratably over the vesting period. Restricted shares vest over periods of up to five years from the date of grant. Dividends accumulate in the form of additional restricted shares and are subject to the same risk of forfeiture as the restricted stock.
Restricted stock activity for the year ended March 2020 is summarized below:
Nonvested shares of restricted stock had a market value of $31.4 million at the end of March 2020. The market value of the shares that vested during the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017 was $3.6 million, $8.7 million, $3.9 million and $19.4 million, respectively.

The provision for income taxes was computed based on the following amounts of income from continuing operations before income taxes:
The provision for income taxes consisted of:

March 2020
On May 19, 2019, Switzerland voted to approve the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing ("Swiss Tax Act"). Provisions of the Swiss Tax Act were enacted for Swiss federal purposes during the second quarter of Fiscal 2020, and later enacted for certain cantons during the fourth quarter. These provisions resulted in adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities such that a net tax benefit of $93.6 million was recorded for the year ended March 2020.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("U.S. Tax Act"). In response to the complexities and ambiguity surrounding the U.S. Tax Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission released Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ("SAB 118") to provide companies with relief around the initial accounting for the U.S. Tax Act, providing a one-year measurement period for companies to analyze and finalize accounting for the Tax Act.
VF finalized its accounting for the U.S. Tax Act during the one-year measurement period under SAB 118 and recognized additional net
charges of $18.2 million, resulting in a cumulative net charge of $483.7 million. The measurement period adjustments included $5.1 million of net tax benefit recognized in the three months ended March 2018 and $23.3 million of net tax expense recognized during the year ended March 2019.
On January 15, 2019 final regulations under Section 965 related to the transition tax were released. After analyzing these regulations, the Company recorded an additional net charge of $13.9 million during the year ended March 2019, primarily comprised of $20.7 million tax expense related to transition tax and a net tax benefit of $6.8 million related to a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the final regulations.
The income tax payable attributable to the transition tax is due over an 8-year period beginning in 2018. At March 28, 2020, a noncurrent income tax payable of approximately $372.3 million attributable to the transition tax is reflected in the other liabilities line item of the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
The differences between income taxes computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate and income tax expense reported in the consolidated financial statements are as follows:
Income tax expense includes tax benefits of $13.4 million, $6.3 million, $9.8 million and $10.1 million in the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017, respectively, from favorable audit outcomes on certain tax matters and from expiration of statutes of limitations.
VF was granted a ruling which lowered the effective income tax rate on taxable earnings for years 2010 through 2014 under Belgium’s excess profit tax regime. In February 2015, the European Union Commission (“EU”) opened a state aid investigation into Belgium’s rulings. On January 11, 2016, the EU announced its decision that these rulings were illegal and ordered that tax benefits granted under these rulings should be collected from the affected companies, including VF.
On March 22, 2016, the Belgium government filed an appeal seeking annulment of the EU decision. Additionally, on June 21, 2016, VF Europe BVBA filed its own application for annulment of the EU decision.
On December 22, 2016, Belgium adopted a law which entitled the Belgium tax authorities to issue tax assessments, and demand timely payments from companies which benefited from the excess profits regime. On January 10, 2017, VF Europe BVBA received an assessment for €31.9 million tax and interest related to excess profits benefits received in prior years. VF Europe BVBA remitted €31.9 million ($33.9 million) on January 13, 2017, which was recorded as an income tax receivable in 2017 based on the expected success of the aforementioned requests for annulment. An additional assessment of €3.1 million ($3.8 million) was received and paid in January 2018. On February 14, 2019 the General Court annulled the EU decision and on April 26, 2019 the EU appealed the General Court's annulment. Both listed requests for annulment remain open and unresolved. Additionally, the EU has initiated proceedings related to individual rulings granted by Belgium, including the ruling granted to VF. If this matter is adversely resolved, these amounts will not be collected by VF.
In addition, VF has been granted a lower effective income tax rate on taxable earnings in another foreign jurisdiction that will expire as of the end of June 2020. This lower rate, when compared with
VF Corporation Fiscal 2020 Form 10-K
VF CORPORATION
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
March 2020
the country’s statutory rate, resulted in income tax reductions of $15.3 million ($0.04 per diluted share) in the year ended March 2020, $15.7 million ($0.04 per diluted share) in the year ended
March 2019, $7.5 million ($0.02 per diluted share) in the three months ended March 2018 and $17.8 million ($0.04 per diluted share) in the year ended December 2017.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:
At the end of Fiscal 2020, the Company is not asserting indefinite reinvestment with regards to short-term liquid assets of its foreign subsidiaries, as well as certain noncurrent assets that are expected to be converted to liquid assets in the foreseeable future. All other foreign earnings, including basis differences of certain foreign subsidiaries, continue to be considered indefinitely reinvested. As of the end of Fiscal 2020, there was $3.9 billion of undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries which have substantially been included for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but if distributed could result in additional U.S. state income or other taxes. The Company has not determined the deferred tax liability associated with these undistributed earnings and basis differences, as such determination is not practicable.
VF has potential tax benefits totaling $213.0 million for foreign operating loss carryforwards, of which $160.3 million have an unlimited carryforward life. In addition, there are $15.7 million of potential tax benefits for federal and state capital loss
carryforwards that begin to expire in 2022 and $8.6 million of potential tax benefits for state operating loss and credit carryforwards that expire between 2021 and 2040.
A valuation allowance has been provided where it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to those operating loss carryforwards will not be realized. Valuation allowances totaled $158.4 million for available foreign operating loss carryforwards, $2.7 million for available capital loss carryforwards, $5.4 million for available state operating loss and credit carryforwards, and $6.4 million for other foreign deferred income tax assets. During Fiscal 2020, VF had a net decrease in valuation allowances of $2.5 million related to capital loss carryforwards, a net decrease of $9.7 million related to state operating loss and credit carryforwards and an increase of $7.1 million related to foreign operating loss carryforwards and other foreign deferred tax assets, inclusive of foreign currency effects.

for the current and prior years and has concluded that VF’s provision for income taxes is adequate. The outcome of any one examination is not expected to have a material impact on VF’s consolidated financial statements. Management believes that some of these audits and negotiations will conclude during the next
12 months. Management also believes that it is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits may decrease by $16.9 million within the next 12 months due to settlement of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations, $9.8 million of which would reduce income tax expense.
NOTE 20 - REPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION
The chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based on a global brand view which represents VF's operating segments. The operating segments have been evaluated and combined into reportable segments because they have met the similar economic characteristics and qualitative aggregation criteria set forth in the relevant accounting guidance. Based on this assessment, the Company's reportable segments have been identified as: Outdoor, Active and Work.
Below is a description of VF's reportable segments and the brands included within each:
Other - included in the tables below for purposes of reconciliation of revenues and profit, but it is not considered a reportable segment. Other includes results related to the sale of non-VF products and transition services primarily related to the sale of the Nautica® brand business.
The Company continuously assesses the composition of its portfolio to ensure it is aligned with its strategic objectives and positioned to maximize growth and return to shareholders. In doing so, it evaluates whether changes may need to be made to our internal reporting structure to better support and assess the operations of our business going forward. If changes are made, we will assess the resulting effect on our reportable segments, operating segments and reporting units, if any.
The primary financial measures used by management to evaluate the financial results of VF's reportable segments are segment revenues and segment profit. Segment profit comprises the operating income and other income (expense), net line items of each segment.
Accounting policies used for internal management reporting at the individual segments are consistent with those in Note 1, except as stated below. Corporate costs (other than common costs allocated to the segments), impairment charges and net interest expense are not controlled by segment management and therefore are excluded from the measurement of segment profit. Common costs such as information systems processing, retirement benefits and insurance are allocated from corporate costs to the segments based on appropriate metrics such as usage or employment.
Corporate costs that are not allocated to the segments consist of corporate headquarters expenses (including compensation and benefits of corporate management and staff, certain legal and professional fees and administrative and general costs) and other expenses which include a portion of defined benefit pension costs, development costs for management information systems, costs of registering, maintaining and enforcing certain of VF’s trademarks and miscellaneous consolidated costs. Defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. are centrally managed. The current year service cost component of pension cost is allocated to the segments, while the remaining pension cost components are reported in corporate and other expenses.
Segment assets, for internal management purposes, are those used directly in or resulting from the operations of each business, which are accounts receivable and inventories. Segment assets included in the Other category represent balances related to transition services and other corporate activities, and are provided for purposes of reconciliation as the Other category is not considered a reportable segment. Total expenditures for additions to long-lived assets are not disclosed as this information is not regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker at the segment level.

VF is obligated under noncancelable operating leases. Refer to Note 10 for additional information related to future lease payments.
VF has entered into licensing agreements that provide VF rights to market products under trademarks owned by other parties. Royalties under these agreements are recognized in cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain of these agreements contain minimum advertising requirements. Future minimum advertising payments are $16.2 million, $7.3 million, $4.3 million, $2.2 million and $1.7 million for fiscal years 2021 through 2025, respectively, and $7.1 million thereafter.
In the ordinary course of business, VF has entered into purchase commitments for finished products, raw materials and contract production. Total payments required under these agreements are $1.7 billion, $12.1 million, $10.1 million and $9.4 million for fiscal years 2021 through 2024, respectively, and no commitments thereafter.
VF has entered into commitments for (i) capital spending, (ii) service and maintenance agreements related to its management information systems, and (iii) advertising. Future payments under these agreements are $249.0 million, $84.3 million, $49.6 million, $6.7 million and $4.6 million for fiscal years 2021 through 2025, respectively, and $0.3 million thereafter.
Surety bonds, customs bonds, standby letters of credit and international bank guarantees, all of which represent contingent guarantees of performance under self-insurance and other
programs, totaled $107.5 million as of March 2020. These commitments would only be drawn upon if VF were to fail to meet its claims or other obligations.
Contingencies
The Company petitioned the U.S. Tax Court to resolve an IRS dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with the 2011 Timberland acquisition. The Company remains confident in our timing and treatment of the income inclusion, and therefore this matter is not reflected in our financial statements. We are vigorously defending our position, and do not expect the resolution to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While the IRS argues immediate income inclusion, the Company's position is to include the income over a period of years. As the matter relates to 2011, nearly half of the timing in dispute has passed with the Company including the income, and paying the related tax, on our income tax returns. The Company notes that should the IRS prevail in this timing matter, the net interest expense would be up to $158 million. Further, this timing matter is impacted by the U.S. Tax Act that reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. If the IRS is successful, this rate differential would increase tax expense by approximately $136 million.
The Company is currently involved in other legal proceedings that are ordinary, routine litigation incidental to the business. The resolution of any particular proceeding is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
NOTE 22 - EARNINGS PER SHARE
Outstanding options to purchase 1.5 million, 0.5 million and 6.9 million shares of Common Stock were excluded from the calculations of diluted earnings per share in the years ended March 2020, March 2019 and December 2017, respectively, because the effect of their inclusion would have been antidilutive to those years. For the three months ended March 2018, all outstanding options to purchase shares were dilutive and included in the calculation of

NOTE 23 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified in a three-level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation process. A financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The hierarchy is based on the observability and objectivity of the pricing inputs, as follows:
•
Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
•
Level 2 - Significant directly observable data (other than Level 1 quoted prices) or significant indirectly observable
data through corroboration with observable market data. Inputs would normally be (i) quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, (ii) quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or (iii) information derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
•
Level 3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require significant unobservable data inputs. These inputs would normally be VF’s own data and judgments about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Recurring Fair Value Measurements
The following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured and recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis:
The amounts reported in the table above for the prior period have not been segregated between continuing and discontinued operations. The March 2019 balances include $50.8 million of deferred compensation liabilities and associated assets related to the Jeans business, which were transferred in connection with the spin-off.
(a)
There were no transfers among the levels within the fair value hierarchy during the years ended March 2020 or 2019.
VF’s cash equivalents include money market funds and short-term time deposits that approximate fair value based on Level 1 measurements. The fair value of derivative financial instruments, which consist of foreign exchange forward contracts, is determined based on observable market inputs (Level 2), including spot and forward exchange rates for foreign currencies, and considers the credit risk of the Company and its counterparties. Investment
securities are held in VF’s deferred compensation plans as an economic hedge of the related deferred compensation liabilities (Note 16). These investments primarily include mutual funds (Level 1) that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets, and as of March 2019, also included a separately managed fixed-income fund (Level 2) with underlying investments that are valued based on quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or

March 2020
quoted prices in inactive markets for identical assets. Liabilities related to VF’s deferred compensation plans are recorded at amounts due to participants, based on the fair value of the participants’ selection of hypothetical investments.
All other financial assets and financial liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at cost, except life insurance contracts which are recorded at cash surrender value. These other financial assets and financial liabilities include cash held as demand deposits, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, accounts payable and accrued liabilities. At March 2020 and 2019, their carrying values approximated their fair values. Additionally, at March 2020 and 2019, the carrying values of VF’s long-term debt, including the current portion, were $2,609.3 million and $2,121.1 million, respectively, compared with fair values of $2,672.9 million and $2,318.6 million at those respective dates. Fair value for long-term debt is a Level 2 estimate based on quoted market prices or values of comparable borrowings.
Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements
Certain non-financial assets, primarily property, plant and equipment, lease right-of-use assets, goodwill and intangible assets, are not required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are reported at carrying value. However, these assets are required to be assessed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be fully recoverable, and at least annually for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. In the event an impairment is required, the asset is adjusted to fair value, using market-based assumptions.
The Company recorded $14.6 million, $6.0 million and $17.2 million of impairments in the years ended March 2020 and 2019 and the year ended December 2017, respectively, related to retail store assets, associated lease right-of-use assets and other fixed assets. These impairments are recorded in the selling, general and administrative expenses line item in the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no significant impairment charges during the three months ended March 2018.
During the three months ended September 28, 2019, management performed a quantitative impairment analysis of the Timberland reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset. Based on the analysis, management concluded that the goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible asset were not impaired.
Management performed its annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020. Management performed a quantitative analysis of the Timberland and Altra reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets. A qualitative analysis was performed for all other reporting units and indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets. No impairment charges of goodwill or indefinite-lived trademark intangible assets were recorded as a result of the annual impairment testing completed as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020.
As of March 28, 2020, management determined that the unfavorable projected financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was a triggering event that required management to perform quantitative impairment analyses over the Timberland, Altra and Icebreaker reporting unit goodwill and indefinite-lived trademark
intangible assets. A goodwill impairment charge of $323.2 million was recorded in the year ended March 2020 related to the Timberland reporting unit. No other impairment charges were recorded as a result of the impairment testing completed as of March 28, 2020.
See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional discussion regarding non-recurring fair value measurements during the year ended March 2020.
No impairment charges of goodwill or intangible assets were recorded in the year ended March 2019, the three months ended March 2018 or the year ended December 2017 for VF's continuing operations.
Our impairment testing of goodwill, trademarks and customer relationship intangible assets utilizes significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) to determine fair value.
The fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment testing is determined using a combination of two valuation methods: an income approach and a market approach. The income approach is based on projected future (debt-free) cash flows that are discounted to present value. The appropriate discount rate is based on the reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) that takes market participant assumptions into consideration. For the market approach, management uses both the guideline company and similar transaction methods. The guideline company method analyzes market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) for a group of comparable public companies. The market multiples used in the valuation are based on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the reporting unit compared to the selected guideline companies. Under the similar transactions method, valuation multiples are calculated utilizing actual transaction prices and revenue/EBITDA data from target companies deemed similar to the reporting unit.
Management uses the income-based relief-from-royalty method to value trademark intangible assets. Under this method, revenues expected to be generated by the trademark are multiplied by a selected royalty rate. The royalty rate is selected based on consideration of (i) royalty rates included in active license agreements, if applicable, (ii) royalty rates received by market participants in the apparel industry, and (iii) the current performance of the reporting unit. The estimated after-tax royalty revenue stream is then discounted to present value using the reporting unit’s WACC plus a spread that factors in the risk of the intangible asset.
Management’s revenue and profitability forecasts used in the reporting unit and intangible asset valuations were developed in conjunction with management’s strategic plan review, and our resulting revised outlook for business performance, and considered recent performance and trends, including the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, strategic initiatives and industry trends. Assumptions used in the valuations are similar to those that would be used by market participants performing independent valuations of these businesses.

NOTE 24 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
Summary of Derivative Financial Instruments
All of VF’s outstanding derivative financial instruments are foreign exchange forward contracts. Although derivatives meet the criteria for hedge accounting at the inception of the hedging relationship, a limited number of derivative contracts intended to hedge assets and liabilities are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. The notional amounts of all outstanding derivative
contracts were $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion at March 2020 and 2019, respectively, consisting primarily of contracts hedging exposures to the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Swiss franc, South Korean won, Swedish krona, Japanese yen, Polish zloty and New Zealand dollar. Derivative contracts have maturities up to 20 months.
The following table presents outstanding derivatives on an individual contract basis:
VF records and presents the fair values of all of its derivative assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis, even though they are subject to master netting agreements. If VF were to offset and record the asset and liability balances of its foreign exchange forward contracts on a net basis in accordance with the terms of its master netting agreements, the amounts presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 2020 and 2019 would be adjusted from the current gross presentation to the net amounts as detailed in the following table:
Derivatives are classified as current or noncurrent based on maturity dates, as follows:
Cash Flow Hedges
VF uses derivative contracts primarily to hedge a portion of the exchange risk for its forecasted sales, purchases, production costs, operating costs and intercompany royalties. The effects of cash flow hedging included in VF’s Consolidated Statements of Income and Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are summarized as follows:

Derivative Contracts Not Designated as Hedges
VF uses derivative contracts to manage foreign currency exchange risk on third-party accounts receivable and payable, as well as intercompany borrowings. These contracts are not designated as hedges, and are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the fair values of these instruments are recognized directly in earnings. Gains or losses on these contracts largely offset the net transaction losses or gains on the related assets and liabilities. In the case of derivative contracts executed on foreign currency exposures that are no longer probable of occurring, VF de-designates these hedges and the fair value changes of these instruments are also recognized directly in earnings. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions expected to be taken by the Company, certain derivative contracts were de-designated as hedged forecasted transactions were no longer deemed probable of occurring. Accordingly, the Company reclassified amounts from accumulated OCI and recognized a $9.8 million net gain during the three months ended March 2020, of which a $10.8 million gain was recorded in cost of goods sold and a $1.0 million loss was recorded in net revenues.
Foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedges as of March 2020 also include contracts still owned by VF that are related to the former Jeans business. In connection with the spin-off, VF transferred the value of the unrecognized gain on these contracts to Kontoor Brands.
The changes in fair value of derivative contracts not designated as hedges that have been recognized as gains or losses in VF's Consolidated Statements of Income were not material for the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017.
Other Derivative Information
At March 2020, accumulated OCI included $60.2 million of pre-tax net deferred gains for foreign currency exchange contracts that are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months. The amounts ultimately reclassified to earnings will depend on exchange rates in effect when outstanding derivative contracts are settled.
VF entered into interest rate swap derivative contracts in 2011 and 2003 to hedge the interest rate risk for issuance of long-term debt due in 2021 and 2033, respectively. In each case, the contracts were terminated concurrent with the issuance of the debt, and the realized gain or loss was deferred in accumulated OCI. In connection with the full redemption of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2021 notes in March 2020, the remaining pre-tax net deferred loss of $8.5 million was recorded in the interest expense line item in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The remaining pre-tax net deferred gain, associated with the 2033 notes, in accumulated OCI was $1.4 million at March 2020, which will be reclassified into interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining terms of the associated debt instrument. During the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017, VF reclassified $13.2 million, $5.0 million, $1.2 million and $4.7 million, respectively, of net deferred losses from accumulated OCI into interest expense. VF expects to reclassify $0.1 million to interest expense during the next 12 months.
Net Investment Hedge
The Company has designated its €1.850 billion of euro-denominated fixed-rate notes as a net investment hedge of VF’s investment in certain foreign operations. Because this debt qualified as a nonderivative hedging instrument, foreign currency transaction gains or losses of the debt are deferred in the foreign currency translation and other component of accumulated OCI as an offset to the foreign currency translation adjustments on the hedged investments. During the years ended March 2020 and 2019, the three months ended March 2018 and the year ended December 2017, the Company recognized an after-tax loss of $8.8 million, an after-tax gain of $69.5 million, an after-tax loss of $19.2 million and an after-tax loss of $92.9 million, respectively, in OCI related to the net investment hedge transaction. Any amounts deferred in accumulated OCI will remain until the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated.
