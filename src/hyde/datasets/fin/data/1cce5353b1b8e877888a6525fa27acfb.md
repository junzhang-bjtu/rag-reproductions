Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The management of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the framework established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013).
Additionally, our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying statement of condition of Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (the "Bank") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of capital, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). We also have audited the Bank's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Bank as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Bank maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Bank's management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 8. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Bank’s financial statements and on the Bank's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Bank in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (ii)involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Valuation of Interest-Rate Derivatives and Hedged Items
As described in Notes 8 and 15 to the financial statements, the Bank uses derivative instruments to reduce funding costs and/or to manage interest-rate risks. The total notional amount of derivatives as of December 31, 2020 was $15.5 billion, of which 64% were designated as hedging instruments, and the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020 was $161 million and $24 million, respectively. The fair values of interest-rate derivatives and hedged items are determined using standard valuation techniques such as discounted cash-flow analysis and comparisons with similar instruments. The discounted cash-flow model uses market-observable inputs, including discount rate,forward interest rate, and volatility assumptions.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of interest-rate derivatives and hedged items is a critical audit matter are the significant audit effort in evaluating the discount rate, forward interest rate, and volatility assumptions used to fair value these derivatives and hedged items, and the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of interest-rate derivatives and hedged items,including controls over the model, data and assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in developing an independent range of prices for a sample of interest-rate derivatives and hedged items and comparison of management’s estimate to the independently developed ranges. Developing the independent range of prices involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management and independently developing the discount rate, forward interest rate, and volatility assumptions.

FEDERAL HOME LOAN BANK OF BOSTON
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 1 - Background Information
We are a federally chartered corporation and one of 11 district Federal Home Loan Banks (the FHLBanks or the FHLBank System). The FHLBanks are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that were organized under the Federal Home Loan Bank Act of 1932, as amended (FHLBank Act), to serve the public by enhancing the availability of credit for residential mortgages, targeted community development and economic growth. Each FHLBank operates in a specifically defined geographic territory, or district. We provide a readily available, competitively priced source of funds to our members and certain nonmember institutions located within the six New England states, which are Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. Certain regulated financial institutions, including community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and insurance companies with their principal places of business in New England and engaged in residential housing finance, may apply for membership. Additionally, certain nonmember institutions (referred to as housing associates) that meet applicable legal criteria may also borrow from us. While eligible to borrow, housing associates are not eligible to become members and, therefore, are not allowed to hold capital stock. As we are a cooperative, current and former members own all of our outstanding capital stock and may receive dividends on their investment. We do not have any wholly or partially owned subsidiaries, and we do not have an equity position in any partnerships, corporations, or off-balance-sheet special-purpose entities.
All members must purchase our stock as a condition of membership and as a condition of engaging in certain business activities with us.
The FHFA, our primary regulator, is the independent federal regulator of the FHLBanks, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), and Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). A purpose of the FHFA is to ensure that the FHLBanks operate in a safe and sound manner, including maintenance of adequate capital and internal controls. In addition, the FHFA is responsible for ensuring that 1) the operations and activities of each FHLBank foster liquid, efficient, competitive, and resilient national housing finance markets, 2) each FHLBank complies with the title and the rules, regulations, guidelines, and orders issued under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) and the authorizing statutes, 3) each FHLBank carries out its statutory mission through only activities that are authorized under and consistent with HERA and the authorizing statutes, and 4) the activities of each FHLBank and the manner in which such FHLBank is operated is consistent with the public interest. Each FHLBank is a separate legal entity with its own management, employees, and board of directors.
The Office of Finance is the FHLBanks' fiscal agent and is a joint office of the FHLBanks established to facilitate the issuance and servicing of the FHLBanks' COs and to prepare the combined quarterly and annual financial reports of all the FHLBanks. As provided by the FHLBank Act, and applicable regulations, COs are backed only by the financial resources of all the FHLBanks and are our primary source of funds. Deposits, other borrowings, and the issuance of capital stock, which is principally held by our current and former members, provide other funds. We primarily use these funds to provide loans, called advances, to invest in single-family mortgage loans under the Mortgage Partnership Finance® (MPF®) program, and also to fund other investments. In addition, we offer correspondent services, such as wire-transfer, securities-safekeeping, and settlement services.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Use of Estimates
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make subjective assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The most significant of these estimates include but are not limited to, accounting for derivatives and hedging activities, estimation of fair values, and amortization of premiums and discounts associated with prepayable mortgage-backed securities. Actual results could differ from these estimates.
Fair Value
We determine the fair-value amounts recorded on the statement of condition and in the note disclosures for the periods presented by using available market and other pertinent information, and reflect our best judgment of appropriate valuation
methods. Although we use our best judgment in estimating the fair value of these financial instruments, there are inherent limitations in any valuation technique. Therefore, these fair values may not be indicative of the amounts that would have been realized in market transactions at the reporting dates. See Note 15 - Fair Values for more information.
Financial Instruments Meeting Netting Requirements
We present certain financial instruments on a net basis when they are subject to a legal right of offset and all other requirements for netting are met (collectively referred to as the netting requirements). For these financial instruments, we have elected to offset our asset and liability positions, as well as cash collateral received or pledged, when we have met the netting requirements.
The net exposure for these financial instruments can change on a daily basis; therefore, there may be a delay between the time this exposure change is identified and additional collateral is requested, and the time when this collateral is received or pledged. Likewise, there may be a delay for excess collateral to be returned. For derivative instruments that meet the requirements for netting, any excess cash collateral received or pledged is recognized as a derivative liability or derivative asset. See Note 8 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities for additional information regarding these agreements.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell are also subject to netting requirements. Based on the fair value of the related collateral held, the securities purchased under agreements to resell were fully collateralized for the periods presented. There were no offsetting amounts related to these securities at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
Beginning January 1, 2020, the Bank adopted, on a modified retrospective basis, new accounting guidance pertaining to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments that requires a financial asset or group of financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The new guidance also requires credit losses relating to these financial instruments as well as available-for-sale securities be recorded through the allowance for credit losses. Consistent with the modified retrospective method of adoption, the prior period has not been revised to conform to the new basis of accounting. Key changes to our accounting policies based on this guidance are detailed below.
Interest-Bearing Deposits, Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell, and Federal Funds Sold
We invest in interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold. Interest-bearing deposits include bank notes not meeting the definition of a security. Securities purchased under agreements to resell are treated as short-term collateralized loans. Federal funds sold consist of short-term, unsecured loans transacted with counterparties that we consider to be of investment quality. These investments provide short-term liquidity and are carried at cost. Accrued interest receivable is recorded separately on the statements of condition. If applicable, an allowance for credit losses is recorded with a corresponding adjustment to the provision for credit losses. Interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold are evaluated quarterly for expected credit losses if not expected to be repaid according to the contractual terms. We have not sold or repledged the collateral received on securities purchased under agreements to resell.
Beginning January 1, 2020, we adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses accounting guidance. Under this new guidance, we use the collateral maintenance provision practical expedient for securities purchased under agreements to resell. Consequently, a credit loss would be recognized if there is a collateral shortfall which we do not believe the counterparty will replenish in accordance with its contractual terms. The credit loss would be limited to the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the investment’s amortized cost.
Prior to January 1, 2020, securities purchased under agreements to resell were evaluated for credit losses if there was a collateral shortfall which we did not believe the counterparty would replenish in accordance with the contractual terms.
See Note 5 - Investments for details on the allowance methodologies relating to these investments.
Investment Securities
We classify investments as trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity at the date of acquisition. Purchases and sales of securities are recorded on a trade date basis.
Trading. Securities classified as trading are held for liquidity purposes and carried at fair value. We record changes in the fair value of these investments through other income as net unrealized gains (losses) on trading securities. FHFA regulations prohibit trading in or the speculative use of these instruments and limit the credit risks we have from these instruments.
Available-for-sale. We classify certain investments that are not classified as held-to-maturity or trading as available-for-sale and carry them at fair value. Changes in fair value of available-for-sale securities not being hedged by derivatives, or in an economic hedging relationship, are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). For available-for-sale securities that have been hedged under fair-value hedge designations, we record the portion of the change in the fair value of the investment related to the risk being hedged in available-for-sale interest income together with the related change in the fair value of the derivative. Prior to January 1, 2019, this amount was recorded in other income as net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities. The remainder of the change in the fair value of the investment is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) as net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities.
Additionally, beginning January 1, 2020, we adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses accounting guidance. Under this new guidance, for securities classified as available-for-sale, we evaluate an individual security for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the security’s fair value to its amortized cost. Accrued interest receivable is recorded separately on the statements of condition and is not included in the amortized cost basis. Impairment exists when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost. In assessing whether a credit loss exists on an impaired security, we consider whether there would be a shortfall in receiving all cash flows contractually due on the investment. When a shortfall is considered possible, we compare the present value of cash flows to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows is less than amortized cost, an allowance-for-credit losses is recorded with a corresponding adjustment to the provision for credit losses. The allowance is limited to the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value on the individual security and excludes uncollectible accrued interest receivable, which is measured separately.
If management intends to sell an impaired security classified as available-for-sale, or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before expected recovery of its amortized cost basis, any allowance for credit losses is written off and the amortized cost basis is written down to the security’s fair value at the reporting date with any incremental impairment reported in earnings as net gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities. If management does not intend to sell an impaired security classified as available-for-sale and it is not more likely than not that management will be required to sell the debt security, then the credit portion of the difference is recognized as an allowance for credit losses and any remaining difference between the security’s fair value and amortized cost is recorded to net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities within other comprehensive income (loss).
See Investment Securities - Other-than-Temporary Impairment below for the accounting policy relating to credit losses in effect prior to January 1, 2020.
Held-to-Maturity. Certain investments for which we have both the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and are carried at amortized cost, which is original cost net of periodic principal repayments and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the level-yield method adjusted for other-than-temporary impairment losses recorded prior to January 1, 2020. Accrued interest receivable is recorded separately on the statement of condition.
Certain changes in circumstances may cause us to change our intent to hold a security to maturity without calling into question our intent to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future. Thus, the sale or transfer of a held-to-maturity security due to certain changes in circumstances, such as evidence of significant deterioration in the issuer's creditworthiness or changes in regulatory requirements, is not considered to be inconsistent with its original classification. Other events that are isolated, nonrecurring, and unusual for us that could not have been reasonably anticipated may cause us to sell or transfer a held-to-maturity security without necessarily calling into question out intent to hold other debt securities to maturity. In addition, sale of a debt security that meets either of the following two conditions would not be considered inconsistent with the original classification of that security.
•The sale occurs near enough to its maturity date (for example, within three months of maturity), or call date if exercise of the call is probable, that interest-rate risk is substantially eliminated as a pricing factor and the changes in market interest rates would not have a significant effect on the security's fair value; or
•The sale of a security occurs after we have already collected a substantial portion (at least 85 percent) of the principal outstanding at acquisition due either to prepayments on the debt security or to scheduled payments on a debt security payable in equal installments (both principal and interest) over its term.
Additionally, during the third quarter of 2020 we adopted a provision of the Accounting Standards Update titled Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting which provides a one-time election to sell, transfer, or both sell and transfer debt securities classified as held-to-maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform and that were classified as held-to-maturity before January 1, 2020.
See Note 5 - Investments for a summary of our transfers and sales of investment securities.
Beginning January 1, 2020, we adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses accounting guidance. Under this new guidance, held-to-maturity securities are evaluated quarterly for expected credit losses on a pool basis unless an individual assessment is deemed necessary because the securities do not possess similar risk characteristics. An allowance for credit losses is recorded with a corresponding adjustment to the provision for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses excludes uncollectible accrued interest receivable, which is measured separately. Prior to January 1, 2020, credit losses were recorded as a direct write-down of the held-to-maturity security carrying value.
For improvements in expected future cash flows for held-to-maturity securities impaired prior to January 1, 2020, interest income continues to follow the recognition pattern pursuant to the impairment guidance in effect prior to January 1, 2020. Any additional recoveries of amounts previously written off prior to January 1, 2020, are recorded when received. For any improvements in expected future cash flows for held-to-maturity securities with an allowance for credit losses recognized after the adoption of the new guidance, the allowance for credit losses associated with recoveries may be derecognized up to its full amount immediately in the current period.
See Investment Securities - Other-than-Temporary Impairment below for the accounting policy relating to credit losses in effect prior to January 1, 2020.
Premiums and Discounts. We amortize premiums and accrete discounts on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) using the level-yield method over the estimated lives of the securities. This method requires a retrospective adjustment of the effective yield each time we change the estimated life, based on actual prepayments received and changes in expected prepayments, as if the new estimate had been known since the original acquisition date of the securities. We estimate prepayment speeds on each individual security using the most recent three months of historical constant prepayment rates, as available, or may subscribe to third-party data services that provide estimates of future cash flows, from which we determine expected asset lives. We amortize premiums and accrete discounts on other investments using the level-yield method to the contractual maturity of the securities.
Gains and Losses on Sales. We compute gains and losses on sales of investment securities using the specific identification method and include these gains and losses in other income (loss).
Investment Securities - Other-than-Temporary Impairment
Beginning January 1, 2020, we adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses accounting guidance. As a result, the accounting guidance related to other-than-temporary impairment accounting for investments was superseded as of that date.
Prior to January 1, 2020, we evaluated our individual available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities in an unrealized loss position for other-than-temporary impairment each quarter. An investment was considered impaired when its fair value was less than its amortized cost. We considered other-than-temporary impairment to have occurred if we:
•had an intent to sell the investment;
•believed it was more likely than not that we would be required to sell the investment before the recovery of its amortized cost based on available evidence; or
•did not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the debt security.
Recognition of Other-than-Temporary Impairment. If either of the first two conditions above was met, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment charge in earnings equal to the entire difference between the security's amortized cost and its fair value as of the statement of condition date.
For securities in an unrealized loss position that meet neither of the first two conditions (excluding agency MBS) and for each of our private-label MBS, we performed an analysis to determine if we would recover the entire amortized cost of each of these securities. The present value of the cash flows expected to be collected was compared with the amortized cost of the debt security to determine whether a credit loss existed. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected was less than
the amortized cost of the debt security, the security was deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired and the carrying value of the debt security was adjusted to its fair value. However, rather than recognizing the entire difference between the amortized cost and fair value in earnings, only the amount of the impairment representing the credit loss (that is, the credit component) was recognized in earnings, while the amount related to all other factors (that is, the noncredit component) was recognized in other comprehensive income (loss). For a security that was determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, in the event that the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected was less than the fair value of the security, the credit loss on the security was limited to the amount of that security's unrealized losses.
In performing a detailed cash-flow analysis, we estimated the cash flows expected to be collected. If this estimate resulted in a present value of expected cash flows (discounted at the security's effective yield) that was less than the amortized cost basis of a security (that is, a credit loss exists), other-than-temporary impairment was considered to have occurred. For determining the present value of variable-rate and hybrid private-label residential MBS, we used the effective interest rate derived from a variable-rate index, such as one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus the contractual spread, plus or minus a fixed-spread adjustment when there was an existing discount or premium on the security. Because the implied forward yield curve of a selected variable-rate index changes over time, the effective interest rates derived from that index will also change over time and would therefore impact the present value of the subject security.
Interest Income Recognition. Upon subsequent evaluation of a debt security when there was no additional other-than-temporary impairment, we adjusted the accretable yield on a prospective basis if there was a significant increase in the security's expected future cash flows. This adjusted yield was used to calculate the amount to be recognized into income over the remaining life of the security so as to match the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be collected. Subsequent changes in estimated cash flows that were deemed significant would change the accretable yield on a prospective basis. For debt securities classified as held-to-maturity, the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) was accreted to the carrying value of each security on a prospective basis, based on the amount and timing of future estimated cash flows. The estimated cash flows and accretable yield were re-evaluated each quarter.
Advances
Advances are carried at amortized cost, which is original cost net of periodic principal repayments, amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and fair value hedge adjustments, as discussed in Note 6 - Advances. We generally record our advances at par. However, we may record premiums or discounts on advances in the following cases:
•Advances may be acquired from another FHLBank when one of our members acquires a member of another FHLBank. In these cases, we may purchase the advances from the other FHLBank at a price that results in a fair market yield for the acquired advance.
•When the prepayment of an advance is followed by disbursement of a new advance and the transactions effectively represent a modification of the previous advance, the prepayment fee received is deferred, recorded as a discount to the modified advance, and accreted over the life of the new advance.
•When an advance is modified under our advance restructuring program and our analysis of the restructuring concludes that the transaction is an extinguishment of the prior advance rather than a modification, the deferred prepayment fee is recognized into income immediately, recorded as premium on the new advance, and amortized over the life of the new advance.
•When we make an AHP advance, the present value of the variation in the cash flow caused by the difference in the interest rate between the AHP advance rate and our related cost of funds for comparable maturity funding is charged against the AHP liability and recorded as a discount on the AHP advance.
•Advances issued under our Jobs for New England (JNE) and Helping to House New England (HHNE) programs have an interest rate at a significant discount to market rates. Due to the below market interest rate, we record a discount on the advance and an interest rate subsidy expense at the time that we transact the advance. The subsidy expense is recorded in other expense in the statement of operations.
We amortize the premiums and accrete the discounts on advances to interest income using the level-yield method. We record interest on advances to interest income as earned. Accrued interest receivable is recorded separately on the statements of condition.
Beginning January 1, 2020, we adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses accounting guidance. Under this new guidance, advances are evaluated quarterly for expected credit losses. Prior to January 1, 2020, we evaluated advances to determine if an allowance for credit losses was necessary if it was probable an impairment occurred in our advances portfolio as of the statement of condition date and the amount of loss could be reasonably estimated.
See Note 6 - Advances for details on the allowance methodology.
Prepayment Fees. We charge borrowers a prepayment fee when they prepay certain advances before the original maturity. We record prepayment fees net of hedging fair-value adjustments included in the carrying value of the advance as prepayment fees on advances, net in the interest income section of the statement of operations.
Advance Modifications. In cases in which we fund a new advance concurrently with or within a short period of time of the prepayment of an existing advance by the same member, we evaluate whether the new advance meets the accounting criteria to qualify as a modification of the existing advance or whether it constitutes a new advance. We compare the present value of cash flows on the new advance with the present value of cash flows remaining on the existing advance. If there is at least a 10 percent difference in the present value of cash flows or if we conclude the difference between the advances is more than minor based on a qualitative assessment of the modifications made to the advance's original contractual terms, the advance is accounted for as a new advance. In all other instances, the new advance is accounted for as a modification.
If a new advance qualifies as a modification of the existing advance, the net prepayment fee on the prepaid advance is deferred, recorded in the basis of the modified advance, and amortized to interest income over the life of the modified advance using the level-yield method. This amortization is recorded in advance interest income. If the modified advance is hedged, changes in fair value are recorded after the amortization of the basis adjustment in advance interest income. Prior to January 1, 2019, this amortization resulted in offsetting amounts being recorded in net interest income and net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities in other income.
For prepaid advances that were hedged and meet the hedge-accounting requirements, we terminate the hedging relationship upon prepayment and record the prepayment fee net of the hedging fair-value adjustment in the basis of the advance as advance interest income. If we fund a new advance to a member concurrent with or within a short period of time after the prepayment of a previous advance to that member, we evaluate whether the new advance qualifies as a modification of the original hedged advance. If the new advance qualifies as a modification of the original hedged advance, the hedging fair-value adjustment and the prepayment fee are included in the carrying amount of the modified advance and are amortized in interest income over the life of the modified advance using the level-yield method. If the modified advance is also hedged and the hedge meets the hedging criteria, the modified advance is marked to fair value after the modification, and subsequent fair-value changes are recorded in advance interest income. Prior to January 1, 2019, subsequent fair value changes were recorded in other income as net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.
If a new advance does not qualify as a modification of an existing advance, prepayment of the existing advance is treated as an advance termination and any prepayment fee, net of hedging adjustments, is recorded to advance interest income in the statement of operations.
Commitment Fees
We record commitment fees for standby letters of credit to members as deferred fee income when received, and amortize these fees on a straight-line basis to service-fees income in other income over the term of the standby letter of credit. Based upon past experience, we believe the likelihood of standby letters of credit being drawn upon is remote.

We participate in the MPF program through which we invest in conventional, residential, fixed-rate mortgage loans (conventional mortgage loans) and government-insured or -guaranteed residential fixed-rate mortgage loans (government mortgage loans) that are purchased from participating financial institutions (see Note 7 - Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio). We classify our investments in mortgage loans for which we have the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff as held for portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, all our investments in mortgage loans are held for portfolio. Mortgage loans held for portfolio are recorded at amortized cost, which is original cost, net of periodic principal repayments and amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, and direct write-downs. Accrued interest receivable is recorded separately on the statements of condition. We perform a quarterly assessment of our mortgage loans held for portfolio to estimate expected credit losses. An allowance for credit losses is recorded with a corresponding adjustment to the provision for credit losses. We do not purchase mortgage loans with credit deterioration present at the time of purchase.
Beginning January 1, 2020, we adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses accounting guidance. Under this new guidance, quarterly we measure expected credit losses on mortgage loans on a collective basis, pooling loans with similar risk characteristics. If a mortgage loan no longer shares risk characteristics with other loans, it is removed from the pool and
evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis. When developing the allowance for credit losses, we measure the expected loss over the estimated remaining life of a mortgage loan, which also considers how our credit enhancements mitigate credit losses. If a loan is purchased at a discount, the discount does not offset the allowance for credit losses. We include estimates of expected recoveries within the allowance for credit losses.
The allowance excludes uncollectible accrued interest receivable, as we write off accrued interest receivable by reversing interest income if a mortgage loan is placed on nonaccrual status.
Prior to January 1, 2020, we recorded an allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans if it was probable an impairment occurred in our mortgage loans held for portfolio as of the statement of condition date and the amount of loss could be reasonably estimated. A loan was considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it was probable that we would be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.
Premiums and Discounts. We compute the amortization of mortgage-loan-origination fees (premiums and discounts) as interest income using the level-yield method over the contractual term to maturity of each individual loan, which results in income recognition in a manner that is effectively proportionate to the actual repayment behavior of the underlying assets and reflects the contractual terms of the assets without regard to changes in estimated prepayments based on assumptions about future borrower behavior.
Credit-Enhancement Fees. For conventional mortgage loans, participating financial institutions retain a portion of the credit risk on the loans in which we invest by providing credit-enhancement protection either through a direct liability to pay credit losses up to a specified amount or through a contractual obligation to provide supplemental mortgage insurance. Participating financial institutions are paid a credit-enhancement fee for assuming credit risk and in some instances all or a portion of the credit-enhancement fee may be performance-based. Credit-enhancement fees are paid monthly and are determined based on the remaining unpaid principal balance of the pertinent MPF loans. The required credit-enhancement amount varies depending on the MPF product. Credit-enhancement fees are recorded as an offset to mortgage-loan-interest income. To the extent that losses in the current month exceed performance-based credit-enhancement fees accrued, the remaining losses may be recovered from future performance-based credit-enhancement fees payable to the participating financial institution.
Other Fees. We record other nonorigination fees in connection with our MPF program activities in other income. Such fees include delivery-commitment-extension fees, pair-off fees, price-adjustment fees, and counterparty fees in connection with MPF products under which we facilitate third party investment in loans (non-investment MPF products) such as with
the MPF Xtra® product. Delivery-commitment-extension fees are charged when a participating financial institution requests to extend the period of the delivery commitment beyond the original stated expiration. Pair-off fees represent a make-whole provision; they are received when the amount funded under a delivery commitment is less than a certain threshold (under-delivery) of the delivery-commitment amount. Price-adjustment fees are received when the amount funded is greater than a certain threshold (over-delivery) of the delivery-commitment amount. To the extent that pair-off fees relate to under-deliveries of loans, they are recorded in service fee income. Fees related to over-deliveries represent purchase-price adjustments to the related loans acquired and are recorded as part of the carrying value of the loan. The FHLBank of Chicago pays us a counterparty fee for the costs and expenses of marketing activities for loans originated for sale under non-investment MPF products.
Mortgage-Loan Participations. We may purchase and sell participations in MPF loans from other FHLBanks from time to time. References to our investments in mortgage loans throughout this report include any participation interests we own.
Nonaccrual Loans. We place conventional mortgage loans on nonaccrual status when the collection of the contractual principal or interest is 90 days or more past due, and we place government mortgage loans on nonaccrual status when the collection of the contractual principal or interest is 90 days or more past due and the borrower has been granted temporary forbearance for the payment of principal and interest. When a conventional mortgage loan is placed on nonaccrual status, accrued but uncollected interest is reversed against interest income in the current period. We generally record cash payments received on nonaccrual loans first as interest income and then as a reduction of principal as specified in the contractual agreement, unless we consider the collection of the remaining principal amount due to be doubtful. If we consider the collection of the remaining principal amount to be doubtful, cash payments received are applied first solely to principal until the remaining principal amount due is expected to be collected and then as a recovery of any charge-off, if applicable, followed by recording interest income. A loan on nonaccrual status may be restored to accrual status when the collection of the contractual principal and interest is less than 90 days past due. We do not place government mortgage loans, other than government mortgage loans that have been granted temporary forbearance, on nonaccrual status when the collection of the contractual principal or interest is 90 days or more past due because of the U.S. government guarantee of the loan and the contractual obligations of each related servicer, as more fully discussed in Note 7 - Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio.
Collateral-dependent Loans. A loan is considered collateral-dependent if repayment is expected to be provided solely by the sale of the underlying property; that is, there is no other available and reliable source of repayment. A loan that is considered collateral-dependent is measured for credit loss on an individual basis based on the fair value of the underlying property less estimated selling costs, with any shortfall recognized as an allowance for loan loss or charged-off.
Charge-Off Policy. A charge-off is recorded if it is estimated that the recorded investment in a loan will not be recovered. The recorded investment in a loan is the unpaid principal balance of the loan, adjusted for accrued interest, net deferred loan fees or costs, unamortized premiums or discounts, hedging adjustments, and direct write-downs. We evaluate whether to record a charge-off on a conventional mortgage loan upon the occurrence of a confirming event. Confirming events include, but are not limited to, the occurrence of foreclosure or notification of a claim against any of the credit-enhancements. We charge off the portion of outstanding conventional mortgage loan balances in excess of fair value of the underlying property less cost to sell, and adjusted for any available credit-enhancements for loans that are 180 or more days past due, when the borrower has filed for bankruptcy protection and the loan is at least 30 days past due, or when there is evidence of fraud.
Troubled Debt Restructurings. We consider a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) of a financing receivable to have occurred when we grant a concession to a borrower that we would not otherwise consider for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties. We place conventional mortgage loans that are deemed to be TDRs as a result of our modification program on nonaccrual when payments are 60 days or more past due.
Section 4013 of the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) provides optional temporary relief from the accounting and reporting requirements for TDRs for certain loan modifications related the adverse effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). On December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, was signed into law amending the CARES Act. Specifically, the CARES Act, as amended, provides that a qualifying financial institution may elect to suspend (1) the requirements under U.S. GAAP for certain loan modifications that would otherwise be categorized as a TDR, and (2) any determination that such loan modifications would be considered a TDR, including the related impairment for accounting purposes. Section 4013 of the CARES Act applies to any modification related to an economic hardship as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including an interest rate modification, a repayment plan, or any similar arrangement that defers or delays payment of principal or interest, for a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, and that occurs during the period beginning on March 1, 2020, and ending on the earlier of January 1, 2022, or the date that is 60 days following the termination of the national emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic declared by the President of the United States. Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, we elected to apply the TDR relief provided by the CARES Act.
As such, all COVID-related modifications meeting the provisions of the CARES Act will be excluded from TDR classification and accounting. We consider these loans to have a current payment status as long as payments are being made in accordance with the new terms. Alternatively, COVID-related modifications that do not meet the provisions of the CARES Act will continue to be assessed for TDR classification under our existing accounting policies. Additionally, we continue to apply our delinquency, non-accrual and charge-off policies during the forbearance period. We estimate the allowance for credit losses for COVID-related modifications in the same manner as other mortgage loans held for portfolio.
See Note 7 - Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio for additional details on the allowance methodology.
Real Estate Owned
Real-estate-owned property (REO) includes assets that have been received in satisfaction of debt or as a result of actual foreclosures. REO is recorded as other assets in the statement of condition and is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $273 thousand and $1.3 million, respectively, in assets classified as REO. Fair value is derived from third-party valuations of the property. If the fair value of the REO less estimated selling costs is less than the recorded investment in the MPF loan at the date of transfer, we recognize a charge-off to the allowance for credit losses for the difference. Subsequent realized gains and realized or unrealized losses are included in other income (loss) in the statement of operations.
Derivatives and Hedging Activities
All derivatives are recognized on the statement of condition at fair value and are reported as either derivative assets or derivative liabilities, net of cash collateral and accrued interest received from or pledged to clearing members and/or counterparties. We offset fair-value amounts recognized for derivatives and fair-value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) arising from derivatives recognized at fair value executed with the same clearing member and/or counterparty when the netting requirements have been met. If
these netted amounts are positive, they are classified as an asset and, if negative, they are classified as a liability. Derivative assets and derivative liabilities reported on the statement of condition also include net accrued interest. Cash flows associated with derivatives are reflected as cash flows from operating activities in the statement of cash flows unless the derivative meets the criteria to be a financing derivative.
Each derivative is designated as one of the following:
•a qualifying hedge of the change in fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment (a fair value hedge);
•a qualifying hedge of a forecasted transaction (a cash-flow hedge); or
•a nonqualifying hedge of an asset or liability (an economic hedge) for asset-liability-management purposes.
We utilize two derivatives clearing organizations (DCOs), for all cleared derivative transactions, Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (CME Inc.) and LCH Limited (LCH Ltd.). At both DCOs, variation margin is characterized as daily settlement payments and initial margin is considered collateral.
Accounting for Fair-Value and Cash-Flow Hedges. If hedging relationships meet certain criteria, including, but not limited to, formal documentation of the hedging relationship and an expectation to be highly effective, they qualify for fair-value or cash-flow hedge accounting. For cash-flow hedges, we measure effectiveness using the hypothetical derivative method, which compares the cumulative change in fair value of the actual derivative designated as the hedging instrument to the cumulative change in fair value of a hypothetical derivative having terms that identically match the critical terms of the hedged forecasted transaction.
Derivatives that are used in fair-value hedges are typically executed at the same time as the hedged items, and we designate the hedged item in a qualifying hedge relationship as of the trade date. We then record the changes in fair value of the derivative and the hedged item beginning on the trade date. Beginning January 1, 2019, we adopted new hedge accounting guidance which, among other things, impacts the presentation of gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities for qualifying hedges as follows:
•Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a fair-value hedge, along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item; and
•Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash-flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), a component of capital, until the hedged transaction affects earnings.
Prior to January 1, 2019, for both fair-value and cash-flow hedges, any hedge ineffectiveness (which represented the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in the fair value of the hedged item or the variability in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction attributable to the hedged risk) was recorded in non-interest income as net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.
Accounting for Economic Hedges. An economic hedge is defined as a derivative hedging specific or nonspecific assets, liabilities, or firm commitments that does not qualify or was not designated for fair-value or cash-flow hedge accounting, but is an acceptable hedging strategy under our risk-management policy. These economic hedging strategies also comply with FHFA regulatory requirements prohibiting speculative derivative transactions. An economic hedge introduces the potential for earnings variability caused by the changes in fair value of the derivatives that are recorded in income but not offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the economically hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments. As a result, we recognize only the net interest and the change in fair value of these derivatives in other income (loss) as net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities with no offsetting fair-value adjustments for the economically hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments.
Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable. The differential between accrual of interest receivable and payable on derivatives designated as a fair-value hedge or as a cash-flow hedge is recognized through adjustments to the interest income or interest expense of the designated hedged investment securities, advances, COs, or other financial instruments. The differential between accrual of interest receivable and payable on economic hedges is recognized in other income (loss), along with changes in fair value of these derivatives, as net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities.
Discontinuance of Hedge Accounting. We may discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when:
•we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item attributable to the hedged risk (including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions);
•the derivative and/or the hedged item expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised;
•it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction in a cash-flow hedge will occur in the originally expected period or within the following two months;
•a hedged firm commitment in a fair-value hedge no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment; or
•we determine that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate.
If hedge accounting is discontinued because we determine that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair-value hedge of an existing hedged item, we either terminate the derivative or continue to carry the derivative on the statement of condition at its fair value and cease to adjust the hedged asset or liability for changes in fair value. We will then begin to amortize the cumulative basis adjustment on the hedged item into earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item using the level-yield method.
If hedge accounting is discontinued because we determine that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective cash-flow hedge of an existing hedged item, we will continue to carry the derivative on the statement of condition at its fair value and amortize the cumulative other comprehensive loss adjustment to earnings when earnings are affected by the existing hedged item.
If it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally expected period or within two months thereafter, we immediately recognize in earnings the gain or loss that was in accumulated other comprehensive loss.
If hedge accounting is discontinued because the hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment, we will continue to carry the derivative on the statement of condition at its fair value, removing from the statement of condition any asset or liability that was recorded to recognize the firm commitment and recording it as a gain or loss in current period earnings.
Embedded Derivatives. We may issue debt, make advances, or purchase financial instruments in which a derivative is embedded. Upon execution of these transactions, we assess whether the economic characteristics of the embedded derivative are clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the remaining component of the debt, advance, or other financial instrument (the host contract) and whether a separate, nonembedded instrument with the same terms as the embedded instrument would meet the definition of a derivative. When we determine that (1) the embedded derivative has economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract and (2) a separate, stand-alone instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is separated from the host contract, carried at fair value, and designated as a stand-alone derivative instrument. If the entire contract (the host contract and the embedded derivative) is to be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in current earnings (for example, an investment security classified as trading, as well as hybrid financial instruments) or if we cannot reliably identify and measure the embedded derivative for purposes of separating that derivative from its host contract, the entire contract is carried on the statement of condition at fair value and no portion of the contract is designated as a hedging instrument. At December 31, 2020, and 2019, we had certain advances with embedded features that met the requirement to be separated from the host contract and designated the embedded features as stand-alone derivatives. The value of the embedded derivatives is included in total advances on the statement of condition. See Note 6 - Advances for the fair value of these embedded derivatives.
Premises, Software, Equipment and Leases
We record premises, software, and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and compute depreciation on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives ranging from three years to 10 years. We amortize leasehold improvements on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease. We capitalize improvements and major renewals but expense ordinary maintenance and repairs when incurred. We include gains and losses on disposal of premises, software, and equipment in other income (loss) on the statement of operations. The cost of purchased software and certain costs incurred in developing computer software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over future periods.
We lease office space and office equipment to run our business operations. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, we have made an accounting policy election to not recognize lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we included in the statement of condition $8.0 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of lease right-of-use assets in other assets as well as $8.0 million and $10.4 million, respectively, of lease liabilities in other liabilities. We have recognized
operating lease costs in other operating expenses on the statement of operations of $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Consolidated Obligations
We record COs at amortized cost.
Discounts and Premiums. We accrete discounts and amortize premiums on COs to interest expense using the level-yield method over the contractual term to maturity of the CO.
Concessions on COs. We pay concessions to dealers in connection with the issuance of certain COs. The Office of Finance prorates the amounts paid to dealers based upon the percentage of debt issued that we assumed. We record concessions paid on COs as a direct reduction from their carrying amounts, consistent with the presentation of discounts on COs. These dealer concessions are amortized using the level-yield method over the contractual term to maturity of the COs. The amortization of those concessions is included in CO interest expense on the statement of operations.
Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures
Beginning January 1, 2020, we adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses accounting guidance. Under this new guidance, we evaluate our off-balance sheet credit exposures on a quarterly basis for expected credit losses. If deemed necessary, an allowance for expected credit losses on these off-balance sheet exposures is recorded in other liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the provision for credit losses.
Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock
We reclassify stock subject to redemption from equity to a liability after a member exercises a written redemption request, gives notice of intent to withdraw from membership, or attains nonmember status by merger or acquisition, charter termination, or other involuntary termination from membership, since the shares meet the definition of a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument upon such instances. Member shares meeting this definition are reclassified to a liability at fair value. Dividends declared on mandatorily redeemable capital stock are accrued at the expected dividend rate for Class B stock and reflected as interest expense on the statement of operations. The repayment of these mandatorily redeemable financial instruments is reflected as cash outflows in the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows once settled.
We do not take into consideration our members' right to cancel a redemption request in determining when shares of capital stock should be classified as a liability because such cancellation would be subject to a cancellation fee equal to two percent of the par amount of the shares of Class B stock that is the subject of the redemption notice. If a member cancels its written notice of redemption or notice of withdrawal, we will reclassify mandatorily redeemable capital stock from a liability to equity. After the reclassification, dividends on the capital stock will no longer be classified as interest expense.
Restricted Retained Earnings
The joint capital enhancement agreement, as amended (the Joint Capital Agreement), provides that each FHLBank will, on a quarterly basis, contribute 20 percent of its net income to a separate restricted retained earnings account until the balance of that account, calculated as of the last day of each calendar quarter, equals at least 1 percent of that FHLBank's average balance of outstanding COs (excluding fair-value adjustments) for the calendar quarter. As of December 31, 2020, the balance in restricted retained earnings exceeds the threshold for the contribution requirement by $14.0 million, primarily the result of the decline in outstanding COs since March 31, 2020. Accordingly, no allocation of net income was made to restricted retained earnings in the fourth quarter of 2020 and no further allocations of net income into restricted retained earnings are required until such time as the contribution requirement exceeds the balance in restricted retained earnings. Restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends, and we present them separate from other retained earnings on the statement of condition.
Litigation Settlements
Litigation settlement gains, net of related legal expenses, are recorded in other income (loss). A litigation settlement gain is considered realized and recorded when we receive cash or assets that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash or claims to cash. In addition, a litigation settlement gain is considered realizable and recorded when we enter into a signed agreement that is not subject to appeal, where the counterparty has the ability to pay, and the amount to be received can be reasonably estimated. Prior to being realized or realizable, we consider potential litigation settlement gains to be gain
contingencies, and therefore they are not recorded in the statement of operations. The related legal expenses are contingent-based fees and are only incurred and recorded upon a litigation settlement gain.
FHFA Expenses
We fund a portion of the costs of operating the FHFA. The portion of the FHFA's expenses and working capital fund paid by the FHLBanks is allocated among the FHLBanks based on the ratio of each FHLBank's minimum required regulatory capital to the aggregate minimum required regulatory capital of every FHLBank. We must pay an amount equal to one-half of our annual assessment twice each year.
Office of Finance Expenses
Each FHLBank's proportionate share of Office of Finance operating and capital expenditures has been calculated using a formula based upon the following components: (1) two-thirds based upon each FHLBank's share of total COs outstanding and (2) one-third divided equally among the FHLBanks.
Assessments
Affordable Housing Program. The FHLBank Act requires us to establish and fund an AHP based on positive annual net earnings, providing grants to members to assist in the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of housing for very low- to moderate-income households. We charge the required funding as well as any discretionary funding for the AHP to earnings and establish a liability, except when annual net earnings are zero or negative, in which case there is no requirement to fund an AHP. We also issue AHP advances at interest rates below the customary interest rate for nonsubsidized advances. A discount on the AHP advance and charge against the AHP liability is recorded for the present value of the variation in the cash flow caused by the difference in the interest rate between the AHP advance rate and our related cost of funds for comparable maturity funding. The discount on AHP advances is accreted to interest income on advances using the level-yield method over the life of the advance. See Note 11 - Affordable Housing Program for additional information.
Cash Flows
In the statement of cash flows, we consider noninterest bearing cash and due from banks as cash and cash equivalents. Federal funds sold and interest-bearing deposits are not treated as cash equivalents for purposes of the statement of cash flows, but are instead treated as short-term investments and are reflected in the investing activities section of the statement of cash flows.
Related-Party Activities
We define related parties as members who owned 10 percent or more of the voting interests of our outstanding capital stock at December 31, 2020. See Note 17 - Transactions with Shareholders for additional information.
Segment Reporting
We report on an enterprise-wide basis. The enterprise-wide method of evaluating our financial information reflects the manner in which the chief operating decision-maker manages the business.
Reclassification
Certain amounts in the 2019 and 2018 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Note 3 - Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance
Effective January 1, 2020
Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. On March 12, 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released temporary optional guidance that provides transition relief for reference rate reform. The guidance contains optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contract modifications, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or a reference rate that is expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform if certain criteria are met.
In addition to the optional expedients for contract modifications and hedging relationships, this update provides a one-time election to sell, transfer, or both sell and transfer debt securities classified as held-to-maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform and that are classified as held-to-maturity before January 1, 2020.
This standard was effective upon issuance and the provisions generally can be applied prospectively as of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In the third quarter of 2020, we adopted the provision of this guidance which allows a one-time election to sell, transfer, or both sell and transfer debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. See Note 5 - Investments for additional information related to these sales and transfers. We are in the process of evaluating the remaining provisions of this guidance, and the anticipated effects on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows have not yet been determined.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we retrospectively elected to adopt the provision of Reference Rate Reform guidance issued by the FASB in January 2021 specific to the modification of interest rates used for the discounting of derivative instruments. This did not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance for the accounting of credit losses on financial instruments. The amendments require entities to measure expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events (including historical experience), current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. The new guidance requires a financial asset, or a group of financial assets, measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected over the contractual term of the financial asset(s). The guidance also requires, among other things, that we:
•Reflect in the statement of operations the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period;
•Determine the allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination that are measured at amortized cost in a similar manner to other financial assets measured at amortized cost. The initial allowance for credit losses is required to be added to the purchase price;
•Record credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities through an allowance for credit losses. The amendments limit the allowance for credit losses to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost; and
•Further disaggregate the current disclosure of credit quality indicators in relation to the amortized cost of financing receivables by the year of origination.
We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2020, using a modified-retrospective approach. Upon adoption, we recognized an increase in the allowance for credit losses of $7.5 million as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.
Note 4 - Cash and Due from Banks
Cash and due from banks includes cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, compensating balances, and amounts due from correspondent banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Compensating Balances. We maintain collected cash balances with a commercial bank in return for certain services. The related agreement contains no legal restrictions on the withdrawal of funds. The average collected cash balance was $176.3 million and $19.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Note 5 - Investments
Interest-Bearing Deposits, Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell, and Federal Funds Sold
We invest in interest-bearing deposits, securities purchased under agreements to resell, and federal funds sold to provide short-term liquidity. These investments are generally transacted with counterparties that have received, or whose guarantors have received, a credit rating of triple-B or greater (investment grade) by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO), or the equivalent. At December 31, 2020, none of these investments were made to counterparties or, if applicable, guaranteed by entities rated below triple-B.
Securities purchased under agreements to resell are short-term and are structured such that they are evaluated daily to determine if the market value of the underlying securities decreases below the market value required as collateral (i.e. subject to collateral maintenance provisions). If so, the counterparty must place an amount of additional securities as collateral or remit an
equivalent amount of cash sufficient to comply with collateral maintenance provisions, generally by the next business day. Based upon the collateral held as security and collateral maintenance provisions with our counterparties, we determined that no allowance for credit losses was needed for our securities purchased under agreements to resell at December 31, 2020. The carrying value of securities purchased under agreements to resell excludes accrued interest receivable of $1 thousand and $348 thousand at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Federal funds sold are unsecured loans that are generally transacted on an overnight term. FHFA regulations include a limit on the amount of unsecured credit we may extend to a counterparty. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, all investments in interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold were repaid according to the contractual terms. No allowance for credit losses was recorded for these assets at December 31, 2020. Carrying values of interest-bearing deposits and federal funds sold exclude accrued interest receivable of $31 thousand and $5 thousand, respectively, at December 31, 2020, and $682 thousand and $37 thousand, respectively, at December 31, 2019.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and financial markets are expected to put pressure on our bank counterparties’ profitability, asset quality, and in some cases, capitalization. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties and may reduce or suspend individual credit lines as conditions warrant.
Debt Securities
We invest in debt securities, which are classified as either trading, available-for-sale, or held-to-maturity. We are prohibited by FHFA regulations from investing in certain higher-risk securities, such as equity securities and debt instruments that are not investment quality, other than certain investments targeted at low-income persons or communities, but we are not required to divest instruments that experienced credit deterioration after their purchase.
Trading Securities

Transfers and Sales of Available-for-Sale Securities and Held-to-Maturity Securities
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we sold held-to-maturity private-label MBS that had less than 15 percent of the acquired principal outstanding at the time of the sale. Such sales are treated as maturities for the purposes of security classification. The sale does not impact our ability and intent to hold the remaining investments classified as held-to-maturity through their stated maturity dates. These sales were as follows:
•In the fourth quarter of 2019, we sold securities with an amortized cost of $173.2 million and realized a gain of $12.0 million.
•In the first quarter of 2020, we sold securities with an amortized cost of $121.0 million and realized a gain of $40.7 million.
•In the third quarter of 2020, we sold securities with an amortized cost of $12.2 million and realized a gain of $473 thousand.
Additionally, during the third quarter of 2020 we adopted a provision of the Accounting Standards Update titled Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting which provides a one-time election to sell, transfer, or both sell and transfer debt securities classified as held-to-maturity that reference a rate affected by reference rate reform and that were classified as held-to-maturity before January 1, 2020. Upon adopting this provision, we:
•sold certain held-to-maturity private-label MBS which had an amortized cost of $82.2 million and realized a net gain of $6.2 million; and
•transferred from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale certain securities which, on the date of transfer, were comprised of the following:
Table 5.9 - Transfer of Held-to-Maturity Securities to Available-for-Sale Securities
(dollars in thousands)
Subsequent to the transfer of securities to available-for-sale, we sold certain available-for-sale private-label MBS which had an amortized cost of $157.1 million and realized a net gain of $30.6 million.
Gains and Losses on Sales. We compute gains and losses on sales of investment securities using the specific identification method and include these gains and losses in other income (loss). The following table summarizes the proceeds from sale and gains and losses on sales of securities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Available-for-Sale Securities and Held-to-Maturity Securities
We evaluate available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities for credit losses on a quarterly basis. We adopted new accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on January 1, 2020. See Note 3 - Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Guidance for additional information. See Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Financial Statements - Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Investment Securities - Other-than-Temporary Impairment in the 2019 Annual Report, for information on the prior methodology for evaluating credit losses.
Upon adoption of new accounting guidance for credit impairment, on January 1, 2020, we recorded through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings an increase in the allowance for credit losses associated with held-to-maturity private-label MBS totaling $5.3 million. Under the previous accounting methodology of security impairment, we recognized net credit losses of $1.2 million and $532 thousand, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
Table 5.11 - Allowance for Credit Losses on Debt Securities
(dollars in thousands)
To evaluate investment securities for credit loss at December 31, 2020, we employed the following methodologies, based on the type of security.
Available-for-Sale Securities and Held-to-Maturity Securities. Our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities are principally GSE and U.S. government-owned corporations, supranational institutions, state or local housing finance agency obligations, and MBS issued by Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Fannie Mae that are backed by single-family or multifamily mortgage loans. We only purchase investment-grade securities. At December 31, 2020, 99.4 percent of available-for-sale securities and all held-to-maturity securities, based on amortized cost, were rated single-A, or above, by a NRSRO, based on the lowest long-term credit rating for each security.
We evaluate our individual available-for-sale securities for impairment by comparing the security’s fair value to its amortized cost. Impairment may exist when the fair value of the investment is less than its amortized cost (i.e. in an unrealized loss position). At December 31, 2020, certain available-for-sale securities were in an unrealized loss position. These losses are considered temporary as we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis on these available-for-sale investment securities and we neither intend to sell these securities nor do we consider it more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of each security's remaining amortized cost basis. Further, we have not experienced any payment defaults on the instruments. In addition, substantially all of these securities carry an implicit or explicit government guarantee. As a result, no allowance for credit losses was recorded on these available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2020.
We evaluate our held-to-maturity securities for impairment on a collective or pooled basis unless an individual assessment is deemed necessary because the securities do not possess similar risk characteristics. As of December 31, 2020, we had not established an allowance for credit loss on any of our held-to-maturity securities because the securities: (1) were all highly-rated and/or had short remaining terms to maturity, (2) had not experienced, nor did we expect, any payment default on the instruments, and (3) in the case of U.S., GSE, or other agency obligations, carry an implicit or explicit government guarantee such that we consider the risk of nonpayment to be zero.
Private-label MBS. As of December 31, 2020, we no longer held any investments in private-label MBS. Table 5.12 presents a roll forward of the amount of credit losses recognized in earnings prior to January 1, 2020, for which a portion of other-than-temporary impairment was recognized in other comprehensive income.

Note 6 - Advances
General Terms. We offer a wide range of fixed- and variable-rate advance products with different maturities, interest rates, payment characteristics, and optionality. Advances have maturities ranging from one day to 30 years or longer with the approval of our credit committee. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had advances outstanding with interest rates ranging from 0.00 percent to 7.72 percent and (0.35) percent to 7.72 percent, respectively. Advances with negative interest rates contain embedded interest-rate features that have met the requirements to be separated from the host contract and are recorded as stand-alone derivatives, and which we economically hedge with derivatives containing offsetting interest-rate features.
Table 6.1 - Advances Outstanding by Year of Contractual Maturity
(dollars in thousands)
_________________________
(1) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had certain advances with embedded features that met the requirements to be separated from the host contract and designated as stand-alone derivatives.
(2) Excludes accrued interest receivable of $25.8 million and $48.1 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We offer advances to members and eligible nonmembers that provide the borrower the right, based upon predetermined option exercise dates, to repay the advance prior to maturity without incurring prepayment or termination fees (callable advances). We also offer certain floating-rate advances that may be contractually prepaid by the borrower on a floating-rate reset date without incurring prepayment or termination fees. Other advances may only be prepaid by paying a fee (prepayment fee) that makes us financially indifferent to the prepayment of the advance.
Table 6.2 - Advances Outstanding by Year of Contractual Maturity or Next Call Date
(dollars in thousands)
We currently hold putable advances that provide us with the right to require repayment prior to maturity of the advance (and thereby extinguish the advance) on predetermined exercise dates (put dates). Generally, we would exercise the put options when interest rates increase relative to contractual rates.
Table 6.3 - Advances Outstanding by Year of Contractual Maturity or Next Put Date
(dollars in thousands)
Table 6.4 - Advances by Current Interest Rate Terms
(dollars in thousands)
Credit Risk Exposure and Security Terms. Our advances are primarily made to member financial institutions, including commercial banks, insurance companies, savings institutions, and credit unions. We manage our credit exposure to secured member credit products through an integrated approach that generally includes establishing a credit limit for each borrower. This approach includes an ongoing review of each borrower's financial condition, and collateral and lending policies that are intended to limit risk of loss while balancing borrowers' needs for a reliable source of funding.
In addition, we lend to eligible borrowers in accordance with federal law and FHFA regulations. Specifically, we are required to obtain sufficient collateral to fully secure credit products up to the counterparty’s total outstanding credit obligations plus unused credit lines. Collateral eligible to secure new or renewed advances includes:
•fully disbursed, first-mortgage loans on improved residential property (provided that the borrower is not in arrears by two or more payments), or securities representing a whole interest in such mortgages;
•securities issued, insured, or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any agency thereof (including without limitation, MBS issued or guaranteed by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae);
•cash or deposits in a collateral account with us; and
•other real-estate-related collateral acceptable to us if such collateral has a readily ascertainable value and we can perfect our security interest in the collateral.
In addition, in the case of any community financial institution, as defined in accordance with the FHLBank Act, we may accept as collateral secured loans for small business and agriculture, or securities representing a whole interest in such secured loans.
Residential mortgage loans are the principal form of collateral for advances. The estimated value of the collateral pledged to secure each borrower's credit products is calculated by applying collateral discounts, or haircuts, to the market value or unpaid principal balance of the collateral, as applicable. We require all borrowers that pledge securities collateral to place physical possession of such securities collateral with our safekeeping agent, the borrower's approved designated agent, or the borrower's securities corporation, subject to a control agreement giving us appropriate control over such collateral. In addition, community financial institutions are eligible to use expanded statutory collateral provisions for small-business and agriculture loans. The Bank has a lien on and holds the stock of a member in the Bank as further collateral security for all indebtedness of the member to the Bank. Collateral arrangements may vary depending upon borrower credit quality, financial condition, performance, borrowing capacity, and our overall credit exposure to the borrower. We can call for additional or substitute collateral to further safeguard our security interest. We also have policies and procedures for validating the reasonableness of our collateral valuations. In addition, we perform collateral verifications based on the risk profile of the borrower and other considerations. Management believes that these policies effectively manage our credit risk from advances.
We either allow the borrower to retain possession of loan collateral pledged to us while agreeing to hold such collateral for our benefit or require the borrower to specifically assign or place physical possession of such loan collateral with us or a third-party custodian under a tri-party collateral control agreement that we approve.
We are provided an additional safeguard for our security interests by Section 10(e) of the FHLBank Act, which generally affords any security interest granted by a borrower to the Bank priority over the claims and rights of any other party. The exceptions to this prioritization are limited to claims that would be entitled to priority under otherwise applicable law and are held by bona fide purchasers for value or by secured parties with higher priority perfected security interests. The priority granted to our security interests under Section 10(e) of the FHLBank Act may not apply when lending to insurance company members due to the anti-preemption provision contained in the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which provides that federal law does not preempt state insurance law unless the federal law expressly regulates the business of insurance. Thus, if state law conflicts with Section 10(e) of the FHLBank Act, the protection afforded by this provision may not be available to us. However, we perfect our security interests in the collateral pledged by our members, including insurance company members, by filing Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)-1 financing statements, taking possession or control of such collateral, or taking other appropriate steps.
Using a risk-based approach and taking into consideration each borrower's financial strength, we consider the types and level of collateral to be the primary indicator of credit quality on our credit products. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had rights to collateral, on a borrower-by-borrower basis, with an estimated value in excess of our outstanding extensions of credit.
We continue to evaluate and make changes to our collateral guidelines based on market conditions. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, none of our advances were past due, on non accrual status, or considered impaired. In addition, there were no troubled debt restructurings related to advances during the years December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Based upon the collateral held as security, our credit extension and collateral policies, management's credit analysis, and the repayment history on advances, we have not recorded any allowance for credit losses on our advances at December 31, 2020, and 2019.
Prepayment Fees. We record prepayment fees received from borrowers on certain prepaid advances net of any associated basis adjustments related to hedging activities on those advances and net of deferred prepayment fees on advance prepayments considered to be loan modifications. Additionally, for certain advances products, the prepayment-fee provisions of the advance agreement could result in either a payment from the borrower or to the borrower when such an advance is prepaid, based upon market conditions at the time of prepayment (referred to as a symmetrical prepayment fee). Advances with a symmetrical prepayment fee provision are hedged with derivatives containing offsetting terms, so that we are financially indifferent to the borrower's decision to prepay such advances. The net amount of prepayment fees is reflected as interest income in the statement of operations.
We also offer an advance restructuring program under which the prepayment fee on prepaid advances may be satisfied by the borrower's agreement to pay an interest rate on a new advance sufficient to amortize the prepayment fee by the maturity date of the new advance, rather than paying the fee in immediately available funds to us. If we conclude an advance restructuring is an extinguishment of the prior loan rather than a modification, the deferred prepayment fee is recognized into income immediately.

Note 7 - Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio
We invest in mortgage loans through the Mortgage Partnership Finance® (MPF®) program. These mortgage loans are either guaranteed or insured by federal agencies, as is the case with government mortgage loans, or are credit-enhanced, directly or indirectly, by the related entity that sold the loan (a participating financial institution), as is the case with conventional mortgage loans. All such investments are held for portfolio. The mortgage loans are typically originated and credit-enhanced by the related participating financial institution. The majority of these loans are serviced by the originating institution or an affiliate thereof. However, a portion of these loans are sold servicing-released by the participating financial institution and serviced by a third-party servicer.

(dollars in thousands)

Table 7.2 - Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio by Collateral/Guarantee Type
(dollars in thousands)
Credit-Enhancements. Our allowance for credit losses factors in the credit-enhancements associated with conventional mortgage loans under the MPF program. These credit-enhancements apply after the homeowner's equity is exhausted and can include primary and/or supplemental mortgage insurance or other kinds of credit-enhancement. The credit risk analysis of our conventional loans is performed at the individual master commitment level to determine the credit-enhancements available to recover losses on loans under each individual master commitment. The credit-enhancement amounts estimated to protect us against credit losses are determined through the use of a model. Any incurred losses that would be recovered from the credit-enhancements are not reserved as part of our allowance for loan losses. In such cases, a receivable is generally established to reflect the expected recovery from credit-enhancement arrangements.
Assets delivered to us must be credit enhanced to an equivalent of a single-A-minus rated MBS. We share the risk of credit losses on our investments in mortgage loans with the related participating financial institution by structuring potential losses on these investments into layers with respect to each master commitment. We analyze the risk characteristics of our mortgage loans using a third-party model to determine the credit-enhancement amount at the time of purchase. This credit-enhancement amount is broken into two parts: the Bank's first-loss account and the participating financial institution's credit-enhancement obligation, which may be calculated based on the risk analysis to equal the difference between the amounts needed for the master commitment to have a rating equivalent to a single-A-minus rated MBS and our initial first-loss account exposure.
The first-loss account represents the first layer or portion of credit losses that we absorb with respect to our investments in mortgage loans after considering the borrower's equity and primary mortgage insurance. The participating financial institution is required to cover the next layer of losses up to an agreed-upon credit-enhancement obligation amount, which may consist of a direct liability of the participating financial institution to pay credit losses up to a specified amount, a contractual obligation of a participating financial institution to provide supplemental mortgage insurance, or a combination of both. We absorb any remaining unallocated losses.
The aggregate amount of the first-loss account is documented and tracked but is neither recorded nor reported as an allowance for loan losses in our financial statements. As credit and special hazard losses are realized that are not covered by the liquidation value of the real property or primary mortgage insurance, they are first charged to us, with a corresponding reduction of the first-loss account for that master commitment up to the amount in the first-loss account at that time. Over time, the first-loss account may cover the expected credit losses on a master commitment, although losses that are greater than expected or that occur early in the life of a master commitment could exceed the amount in the first-loss account. In that case, the excess losses would be charged to the participating financial institution's credit-enhancement amount, then to us after the participating financial institution's credit-enhancement amount has been exhausted.
For loans in which we buy or sell participations from or to other FHLBanks that participate in the MPF program (MPF Banks), the amount of the first-loss account remaining to absorb losses for loans that we own is partly dependent on the percentage of our participation in such loans. Assuming losses occur on a proportional basis between loans that we own and loans owned by other MPF Banks, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amount of first-loss account remaining for losses allocable to us was $30.4 million and $28.5 million, respectively.
Participating financial institutions are paid a credit-enhancement fee for assuming credit risk and in some instances all or a portion of the credit-enhancement fee may be performance based. For certain MPF products, our losses incurred under the first-loss account can be mitigated by withholding future performance-based credit-enhancement fees that would otherwise be payable to the participating financial institutions. We record credit-enhancement fees paid to participating financial institutions as a reduction to mortgage-loan-interest income.
Withheld performance-based credit-enhancement fees can mitigate losses from our investments in mortgage loans and therefore we consider our expectations for each master commitment for such withheld fees in determining the allowance for loan losses. More specifically, we determine the amount of credit-enhancement fees available to mitigate losses as follows: accrued credit-enhancement fees to be paid to participating financial institutions; plus projected credit-enhancement fees to be paid to the participating financial institutions using the weighted average life of the loans within each relevant master commitment; minus any losses incurred or expected to be incurred.
Relief to Borrowers During the COVID-19 Pandemic. We have elected to apply Section 4013 of the CARES Act to our loan modifications that qualify under the CARES Act. As a result, we have elected to suspend TDR accounting for eligible modifications under Section 4013 of the CARES Act. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.3 million of these modifications outstanding. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.
Our Servicers may grant a forbearance period to borrowers who have requested forbearance based on COVID-19 related difficulties regardless of the status of the loan at the time of the request. We continue to apply our accounting policy for past due loans and charge-offs to loans during the forbearance period unless there is a legal modification made to update the terms of the mortgage loan contract. The accrual status for loans under forbearance will be driven by the past due status of the loan based on its contractual terms.
As of December 31, 2020, we held approximately $62.8 million in par value of conventional mortgage loans that were in a forbearance plan as a result of COVID-19. Of these loans, $4.1 million had a current payment status, $2.5 million were 30 to 59 days past due, $8.6 million were 60 to 89 days past due, and $47.6 million were greater than 90 days past due and in nonaccrual status. The $62.8 million of conventional mortgage loans in forbearance represents 1.6 percent of our mortgage loans held for portfolio at December 31, 2020. In addition, we had approximately $12.5 million in par value of government mortgage loans in a forbearance plan as a result of COVID-19.
Payment Status of Mortgage Loans. Payment status is a key credit quality indicator for conventional mortgage loans and allows us to monitor the migration of past due loans. Past due loans are those where the borrower has failed to make timely payments of principal and/or interest in accordance with the terms of the loan. Other delinquency statistics include non-accrual loans and loans in process of foreclosure. Tables 7.3 and 7.4 present the payment status for conventional mortgage loans and other delinquency statistics for all mortgage loans at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Allowance for Credit Losses for Mortgage Loans.
Conventional Mortgage Loans. Using Financial Instruments - Credit Losses accounting guidance, conventional loans are evaluated collectively when similar risk characteristics exist. Conventional loans that do not share risk characteristics with other pools are evaluated for expected credit losses on an individual basis. We determine our allowance for credit losses on conventional loans through analyses that include consideration of various loan portfolio and collateral-related characteristics, such as past performance, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of expected economic conditions. We use a discounted cash flow model to project our expected losses. We use a third-party model to project cash flows to estimate the expected credit losses over the life of the loans. The model relies on a number of inputs, such as both current and forecasted property values and interest rates as well as historical borrower behavior. We incorporate associated credit enhancements and expected recoveries, if any, to determine our estimate of expected credit losses.
Certain conventional loans may be evaluated for credit losses by using the practical expedient for collateral dependent assets. A mortgage loan is considered collateral dependent if repayment is expected to be provided by the sale of the underlying property, that is, if it is considered likely that the borrower will default. We estimate the fair value of this collateral by using a third-party property valuation model. The expected credit loss of a collateral dependent mortgage loan is equal to the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the estimated fair value of the collateral, less estimated selling costs. We will reserve for these estimated losses or record a direct charge-off of the loan balance if certain triggering criteria are met.
Prior to the adoption of the Financial Instruments - Credit Loss accounting guidance, our allowance for mortgage loans consisted of an estimate of incurred losses from individually evaluated mortgage loans, including collateral dependent loans; collectively evaluated mortgage loans; and an estimate of additional credit losses on mortgage loans. The incurred loss of an individually evaluated mortgage loan was equal to the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs and may have included expected proceeds from primary mortgage insurance and other applicable credit enhancements. Certain conventional mortgage loans, primarily impaired mortgage loans that were considered collateral dependent, were specifically identified for purposes of calculating the allowance for credit losses. The credit risk analysis of conventional loans evaluated collectively for impairment considered loan pool specific attribute data at the master commitment pool level (including historical delinquency migration) applies estimated loss severities, and incorporated available credit enhancements to establish our best estimate of probable incurred losses at the reporting date. We then estimated how many loans in each payment status category may migrate to a realized loss position and then applied a loss severity factor to estimate losses incurred at the statement of condition date. The losses were then reduced by the probable cash flows resulting from available credit enhancements. We also assessed a factor for the margin of imprecision to the estimation of credit losses for the homogeneous loan population. This amount represented a subjective management judgment based on facts and circumstances that exist as of the reporting date that is unallocated to any specific measurable economic or credit event and was intended to cover other inherent losses that may not have been captured in our methodology.
Table 7.5 presents a roll forward of the allowance for credit losses on conventional mortgage loans for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. As required by prior accounting guidance for determining the allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans, table 7.5 also presents the recorded investment in mortgage loans by impairment methodology at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The recorded investment in a loan is the par amount of the loan, adjusted for accrued interest, unamortized premiums or discounts, deferred derivative gains and losses, and direct write-downs. The recorded investment is net of any valuation allowance.
Table 7.5 - Allowance for Credit Losses on Conventional Mortgage Loans
(dollars in thousands)
_________________________
(1) These amounts exclude government mortgage loans because we make no allowance for credit losses based on our investments in government mortgage loans, as discussed below under - Government Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio.
Government Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio. We invest in government mortgage loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties. Government mortgage loans are mortgage loans insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (the FHA), the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA), the Rural Housing Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (RHS), or by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
The servicer provides and maintains insurance or a guarantee from the applicable government agency. The servicer is responsible for compliance with all government agency requirements and for obtaining the benefit of the applicable insurance or guaranty with respect to defaulted government-guaranteed mortgage loans. Any losses incurred on these loans that are not recovered from the insurer or guarantor are absorbed by the related servicer. Therefore, we only have credit risk for these loans if the servicer fails to pay for losses not covered by insurance or guarantees. Due to government guarantees or insurance on our government loans, there is no allowance for credit losses for the government mortgage loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Additionally, government mortgage loans, other than government mortgage loans that have been granted temporary forbearance, are not placed on nonaccrual status due to the government guarantee or insurance on these loans and the contractual obligation of the loan servicers to repurchase their related loans when certain criteria are met.
Troubled Debt Restructurings. We consider a troubled debt restructuring of a financing receivable to have occurred when we grant a concession to a borrower that we would not otherwise consider for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial difficulties, except for troubled debt restructurings meeting the provisions of the CARES Act as described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We have granted a concession when we do not expect to collect all amounts due to us under the original contract as a result of the restructuring.
A mortgage loan considered to be a troubled debt restructuring is individually evaluated for impairment when determining its related allowance for credit losses. When a loan first becomes a troubled debt restructuring, we compare the carrying value of the loan at the time of modification with the present value of the revised cash flows discounted at the original effective yield on the loan. Credit losses are measured by estimating the loss severity rate incurred as of the reporting date as well as the economic loss attributable to delaying the original contractual principal and interest due dates, if applicable. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the recorded investment of mortgage loans classified as troubled debt restructurings were $7.7 million and $7.2 million, respectively.
Note 8 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities
Nature of Business Activity
We are exposed to interest-rate risk primarily from the effects of interest-rate changes on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that finance these assets. The goal of our interest-rate risk-management strategy is to manage interest-rate risk within appropriate limits. As part of our effort to mitigate the risk of loss, we have established policies and procedures, which
include guidelines on the amount of exposure to interest-rate changes we will accept. In addition, we monitor the risk to our interest income, net interest margin, and average maturity of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.
Consistent with FHFA regulations, we enter into derivatives to manage the interest-rate-risk exposures inherent in otherwise unhedged assets and liabilities and achieve our risk-management objectives. FHFA regulation prohibits us from the speculative use of these derivative instruments. The use of derivatives is an integral part of our financial and risk management strategy. We may enter into derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting provided that we document a non-speculative use.
We reevaluate our hedging strategies periodically and may change the hedging techniques we use or may adopt new strategies. The most common ways in which we use derivatives are to:
•effectively change the coupon repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities from fixed-rate to floating-rate;
•hedge the mark-to-market sensitivity of existing assets or liabilities;
•offset or neutralize embedded options in assets and liabilities; and
•hedge the potential yield variability of anticipated asset or liability transactions.
Application of Derivatives
We formally document at inception all relationships between derivatives designated as hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions and our method of assessing hedge effectiveness. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair-value or cash-flow hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the statement of condition, firm commitments, or forecasted transactions.
We may use derivatives to adjust the effective maturity, repricing frequency, or option characteristics of our financial instruments, including our advances products, investments, and COs to achieve risk-management objectives. Derivative instruments are designated by us as:
•a qualifying fair-value hedge of a non-derivative financial instrument or a cash-flow hedge of a forecasted transaction; and
•a non-qualifying economic hedge in general asset-liability management where derivatives serve a documented risk-mitigation purpose but do not qualify for hedge accounting. These hedges are primarily used to manage certain mismatches between the coupon features of our assets and liabilities.
We transact all of our derivatives with counterparties who are major banks or securities firms, and in a few instances, with their affiliates with unconditional guarantees provided by the respective major bank or securities firm. Some of these derivative counterparties and their affiliates buy, sell, and distribute COs, and may be affiliates of members of the Bank. Derivative transactions may be either over-the-counter with a counterparty (uncleared derivatives) or cleared through a futures commission merchant (clearing member) with a DCO as the counterparty (cleared derivatives).
Once a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a DCO, the executing counterparty is replaced with the DCO. We are not a derivatives dealer and do not trade derivatives for short-term profit.
Types of Derivatives
We primarily use the following derivatives instruments to reduce funding costs and/or to manage our interest-rate risks.
•Interest-Rate Swaps. An interest-rate swap is an agreement between two entities to exchange cash flows in the future. The agreement sets the dates on which the cash flows will be exchanged and the manner in which the cash flows will be calculated. One of the simplest forms of an interest-rate swap involves the promise by one party to pay cash flows equivalent to the interest on a notional amount at a predetermined fixed rate for a given period of time to the counterparty. In return for this promise, this party receives cash flows equivalent to the interest on the same notional amount at a variable-rate index for the same period of time from the counterparty. The variable-rate indices we utilize in our derivative transactions are LIBOR, the overnight-index swap (OIS) rate based on the federal funds effective rate, and the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).
•Optional Termination Interest-Rate Swaps. In an optional termination interest-rate swap, one counterparty has the right, but not the obligation, to terminate the interest-rate swap prior to its stated maturity date. We use optional termination interest-rate swaps to hedge callable CO bonds and putable advances. In most cases, we own an option to terminate the hedged
item, that is, redeem a callable bond or demand repayment of a putable advance on specified dates, and the counterparty to the optional termination interest-rate swap owns the option to terminate the interest-rate swap on those same dates.
•Forward-Start Interest-Rate Swaps. A forward-start interest-rate swap is an interest-rate swap (as described above) with a deferred effective date. We designate forward-start interest-rate swaps as cash-flow hedges of expected debt issuances.
•Interest-Rate Cap and Floor Agreements. In an interest-rate cap agreement, a cash flow is generated if the price or rate of an underlying variable rises above a certain threshold or cap price. In an interest-rate floor agreement, a cash flow is generated if the price or rate of an underlying variable falls below a certain threshold or floor price. These agreements are intended to serve as protection against the interest rate on a variable-rate asset or liability falling below or rising above a certain level.
Types of Assets and Liabilities Hedged
Investments. We use derivatives to manage the interest-rate and prepayment risk associated with certain investment securities that are classified either as available-for-sale or as trading securities.
We may also manage the risk arising from changing market prices or cash flows of certain investment securities classified as trading securities by entering into economic hedges that offset the changes in fair value or cash flows of the securities. These economic hedges are not specifically designated as hedges of individual assets, but rather are collectively managed to provide an offset to the changes in the fair values of the assets. The market-value changes of trading securities are included in net unrealized (losses) gains on trading securities in the statement of operations, while the changes in fair value of the associated derivatives are included in other income as net (losses) gains on derivatives and hedging activities.
Advances. We offer a wide range of fixed- and variable-rate advance products with different maturities, interest rates, payment characteristics and optionality. We may use interest-rate swaps to manage the repricing and/or options characteristics of advances to more closely match the characteristics of our funding liabilities. Typically, we hedge the fair value of fixed-rate advances with interest-rate swaps where we pay a fixed-rate coupon and receive a variable-rate coupon, effectively converting the advance to a floating-rate advance. We also hedge the fair value of certain floating-rate advances that contain either an interest-rate cap or floor, or both a cap and a floor, with a derivative containing an offsetting cap and/or floor.
With each issuance of a putable advance, we effectively purchase from the borrower an embedded put option that enables us to terminate a fixed-rate advance on predetermined put dates, and offer, subject to certain conditions, replacement funding at then-current advances rates. We may hedge a putable advance by entering into a derivative that is cancelable by the derivative counterparty, where we pay a fixed-rate coupon and receive a variable-rate coupon. This type of hedge is treated as a fair-value hedge. The swap counterparty would normally exercise its option to cancel the derivative at par on any defined exercise date if interest rates had risen, and at that time, we could, at our option, require immediate repayment of the advance.
Additionally, the borrower's option to prepay an advance can create interest-rate risk. When a borrower prepays an advance, we could suffer lower future income if the principal portion of the prepaid advance were invested in lower-yielding assets that continue to be funded by higher-cost debt. To protect against this risk, we generally charge a prepayment fee that makes us financially indifferent to a borrower's decision to prepay an advance. If the advance is hedged with a derivative instrument, the prepayment fee will generally offset the cost of terminating the designated hedge. When we offer advances (other than short-term advances) that a borrower may prepay without a prepayment fee, we usually finance such advances with callable debt with an interest-rate swap cancellable by us.
COs. We may enter into derivatives to hedge (or partially hedge, depending on the risk strategy) the interest-rate risk associated with our specific debt issuances, including using derivatives to change the effective interest-rate sensitivity of debt to better match the characteristics of funded assets. We endeavor to manage the risk arising from changing market prices and volatility of a CO by matching the cash inflow on the derivative with the cash outflow on the CO.
As an example of such a hedging strategy, when fixed-rate COs are issued, we may simultaneously enter into a matching derivative in which we receive a fixed-interest cash flows designed to mirror in timing and amount the interest cash outflows we pay on the CO. At the same time, we may pay variable cash flows that closely match the interest payments we receive on short-term or variable-rate assets. In some cases, the hedged CO may have a nonstatic coupon that is subject to fair-value risk and that is matched by the receivable coupon on the hedging interest-rate swap. These transactions are treated as fair-value hedges.
In a typical cash-flow hedge of anticipated CO issuance, we may enter into interest-rate swaps to hedge the cost of anticipated future issuance of fixed-rate CO bonds against potential rising interest rates. The interest-rate swap is terminated upon issuance
of the fixed-rate CO bond. Changes in fair value of the hedging derivative, to the extent that the hedge is effective, will be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the cash flows of the fixed-rate CO bond affects earnings (beginning upon issuance and continuing over the life of the CO bond).
Firm Commitments. Mortgage loan purchase commitments are considered derivatives. When the mortgage loan purchase commitment derivative settles, the current market value of the commitment is included in the basis of the mortgage loan. The basis adjustments on the resulting performing loans are then amortized into net interest income over the life of the loans.
We may also hedge a firm commitment for a forward-starting advance through the use of an interest-rate swap. In this case, the interest-rate swap functions as the hedging instrument for both the firm commitment and the subsequent advance and is treated as a fair value hedge. The fair-value change associated with the firm commitment is recorded as a basis adjustment of the advance at the time the commitment is terminated and the advance is issued. The basis adjustment is then amortized into interest income over the life of the advance.
Financial Statement Impact and Additional Financial Information. The notional amount of derivatives is a factor in determining periodic interest payments or cash flows received and paid. However, the notional amount of derivatives reflects our involvement in the various classes of financial instruments and represents neither the actual amounts exchanged nor our overall exposure to credit and market risk; the overall risk is much smaller. The risks of derivatives can be measured meaningfully on a portfolio basis that takes into account the counterparties, the types of derivatives, the tenor of the derivatives, the items being hedged, and any offsets between the derivatives and the items being hedged.
Table 8.1 - Fair Value of Derivative Instruments
(dollars in thousands)
_______________________
(1) Mortgage-delivery commitments are classified as derivatives with changes in fair value recorded in other income.
(2) Amounts represent the effect of master-netting agreements intended to allow us to settle positive and negative positions with the same counterparty. Cash collateral including accrued interest posted was $215.8 million and $178.5 million at December 31, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The change in cash collateral posted is included in the net change in interest-bearing deposits in the statement of cash flows. There was no cash collateral and related accrued interest received at December 31, 2020. Cash collateral including accrued interest received was $561 thousand at December 31, 2019.
Beginning on January 1, 2019, changes in fair value of the derivative hedging instrument and the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk for designated fair-value hedges are recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. For designated cash-flow hedges, the entire change in the fair value of the hedging instrument (assuming it is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness) is reported in other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction affects earnings. At that time, this amount is reclassified from other comprehensive income and recorded in net interest income in the same line as the earnings effect of the hedged item. Prior to January 1, 2019, for both fair value and cash-flow hedges, any hedge ineffectiveness (which represented the amount by which the change in the fair value of the derivative differed from the change in the fair value of the hedged item or the variability in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction attributable to the hedged risk) was recorded in noninterest income as net gains on derivatives and hedging activities.
Tables 8.2 presents the net gains (losses) on qualifying fair-value hedging relationships. Beginning on January 1, 2019, gains (losses) on derivatives include unrealized changes in fair value as well as net interest settlements.

For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, there were no reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash-flow hedges because the original forecasted transactions were not expected to occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within a two-month period thereafter. As of December 31, 2020, the maximum length of time over which we are hedging our exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions is one year.
As of December 31, 2020, the amount of deferred net losses on derivatives accumulated in other comprehensive loss related to cash flow hedges expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months is $6.0 million.

Impacts on Statement of Cash Flows. Due to declines in market values, from our perspective, of cleared derivatives during the year ended December 31, 2020, there was an increase in variation margin posted on cleared derivatives to the DCOs totaling $375.7 million. On the statement of cash flows, $321.9 million of the variation margin cash payment is included in net change in derivatives and hedging activities, as an operating activity, while $53.8 million of the variation margin cash payment is included in net payments on derivatives with a financing element, as a financing activity.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we terminated certain uncleared interest-rate exchange agreements with a total notional amount of $611.9 million which were indexed to three-month LIBOR on the floating leg of the swaps. The net fair value of these derivative transactions, from our perspective, was $(251.5) million, which was transferred to the bilateral counterparty upon termination, and securities collateral that we had pledged against this obligation was returned to us. This cash payment is included in net change in derivatives and hedging activities, within the operating activities section of the statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019. Simultaneously with the termination of these derivatives, we entered into replacement interest-rate exchange agreements (the replacement derivatives) having the same notional amount of $611.9 million and which are indexed to the OIS rate based on the federal funds effective rate on the floating leg of the swaps. Upon settlement of the replacement derivatives, the Bank received an initial upfront payment of $251.5 million. The replacement
derivatives are cleared through DCO, which called for variation margin to be delivered. Because the replacement derivatives include off-market terms and this large initial upfront payment, all payments for the replacement derivatives are classified as net payments on derivative contracts with a financing element, within the financing activities section of the statement of cash flows.
Managing Credit Risk on Derivatives. We are subject to credit risk on our hedging activities due to the risk of nonperformance by nonmember counterparties (including DCOs and their clearing members acting as agent to the DCOs as well as uncleared counterparties) to the derivative agreements. We manage credit risk through credit analysis, collateral requirements and adherence to the requirements set forth in our policies, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) regulations, and FHFA regulations.
Uncleared Derivatives. All counterparties must execute master-netting agreements prior to entering into any uncleared derivative with us. Our master-netting agreements for uncleared derivatives contain bilateral-collateral exchange agreements that require that credit exposure beyond a defined threshold amount (which may be zero) be secured by readily marketable, U.S. Treasury, U.S. Government-guaranteed, or GSE securities, or cash. The level of these collateral threshold amounts (when applicable) varies according to the counterparty's Standard & Poor's Rating Service (S&P) or Moody's Investors Services (Moody's) long-term credit ratings. Credit exposures are then measured daily and adjustments to collateral positions are made in accordance with the terms of the master-netting agreements. These master-netting agreements also contain bilateral ratings-tied termination events permitting us to terminate all outstanding derivatives transactions with a counterparty in the event of a specified rating downgrade by Moody's or S&P. Based on credit analyses and collateral requirements, we do not anticipate any credit losses on our derivative agreements.
We execute uncleared derivatives with nonmember counterparties with long-term ratings of single-A (or equivalent) or better by the major NRSROs at the time of the transaction, although risk-reducing trades may be permitted for counterparties whose ratings have fallen below these ratings. Some of these counterparties or their affiliates buy, sell, and distribute COs. See Note 10 - Consolidated Obligations for additional information.
Certain of our uncleared derivatives master-netting agreements contain provisions that require us to post additional collateral with our uncleared derivatives counterparties if our credit ratings are lowered. Under the terms that govern such agreements, if our credit rating is lowered by Moody's or S&P to a certain level, we are required to deliver additional collateral on uncleared derivatives in a net liability position, unless the collateral delivery threshold is set to zero. In the event of a split between such credit ratings, the lower rating governs. The aggregate fair value of all uncleared derivatives with these provisions that were in a net-liability position (before cash collateral and related accrued interest) at December 31, 2020, was $77.4 million for which we had delivered collateral with a post-haircut value of $76.7 million in accordance with the terms of the master-netting agreements. Securities collateral is subject to valuation haircuts in accordance with the terms of the master-netting arrangements. Table 8.6 sets forth the post-haircut value of incremental collateral that certain uncleared derivatives counterparties could have required us to deliver based on incremental credit rating downgrades at December 31, 2020.
Table 8.6 - Post Haircut Value of Incremental Collateral to be Delivered as of December 31, 2020
(dollars in thousands)
_______________________
(1) Ratings are expressed in this table according to S&P's conventions but include the equivalent of such rating by Moody's. If there is a split rating, the lower rating is used.
Cleared Derivatives. For cleared derivatives, the DCO is our counterparty. The DCO notifies the clearing member of the required initial and variation margin and our agent (clearing member) in turn notifies us. We utilize two DCOs, for all cleared derivative transactions, CME Inc. and LCH Ltd. Based upon their rulebooks, we characterize variation margin payments as daily settlement payments, rather than as collateral. At both DCOs, posted initial margin is considered collateral. We post initial margin and exchange variation margin through a clearing member which acts as our agent to the DCO and which guarantees our performance to the DCO, subject to the terms of relevant agreements. These arrangements expose us to credit risk in the event that one of our clearing members or one of the DCOs fails to meet its obligations. The use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because the DCO, which is fully secured at all times through margin received from its
clearing members, is substituted for the credit risk exposure of individual counterparties in uncleared derivatives, and collateral is posted at least once daily for changes in the fair value of cleared derivatives through a clearing member.
For cleared derivatives, the DCO determines initial margin requirements. We clear our trades via clearing members of the DCOs. These clearing members who act as our agent to the DCOs are CFTC-registered futures commission merchants. Our clearing members may require us to post margin in excess of DCO requirements based on our credit or other considerations, including but not limited to, credit rating downgrades. We were not required to post any such excess margin by our clearing members based on credit or any other considerations at December 31, 2020.
Offsetting of Certain Derivatives. We present derivatives, any related cash collateral received or pledged, and associated accrued interest, on a net basis by counterparty.
We have analyzed the rights, rules, and regulations governing our cleared and non-cleared derivatives and determined that those rights, rules, and regulations should result in a net claim with each of our counterparties (which, in the context of cleared derivatives is through each of our clearing members with the related DCO) upon an event of default (solely in the case of non-cleared derivatives) or the bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar proceeding involving our counterparty (and/or one of our clearing members, in the case of cleared derivatives). For this purpose, "net claim" generally means a single net amount reflecting the aggregation of all amounts owed by us to the relevant counterparty and payable to us from the relevant counterparty.
Table 8.7 presents separately the fair value of derivatives that are subject to netting due to a legal right of offset based on the terms of our master netting arrangements or similar agreements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the fair value of derivatives that are not subject to such netting. Derivatives subject to netting include any related cash collateral received from or pledged to counterparties.

Note 9 - Deposits
We offer demand and overnight deposits for members and qualifying nonmembers, and prior to February 19, 2021, we offered term deposits to our members. Members that service mortgage loans may deposit funds collected in connection with mortgage loans pending disbursement of such funds to the owners of the mortgage loans, which we classify as "other" in the following table.
Deposits classified as demand, overnight, and other pay interest based on a daily interest rate. Term deposits pay interest based on a fixed rate determined at the issuance of the deposit. The average interest rate paid on average deposits during 2020 and 2019 was 0.10 percent and 1.16 percent, respectively.

Note 10 - Consolidated Obligations
COs consist of CO bonds and CO discount notes. CO bonds may be issued to raise short-, intermediate-, and long-term funds and are not subject to any statutory or regulatory limits on maturity. CO discount notes are issued to raise short-term funds and have original maturities of up to one year. These notes sell at less than their face amount and are redeemed at par value when they mature.
Although we are primarily liable for the portion of COs issued for which we received issuance proceeds, we are also jointly and severally liable with the other FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on all COs. The FHFA, at its discretion, may
require any FHLBank to make principal or interest payments due on any CO whether or not the CO represents a primary liability of such FHLBank. Although an FHLBank has never paid the principal or interest payments due on a CO on behalf of another FHLBank, if that event should occur, FHFA regulations provide that the paying FHLBank is entitled to reimbursement from the noncomplying FHLBank for any payments made on its behalf and other associated costs, including interest to be determined by the FHFA. If, however, the FHFA determines that the noncomplying FHLBank is unable to satisfy its repayment obligations, the FHFA may allocate the outstanding liabilities of the noncomplying FHLBank among the remaining FHLBanks on a pro rata basis in proportion to each FHLBank's participation in all COs outstanding or in any other manner it may determine to ensure that the FHLBanks operate in a safe and sound manner. See Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies for additional information regarding the FHLBanks' joint and several liability.
The par values of the FHLBanks' outstanding COs, including COs on which other FHLBanks are primarily liable, were approximately $746.8 billion and $1.0 trillion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Regulations require each FHLBank to maintain unpledged qualifying assets equal to outstanding COs for which it is primarily liable. Such qualifying assets include cash; secured advances; obligations of or fully guaranteed by the U.S.; obligations, participations, or other instruments of or issued by Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae; mortgages, obligations, or other securities which are or ever have been sold by Freddie Mac; and such securities as fiduciary and trust funds may invest in under the laws of the state in which the FHLBank is located. Any assets subject to a lien or pledge for the benefit of holders of any issues of COs are treated as if they were free from lien or pledge for purposes of compliance with these regulations.
CO Bonds.

CO bonds outstanding were issued with either fixed-rate coupon-payment terms or variable-rate coupon-payment terms that may use a variety of indices for interest-rate resets, such as SOFR and LIBOR. To meet the expected specific needs of certain investors in CO bonds, both fixed-rate CO bonds and variable-rate CO bonds may contain features which may result in complex coupon-payment terms and call options. When these CO bonds are issued, we may enter into derivatives containing features that offset the terms and embedded options, if any, of the CO bonds.

Note 11 - Affordable Housing Program
The FHLBank Act requires each FHLBank to establish and maintain an AHP to provide subsidies in the form of direct grants and below-market interest-rate advances (AHP advances). These funds are intended to assist in the purchase, construction, or rehabilitation of housing for very low-, low-, and moderate-income households. Each FHLBank is required to contribute to its
AHP the greater of 10 percent of its previous year's net income before interest expense associated with mandatorily redeemable capital stock and the assessment for AHP (AHP earnings), or the prorated sum required to ensure the aggregate contribution by the FHLBanks is no less than $100 million for each year. We accrue this expense monthly based on our AHP earnings, and the accruals are accumulated into our AHP payable account. We may elect to voluntarily contribute amounts in addition to the required accruals. We reduce our AHP payable account as we disburse the funds either in the form of direct grants to member institutions or as a discount on below-market-rate AHP advances.
If we experience a net loss during a quarter, but still have AHP earnings for the year, our obligation to the AHP would be calculated based on our AHP earnings for that calendar year. In annual periods where our AHP earnings are zero or less, our required AHP assessment is zero since our required annual contribution is limited to our annual AHP earnings. If the result of the aggregate 10 percent calculation described above is less than $100 million for all the FHLBanks, then each FHLBank would be required to contribute such prorated sums as may be required to ensure that the aggregate contributions by the FHLBanks equals $100 million. The proration would be made on the basis of the income of the FHLBanks for the year, except that the
required annual AHP contribution for an FHLBank cannot exceed its AHP earnings for the year pursuant to an FHFA regulation. Each FHLBank's required annual AHP contribution is limited to its annual net earnings. Our required AHP expense for 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $13.4 million, $21.3 million, and $24.3 million, respectively. Additionally, in 2020 we voluntarily contributed $1.6 million to our AHP, resulting in a total combined contribution amount of $15.0 million for the year.
There was no shortfall, as described above, in 2020, 2019, or 2018. If an FHLBank is experiencing financial instability and finds that its required AHP contributions are contributing to the financial instability, the FHLBank may apply to the FHFA for a temporary suspension of its contributions. We did not make such an application in 2020, 2019, or 2018.

Note 12 - Capital
We are subject to capital requirements under our capital plan, the FHLBank Act, and FHFA regulations and guidance:
1. Risk-based capital. We are required to maintain at all times permanent capital, defined as Class B stock, including Class B stock classified as mandatorily redeemable capital stock, and retained earnings, in an amount at least equal to the sum of our credit-risk capital requirement, market-risk capital requirement, and operations-risk capital requirement, calculated in accordance with FHFA rules and regulations, referred to herein as the risk-based capital requirement. Only permanent capital satisfies the risk-based capital requirement.
2. Total regulatory capital. We are required to maintain at all times a total capital-to-assets ratio of at least four percent. Total regulatory capital is the sum of permanent capital, the amount paid-in for Class A stock, the amount of any general loss allowance if consistent with GAAP and not established for specific assets, and other amounts from sources determined by the FHFA as available to absorb losses. We have never issued Class A stock.
3. Leverage capital. We are required to maintain at all times a leverage capital-to-assets ratio of at least five percent. Leverage capital is calculated by multiplying permanent capital by 1.5 and adding to this product all other components of total capital.
The FHFA has authority to require us to maintain a greater amount of permanent capital than is required as defined by the risk-based capital requirements.
Table 12.1 - Regulatory Capital Requirements
(dollars in thousands)
We are a cooperative whose members own most of our capital stock. Former members (including certain nonmembers that own our capital stock as a result of merger or acquisition, relocation, or involuntary termination of membership) own the remaining capital stock to support business transactions still carried on our statement of condition. Shares of capital stock cannot be purchased or sold except between us and our members at $100 per share par value. We have only issued Class B stock and each member is required to purchase Class B stock equal to the sum of 0.20 percent of certain member assets eligible to secure advances under the FHLBank Act, provided that this amount is not less than $10 thousand nor more than $10 million (the membership stock investment requirement), and 3.00 percent for overnight advances, 4.00 percent for all other advances, 0.25 percent for outstanding letters of credit, and 4.50 percent of the unpaid principal balance of certain mortgage we purchased through the MPF program (collectively, the activity-based stock-investment requirement). The sum of the membership stock investment requirement and the activity-based stock investment requirement, rounded up to the nearest whole share, represents the total stock investment requirement.
Members may redeem Class B stock after no sooner than five years' notice provided in accordance with our capital plan (the redemption-notice period). The effective date of termination of membership for any member that voluntarily withdraws from membership is the end of the redemption-notice period, at which time any stock that is held as a condition of membership shall be divested, subject to any other applicable restrictions. At that time, any stock held pursuant to activity-based stock investment requirements shall remain outstanding until such requirements are eliminated by disposition of the related business activity. Any member that withdraws from membership may not be readmitted to membership in any FHLBank until five years from the divestiture date for all capital stock that is held as a condition of membership. This restriction does not apply if the member is transferring its membership from one FHLBank to another on an uninterrupted basis.
The redemption-notice period can also be triggered by the involuntary termination of membership of a member by our board of directors or by the FHFA, the merger or acquisition of a member into a nonmember institution, or the relocation of a member to a principal location outside our district. At the end of the redemption-notice period, if the former member's activity-based stock
investment requirement is greater than zero, we may require the associated remaining obligations to us to be satisfied in full prior to allowing the member to redeem the remaining shares.
Because our Class B stock is subject to redemption in certain instances, we can experience a reduction in our capital, particularly due to membership terminations due to merger and acquisition activity. However, there are several mitigants to this risk, including, but not limited to, the following:
•the activity-based stock-investment requirement allows us to retain stock beyond the redemption-notice period if the associated member-related activity is still outstanding, until the obligations are paid in full;
•the redemption notice period allows for a significant period in which we can restructure our balance sheet to accommodate a reduction in capital;
•our board of directors may modify the membership stock-investment requirement (MSIR) or the activity-based stock-investment requirement (ABSIR), or both, to address expected shortfalls in capitalization due to membership termination;
•our board of directors or the FHFA may suspend redemptions in the event that such redemptions would cause us not to meet our minimum regulatory capital requirements; and
•the growth in our retained earnings, which are included in our equity capital, helps offset the risk that our capital could be reduced by redemptions.
Our board of directors may declare and pay dividends in either cash or capital stock, subject to limitations in applicable law and our capital plan.
Restricted Retained Earnings. At December 31, 2020, our restricted retained earnings totaled $368.4 million and exceeded the contribution requirement of $354.4 million. Restricted retained earnings are not available to pay dividends.
Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock. We will reclassify capital stock subject to redemption from equity to liability once a member exercises a written notice of redemption, gives notice of intent to withdraw from membership, or attains nonmember status by merger or acquisition, charter termination, or involuntary termination from membership. Dividends related to capital stock classified as a liability are accrued at the expected dividend rate and reported as interest expense in the statement of operations. If a member cancels its written notice of redemption or notice of withdrawal, we will reclassify mandatorily redeemable capital stock from a liability to equity. After the reclassification, dividends on the capital stock would no longer be classified as interest expense.
Redemption of capital stock is subject to the redemption-notice period and our satisfaction of applicable minimum capital requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock of $221 thousand, $974 thousand, and $1.9 million, respectively, were recorded as interest expense.
Table 12.2 - Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock
(dollars in thousands)
The number of stockholders holding mandatorily redeemable capital stock was twelve, nine, and ten at December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
Table 12.3 - Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock by Expiry of Redemption Notice Period
(dollars in thousands)
_______________________
(1) Amount represents mandatorily redeemable capital stock that has reached the end of the five-year redemption-notice period but the member-related activity (for example, advances) remains outstanding. Accordingly, these shares of stock will not be redeemed until the activity is no longer outstanding.
(2) Amount represents reclassifications to mandatorily redeemable capital stock resulting from an FHFA rule effective February 19, 2016, that makes captive insurance companies ineligible for membership. Captive insurance company members that were admitted as members prior to September 12, 2014, had their memberships terminated on February 19, 2021.
A member may cancel or revoke its written notice of redemption or its notice of withdrawal from membership prior to the end of the redemption-notice period. Our capital plan provides that we will charge the member a cancellation fee in the amount of 2.0 percent of the par amount of the shares of Class B stock that is the subject of the redemption notice. We will assess a redemption-cancellation fee unless the board of directors decides that it has a bona fide business purpose for waiving the imposition of the fee, and such a waiver is consistent with the FHLBank Act.
Excess Capital Stock Repurchases. Our capital plan provides us with the sole discretion to repurchase capital stock from a member at par value that is in excess of the amount required to meet the member's total stock investment requirement (excess capital stock) subject to all applicable limitations. In conducting any repurchases, we repurchase any shares that are the subject of an outstanding redemption notice from the member from whom we are repurchasing prior to repurchasing any other shares that are in excess of the member's total stock-investment requirement (TSIR). We generally repurchase excess stock held by any shareholder whose excess stock exceeds the lesser of $10.0 million or 10 percent of the shareholder’s total stock investment requirement, subject to a minimum repurchase of $100,000. We plan to continue with this practice, subject to regulatory requirements and our anticipated liquidity or capital management needs, although continued repurchases remain at our sole discretion, and we retain authority to suspend repurchases of excess stock from any shareholder or all shareholders without prior notice. In addition to these daily repurchases, subject to our sole discretion shareholders may request that we voluntarily repurchase excess stock shares at any time. We may also allow the member to sell the excess capital stock at par value to another one of our members.
At December 31, 2020 and 2019, members and nonmembers with capital stock outstanding held excess capital stock totaling $90.8 million and $79.7 million, respectively, representing approximately 7.1 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively, of total capital stock outstanding. FHFA rules limit our ability to create member excess capital stock under certain circumstances. We may not pay dividends in the form of capital stock or issue new excess capital stock to members if our excess capital stock exceeds one percent of our total assets or if the issuance of excess capital stock would cause our excess capital stock to exceed one percent of our total assets. At December 31, 2020, we had excess capital stock outstanding totaling 0.2 percent of our total assets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we complied with the FHFA's excess capital stock rule.
Capital Classification Determination. We are subject to the FHFA's regulation on FHLBank capital classification and critical capital levels (the Capital Rule). The Capital Rule, among other things, defines criteria for four capital classifications and corrective action requirements for FHLBanks that are classified in any classification other than adequately capitalized. An adequately capitalized FHLBank is one that has sufficient permanent and total capital to satisfy its risk-based and minimum capital requirements. We satisfied these requirements at December 31, 2020. However, pursuant to the Capital Rule, the FHFA has discretion to reclassify an FHLBank and modify or add to corrective action requirements for a particular capital classification. If we become classified into a capital classification other than adequately capitalized, we will be subject to the corrective action requirements for that capital classification in addition to being subject to prohibitions on declaring dividends
and redeeming or repurchasing capital stock. By letter dated December 11, 2020, the Director of the FHFA notified us that, based on September 30, 2020 financial information, we met the definition of adequately capitalized under the Capital Rule.
Partial recovery of prior capital distribution to Financing Corporation. The Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 was enacted in August 1987, and, among other things, provided for the recapitalization of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation through a newly-chartered entity, the Financing Corporation (FICO). The capitalization of FICO was provided by capital distributions from the FHLBanks to FICO in exchange for FICO nonvoting capital stock. Capital distributions were made by the FHLBanks in 1987, 1988 and 1989 that aggregated to $680 million. Upon passage of Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, the FHLBanks’ previous investment in capital stock of FICO was determined to be non-redeemable and the FHLBanks charged-off their prior capital distributions to FICO directly against retained earnings.
Upon the dissolution of FICO in July 2020, FICO determined that excess funds aggregating to $200 million were available for distribution to its stockholders, the FHLBanks. FICO distributed these funds to the FHLBanks in June 2020. Our partial recovery of prior capital distribution totaled $3.7 million, which was determined based on our share of the $680 million originally contributed by the FHLBanks. We have treated the receipt of these funds as a return of our investment in FICO capital stock, and therefore as a partial recovery of the prior capital distributions made by the Bank to FICO in 1987, 1988, and 1989. These funds have been credited to unrestricted retained earnings.

Note 14 - Employee Retirement Plans
Qualified Defined Benefit Multiemployer Plan. We participate in the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan for Financial Institutions (the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan), a funded, tax-qualified, noncontributory defined-benefit pension plan. The Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan is treated as a multiemployer plan for accounting purposes, but operates as a multiple-employer plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, certain multiemployer plan disclosures are not applicable to the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan. Under the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan, contributions made by a participating employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers since assets contributed by an employer are not segregated in a separate account or restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that employer. Also, in the event a participating employer is unable to meet its contribution requirements, the required contributions for the other participating employers could increase proportionately. The plan covers substantially all of our employees. For each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, in addition to our required contribution, we made voluntary contributions of $6.0 million to the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan. We were not required to nor did we pay a funding improvement surcharge to the plan for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
The Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan operates on a fiscal year from July 1 through June 30. The Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan files one Form 5500 on behalf of all employers who participate in the plan. The Employer Identification Number is 13-5645888 and the three-digit plan number is 333. We do not have any collective bargaining agreements in place.
The Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan's annual valuation process includes calculating the plan's funded status and separately calculating the funded status of each participating employer. The funded status is defined as the market value of assets divided by the funding target (100 percent of the present value of all benefit liabilities accrued at that date). As permitted by ERISA, the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan accepts contributions for the prior plan year up to eight and a half months after the asset valuation date. Accordingly, the market value of assets at the valuation date (July 1) will increase by any subsequent contributions designated for the immediately preceding plan year ended June 30.
The most recent Form 5500 available for the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan is for the plan year ended June 30, 2019. For the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan plan years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, our contributions did not represent more than five percent of the total contributions to the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan.
On November 30, 2020, the board of directors elected to freeze the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan. The Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan will be frozen to employees hired on or after January 1, 2021, and on January 1, 2024, future benefit accruals under the plan will cease for all employees that were hired before January 1, 2021.
Table 14.1 - Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan Net Pension Cost and Funded Status
(dollars in thousands)
______________________
(1) The funded status is calculated in accordance with a provision contained in the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 (HATFA), which was signed into law on August 8, 2014, and which modifies the interest rates that had been set by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21). MAP-21, signed into law in 2012, changed the calculation of the discount rate used in measuring the pension plan liability. MAP-21 allows plan sponsors to measure the pension plan liability using a 25-year average of interest rates plus or minus a corridor. Prior to MAP-21, the discount rate used in measuring the pension plan liability was based on the 24-month average of interest rates. HATFA amended MAP-21 by extending the time period and reducing the rate at which the 25-year corridors widen. Over time, the pension funding stabilization effect of MAP-21 will decline because the 24-month smoothed segment rates and the amended 25-year corridors are likely to converge.
(2) The funded status as of July 1, 2020, is preliminary and may increase because the plan's participants were permitted to make contributions for the plan year ended June 30, 2020, through March 15, 2021. Contributions made on or before March 15, 2021, and designated for the plan year ended June 30, 2020, will be included in the final valuation as of July 1, 2020. The final funded status as of July 1, 2020, will not be available until the Form 5500 for the plan year July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2021 is filed. This Form 5500 is due to be filed no later than April 2022.
(3) The funded status as of July 1, 2019, is preliminary and may increase because the plan's participants were permitted to make contributions for the plan year ended June 30, 2019, through March 15, 2020. Contributions made on or before March 15, 2020, and designated for the plan year ended June 30, 2019, will be included in the final valuation as of July 1, 2020. The final funded status as of July 1, 2019, will not be available until the Form 5500 for the plan year July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020 is filed. This Form 5500 is due to be filed no later than April 2021.
Qualified Defined Contribution Plan. We also participate in the Pentegra Defined Contribution Plan for Financial Institutions, a tax-qualified defined contribution plan. The plan covers substantially all of our employees. We contribute a percentage of the participants' compensation by making a matching contribution equal to a percentage of voluntary employee contributions, subject to certain limitations. Our matching contributions are charged to compensation and benefits expense and are not considered to be material.
On November 30, 2020, the board of directors adopted changes to the Pentegra Defined Contribution Plan to add, subject to certain limitations of the Internal Revenue Code, a non-elective, non-matching contribution from the Bank of six percent of each eligible employee’s salary for employees who are ineligible to accrue benefits under the Pentegra Defined Benefit Plan, either because they were hired on or after January 1, 2021, or because benefit accruals have ceased on January 1, 2024.
Nonqualified Defined Contribution Plan. We also maintain the Thrift Benefit Equalization Plan, a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan covering certain of our senior officers and directors. The plan's liability consists of the accumulated compensation deferrals and the accumulated earnings on these deferrals. Our obligation from this plan was $14.1 million and $12.6 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is recorded in other liabilities on the statement of condition. We maintain a rabbi trust, which is recorded in other assets on the statement of condition, intended to satisfy future benefit obligations. Our matching contributions are charged to compensation and benefits expense and are not considered to be material.
On November 30, 2020, the board of directors adopted changes to the Thrift Benefit Equalization Plan to add, subject to certain limitations of the Internal Revenue Code, a non-elective, non-matching contribution from the Bank of six percent of each eligible executive participant's salary for certain senior officers who are ineligible to accrue benefits under the Nonqualified Supplemental Defined Benefit Retirement Plan, either because they were hired on or after January 1, 2021, or because benefit accruals have ceased on January 1, 2024.
Nonqualified Supplemental Defined Benefit Retirement Plan. We also maintain a nonqualified, single-employer unfunded defined-benefit plan covering certain senior officers, for which our obligation is detailed below. We maintain a rabbi trust which is recorded in other assets on the statement of condition, intended to satisfy future benefit obligations.
On November 30, 2020, the board of directors elected to freeze this plan. The plan will be frozen to senior officers hired on or after January 1, 2021, and on January 1, 2024, future benefit accruals under the plan will cease for all senior officers.
Postretirement Benefits. We sponsor a fully insured postretirement benefit program that includes life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. We provide life insurance to all employees who retire on or after age 55 after completing six years of service. No contributions are required from the retirees. There are no funded plan assets that have been designated to provide postretirement benefits.

Note 15 - Fair Values
Fair-Value Methodologies and Techniques
We have determined the fair-value amounts below using available market and other pertinent information and our best judgment of appropriate valuation methods. Fair value is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or transfer a liability in the principal (or advantageous) market for the asset or liability at the measurement date (an exit price). Although we use our best judgment in estimating the fair value of these financial instruments, there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique or valuation methodology. For example, because an active secondary market does not exist for a portion of our financial instruments, in certain cases, fair values are not subject to precise quantification or verification and may change as economic and market factors and evaluation of those factors change. Therefore, these fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in current market transactions, although they do reflect our judgment of how a market participant would estimate the fair values. Additionally, these values do not represent an estimate of the overall market value of the Bank as a going concern, which would take into account, among other things, future business opportunities and the net profitability of assets and liabilities.
Fair-Value Hierarchy.
GAAP establishes a fair-value hierarchy and requires an entity to maximize the use of significant observable inputs and minimize the use of significant unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The inputs are evaluated and an overall level for the fair-value measurement is determined. This overall level is an indication of market observability of the fair-value measurement for the asset or liability. An entity must disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the measurements are classified.
The fair-value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels:
Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the reporting entity can access on the measurement date. An active market for the asset or liability is a market in which the transaction for the asset or liability occurs with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified or contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following: (1) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, and prepayment speeds); and (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data (e.g., implied spreads).
Level 3 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
We review the fair-value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of the valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of certain assets or liabilities. There were no such transfers into or out of Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Table 15.1 presents the carrying value, fair value, and fair value hierarchy of our financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We record trading securities, available-for-sale securities, derivative assets, derivative liabilities, and certain other assets at fair value on a recurring basis and certain mortgage loans, and certain other assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis. We record all other financial assets and liabilities at amortized cost. Refer to Table 15.2 for further details about the financial assets and liabilities held at fair value on either a recurring or non-recurring basis.

Summary of Valuation Methodologies and Primary Inputs
The valuation methodologies and primary inputs used to develop the measurement of fair value for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis in the Statement of Condition are listed below. The fair values and level within the fair value hierarchy of these assets and liabilities are reported in Table 15.2.
Investment Securities. We determine the fair values of our investment securities, other than HFA floating-rate securities, based on prices obtained for each of these securities that we request from multiple designated third-party pricing vendors. The fair value of each such security is the average of such vendor prices that are within a cluster pricing tolerance range. A cluster is defined as a group of available vendor prices for a given security that is within a defined price tolerance range of the median vendor price depending on the security type. An outlier is any vendor price that is outside of the defined cluster and is evaluated for reasonableness.
All prices that are within a specified tolerance threshold of the median price are included in the cluster of prices that are averaged to compute a default price. Vendor prices that are outside of a defined cluster are identified as outliers and are subject to additional review including, but not limited to, comparison to prices provided by an additional third-party valuation vendor, prices for similar securities, and/or nonbinding dealer estimates, or the use of internal model prices, which we believe reflect the
facts and circumstances that a market participant would consider. We also perform this analysis in those limited instances where no third-party vendor price or only one third-party vendor price is available to determine fair value. If the analysis indicates that an outlier is not representative of fair value and that the average of the vendor prices within the tolerance threshold of the median price is the best estimate, then we use the average of the vendor prices within the tolerance threshold of the median price as the final price. If, on the other hand, we determine that an outlier (or some other price identified in the analysis) is a better estimate of fair value, then the outlier (or the other price as appropriate) is used as the final price. In all cases, the final price is used to determine the fair value of the security.
As of December 31, 2020, multiple vendor prices were received for substantially all of our investment securities and the final prices for substantially all of those securities were computed by averaging the prices received. The relative proximity of the prices received supports our conclusion that the final computed prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Based on the current low level of market activity for private-label residential MBS, the nonrecurring fair-value measurements for such securities during 2020 and 2019 fell within Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy. Our fixed-rate HFA securities fall within Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy due to the current lack of market activities for these bonds.
Investment Securities - HFA Floating Rate Securities. The fair value is determined by calculating the present value of the expected future cash flows. The discount rates used in these calculations are the rates for securities with similar terms. Our floating rate HFA securities fall within Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy due to the current lack of market activity for these bonds.
Mortgage Loans. The fair value of impaired conventional mortgage loans is based on the lower of the carrying value of the loans or fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell. The fair value of impaired government mortgage loans is equal to the unpaid principal balance.
REO. Fair value is derived from third-party valuations of the property, which fall within Level 3 of the fair-value hierarchy.
Derivative Assets/Liabilities - Interest-Rate-Exchange Agreements. We base the fair values of interest-rate-exchange agreements on available market prices of derivatives having similar terms, including accrued interest receivable and payable. The fair-value methodology uses standard valuation techniques for derivatives such as discounted cash-flow analysis and comparisons with similar instruments.
The fair values of all interest-rate-exchange agreements are netted by clearing member and/or by counterparty, including cash collateral received from or delivered to the counterparty. If these netted amounts are positive, they are classified as an asset, and if negative, they are classified as a liability. We generally use a midmarket pricing convention based on the bid-ask spread as a practical expedient for fair-value measurements. Because these estimates are made at a specific point in time, they are susceptible to material near-term changes. We have evaluated the potential for the fair value of the instruments to be affected by counterparty risk and our own credit risk and have determined that no adjustments were significant to the overall fair-value measurements.
The discounted cash-flow model uses market-observable inputs (inputs that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources), including the following:
•Discount rate assumption. For all derivatives cleared through a DCO, at December 31, 2020, the discount rate used is SOFR, and at December 31, 2019, the discount rate used was the OIS rate based on the federal funds effective rate. For our bilateral, non-cleared interest-rate derivatives the discount rate used is either the OIS rate based on the federal funds effective rate curve or the LIBOR swap curve depending on the terms of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreement we have with each derivative counterparty.
•Forward interest-rate assumption. LIBOR swap curve or OIS based on the federal funds effective rate.
•Volatility assumption. Market-based expectations of future interest-rate volatility implied from current market prices for similar options.
Derivative Assets/Liabilities - Commitments to Invest in Mortgage Loans. Commitments to invest in mortgage loans are recorded as derivatives in the statement of condition. The fair values of such commitments are based on the end-of-day delivery commitment prices provided by the FHLBank of Chicago and a spread, derived from MBS TBA delivery commitment prices with adjustment for the contractual features of the MPF program, such as servicing and credit-enhancement features.
Subjectivity of Estimates. Estimates of the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the methodologies described above are highly subjective and require judgments regarding significant matters such as the amount and timing of future cash flows, prepayment speed assumptions, expected interest-rate volatility, possible distributions of future interest rates used to value
options, and the selection of discount rates that appropriately reflect market and credit risks. The use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the fair-value estimates. Since these estimates are made as of a specific point in time, they are susceptible to material near-term changes.

The fair values presented are as of the date the fair value adjustment was recorded.
Table 15.3 presents a reconciliation of available-for-sale securities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies
Joint and Several Liability. COs are backed by the financial resources of the FHLBanks. The FHFA has authority to require any FHLBank to repay all or a portion of the principal and interest on COs for which another FHLBank is the primary obligor. No FHLBank has ever been asked or required to repay the principal or interest on any CO on behalf of another FHLBank. We evaluate the financial condition of the other FHLBanks primarily based on known regulatory actions, publicly available financial information, and individual long-term credit-rating action as of each period-end presented. Based on this evaluation, as of December 31, 2020, and through the filing of this report, we do not believe it is likely that we will be required to repay the principal or interest on any CO on behalf of another FHLBank.
We have considered applicable FASB guidance and determined it is not necessary to recognize a liability for the fair value of our joint and several liability for all of the COs. The joint and several obligation is mandated by the FHLBank Act, as implemented by FHFA regulations, and is not the result of an arms-length transaction among the FHLBanks. The FHLBanks have no control over the amount of the guaranty or the determination of how each FHLBank would perform under the joint and several obligation. Because the FHLBanks are subject to the authority of the FHFA as it relates to decisions involving the allocation of the joint and several liability for the FHLBanks' COs, the FHLBanks' joint and several obligation is excluded from the initial recognition and measurement provisions. Accordingly, we have not recognized a liability for our joint and several obligation related to other FHLBanks' COs at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The par amounts of other FHLBanks' outstanding COs for which we are jointly and severally liable totaled $712.5 billion and $974.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. See Note 10 - Consolidated Obligations for additional information.

(dollars in thousands)
__________________________
(1) We have determined that it is unnecessary to record any liability for credit losses on these agreements.
(2) The amount of standby letters of credit outstanding excludes commitments to issue standby letters of credit that expire within one year. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, these amounts totaled $37.1 million and $27.2 million, respectively. Also excluded are commitments to issue standby letters of credit that expire after one year totaling $25 thousand and $1.8 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(3) Commitments for unused line-of-credit advances are generally for periods of up to 12 months. Since many of these commitments are not expected to be drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily indicate future liquidity requirements.
Standby Letters of Credit. We issue standby letters of credit on behalf of our members to support certain obligations of the members to third-party beneficiaries. These standby letters of credit are subject to the same collateralization and borrowing limits that are applicable to advances. Standby letters of credit may be offered to assist members in facilitating residential housing finance, community lending, and asset-liability management, and to provide liquidity. In particular, members often use standby letters of credit as collateral for deposits from state and local government agencies. Standby letters of credit are executed for members for a fee. If we are required to make payment for a beneficiary's draw, our strategy is to take prompt action to recover the funds paid to the third-party beneficiary, including converting the payment amount into a collateralized advance to the primary obligor, withdrawing the payment amount from the primary obligor's demand deposit account with us, or selling collateral pledged by the primary obligor in a commercially reasonable manner to offset the payment amount. Historically, standby letters of credit usually expire without being drawn upon. At December 31, 2020, the terms of these standby letters of credit have original expiration periods of up to 20 years, expiring no later than 2030. Currently, we offer new standby letters of credit with terms typically up to 10 years, while terms greater than 10 years may be available on an exception basis. Unearned fees for the value of the guarantees related to standby letters of credit are recorded in other liabilities and totaled $1.3 million and $1.7 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We monitor the creditworthiness of our members and housing associates that have standby letter of credit agreements outstanding based on our evaluations of the financial condition of the member or housing associate. We review available financial data, which can include regulatory call reports filed by depository institution members, regulatory financial statements filed with the appropriate state insurance department by insurance company members, audited financial statements of housing associates, SEC filings, and rating-agency reports to ensure that potentially troubled members are identified as soon as possible. In addition, we have access to most members' regulatory examination reports. We analyze this information on a regular basis.
Standby letters of credit are fully collateralized at the time of issuance. Based on our credit analyses and collateral requirements, we have not deemed it necessary to record any additional liability on these commitments.
Commitments to Invest in Mortgage Loans. Commitments to invest in mortgage loans are generally for periods not to exceed 60 business days. Such commitments are recorded as derivatives at their fair values on the statement of condition.
Pledged Collateral. We have pledged securities as collateral related to derivatives. See Note 8 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities for additional information about our pledged collateral and other credit-risk-related contingent features.
Legal Proceedings. We are subject to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business from time to time. We would record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management does not anticipate that the ultimate liability, if any, arising out of these matters will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
Other commitments and contingencies are discussed in Note 6 - Advances, Note 8 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities, Note 10 - Consolidated Obligations, Note 11 - Affordable Housing Program, Note 12 - Capital, and Note 14 - Employee Retirement Plans.
Note 17 - Transactions with Shareholders
We are a cooperative whose members own our capital stock and may receive dividends on their investment in our capital stock. In addition, certain former members and nonmembers that still have outstanding transactions with us are also required to maintain their investment in our capital stock until the transactions mature or are paid off. All advances are issued to members or housing associates, and mortgage loans held for portfolio are generally acquired from our members or housing associates. We also maintain demand-deposit accounts for members and housing associates primarily to facilitate settlement activities that are directly related to advances, mortgage-loan purchases, and other transactions between us and the member or housing associate. In instances where the member has an officer or director who serves as a director of the Bank, those transactions are subject to the same eligibility and credit criteria, as well as the same terms and conditions, as transactions with all other members.
Related Parties. We define related parties as members who owned 10 percent or more of the voting interests of our capital stock outstanding at year end. Each member eligible to vote is entitled to cast by ballot one vote for each share of stock that it was required to hold as of the record date, which is December 31, of the year prior to each election, subject to the limitation that no member may cast more votes than the average number of shares of our stock that is required to be held by all members located in such member's state. Under the FHLBank Act and FHFA regulations, each member directorship is designated to one of the six states in our district. Eligible members are permitted to vote all their eligible shares for one candidate for each open member directorship in the state in which the member is located and for each open independent directorship. A nonmember stockholder is not entitled to cast votes for the election of directors unless it was a member as of the record date. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, no shareholder owned more than 10 percent of the total voting interests due to statutory limits on members' voting rights, therefore, we did not have any related parties.
Shareholder Concentrations. We consider shareholder concentrations as members or nonmembers whose capital stock holdings (including mandatorily redeemable capital stock) are in excess of 10 percent of total capital stock outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019. At December 31, 2020, no shareholder has more than 10 percent of total capital stock outstanding.

We held sufficient collateral to support the advances to the above institution such that we do not expect to incur any credit losses on these advances.
Transactions with Directors' Institutions. We provide, in the ordinary course of business, products and services to members whose officers or directors serve on our board of directors. In accordance with FHFA regulations, transactions with directors' institutions are conducted on the same terms as those with any other member.

Note 18 - Transactions with Other FHLBanks
We may occasionally enter into transactions with other FHLBanks. These transactions are summarized below.
Overnight Funds. We may borrow or lend unsecured overnight funds from or to other FHLBanks. All such transactions are at current market rates. Interest income and interest expense related to these transactions with other FHLBanks are included within other interest income and interest expense from other borrowings in the statement of operations. Interest income on loans to other FHLBanks was $48 thousand, $25 thousand and $21 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Interest expense for loans from other FHLBanks was $218 thousand, $20 thousand, and $36 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.
MPF Mortgage Loans. We pay a transaction-services fee and a membership fee to the FHLBank of Chicago for our participation in the MPF program. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we recorded $2.9 million, $2.8 million, and $2.5 million, respectively in MPF transaction-services fee expense to the FHLBank of Chicago which has been recorded in the statement of operations as other expense. The membership fee has been recorded in the statement of operations as an operating expense, and totaled $600 thousand for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. In addition, beginning in 2020, we receive an MPF performance fee from the FHLBank of Chicago. The MPF performance fee for the year ended December 31, 2020 amounted to $50 thousand and was recorded in the statement of operations as other income.
COs. From time to time, one FHLBank may transfer to another FHLBank the COs for which the transferring FHLBank was originally the primary obligor but upon transfer the assuming FHLBank becomes the primary obligor. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we transferred debt obligations with par amounts of $985.1 million and $10.0 million, respectively, and fair values of approximately $1.0 billion and $12.7 million, respectively, on the day they were transferred. During the year ended December 31, 2018, there were no transfers of COs between us and other FHLBanks.
Note 19 - Subsequent Events
On February 19, 2021, the board of directors declared a cash dividend at an annualized rate of 1.59 percent based on daily average capital stock balances outstanding during the fourth quarter of 2020. The dividend, including dividends classified as interest on mandatorily redeemable capital stock, amounted to $5.4 million and was paid on March 2, 2021.
