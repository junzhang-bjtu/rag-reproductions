Report on Management’s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
The management of FB Financial Corporation (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements. No matter how well designed, internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden, and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.
The Company's management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).
In conducting the evaluation of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, the Company has excluded the operations of FNB Financial Corp. and its subsidiary and Franklin Financial Network, Inc. and its subsidiaries as permitted by the guidance issued by the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (not to extend more than one year beyond the date of the acquisition or for more than one annual reporting period). In conducting the evaluation of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020, the Company has excluded those disclosure controls and procedures of the acquired entities that are subsumed by internal control over financial reporting. The mergers of FNB Financial Corp. and Franklin Financial Network, Inc. were completed on February 14, 2020 and August 15, 2020, respectively. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, acquired assets represented approximately 35 percent of the Company’s consolidated assets. See "Note 2. Mergers and Acquisitions" for further discussion of the mergers and the impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
Based on this assessment management has determined that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the specified criteria.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of FB Financial Corporation (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for credit losses effective January 1, 2020 due to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification No. 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326). The Company adopted the new credit loss standard using the modified retrospective method such that prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable generally accepted accounting principles.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Note (1)-Basis of presentation:
(A) Organization and Company overview:
FB Financial Corporation (the “Company”) is a financial holding company headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, FirstBank (the "Bank") and FirstBank Risk Management, Inc. The Bank operates through 81 full-service branches throughout Tennessee, southern Kentucky, north Alabama, and north Georgia, and a national online mortgage business with office locations across the Southeast, which primarily originates mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market.
On August 15, 2020, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of Franklin Financial Network, Inc. ("Franklin"). The transaction added a new subsidiary to the Company, FirstBank Risk Management ("FBRM") (formerly known as Franklin Synergy Risk Management), which provides risk management services to the Company in the form of enhanced insurance coverages. It also added a new subsidiary to the Bank, FirstBank Investments of Tennessee, Inc. ("FBIT"), which provides investment services to the Bank. FBIT has a wholly owned subsidiary, FirstBank Investments of Nevada, Inc. ("FBIN") to provide investment services to FBIT. FBIN has a controlling interest in a subsidiary, FirstBank Preferred Capital, Inc. ("FBPC"), which serves as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), to allow the Bank to sell real estate loans to the REIT to obtain a tax benefit. Refer to Note 2, "Mergers and acquisitions" for additional information on this acquisition.
The Bank is subject to competition from other financial services companies and financial institutions. The Company and the Bank are also subject to the regulations of certain federal and state agencies and undergo periodic examinations by those regulatory authorities. See "Supervision and regulation" in part 1, item 1, for more details regarding regulatory oversight.
The Company continues to qualify as an emerging growth company as defined by the "Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act" ("JOBS Act").
During 2020, the COVID-19 health pandemic created a crisis resulting in volatility in financial markets, sudden, unprecedented job losses, and disruption in consumer and commercial behavior, resulting in governments in the United States and globally to intervene with varying levels of direct monetary support and fiscal stimulus packages. All industries, municipalities and consumers have been impacted by the health crisis to some degree, including the markets that we serve. In attempts to “flatten the curve”, businesses not deemed essential were closed or constrained to capacity limitations, individuals were asked to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and shelter in place. These actions resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses, leading to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, widening of credit spreads, dislocation of bond markets, disruption of global supply chains and changes in consumer spending behavior. As certain restrictions began lifting and more businesses were allowed to open their doors in late 2020, we began to experience a slow improvement in commerce through much of the Company's footprint. Despite the pickup in economic activity late in the year, there is uncertainty regarding the long term effects on the global economy which could have an adverse impact on the Company.
(B) Basis of presentation:
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and general banking industry. In preparing the financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and the reported results of operations for the year then ended. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. It is possible that the Company's estimate of the allowance for credit losses and determination of impairment of goodwill could change as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy. The resulting change in these estimates could be material to the Company's financial statements.
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Bank, and its’ wholly-owned subsidiaries, FirstBank Insurance, Inc., Investors Title Company, in addition to the newly acquired subsidiaries mentioned above. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation without any impact on the reported amounts of net income or shareholders’ equity.
Certain accounting policies identified below were modified during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to the Company's audited financial statements on Form 10-K filed on March 13, 2020 for accounting policies in place as of December 31, 2019.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
(C) Cash flows:
For purposes of reporting consolidated cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, federal funds sold and interest earning deposits in other financial institutions with maturities of less than 90 days at the date of purchase. These amounts are reported in the consolidated balance sheets caption “Cash and cash equivalents.” Net cash flows are reported for loans held for investment, deposits and short-term borrowings.
(D) Cash and cash equivalents:
The Company considers all highly liquid unrestricted investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
(E) Investment securities:
Debt securities are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost, excluding accrued interest, when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Debt securities are classified as available-for-sale when they might be sold before maturity. Available-for-sale debt securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. Beginning January 1, 2020, unrealized losses resulting from credit losses for available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in earnings as a provision for credit losses. Unrealized losses that do not result from credit losses are excluded from earnings and reported as accumulated other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes, which is included in equity. Accrued interest receivable is separated from other components of amortized cost and presented separately on the consolidated balance sheets.
Equity securities with readily determinable market values are carried at fair value on the balance sheet with any periodic changes in value made through adjustments to the statement of income. Equity securities without readily determinable market values are carried at cost less impairment and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.
Interest income includes the amortization and accretion of purchase premium and discount. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method anticipating prepayments based upon the prior three month average monthly prepayments when available. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method.
The Company evaluates available-for-sale securities for expected credit losses at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, consideration is given to the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. In analyzing an issuer’s financial condition, the Company considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, and the results of reviews of the issuer’s financial condition.
When credit losses are expected to occur, the amount of the expected credit loss recognized in earnings depends on the Company's intention to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If the Company intends to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the expected credit loss recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between its amortized cost basis and its fair value at the date it was determined to be impaired due to credit losses or other factors. The previous amortized cost basis less the impairment recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.
However, if the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not to be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. If the Company determines a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of an available-for-sale investment security has resulted from credit related factors, beginning January 1, 2020 with the adoption of CECL, the Company records a credit loss through an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than amortized cost. The amount of the allowance for credit losses is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized as a charge to earnings. The amount of the impairment related to other, non-credit related, factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.
The Company did not record any provision for credit losses for its available-for-sale debt securities during the year ended December 31, 2020, as the majority of the investment portfolio is government guaranteed and declines in fair value below amortized cost were determined to be non-credit related.

(F) Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock:
The Bank accounts for its investments in FHLB stock in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 942-325 "Financial Services-Depository and Lending-Investments-Other." FHLB stock are equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value because its ownership is restricted and lacks a market. FHLB stock is carried at cost and evaluated for impairment.
(G) Loans held for sale:
Loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market, primarily mortgage loans, are carried at fair value as permitted under the guidance in ASC 825, “Financial Instruments” (“ASC 825”). Net gains (losses) of $24,233, $(2,861), and $(4,539) resulting from fair value changes of these mortgage loans were recorded in income during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amount does not reflect changes in fair values of related derivative instruments used to hedge exposure to market-related risks associated with these mortgage loans. The change in fair value of both mortgage loans held for sale and the related derivative instruments are recorded in “Mortgage banking income” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Gains and losses are recognized in Mortgage banking income on the consolidated statements of income at the time the loan is closed. Pass through origination costs and related loan fees are also included in “Mortgage banking income”.
Periodically, the Bank will transfer mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary markets into the loan portfolio based on current market conditions, the overall secondary marketability of the loan and the status of the loan. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Bank transferred $55,766, $12,259, and $14,732, respectively, of residential mortgage loans into its loans held for investment portfolio. The loans are transferred into the portfolio at fair value at the date of transfer. Additionally, occasionally the Bank will transfer loans from the held for investment portfolio into loans held for sale. At the time of the transfer, loans are marked to fair value through the allowance for credit losses and reclassified to loans held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company transferred $2,116 from the portfolio to loans held for sale. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company transferred $11,888 from the portfolio to loans held for sale,resulting in an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses of $349.
Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) optional repurchase programs allow financial institutions to buy back individual delinquent mortgage loans that meet certain criteria from the securitized loan pool for which the institution provides servicing and was the original transferor. At the servicer’s option and without GNMA’s prior authorization, the servicer may repurchase such a delinquent loan for an amount equal to 100 percent of the remaining principal balance of the loan. Under FASB ASC Topic 860, “Transfers and Servicing,” this buy-back option is considered a conditional option until the delinquency criteria are met, at which time the option becomes unconditional. When the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans under the unconditional buy-back option, the loans can no longer be reported as sold and must be brought back onto the balance sheet, regardless of whether the Company intends to exercise the buy-back option if the buyback option provides the transferor a more-than-trivial benefit. When this criteria is met and these are repurchased, after a period of borrower performance, the loans are transferred to loans held for sale at fair value and are able to be repooled into new Ginnie Mae guaranteed securities. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company transferred $9,367 and $7,891, respectively, of these repurchased loans from loans held for investment to loans held for sale. There was no such activity during the year ended December 21, 2018. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, there were $151,184 and $51,705, respectively, of delinquent GNMA loans that had previously been sold which the Company had the option to repurchase; however, the Company determined there not to be a "more-than-trivial benefit" based on an analysis of interest rates and assessment of potential reputational risk associated with these loans. As such, the Company did not record these loans on the balance sheets.
During the year ended December 31, 2020 , the Company acquired a portfolio of commercial loans, including shared national credits and institutional healthcare loans, as part of the Franklin transaction that the Company has elected to account for as held for sale. Changes in fair value from the acquisition date fair value are included in 'other noninterest income' on the consolidated statement of income.
(H) Loans (excluding purchased credit deteriorated loans):
Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or pay-off are stated at the principal amount outstanding less any purchase accounting discount net of any accretion recognized to date. Interest on loans is recognized as income by using the simple interest method on daily balances of the principal amount outstanding plus any accretion of purchase accounting discounts.

Notes to consolidated financial statements
(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
Loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans. Accrual of interest is discontinued on loans past due 90 days or more unless the credit is well secured and in the process of collection. Also, a loan may be placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming past due 90 days if management believes, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower’s financial condition is such that collection of principal or interest is doubtful. The decision to place a loan on nonaccrual status prior to becoming past due 90 days is based on an evaluation of the borrower’s financial condition, collateral liquidation value, economic and business conditions and other factors that affect the borrower’s ability to pay. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued but unpaid interest is charged against current period operations. Thereafter, interest on nonaccrual loans is recognized only as received if future collection of principal is probable. If the collectability of outstanding principal is doubtful, interest received is applied as a reduction of principal. A loan may be restored to accrual status when principal and interest are no longer past due or it otherwise becomes both well secured and collectability is reasonably assured. The Company continues to monitor the level of accrued interest receivable, however an allowance for credit losses was not required as of December 31, 2020.
(I) Allowance for credit losses:
The allowance for credit losses represents the portion of the loan's amortized cost basis that the Company does not expect to collect due to credit losses over the loan's life, considering past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions considering macroeconomic forecasts. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance for credit losses is based on the loan's amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest receivable, as the Company promptly charges off uncollectible accrued interest receivable. Management’s determination of the appropriateness of the allowance is based on periodic evaluation of the loan portfolio, lending-related commitments and other relevant factors, including macroeconomic forecasts and historical loss rates. In future quarters, the Company may update information and forecasts that may cause significant changes in the estimate in those future quarters.
As of January 1, 2020, the Company’s policy for the allowance for credit losses changed with the adoption of CECL. As permitted, the new guidance was implemented using a modified retrospective approach with the impact of the initial adoption being recorded through retained earnings at January 1, 2020, with no restatement of prior periods. Prior to adopting CECL, the Company calculated the allowance using an incurred loss approach. Beginning January 1, 2020, the Company calculates the allowance using a lifetime expected credit loss approach as described in the previous paragraph. See Note 5, "Loans and allowance for credit losses" for additional details related to the Company's specific calculation methodology.
The allowance for credit losses is the Company’s best estimate. Actual losses may differ from the December 31, 2020 allowance for credit loss as the CECL estimate is sensitive to economic forecasts and management judgment.
The following portfolio segments have been identified:
Commercial and industrial loans. The Company provides a mix of variable and fixed rate commercial and industrial loans. Commercial and industrial loans are typically made to small- and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses for working capital and operating needs and business expansions, including the purchase of capital equipment and loans made to farmers relating to their operations. This category also includes loans secured by manufactured housing receivables. Commercial and industrial loans generally include lines of credit and loans with maturities of five years or less. The loans are generally made with operating cash flows as the primary source of repayment, but may also include collateralization by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment and/or personal guarantees. The ability of the borrower to collect accounts receivable, and to turn inventory into sales are risk factors in the repayment of the loan.
Construction loans. Construction loans include commercial construction, land acquisition and land development loans and single-family interim construction loans to small- and medium-sized businesses and individuals. These loans are generally secured by the land or the real property being built and are made based on our assessment of the value of the property on an as-completed basis. We expect to continue to make construction loans at a similar pace so long as demand continues and the market for and values of such properties remain stable or continue to improve in our markets. These loans can carry risk of repayment when projects incur cost overruns, have an increase in the price of building materials, encounter zoning and environmental issues, or encounter other factors that may affect the completion of a project on time and on budget. Additionally, repayment risk may be negatively impacted when the market experiences a deterioration in the value of real estate.

(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
Residential real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans. The Company’s residential real estate 1-4 family mortgage loans are primarily made with respect to and secured by single family homes, which are both owner-occupied and investor owned and include manufactured homes with real estate. The Company intends to continue to make residential 1-4 family housing loans at a similar pace, so long as housing values in our markets do not deteriorate from current prevailing levels and we are able to make such loans consistent with our current credit and underwriting standards. First lien residential 1-4 family mortgages may be affected by unemployment or underemployment and deteriorating market values of real estate.
Residential line of credit loans. The Company’s residential line of credit loans are primarily revolving, open-end lines of credit secured by 1-4 residential properties. The Company intends to continue to make home equity loans if housing values in our markets do not deteriorate from current prevailing levels and we are able to make such loans consistent with our current credit and underwriting standards. Second lien residential 1-4 family mortgages may be affected by unemployment or underemployment and deteriorating market values of real estate.
Multi-family residential loans. The Company’s multi-family residential loans are primarily secured by multi-family properties, such as apartments and condominium buildings. These loans also may be affected by unemployment or underemployment and deteriorating market values of real estate.
Commercial real estate loans. The Company’s commercial real estate owner-occupied loans include loans to finance commercial real estate owner occupied properties for various purposes including use as offices, warehouses, production facilities, health care facilities, retail centers, restaurants, churches and agricultural based facilities. Commercial real estate owner-occupied loans are typically repaid through the ongoing business operations of the borrower, and hence are dependent on the success of the underlying business for repayment and are more exposed to general economic conditions.
Commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans. The Company’s commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans include loans to finance commercial real estate non-owner occupied investment properties for various purposes including use as offices, warehouses, health care facilities, hotels, mixed-use residential/commercial, manufactured housing communities, retail centers, assisted living facilities and agricultural based facilities. Commercial real estate non-owner occupied loans are typically repaid with the funds received from the sale of the completed property or rental proceeds from such property, and are therefore more sensitive to adverse conditions in the real estate market, which can also affected by general economic conditions.
Consumer and other loans. The Company’s consumer and other loans include loans to individuals for personal, family and household purposes, including car, boat and other recreational vehicle loans, manufactured homes without real estate, and personal lines of credit. Consumer loans are generally secured by vehicles and other household goods. The collateral securing consumer loans may depreciate over time. The company seeks to minimize these risks through its underwriting standards. Other loans also include loans to states and political subdivisions in the U.S. These loans are generally subject to the risk that the borrowing municipality or political subdivision may lose a significant portion of its tax base or that the project for which the loan was made may produce inadequate revenue.
(J) Business combinations, accounting for acquired loans with credit deterioration and off-balance sheet financial instruments:
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805, “Business Combinations” (“ASC 805”). Under the acquisition method, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date are measured at their fair values as of that date. Any excess of the purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. To the extent the fair value of net assets acquired, including any other identifiable intangible assets, exceed the purchase price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized. Results of operations of acquired entities are included in the consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition.
Beginning January 1, 2020, loans acquired in business combinations with evidence of more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination are considered to be Purchased Credit Deteriorated ("PCD"). The Company developed multiple criteria to assess the presence of more-than-insignificant credit deterioration in acquired loans, mainly focused on changes in credit quality and payment status. While general criteria have been established, each acquisition will vary in its specific facts and circumstances and the Company will apply judgment around PCD identification for each individual acquisition based on their unique portfolio mix and risks identified.
The Company adopted ASC 326 using the prospective transition approach for loans previously classified as purchased credit impaired ("PCI") and accounted for under ASC 310-30. In accordance with the standard, management did not
FB Financial Corporation and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements
(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
reassess whether PCI assets met the criteria of PCD assets as of the date of adoption and all PCI loans were transitioned to PCD loans upon adoption. Under PCD accounting,the amount of expected credit losses as of the acquisition date is added to the purchase price of the PCD loan. This establishes the amortized cost basis of the PCD loan. The difference between the unpaid principal balance of the PCD loan and the amortized cost basis of the PCD loan as of the acquisition date is the non-credit discount. Interest income for a PCD loan is recognized by accreting the amortized cost basis of the PCD loan to its contractual cash flows. The discount related to estimated credit losses on acquisition recorded as an allowance for credit losses will not be accreted into interest income. Only the noncredit-related discount will be accreted into interest income and subsequent adjustments to expected credit losses will flow through the provision for credit losses on the income statement.
Financial instruments include off-balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded, unless considered derivatives.
For loan commitments that are not accounted for as derivatives and when the obligation is not unconditionally cancellable by the Company, the Company applies the CECL methodology to estimate the expected credit loss on off-balance-sheet commitments. The estimate of expected credit losses for off-balance-sheet credit commitments is recognized as a liability. When the loan is funded, an allowance for expected credit losses is estimated for that loan using the CECL methodology, and the liability for off-balance-sheet commitments is reduced. When applying the CECL methodology to estimate the expected credit loss, the Company considers the likelihood that funding will occur, the contractual period of exposure to credit loss, the risk of loss, historical loss experience, and current conditions along with expectations of future economic conditions.
(K) Premises and equipment:
Land is carried at cost. Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Provisions for depreciation are computed principally on the straight-line method and are charged to occupancy expense over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Maintenance agreements are amortized to expense over the period of time covered by the agreement. Costs of major additions, replacements or improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
For financial statement purposes, the estimated useful life for premises is the lesser of the remaining useful life per third party appraisal or forty years, for furniture and fixtures the estimated useful life is seven to ten years, for leasehold improvements the estimated useful life is the lesser of twenty years or the term of the lease and for equipment the estimated useful life is three to seven years.
(L) Other real estate owned:
Real estate acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure is initially recorded at fair value less the estimated cost to sell at the date of foreclosure, which may establish a new cost basis. Other real estate owned may also include excess facilities and properties held for sale as described in Note 8. Physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan occurs when legal title is obtained upon completion of foreclosure or when the borrower conveys all interest in the property to satisfy the loan. After initial measurement, valuations are periodically performed by management and the asset is carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. Revenue and expenses from operations are included in other noninterest income and noninterest expenses. Losses due to the valuation of the property are included in gain (loss) on sales or write-downs of other real estate owned.
(M) Leases:
The Company leases certain banking, mortgage and operations locations. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company records leases on the balance sheet in the form of a lease liability for the present value of future minimum payments under the lease terms and a right-of-use asset equal to the lease liability adjusted for items such as deferred or prepaid rent, incentive liabilities, leasehold intangibles and any impairment of the right-of-use asset. In determining whether a contract contains a lease, management conducts an analysis at lease inception to ensure an asset was specifically identified and the Company has control of use of the asset. For contracts determined to be leases entered into after January 1, 2019, the Company performs additional analysis to determine whether the lease should be classified as a finance or operating lease. The Company considers a lease to be a finance lease if future minimum lease payments amount to greater than 90% of the asset's fair value or if the lease term is equal to or greater than 75% of the asset's

estimated economic useful life. As of December 31, 2020, the Company has one finance lease that resulted from the Franklin transaction. As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any leases that were determined to be finance leases. The Company does not record leases on the consolidated balance sheets that are classified as short term (less than one year). Additionally, the Company has not recorded equipment leases or leases in which the Company is the lessor on the consolidated balance sheets as these are not material to the Company.
At lease inception, the Company determines the lease term by adding together the minimum lease term and all optional renewal periods that it is reasonably certain to renew. This determination is at management's full discretion and is made through consideration of the asset, market conditions, competition and entity based economic conditions, among other factors. The lease term is used in the economic life test and also to calculate straight-line rent expense. The depreciable life of leasehold improvements is limited by the estimated lease term, including renewals.
Operating leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease beginning when the lease commences. Rent expense and variable lease expense are included in occupancy and equipment expense on the Company's Consolidated statements of income. The Company's variable lease expense include rent escalators that are based on the Consumer Price Index or market conditions and include items such as common area maintenance, utilities, parking, property taxes, insurance and other costs associated with the lease.
There are no residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants imposed by leases that will impact the Company's ability to pay dividends or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. The discount rate used in determining the lease liability is based upon incremental borrowing rates the Company could obtain for similar loans as of the date of commencement or renewal.
(N) Mortgage servicing rights:
The Company accounts for its mortgage servicing rights under the fair value option as permitted under ASC 860-50-35, "Transfers and Servicing". The Company retains the right to service certain mortgage loans that it sells to secondary market investors. The retained mortgage servicing right is initially recorded at the fair value of future net cash flows expected to be realized for performing servicing activities. Fair value is determined using an income approach with various assumptions including expected cash flows, prepayment speeds, market discount rates, servicing costs, and other factors. These mortgage servicing rights are recognized as a separate asset on the date the corresponding mortgage loan is sold.
Subsequent changes in fair value, including the write downs due to pay offs and paydowns, are recorded in earnings in Mortgage banking income.
(O) Transfers of financial assets:
Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been relinquished. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when the assets have been isolated from the Company, the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.
(P) Goodwill and other intangibles:
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired. Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate possible impairment. Goodwill is assigned to the Company’s reporting units, Banking or Mortgage as applicable. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative evaluation to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The qualitative evaluation is an assessment of factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If an entity does a qualitative assessment and determines that it is not more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired, and it is not necessary to continue to the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss would be recognized in noninterest expense to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated implied fair value, which could be material to our operating results for any particular reporting period. The Company performed a quantitative assessment in 2020 and determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill. No impairment was identified through the annual assessments for impairment performed as of December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.

Other intangible assets consist of core deposit intangible assets arising from whole bank and branch acquisitions in addition to both a customer trust intangible and manufactured housing loan servicing intangible. All intangible assets are initially measured at fair value and then amortized over their estimated useful lives. See Note 9,"Goodwill and intangible assets" for additional information on other intangibles.
(Q) Income taxes:
Income tax expense is the total of the current year income tax due and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes.
A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded.
The Company’s policy is to recognize interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions in “Income tax expense” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no amounts related to uncertain tax positions recognized for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018.
(R) Long-lived assets:
Premises and equipment, core deposit intangible assets, and other long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are recorded at fair value. No long-lived assets were deemed to be impaired at December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(S) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities:
All derivative financial instruments are recorded at their fair values in other assets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.” If derivative financial instruments are designated as hedges of fair values, both the change in the fair value of the hedge and the hedged item are included in current earnings. If derivative financial instruments are not designated as hedges, only the change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is included in current earnings.
Cash flow hedges are utilized to mitigate the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows or other types of forecasted transactions. For the Company’s derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are, to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective, recorded as other comprehensive income and are subsequently recognized in earnings at the same time that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings. The assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is evaluated under the hypothetical derivative method.
The Company also utilizes derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments. The Company enters into interest rate cap and/or floor agreements with its customers and then enters into an offsetting derivative contract position with other financial institutions to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with these customer contracts. Because these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized currently in earnings.
The Company also enters into commitments to originate loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding (rate-lock commitments). Rate-lock commitments on mortgage loans that are intended to be sold are considered to be derivatives. Accordingly, such commitments, along with any related fees received from potential borrowers, are recorded at fair value in other assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in the line item “Mortgage banking income” on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Fair value is based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, and for fixed-rate commitments, the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates is also considered.
The Company utilizes forward loan sale contracts and forward sales of residential mortgage-backed securities to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in the Company’s mortgage loan pipeline and held-for-sale portfolio. Forward sale contracts are contracts for delayed delivery of mortgage loans or a group of loans pooled as mortgage-backed securities. The Company agrees to deliver on a specified future date, a specified instrument, at a specified price or yield. However, the contract may allow for cash settlement. The credit risk inherent to the Company arises from the potential inability of
FB Financial Corporation and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements
(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. In the event of non-acceptance by the counterparty, the Company would be subject to the credit and inherent (or market) risk of the loans retained. Such contracts are accounted for as derivatives and, along with related fees paid to investor are recorded at fair value in derivative assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in the line item “Mortgage banking income” on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Fair value is based on the estimated amounts that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the commitment at the reporting date.
The Company utilizes two methods to deliver mortgage loans sold to an investor. Under a “best efforts” sales agreement, the Company enters into a sales agreement with an investor in the secondary market to sell the loan when an interest rate-lock commitment is entered into with a customer, as described above. Under a “best efforts” sales agreement, the Company is obligated to sell the mortgage loan to the investor only if the loan is closed and funded. Thus, the Company will not incur any liability to an investor if the mortgage loan commitment in the pipeline fails to close. The Company also utilizes “mandatory delivery” sales agreements. Under a mandatory delivery sales agreement, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date. Penalties are paid to the investor should the Company fail to satisfy the contract. Mandatory commitments are recorded at fair value in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses arising from changes in the valuation of these commitments are recognized currently in earnings and are reflected under the line item “Mortgage banking income” on the Consolidated Statements of Income.
(T) Lender risk account:
During 2018, the Company began selling qualified mortgage loans to FHLB-Cincinnati via the Mortgage Purchase Program (“MPP”). All mortgage loans purchased from members through the MPP are held on the FHLB’s balance sheet. FHLB does not securitize MPP loans for sale to other investors. They mitigate their credit risk exposure through their underwriting and pool composition requirements and through the establishment of the Lender Risk Account (“LRA”) credit enhancement. The LRA protects the FHLB against possible credit losses by setting aside a portion of the initial purchase price into a performance based escrow account that can be used to offset possible loan losses. The LRA amount is established as a percentage applied to the sum of the initial unpaid principal balance of each mortgage in the aggregated pool at the time of the purchase of the mortgage as determined by the FHLB-Cincinnati and is funded by the deduction from the proceeds of sale of each mortgage in the aggregated pool to the FHLB-Cincinnati. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company had on deposit with the FHLB-Cincinnati $12,729 and $11,225, respectively, in these LRA’s. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company estimated the guaranty account to be $6,183 and $5,546, respectively. The Company bears the risk of receiving less than 100% of its LRA contribution in the event of losses, either by the Company or other members selling mortgages in the aggregated pool. Any losses will be deducted first from the individual LRA contribution of the institution that sold the mortgage of which the loss was incurred. If losses incurred in the aggregated pool are greater than the member’s LRA contribution, such losses will be deducted from the LRA contribution of other members selling mortgages in that aggregated pool. Any portion of the LRA not used to pay losses will be released over a thirty year period and will not start until the end of five years after the initial fill-up period.
(U) Comprehensive income:
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities and derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, net of taxes.
(V) Loss contingencies:
Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are such matters that will have a material effect on the financial statements.
(W) Securities sold under agreements to repurchase:
The Company routinely sells securities to certain customers and then repurchases the securities the next business day. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at the amount of cash received in connection with each transaction in the line item "Borrowings". These are secured liabilities and are not covered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). See Note 14, "Borrowings" in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding securities sold under agreements to repurchase.

(X) Advertising expense:
Advertising costs, including costs related to internet mortgage marketing, lead generation, and related costs, are expensed as incurred.
(Y) Earnings per common share:
Basic earnings per common share ("EPS") excludes dilution and is computed by dividing earnings attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the dilutive effect of additional potential common shares issuable under the restricted stock units granted but not yet vested and distributable. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing earnings attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year, plus an incremental number of common-equivalent shares computed using the treasury stock method.
Unvested share-based payment awards, which include the right to receive non-forfeitable dividends or dividend equivalents, are considered to participate with common shareholders in undistributed earnings for purposes of computing EPS. Companies that have such participating securities, including the Company, are required to calculate basic and diluted EPS using the two-class method. Certain restricted stock awards granted by the Company include non-forfeitable dividend equivalents and are considered participating securities. Calculations of EPS under the two-class method (i) exclude from the numerator any dividends paid or owed on participating securities and any undistributed earnings considered to be attributable to participating securities and (ii) exclude from the denominator the dilutive impact of the participating securities.
The following is a summary of the basic and diluted earnings per common share calculation for each of the periods presented:
(1) Excludes 239,813 restricted stock units outstanding considered to be antidilutive as of December 31, 2020.
(Z) Segment reporting:
The Company’s Mortgage division represents a distinct reportable segment that differs from the Company’s primary business of Banking. Accordingly, a reconciliation of reportable segment revenues, expenses and profit to the Company’s consolidated total has been presented in Note 21.

(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
(AA) Stock-based compensation:
The Company grants restricted stock units ("RSUs") under compensation arrangements for the benefit of employees, executive officers, and directors. Restricted stock unit grants are subject to time-based vesting. The total number of restricted stock units granted represents the maximum number of restricted stock units eligible to vest based upon the service conditions set forth in the grant agreements.
During 2020, the Company began awarding performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs") to executives and other officers and employees. Under the terms of the award, the number of units that will vest and convert to shares of common stock will be based on the extent to which the Company achieves specified performance criteria during a fixed three-year performance period.
Stock-based compensation expense is recognized in accordance with ASC 718-20, “Compensation - Stock Compensation Awards Classified as Equity”. Expense is recognized based on the fair value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately expected to vest, reduced for forfeitures based on grant-date fair value. The restricted stock unit awards and related expense are amortized over the required service period, if any. Compensation expense for PSUs is estimated each period based on the fair value of the stock at the grant date and the most probable outcome of the performance condition, adjusted for the passage of time within the vesting period of the awards. The reconciliation of RSUs, PSUs, and Stock-based compensation expense is presented in Note 24.
(BB) Subsequent Events:
ASC Topic 855, "Subsequent Events", establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. The Company evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after December 31, 2020 through the date of the issued financial statements.
Recently adopted accounting standards:
In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 and its subsequent amendments issued by the FASB requires the measurement of all current expected credit losses for financial assets (including off-balance sheet credit exposures) held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Additionally, the update requires enhanced disclosures related to the significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization’s portfolio. The new methodology requires institutions to calculate all probable and estimable losses that are expected to be incurred through the financial asset's entire life through a provision for credit losses, including certain loans obtained as a result of any acquisition. For available-for-sale debt securities that have experienced a deterioration in credit, Topic 326 requires an allowance for credit losses to be recognized, instead of a direct write-down, which was previously required under the other-than-temporary impairment ("OTTI") model. Topic 326 eliminates the concept of OTTI impairment and instead focuses on determining whether any impairment is a result of a credit loss or other factors. As a result, the standard says the Company may not use the length of time a debt security has been in an unrealized loss position as a factor, either by itself or in combination with other factors, to conclude that a credit loss does not exist, as the Company was previously allowed under the OTTI model.
ASU 2016-13 eliminates the existing guidance for PCI loans, but requires an allowance for purchased financial assets with more than insignificant deterioration since origination to be determined in a manner similar to that of other financial assets measured at amortized cost; however, the initial allowance will be added to the purchase price rather than recorded as provision expense referred herein as the PCD asset gross-up approach. The Company applied the new PCD asset gross-up approach at transition to all assets that were accounted for as PCI prior to adoption. Any change in the allowance for credit losses for these assets as a result of applying the new guidance is accounted for as an adjustment to the asset’s amortized cost basis and not as a cumulative-effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Additionally, ASU 2016-13 requires additional disclosures related to loans and debt securities. See Note 4, “Investment securities” and Note 5, “Loans and allowance for credit losses” for these disclosures.
The Company formed a cross-functional working group to oversee the adoption of CECL at the effective date. The working group developed a project plan focused on understanding the new standard, researching issues, identifying data needs for modeling inputs, technology requirements, modeling considerations, and ensuring overarching governance was achieved for each objective and milestone. The key data driver for each model was identified, populated, and internally validated. The Company also completed data and model validation testing. The Company has performed model sensitivity
FB Financial Corporation and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements
(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
analysis, developed a framework for qualitative adjustments, created supporting analytics, and executed the enhanced governance and approval process. Internal controls related to the CECL process were finalized prior to adoption.
ASU 2016-13 was adopted effective January 1, 2020 using a modified retrospective approach with no adjustments to prior period comparative financial statements. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a cumulative effective adjustment to decrease retained earnings by $25,018, with corresponding adjustments to the allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments in addition to recording a deferred tax asset on its consolidated balance sheet.
As of that date, the Company also recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to gross-up the amortized cost amount of its PCD loans by $558, with a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses on its consolidated balance sheet.
A summary of the impact to the consolidated balance sheet as of the adoption date is presented in the table below:
In December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations’ implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC announced an interim final rule, which became final on September 30, 2020 to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology’s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). The Company elected the five-year capital transition relief option.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04 eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, an entity may perform only step one of its quantitative goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and then recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Entities have the option to perform a qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative step one impairment test is necessary. ASU 2017-04 became effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
In August 2018, the FASB issued "Accounting Standards Update 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurements." This update is part of the disclosure framework project and eliminates certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements, requires entities to disclose new information, and modifies existing disclosure requirements. The update became effective on January 1, 2020 and did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
In March 2019, FASB issued ASU 2019-01, "Leases (Topic 842): Codification Improvements", which aligns the guidance for fair value of the underlying assets by lessors that are not manufacturers or dealers in Topic 842 with that of existing guidance. As a result, the fair value of the underlying asset at lease commencement is its cost, reflecting any volume or trade discounts that may apply. However, if there has been a significant lapse of time between when the underlying asset
FB Financial Corporation and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements
(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
is acquired and when the lease commences, the definition of fair value in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement should be applied. ASU No. 2019-01 also requires lessors within the scope of Topic 942, "Financial Services-Depository and Lending", to present all “principal payments received under leases” within investing activities. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2020 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
In April 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, "Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, and Topic 825, Financial Instruments". The amendments related to Topic 326 address accrued interest, transfers between classifications or categories for loans and debt securities, recoveries, vintage disclosures, and contractual extensions and renewal options and became effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The improvements and clarifications related to Topic 815 address partial-term fair value hedges of interest-rate risk, amortization, and disclosure of fair value hedge basis adjustments and consideration of hedged contractually specified interest rates under the hypothetical method and became effective for the annual reporting period beginning January 1, 2020. The amendments related to Topic 825 contain various improvements to ASU 2016-01, including scope; held-to-maturity debt securities fair value disclosures; and remeasurement of equity securities at historical exchange rates and became effective as of January 1, 2020. The amendments in this update did not have a material impact on the financial statements.
Newly issued not yet effective accounting standards:
In June 2018, FASB issued ASU 2018-07, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting", which expands the scope of Topic 718 to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. Consistent with the accounting for employee share-based payment awards, nonemployee share-based payment awards will be measured at grant-date fair value of the equity instruments obligated to be issued when the good has been delivered or the service rendered and any other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the instruments have been satisfied. This ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginnings after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted the update effective January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements or disclosures.
Note (2)-Mergers and acquisitions:
The following mergers and acquisitions were accounted for pursuant to FASB ASC 805. Accordingly, the purchase price of each acquisition was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values as of the respective acquisition dates. The excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.
Franklin Financial Network, Inc. merger
Effective August 15, 2020, the Company completed its previously announced merger with Franklin Financial Network, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, with FB Financial Corporation continuing as the surviving entity. After consolidating duplicative locations the merger added 10 branches and expanded the Company's footprint in middle Tennessee and the Nashville metropolitan statistical area. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired total assets of $3.63 billion, loans of $2.79 billion and assumed total deposits of $3.12 billion. Total loans acquired includes a non-strategic institutional portfolio with a fair value of $326,206 the Company classified as held for sale. Franklin common shareholders received 15,058,181 shares of the Company's common stock, net of the equivalent value of 44,311 shares withheld on certain Franklin employee equity awards that vested upon change in control, as consideration in connection with the merger, in addition to $31,330 in cash consideration. Also included in the purchase price, the Company issued replacement restricted stock units for awards initially granted by Franklin during 2020 that did not vest upon change in control, with a total fair value of $674 attributed to pre-combination service. Based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange of $29.52 on August 15, 2020, the merger consideration represented approximately $477,830 in aggregate consideration.
FB Financial Corporation and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements
(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
Goodwill of $67,191 recorded in connection with the transaction resulted from the ongoing business contribution, reputation, operating model and expertise of Franklin. Measurement period adjustments recorded during the fourth quarter of 2020 amounting to $6,546 related to the finalization of valuations relating primarily to commercial loans held for sale, deposits and premises and equipment. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill is included in the Banking segment as substantially all of the operations resulting from the acquisition of Franklin are in alignment with the Company's banking business.
The Company incurred $32,364 in merger expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection with this transaction. These expenses are primarily comprised of professional services, employee-related costs, costs associated with branch consolidation, and integration costs.

FNB Financial Corp. merger
Effective February 14, 2020, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of FNB Financial Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Farmers National Bank of Scottsville (collectively, "Farmers National"). Following the acquisition, Farmers National was merged into the Company with FB Financial Corporation continuing as the surviving entity. The transaction added four branches and expanded the Company's footprint into Kentucky. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired total assets of $258,218, loans of $182,171 and assumed total deposits of $209,535. Farmers National shareholders received 954,797 shares of the Company's common stock as consideration in connection with the merger, in addition to $15,001 in cash consideration. Based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange of $36.70 on February 14, 2020, the merger consideration represented approximately $50,042 in aggregate consideration.
Goodwill of $6,319 recorded in connection with the transaction resulted from the ongoing business contribution of Farmers National and anticipated synergies arising from the combination of certain operational areas of the Company. Goodwill resulting from this transaction is not deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill is included in the Banking segment as substantially all of the operations resulting from the acquisition of Farmers National are in alignment with the Company's core banking business.
The Company incurred $2,338 in merger expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 in connection with this transaction. These expenses are primarily comprised of professional services, employee-related costs, and integration costs. The following table presents the total purchase price, fair value of net assets acquired, and the goodwill as of the acquisition date.

Atlantic Capital Bank, N.A. Branches
On April 5, 2019, the Bank completed its branch acquisition to purchase 11 Tennessee and three Georgia branch locations (the "Branches") from Atlantic Capital Bank, N.A., a national banking association and a wholly owned subsidiary of Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc., a Georgia corporation (collectively, "Atlantic Capital") in a transaction valued at $36,790, further increasing market share in existing markets and expanding the Company's footprint into new locations. The branch acquisition added $588,877 in customer deposits at a premium of 6.25%, $374,966 in loans at 99.32% of principal outstanding and $31,961 of goodwill. All of the operations of the Branches are included in the Banking segment.

Purchased credit-deteriorated loans
Under CECL, the Company is required to determine whether purchased loans held for investment have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. Loans that have experienced this level of deterioration in credit quality are subject to special accounting at initial recognition and measurement. The Company initially measures the amortized cost of a PCD loan by adding the acquisition date estimate of expected credit losses to the loan's purchase price (i.e. the "gross up" approach). There is no provision for credit loss recognized upon acquisition of a PCD loan because the initial allowance is established through gross-up of the loans' amortized cost.
The Company determined that 27.9% of the Franklin loan portfolio had more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination as of the acquisition date. This included deterioration in credit metrics, such as delinquency, nonaccrual status or risk ratings as well as certain loans within designated industries of concern that have been negatively impacted by COVID-19. Additionally, it was determined that 10.1% of the Farmers National loan portfolio had more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination as of the February acquisition date. These were primarily delinquent loans as of February 14, 2020, or loans that Farmers National had classified as nonaccrual or TDR prior to the Company's acquisition.
Loans recognized through the acquisition of Franklin and Farmers National that have not experienced more-than-insignificant credit deterioration since origination are initially recognized at the purchase price. Expected credit losses are measured under CECL through the provision for credit losses. The Company recorded provisions for credit losses in the amounts of $52,822 and $2,885 as of August 15, 2020 and February 14, 2020, respectively, in the income statement related to estimated credit losses on non-PCD loans from Franklin and Farmers National, respectively. Additionally, the Company estimates expected credit losses on off-balance sheet loan commitments that are not accounted for as derivatives. The Company recorded an increase in provision for credit losses from unfunded commitments of $10,499 as of August 15, 2020 related to the Franklin acquisition.
Pro forma financial information (unaudited)
The results of operations of the acquisitions have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements prospectively beginning on the date of each acquisition. The acquisitions have been fully integrated with the Company's existing operations. Accordingly, post-acquisition net interest income, total revenues, and net income are not discernible.The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information presents the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as though the Franklin merger and Farmers National acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2019, and the Atlantic Capital acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2018. The unaudited estimated pro forma information combines the historical results of the mergers with the Company’s historical consolidated results and includes certain adjustments reflecting the estimated impact of certain fair value adjustments for the periods presented. Merger expenses are reflected in the periods they were incurred. The pro forma information is not indicative of what would have occurred had the transactions taken place on January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2018, and does not include the effect of cost-saving or revenue-enhancing strategies.

Note (5)-Loans and allowance for credit losses:
Loans outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019, by class of financing receivable are as follows:
(1)Includes $212,645 of loans originated as part of the PPP at December 31, 2020, established by the CARES Act, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The PPP is administered by the SBA; loans originated as part of the PPP may be forgiven by the SBA under a set of defined rules. PPP loans are federally guaranteed as part of the CARES Act, provided PPP loan recipients receive loan forgiveness under the SBA regulations. As such, there is minimal credit risk associated with these loans.
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $1,248,857 and $412,966, respectively, of qualifying residential mortgage loans (including loans held for sale) and $1,532,749 and $545,540, respectively, of qualifying commercial mortgage loans were pledged to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati securing advances against the Bank’s line of credit. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, $2,463,281 and $1,407,662, respectively, of qualifying loans were pledged to the Federal Reserve Bank under the Borrower-in-Custody program.
The components of amortized cost for loans on the consolidated balance sheet excludes accrued interest receivable as the Company elected to present accrued interest receivable separately on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, total accrued interest receivable on loans was $38,316.
Allowance for Credit Losses
As of January 1, 2020, the Company’s policy for the allowance changed with the adoption of CECL. As permitted, the new guidance was implemented using a modified retrospective approach with the impact of the initial adoption being recorded through retained earnings at January 1, 2020, with no restatement of prior periods. Before January 1, 2020, the Company calculated the allowance on an incurred loss approach. As of January 1, 2020, the Company calculated an expected credit loss using a lifetime loss rate methodology. As a result of the difference in methodology between periods, disclosures presented below may not be comparative in nature.
The Company utilizes probability-weighted forecasts, which consider multiple macroeconomic variables from a third-party vendor that are applicable to the type of loan. Each of the Company's loss rate models incorporate forward-looking macroeconomic projections throughout the reasonable and supportable forecast period and the subsequent historical reversion at the macroeconomic variable input level. In order to estimate the life of a loan, the contractual term of the loan is adjusted for estimated prepayments based on market information and the Company’s prepayment history.
The Company's loss rate models estimate the lifetime loss rate for pools of loans by combining the calculated loss rate based on each variable within the model (including the macroeconomic variables). The lifetime loss rate for the pool is then multiplied by the loan balances to determine the expected credit losses on the pool.
The Company considers the need to qualitatively adjust its modeled quantitative expected credit loss estimate for information not already captured in the model loss estimation process. These qualitative factor adjustments may increase or decrease the Company’s estimate of expected credit losses. The Company reviews the qualitative adjustments so as to validate that information that has already been considered and included in the modeled quantitative loss estimation process is not also included in the qualitative adjustment. The Company considers the qualitative factors that are relevant to the institution as of the reporting date, which may include, but are not limited to: levels of and trends in delinquencies and performance of loans; levels of and trends in write-offs and recoveries collected; trends in volume and terms of loans;
FB Financial Corporation and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements
(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
effects of any changes in reasonable and supportable economic forecasts; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and expertise; available relevant information sources that contradict the Company’s own forecast; effects of changes in prepayment expectations or other factors affecting assessments of loan contractual terms; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations.
The quantitative models require loan data and macroeconomic variables based on the inherent credit risks in each portfolio to more accurately measure the credit risks associated with each. Each of the quantitative models pools loans with similar risk characteristics and collectively assesses the lifetime loss rate for each pool to estimate its expected credit loss.
When a loan no longer shares similar risk characteristics with other loans in any given pool, the loan is individually assessed. The Company has determined the following circumstances in which a loan may require an individual evaluation: collateral dependent loans; loans for which foreclosure is probable; TDRs and reasonably expected TDRs. A loan is deemed collateral dependent when 1) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and 2) the repayment is expected to be primarily through sale or operation of the collateral. The allowance for credit losses for collateral dependent loans as well as loans where foreclosure is probable is calculated as the amount for which the loan’s amortized cost basis exceeds fair value. Fair value is determined based on appraisals performed by qualified appraisers and reviewed by qualified personnel. In cases where repayment is to be provided substantially through the sale of collateral, the Company reduces the fair value by the estimated costs to sell. Loans experiencing financial difficulty for which a concession has not yet been provided may be identified as reasonably expected TDRs.
Reasonably expected TDRs use the same methodology as TDRs. In cases where the expected credit loss can only be captured through a discounted cash flow analysis (such as an interest rate modification for a TDR loan), the allowance is measured by the amount which the loan’s amortized cost exceeds the discounted cash flow analysis. The allowance for credit losses on a TDR or a reasonably expected TDR is calculated individually using a discounted cash flow methodology, unless the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent or foreclosure is probable.
The Company’s acquisitions and changes in reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in projected credit deterioration requiring the Company to recognize significant increases in the provision for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020. Specifically, the Company performed additional qualitative evaluations by class of financing receivable in line with the Company's established qualitative framework, weighting the impact of the current economic outlook, status of federal government stimulus programs, and other considerations, in order to identify specific industries or borrowers seeing credit improvement or deterioration specific to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Loans acquired during the period from Franklin increased the allowance for credit losses by $77,653 as of the August 15, 2020 acquisition date and Farmers National increased the allowance for credit losses by $4,494 as of the February 14, 2020 acquisition date. See Note 2, "Mergers and acquisitions" for additional details related to PCD loans acquired during the year ended December 31, 2020.

Credit Quality
The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans that share similar risk characteristics collectively. Loans that do not share similar risk characteristics are evaluated individually.
The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:
Pass. Loans rated Pass include those that are adequately performing and collateralized and which management believes do not have conditions that have occurred or may occur that would result in the loan being downgraded into an inferior category.
Watch. Loans rated as Watch include those that management believes have conditions that have occurred, or may occur, which could result in the loan being downgraded to an inferior category. Also included in watch are loans rated as special mention, which have a potential weakness that deserves management’s close attention. If left

Notes to consolidated financial statements
(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution’s credit position at some future date.
Substandard. Loans rated as Substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so rated have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.
Doubtful. Loans classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.
Risk ratings are updated on an ongoing basis and are subject to change by continuous loan monitoring processes.
The following table presents the credit quality of our loan portfolio by year of origination as of December 31, 2020. Revolving loans are presented separately. Management considers the guidance in ASC 310-20 when determining whether a modification, extension, or renewal constitutes a current period origination. Generally, current period renewals of credit are reunderwritten at the point of renewal and considered current period originations for the purposes of the table below.

The following disclosures are presented in accordance with GAAP in effect prior to the adoption of CECL. The Company has included these disclosures to address the applicable prior periods presented.
The following table shows credit quality indicators by class of financing receivable at December 31, 2019.
Nonaccrual and Past Due Loans
Nonperforming loans include loans that are no longer accruing interest (nonaccrual loans) and loans past due ninety or more days and still accruing interest.
The following tables provide information on nonaccrual and past due loans as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. For December 31, 2019, purchased credit impaired ("PCI") loans are not included in the nonperforming disclosures as these loans are considered to be performing, even though they may be contractually past due. This is because any non-payment of contractual principal or interest was considered in the periodic re-estimation of expected cash flows and was included in the 2019 loan loss provision or future period yield adjustments. Under PCD accounting, management considers changes in the credit quality of the borrower as part of its regular estimation of expected credit losses and does not make the same future yield adjustments as under the PCI accounting. Consequently, PCD loans that are contractually past due or on nonaccrual status, including those formerly accounted for as PCI loans, are included in the December 31, 2020 nonperforming disclosures.

The following disclosures are presented in accordance with GAAP in effect prior to the adoption of CECL. The Company has included these disclosures to address the applicable prior periods presented.
As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying value of PCI loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 "Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality" was $57,152 and $68,999. The following table presents changes in the value of the accretable yield for PCI loans for the periods indicated.
Included in the ending balance of the accretable yield on PCI loans at December 31, 2019 and 2018, was a purchase accounting liquidity discount of $292 and $2,436, respectively. There was also a purchase accounting nonaccretable credit discount of $3,537 and $4,355 related to the PCI loan portfolio at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and an accretable credit and liquidity discount on non-PCI loans of $8,964 and $3,924 as of December 31, 2019 and $7,527 and $2,197, respectively, as of December 31, 2018.

(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
Interest revenue, through accretion of the difference between the recorded investment of the loans and the expected cash flows, was recognized on all PCI loans. Accretion of interest income amounting to $7,003 and $9,010 was recognized on PCI loans during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This included both the contractual interest income recognized and the purchase accounting contribution through accretion of the liquidity discount for changes in estimated cash flows. The total purchase accounting contribution through accretion excluding contractual interest collected for all purchased loans was $8,556 and $7,608 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively
As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company has a recorded investment in TDRs of $15,988 and $12,206, respectively. The modifications included extensions of the maturity date and/or a stated rate of interest to one lower than the current market rate to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company has calculated $310 and $360 of specific reserves for those loans at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. There were no commitments to lend any additional amounts to these customers for either period end. Of these loans, $8,279 and $5,201 were classified as non-accrual loans as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.
The following tables present the financial effect of TDRs recorded during the periods indicated.
There were no loans modified as troubled debt restructurings for which there was a payment default within twelve months following the modification during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 90 days contractually past due under the modified terms.
In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification. This

(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
evaluation is performed under the Company’s internal underwriting policy. The terms of certain other loans were modified during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 that did not meet the definition of a TDR. The modification of these loans usually involve either a modification of the terms of a loan to borrowers who are not experiencing financial difficulties or an insignificant delay in payments.
Collateral Dependent Loans
For loans for which the repayment (based on the Company's assessment) is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the following table presents the loans and the corresponding individually assessed allowance for credit losses by class of financing receivable.
Deferrals Program included in COVID-19 Relief
On March 22, 2020, an Interagency Statement was issued by banking regulators encouraging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations due to the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Section 4013 of the CARES Act further provides that a qualified loan modification is exempt by law from classification as a TDR as defined by GAAP, from the period beginning March 1, 2020 until the earlier of December 31, 2020 or the date that is 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the COVID-19 outbreak terminates. Section 541 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) extends this relief to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the national emergency termination date. The Interagency Statement was subsequently revised in April 2020 to clarify the interaction of the original guidance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act, as well as setting forth the banking regulators’ views on consumer protection considerations. The following table outlines the Company's recorded investment and percentage of loans held for investment by class of financing receivable for Company executed deferrals that remain on deferral at December 31, 2020, in connection with Company COVID-19 relief programs. These deferrals typically ranged from sixty to ninety days per deferral and were not considered TDRs under the interagency regulatory guidance or the CARES Act issued in March 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had a total of $1,399,088 loans previously deferred that were no longer in deferral status.

Note (10)-Leases:
On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02 "Leases" (Topic 842) and all subsequent updates that modified Topic 842. For the Company, the adoption primarily affected the accounting treatment for operating lease agreements in which the Company is the lessee. Substantially all the leases for which the Company is the lessee are comprised of real estate for branches, mortgage, and operations locations.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company was the lessee in 58 operating leases and 1 finance lease of certain branch, mortgage and operations locations, of which 49 operating leases and 1 finance lease currently have remaining terms varying from greater than one year to 35 years. Leases with initial terms of less than one year are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company also does not include equipment leases and leases in which the Company is the lessor on the consolidated balance sheets as these are insignificant.
Many leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease up to an additional 20 years or more. Certain lease agreements contain provisions to periodically adjust rental payments for inflation. Renewal options that management is reasonably certain to renew and fixed rent escalations are included in the right-of-use ("ROU") asset and lease liability.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $23,972 in ROU assets and liabilities for operating leases assumed in the Franklin and FNB transactions. Additionally, the Company also assumed a finance lease in the Franklin transaction amounting to $1,630 included in premises and equipment and borrowings on the consolidated balance sheets.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company entered into a lease for a new corporate headquarters building located in downtown Nashville. The building is currently under construction and anticipated to be completed in late 2022.

Note (14)-Borrowings:
Borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, lines of credit, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and subordinated debt.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are financing arrangements that mature daily. The Company enters into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the securities the following day. These agreements are made to provide customers with comprehensive treasury management programs and a short-term return for their excess funds.
Information concerning securities sold under agreement to repurchase is summarized as follows:
The fair value of securities pledged to secure repurchase agreements may decline. The Company manages this risk by having a policy to pledge securities valued at 100% of the outstanding balance of repurchase agreements.
The Bank maintains lines with certain correspondent banks that provide borrowing capacity in the form of federal funds purchased in the aggregate amount of $335,000 and $305,000 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no borrowings against these available lines at December 31, 2020 or 2019.

Subordinated Debt
In 2003, two separate trusts formed by the Company issued $9,000 of floating rate trust preferred securities (“Trust I”) and $21,000 of floating rate trust preferred securities (“Trust II”), respectively, as part of a pooled offering of such securities. The Company issued junior subordinated debentures of $9,280, which included proceeds of common securities purchased by the Company of $280, and junior subordinated debentures of $21,650, which included proceeds of common securities of $650. Both issuances were to the trusts in exchange for the proceeds of the securities offerings, which represent the sole asset of the trusts. Trust I pays interest quarterly based upon the 3-month LIBOR plus 3.25%. Trust II pays interest quarterly based upon the 3-month LIBOR plus 3.15%. Rates for the two issues at December 31, 2020, were 3.50% and 3.40%, respectively. Rates for the two issues at December 31, 2019, were 5.19% and 5.10%, respectively. The Company may redeem the first junior subordinated debenture listed, in whole or in part, on any distribution payment date within 120 days of the occurrence of a special event, at the redemption price. The Company may redeem the second junior subordinated debentures listed, in whole or in part, any time after June 26, 2008, on any distribution payment date, at the redemption price. The junior subordinated debentures must be redeemed no later than 2033. The Company has classified $30,000 of subordinated debt as Tier 1 capital at both December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company placed $100,000 of ten year fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes, maturing September 1, 2030. This subordinated note instrument pays interest semi-annually in arrears based on a 4.5% fixed annual interest rate for the first five years of the notes. For years six through ten, the interest rate resets on a quarterly basis, and will be based on the 3-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus a spread of 439 basis points. The Company is entitled to redeem the notes in whole or in part on any interest payment date on or after September 1, 2025. The Company has classified the issuance, net of unamortized issuance costs of $1,772, as Tier 2 capital as of December 31, 2020. Under current regulatory guidelines, the instrument loses 20% of its Tier 2 capital treatment on a graded basis in the final five years prior to maturity.
The Company also assumed two issues of subordinated debt, totaling $60,000, as part of the Franklin merger. The notes, issued in 2016, feature $40,000 of 6.875% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due March 30, 2026 ("March 2026 Subordinated Notes"), and $20,000 of 7% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due July 1, 2026 ("July 2026 Subordinated Notes"). Both note issuances currently pay interest semi-annually, and will begin resetting interest rates on a quarterly basis after March 30, 2021 and July 1, 2021. For years six through ten, interest for the March 2026 Subordinated Notes will based on the 3-month LIBOR plus 5.636%, and interest for the July 2026 Subordinated Notes will be based on the 3-month LIBOR plus 6.04%. The Company is entitled to redeem in whole or in part after the respective fifth anniversary of each note issuance. The Company classified the balance of $60,369, which includes an interest rate premium of $369, as Tier 2 capital as of December 31, 2020. Subsequent to December 31, 2020, the Company issued an irrevocable notice to the holders of the issuance declaring intention to redeem the $40.0 million note in full during the first quarter of 2021.

Other borrowings
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company initiated a credit line in the amount of $20.0 million (1.75% + 1 month LIBOR in effect 2 business days prior to reprice date) and borrowed $15.0 million against the line to fund the cash consideration paid in connection with the Farmers National transaction. As of December 31, 2020, an additional $5.0 million was available for the Company to draw. This line of credit had a term of one year and matured on February 21, 2021.
Note (15)-Income taxes:
An allocation of federal and state income taxes between current and deferred portions is presented below:
The following table presents a reconciliation of federal income taxes at the statutory federal rate of 21% to the Company's effective tax rates for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018:
As of December 31, 2020, the Company acquired $8,346 of net operating losses from Franklin. The net operating loss carryforwards can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income tax liabilities in those future periods. While net operating losses are subject to certain annual utilization limits under IRC Section 382, the Company believes the net operating losses carryforward will be realized based on the projected annual limitation and the length of the net operating loss carryover period. The Company's determination of the realization of the net deferred tax asset is based on its assessment of all available positive and negative evidence. The net operating loss carryforward is set to expire as of December 31, 2030.
The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for tax years before 2017 for federal taxes and before 2016 for various state jurisdictions.

The components of the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, are as follows:
Note (16)-Dividend restrictions:
Due to regulations of the Tennessee Department of Financial Institutions (“TDFI”), the Bank may not declare dividends in any calendar year that exceeds the total of its net income of that year combined with its retained net income of the preceding two years without the prior approval of the TDFI Commissioner. Based upon this regulation, $185,703 and $223,730 was available for payment of dividends without such prior approval at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In addition, dividends paid by the Bank to the Company would be prohibited if the effect thereof would cause the Bank’s capital to be reduced below applicable minimum capital requirements.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, there were $48,750 in cash dividends and $956 in security dividends declared from the Bank to the Company. No cash dividends were declared from the Bank to the Company during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.

Note (17)-Commitments and contingencies:
Some financial instruments, such as loan commitments, credit lines, letters of credit, and overdraft protection, are issued to meet customer financing needs. These are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contract are met, and usually have expiration dates.
Commitments may expire without being used. Off-balance sheet risk of credit loss exists up to the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such commitments as are used for loans, including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment.
As of December 31, 2020, approximately $1.07 billion of loan commitments had fixed rates and $1.65 billion had floating rates.
In connection with the adoption of CECL on January 1, 2020, the Company estimates expected credit losses on off-balance sheet loan commitments that are not accounted for as derivatives. When applying the CECL methodology to estimate expected credit loss, the Company considers the likelihood that funding will occur, the contractual period of exposure to credit loss, the risk of loss, historical loss experience, and current conditions along with expectations of future economic conditions. As such, upon adoption the Company recorded an initial allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments in other liabilities amounting to $2,947. The impact net of taxes was recorded as part of the cumulative adjustment to retained earnings of $25,018 on January 1, 2020.
The table below presents activity within the allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments:
In connection with the sale of mortgage loans to third party investors, the Bank makes usual and customary representations and warranties as to the propriety of its origination activities. Occasionally, the investors require the Bank to repurchase loans sold to them under the terms of the warranties. When this happens, the loans are recorded at fair value with a corresponding charge to a valuation reserve. The total principal amount of loans repurchased (or indemnified for) was $9,171, $6,475, and $6,646 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Company has established a reserve associated with loan repurchases. This reserve is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
The following table summarizes the activity in the repurchase reserve:

Note (18)-Derivatives:
The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments as part of its ongoing efforts to manage its interest rate risk exposure as well as the exposure for its customers. Derivative financial instruments are included in the consolidated balance sheets line item “Other assets” or “Other liabilities” at fair value in accordance with ASC 815, “Derivatives and Hedging.”
The Company enters into commitments to originate loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding (rate-lock commitments). Under such commitments, interest rates for mortgage loans are typically locked in for between 45 to 90 days with the customer. These interest rate lock commitments are recorded at fair value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company also enters into best effort or mandatory delivery forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans to secondary market investors. Gains and losses arising from changes in the valuation of the rate-lock commitments and forward commitments are recognized currently in earnings and are reflected under the line item “Mortgage banking income” on the consolidated statements of income.
The Company enters into forward commitments, futures and options contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments as economic hedges to offset the changes in fair value of MSRs. Gains and losses associated with these instruments are included in earnings and are reflected under the line item “Mortgage banking income” on the consolidated statements of income.
Additionally, the Company enters into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments to help its commercial customers manage their exposure to interest rate fluctuations. To mitigate the interest rate risk associated with customer contracts, the Company enters into an offsetting derivative contract. The Company manages its credit risk, or potential risk of default by its commercial customers through credit limit approval and monitoring procedures.
The Company also maintains two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling $30,000 used to hedge interest rate exposure on outstanding subordinated debentures included in long-term debt totaling $30,930. Under these agreements, the Company receives a variable rate of interest equal to 3-month LIBOR and pays a weighted average fixed rate of interest of 2.08%. The interest rate swap contracts, which mature in June of 2024, are designated as cash flow hedges with the objective of reducing the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates. As of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the fair value of these contracts resulted in liability balances of $1,909 and $515, respectively.
In July 2017, the Company entered into three interest rate swap contracts on floating rate liabilities at the Bank level with notional amounts of $30,000, $35,000 and $35,000 for a period of three, four and five years, respectively. These interest rate swaps were designated as cash flow hedges with the objective of reducing the variability of cash flows associated with $100,000 of FHLB borrowings. During the first quarter of 2018, these swaps were canceled, locking in a tax-adjusted gain of $1,564 in other comprehensive income to be accreted over the three, four and five-year terms of the underlying contracts. As of December 31, 2019, there was $955 remaining in the other comprehensive income to be accreted. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company elected to not renew the advances associated with the legacy cash flow hedge, and reclassified the remaining unamortized gain, from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings.

The following discloses the amount included in other comprehensive income, net of tax, for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges for the periods presented:
Certain financial instruments, including derivatives, may be eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheets when the “right of offset” exists or when the instruments are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement, which includes the right of the non-defaulting party or non-affected party to offset recognized amounts, including collateral posted with the counterparty, to determine a net receivable or net payable upon early termination of the agreement. Certain of the Company’s derivative instruments are subject to master netting agreements, however the Company has not elected to offset such financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents the Company's gross derivative positions as recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as well as the net derivative positions, including collateral pledged to the extent the application of such collateral did not reduce the net derivative liability position below zero, had the Company elected to offset those instruments subject to an enforceable master netting agreement:
Most derivative contracts with clients are secured by collateral. Additionally, in accordance with the interest rate agreements with derivatives dealers, the Company may be required to post margin to these counterparties. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had minimum collateral posting thresholds with certain derivative counterparties and had collateral posted of $57,985 and $33,616, respectively, against its obligations under these agreements. Cash collateral related to derivative contracts is recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.
Note (19)-Fair value of financial instruments:
FASB ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 also establishes a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities according to a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The hierarchy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that are derived from assumptions based on management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances.
FB Financial Corporation and subsidiaries
Notes to consolidated financial statements
(Dollar amounts are in thousands, except share and per share amounts)
The hierarchy is broken down into the following three levels, based on the reliability of inputs:
Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date.
Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.
Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities that are derived from assumptions based on management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.
The Company records the fair values of financial assets and liabilities on a recurring and non-recurring basis using the following methods and assumptions:
Investment securities-Investment securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair values for securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of similar instruments or are determined by matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the pricing relationship or correlation among other benchmark quoted securities. Investment securities valued using quoted market prices of similar instruments or that are valued using matrix pricing are classified as Level 2. When significant inputs to the valuation are unobservable, the available-for-sale securities are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
Where no active market exists for a security or other benchmark securities, fair value is estimated by the Company with reference to discount margins for other high-risk securities.
Loans held for sale-Loans held for sale are carried at fair value. Fair value is determined using current secondary market prices for loans with similar characteristics, that is, using Level 2 inputs.
Derivatives-The fair value of the interest rate swaps are based upon fair values provided from entities that engage in interest rate swap activity and is based upon projected future cash flows and interest rates. Fair value of commitments is based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, and for fixed-rate commitments, the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates is also considered. These financial instruments are classified as Level 2.
Other real estate owned (“OREO”)-OREO is comprised of commercial and residential real estate obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations and excess land and facilities held for sale. OREO acquired in settlement of indebtedness is recorded at the lower of the carrying amount of the loan or the fair value of the real estate less costs to sell. Fair value is determined on a nonrecurring basis based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers and is adjusted for management’s estimates of costs to sell and holding period discounts. The valuations are classified as Level 3.
Mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs")-MSRs are carried at fair value. Fair value is determined using an income approach with various assumptions including expected cash flows, market discount rates, prepayment speeds, servicing costs, and other factors. As such, mortgage servicing rights are considered Level 3.
Collateral dependent loans (Impaired loans prior to the adoption of ASC 326)-loans for which, based on current information and events, the Company has determined foreclosure of the collateral is probable, or where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the Company expects repayment of the loan to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and it is probable that the creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Collateral dependent loans are classified as Level 3.

The following table presents information as of December 31, 2020 about significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used in the valuation of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:
The following table presents information as of December 31, 2019 about significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used in the valuation of assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:
(1) Includes both impaired non-purchased loans and collateral-dependent PCI loans.
For collateral dependent loans, the ACL is measured based on the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the amortized cost basis of the loan as of the measurement date. Fair value of the loan's collateral is determined by third-party appraisals, which are then adjusted for the estimated selling and closing costs related to liquidation of of the collateral. Collateral dependent loans are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly, based on changes in market conditions from the time of valuation and management's knowledge of the client and client's business. Other real estate owned acquired in settlement of indebtedness is recorded at fair value of the real estate less estimated costs to sell. Subsequently, it may be necessary to record nonrecurring fair value adjustments for declines in fair value. Any write-downs based on the asset's fair value at the date of foreclosure are charged to the allowance for credit losses. Appraisals for both collateral dependent loans and other real estate owned are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Once received, a member of the lending administrative department reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal as well as the overall resulting fair value in comparison with independent data sources such as recent market data or industry wide statistics.

Fair value option
The Company measures mortgage loans originated for sale at fair value under the fair value option as permitted under ASC 825. Electing to measure these assets at fair value reduces certain timing differences and more accurately matches the changes in fair value of the loans with changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to economically hedge them.
Net gains of $24,233 resulting from fair value changes of mortgage loans were recorded in income during the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net losses of $2,861 during the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The amount does not reflect changes in fair values of related derivative instruments used to hedge exposure to market-related risks associated with these mortgage loans. The change in fair value of both loans held for sale and the related derivative instruments are recorded in Mortgage Banking Income in the consolidated statements of income. Election of the fair value option allows the Company to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost or fair value and the derivatives at fair value.
As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, there were $151,184 and $51,705, respectively, of GNMA loans previously sold that the Company did not record on its consolidated balance sheets as the Company determined there not to be a more-than-trivial benefit based on an analysis of interest rates and an assessment of potential reputational risk associated with these loans.
The Company’s valuation of loans held for sale incorporates an assumption for credit risk; however, given the short-term period that the Company holds these loans, valuation adjustments attributable to instrument-specific credit risk is nominal.
Interest income on loans held for sale measured at fair value is accrued as it is earned based on contractual rates and is reflected in loan interest income in the consolidated statements of income.
The following table summarizes the differences between the fair value and the principal balance for loans held for sale and nonaccrual loans measured at fair value as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:

Note (21)-Segment reporting:
The Company and the Bank are engaged in the business of banking and provide a full range of financial services. The Company determines reportable segments based on the significance of the segment’s operating results to the overall Company, the products and services offered, customer characteristics, processes and service delivery of the segments and the regular financial performance review and allocation of resources by the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), the Company’s chief operating decision maker. The Company has identified two distinct reportable segments-Banking and Mortgage. The Company’s primary segment is Banking, which provides a full range of deposit and lending products and services to corporate, commercial and consumer customers. The Company offers full-service conforming residential mortgage products, including conforming residential loans and services through the Mortgage segment utilizing mortgage offices outside of the geographic footprint of the Banking operations. Additionally, the Mortgage segment includes the servicing of residential mortgage loans and the packaging and securitization of loans to governmental agencies. The residential mortgage products and services originated in our Banking footprint and related revenues and expenses are included in our Banking segment. The Company’s mortgage division represents a distinct reportable segment which differs from the Company’s primary business of commercial and retail banking.
The financial performance of the Mortgage segment is assessed based on results of operations reflecting direct revenues and expenses and allocated expenses. This approach gives management a better indication of the operating performance of the segment. When assessing the Banking segment’s financial performance, the CEO utilizes reports with indirect revenues and expenses including but not limited to the investment portfolio, electronic delivery channels and areas that primarily support the banking segment operations. Therefore these are included in the results of the Banking segment. Other indirect revenue and expenses related to general administrative areas are also included in the internal financial results reports of the Banking segment utilized by the CEO for analysis and are thus included for Banking segment reporting. The Mortgage segment utilizes funding sources from the Banking segment in order to fund mortgage loans that are ultimately sold on the secondary market. The Mortgage segment uses the proceeds from loan sales to repay obligations due to the Banking segment.

Note (22)-Minimum capital requirements:
Banks and bank holding companies are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines and, additionally for banks, prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators. Failure to meet capital requirements can initiate regulatory action.
Under regulatory guidance for non-advanced approaches institutions, the Bank and Company are required to maintain minimum capital ratios as outlined in the table below. Additionally, under U.S. Basel III Capital Rules, the decision was made to opt out of including accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Bank and Company met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject.
In December 2018, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC approved a final rule to address changes to credit loss accounting under GAAP, including banking organizations’ implementation of CECL. The final rule provides banking organizations the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects on regulatory capital that may result from the adoption of the new accounting standard. In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the FDIC announced a final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the implementation of CECL. The final rule maintains the three-year transition option in the previous rule and provides banks the option to delay for two years an estimate of CECL’s effect on regulatory capital, relative to the incurred loss methodology’s effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period (five-year transition option). The Company adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period.

Performance Based Restricted Stock Units
During 2020, the Company began awarding performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs") to executives and other officers and employees. Under the terms of the award, the number of units that will vest and convert to shares of common stock will be based on the extent to which the Company achieves specified performance criteria during the fixed three-year performance period. The number of shares issued upon vesting will range from 0% to 200% of the PSUs granted. The PSUs vest at the end of a three-year period based on average adjusted return on tangible equity as reported, adjusted for unusual gains/losses, merger expenses, and other items as approved by the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors. Compensation expense for the PSUs will be estimated each period based on the fair value of the stock at the grant date and the most probable outcome of the performance condition, adjusted for the passage of time within the vesting period of the awards.
The Company granted 53,147 shares of performance based restricted stock units and recorded compensation cost of $1,001 during the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the Company determined the probability of meeting the performance criteria, and recorded compensation cost associated with a 181% vesting, when factoring in the conversion of PSUs to shares of common stock.
