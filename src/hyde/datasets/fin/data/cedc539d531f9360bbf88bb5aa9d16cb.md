INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
See accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Newtek Business Services Corp. and Subsidiaries
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of assets and liabilities, including the consolidated schedules of investments, of Newtek Business Services Corp. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements and the financial statement schedule of the Company listed in the accompanying index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of SBA unguaranteed and guaranteed non-affiliate investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, by correspondence with the borrowers or by other appropriate auditing procedures where replies from the borrowers were not received and with respect to controlled and non-controlled investments, by tracing to purchase agreements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Valuation of investments
As described in Notes 2, 3, 4 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s investments consist of privately held debt and equity instruments that lack observable market prices. All of Company’s investments are measured at fair value using unobservable inputs and assumptions, and as such the Company’s investments as of December 31, 2020 are classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 6. Determining the fair value of the Level 3 investments requires management to make significant judgments about the valuation methodologies (e.g. market approach vs. income approach) and inputs and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, including, but not limited to, revenue and EBITDA multiples, market yields, discounts for lack of marketability, underlying cash flows, and the impact of economic conditions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, total Level 3 investments had a fair value of $633.34 million.
We identified the valuation of investments as a critical audit matter because of the judgments necessary for management to select and apply valuation techniques and assumptions, the high degree of auditor judgment involved, and the extensive audit effort involved in testing the valuations. Our audit procedures related to the valuation of the Company’s investments included the following, among others:
Controlled and non-controlled investments
•We obtained an understanding of and evaluated the methods and significant assumptions management used to value the Company’s investment portfolio.
•We performed an evaluation of certain valuation inputs (e.g. portfolio company revenue and EBITDA) used in the Company’s December 31, 2019 valuations by comparing those key inputs used in the prior year valuation to portfolio company 2019 audited financial statements and/or schedules prepared by the portfolio company for a sample of investments.
•We tested the completeness and accuracy of information used in the valuations through inspection of portfolio company financial statements and/or schedules prepared by the portfolio company.
•We obtained management’s valuation analyses and considered the qualitative considerations made in determining each valuation, including, but not limited to, understanding portfolio company outlook, underlying cash flows, macroeconomic factors, liquidity and leverage characteristics, and other factors. We then compared this information to the valuation calculation in assessing the reasonableness of the fair value calculations.
•With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods and assumptions used by management, including the validity of observable market data used in the valuation (e.g. comparable guideline public company multiples) as well as market yields (including discounts for lack of marketability). For certain investments, with the assistance of our valuation specialists, we developed a range of independent enterprise value estimates and evaluated against the enterprise values determined by management. Additionally, we considered the external specialist report engaged by management in valuing the Company’s certain privately held investments.
SBA unguaranteed non-affiliate investments - performing loans and non-performing loans
•We obtained an understanding of and evaluated the methods and assumptions management uses to value the SBA unguaranteed non-affiliate investments performing and non-performing loans.
•We tested the completeness and accuracy of information used in the valuations by agreeing the total amount in the schedules to the trial balance.
•With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods and assumptions used by management in the valuation of performing loans (discount rate, default rate, prepayment rate, cost of servicing, etc.) and performed a recalculation for a sample of loans to ensure validity of the valuation model.
•With the assistance of our valuation specialist, we evaluated the reasonableness of the methods and assumptions used by management in the valuation of non-performing loans (prepayment rate, probability of default, time to liquidate and recovery rate).
Valuation of Servicing assets
As described in Notes 2, 5 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, Servicing assets are measured at fair value. Company’s servicing assets are measured at fair value using unobservable inputs and assumptions, and as such the Company’s servicing assets as of December 31, 2020 are classified as level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 2. Determining the fair value of the Level 3 servicing assets requires management to make significant judgments about the valuation methodologies and inputs and assumptions used in the fair value calculation, including, but not limited to, servicing costs, default rate, prepayment rate, and the impact of economic conditions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, total Level 3 servicing assets had a fair value of $26.06 million.
We identified the valuation of servicing assets as a critical audit matter because of the judgments necessary for management to select and apply valuation techniques and assumptions, the high degree of auditor judgment involved, and the extensive audit effort involved in testing the valuations. Our audit procedures related to the valuation of the servicing assets included the following, among others:
•We obtained an understanding of and evaluated the methods and assumptions management uses to value the servicing assets.
•We tested the completeness and accuracy of information used in the valuations by agreeing the total principal balance of the loans sold in the schedules to the loan subledger.
•With the assistance of externally engaged valuation specialist, developed an independent estimate of fair value for servicing assets as of December 31, 2020.
•We evaluated the significant assumptions (e.g. discount rate, prepayment rate, default rate and cost of service) used by externally engaged valuation specialist for reasonableness.

(1) Newtek values each unguaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) accrual loans (“Loan”) using a discounted cash flow analysis which projects future cash flows and incorporates projections for Loan pre-payments and Loan defaults using historical portfolio data. The data predicts future prepayment and default probability on curves which are based on Loan age. The recovery assumption for each Loan is specific to the discounted valuation of the collateral supporting that Loan. Each Loan’s cash flow is discounted at a rate which approximates a market yield. The Loans were originated under the SBA 7(a) program and conform to the underwriting guidelines in effect at their time of origination. Newtek has been awarded PLP status from the SBA. Portions of these Loans are not guaranteed by the SBA. Individual loan participations can be sold to institutions which have been granted an SBA 750 license. Loans can also be sold as a pool of loans in a security form to qualified investors.
(2) The interest rates in effect on our loans as of December 31, 2020 are based off a Prime Rate equal to 3.25% and 1 month LIBOR equal to 0.14388%.
(3) Newtek values non-accrual SBA 7(a) loans using a discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying collateral which supports the loan. Management’s estimate of the net recovery of collateral, (fair value less cost to liquidate) is applied to the discounted cash flow analysis based upon a time to liquidate estimate. Modified loans are valued based upon current payment streams and are re-amortized at the end of the modification period.
(4a) Newtek values guaranteed accrual SBA 7(a) loans using the secondary SBA 7(a) market as a reference point. Newtek routinely sells accrual SBA 7(a) loans into this secondary market. Guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans partially funded as of the valuation date are valued using level two inputs as disclosed in NOTE 6-FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.
(4b) Newtek values guaranteed non-accrual loans based on the estimated recovery under the SBA guarantee, which is at cost.

(1) Newtek values each unguaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) accrual loans (“Loan”) using a discounted cash flow analysis which projects future cash flows and incorporates projections for Loan pre-payments and Loan defaults using historical portfolio data. The data predicts future prepayment and default probability on curves which are based on Loan age. The recovery assumption for each Loan is specific to the discounted valuation of the collateral supporting that Loan. Each Loan’s cash flow is discounted at a rate which approximates a market yield. The Loans were originated under the SBA 7(a) program and conform to the underwriting guidelines in effect at their time of origination. Newtek has been awarded PLP status from the SBA. Portions of these Loans are not guaranteed by the SBA. Individual loan participations can be sold to institutions which have been granted an SBA 750 license. Loans can also be sold as a pool of loans in a security form to qualified investors.
(2) The interest rates in effect on our loans as of December 31, 2019 are based off a Prime Rate equal to 5.00% and 1 month LIBOR equal to 1.76250%.
(3) Newtek values non-accrual SBA 7(a) loans using a discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying collateral which supports the loan. Management’s estimate of the net recovery of collateral, (fair value less cost to liquidate) is applied to the discounted cash flow analysis based upon a time to liquidate estimate. Modified loans are valued based upon current payment streams and are re-amortized at the end of the modification period.
(4a) Newtek values guaranteed accrual SBA 7(a) loans using the secondary SBA 7(a) market as a reference point. Newtek routinely sells accrual SBA 7(a) loans into this secondary market. Guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans partially funded as of the valuation date are valued using level two inputs as disclosed in NOTE 6-FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.
(4b) Newtek values guaranteed non-accrual loans based on the estimated recovery under the SBA guarantee, which is at cost.
(5) Controlled Investments are disclosed above as equity investments (except as otherwise noted) in those companies that are “Controlled Investments” of the Company as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940. A company is deemed to be a “Controlled Investment” of Newtek Business Services Corp. if Newtek Business Services Corp. or its subsidiaries owns more than 25% of the voting securities of such company. See NOTE 4-TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements of our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 16, 2020 for transactions during the year ended December 31, 2019 with affiliates the Company is deemed to control.

(20) 50.13% owned by Newtek Business Services Holdco 3, Inc. (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.) and 49.87% owned by multiple non-affiliates.
(21) Zero cost basis is reflected as the portfolio company was organized by the Company and incurred internal legal costs to organize the entity and immaterial external filing fees which were expensed when incurred.
(22) All of the Company’s investments are in entities which are organized under the Laws of the United States and have a principal place of business in the United States.
(23) The fair value of the investment was determined using significant unobservable inputs.
(24) The Company’s investments generally are acquired in private transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act and, therefore, generally are subject to limitations on resale, and may be deemed to be “restricted securities” under the Securities Act. However, unless otherwise indicated, such securities may be sold in certain transactions (generally to qualified institutional buyers) and remain exempt from registration.
(25) Restricted security.
(26) Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying assets unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company’s total assets. At December 31, 2019, 7.1% of total assets are non-qualifying assets.
As of December 31, 2019, the federal tax cost of investments was $561,343,000 resulting in estimated gross unrealized gains and losses of $155,414,000 and $49,330,000, respectively.

NOTE 2-SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
Fair Value
The Company applies fair value accounting to certain of its financial instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurement (“ASC Topic 820”). ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, the Company has categorized its financial instruments carried at fair value, based on the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company’s own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date.
The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether the product is new, whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and the current market conditions. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for financial instruments classified as Level 3.
Any changes to the valuation methodology are reviewed by management and the Board to confirm that the changes are appropriate. As markets change, new products develop and the pricing for products becomes more or less transparent, the Company will continue to refine its valuation methodologies. See further description of fair value methodology in Note 6.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are complete. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Consolidation
As provided under ASC Topic 946, the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company.
Assets related to transactions that do not meet ASC Topic 860 - Transfers and Servicing (“ASC Topic 860”) requirements for accounting sale treatment are reflected in the Company’s consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as investments. Those assets are owned by the securitization trusts and are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The creditors of the special purpose entities have received security interests in such assets and such assets are not intended to be available to the creditors of the Company.
Although the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities of NCL, the Company does not have sole control over significant actions of NCL for purposes of the 1940 Act or otherwise, and does not consolidate its interest in NCL.
Distributions
Dividends and distributions to the Company's common stockholders are recorded on the declaration date. The timing and amount to be paid out as a dividend or distribution is determined by the Company's Board each quarter and is generally based upon the annual taxable earnings estimated by management.
Cash
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Invested cash is held exclusively at financial institutions of high credit quality. As of December 31, 2020, cash deposits in excess of insured amounts totaled $27,815,000. The Company has not experienced any losses with respect to cash balances in excess of insured amounts and management does not believe there was a significant concentration of risk with respect to cash balances as of December 31, 2020.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash includes amounts due on SBA loan-related remittances to third parties, cash reserves established as part of a voluntary agreement with the SBA, and cash reserves associated with securitization transactions. As of December 31, 2020, total restricted cash was $49,352,000.
The following table provides a reconciliation of cash and restricted cash as of December 31, 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017:
Broker Receivable
Broker receivable represents amounts due from third parties for loans which have been traded at period end but have not yet settled.
Servicing Assets
The Company accounts for servicing assets in accordance with ASC 860-50 Transfers and Servicing - Servicing Assets and Liabilities. Servicing assets are measured at fair value at each reporting date and the Company reports changes in the fair value of servicing assets in earnings in the period in which the changes occur. The Company earns servicing fees from the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans it originates and sells. The valuation model for servicing assets incorporates assumptions including, but not limited to, servicing costs, discount rate, prepayment rate, and default rate. Considerable judgement is required to estimate the fair value of servicing assets and as such these assets are classified as Level 3 in our fair value hierarchy.
Income Taxes
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted on March 27, 2020 and made significant prospective and retroactive changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws (and certain corresponding state and local conformity measures) including: 1) 5-year net operating loss (“NOL”) carrybacks with no taxable income limitation, 2) relaxation of the limitations on interest expense deductions, 3) qualified improvement property eligible for bonus depreciation, 4) acceleration of alternative minimum tax credits and related quick tax refunds, and 5) indirect tax measures, including workplace tax credits and deferral of social security payroll tax. Management has considered the impact of the CARES Act on the Company, its Taxable Subsidiaries, and the underlying portfolio companies, and the Company has reflected these potential impacts in the financial statements, related tax disclosures, and the value of the investments.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
The Company’s U.S. federal and state income tax returns prior to fiscal year 2017 are generally closed, and management continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings.
The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with the 2015 tax year and operates in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. The RIC tax return includes Newtek Business Services Corp. and NSBF, a single member LLC disregarded for tax purposes. None of the Company’s other subsidiaries are included in the RIC tax return. The Company will evaluate and record any deferred tax assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that are not included in the RIC tax return. In order to maintain its RIC tax treatment, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each tax year. The Company intends to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to any income that is distributed to its stockholders as dividends.
Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. The Company would then pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no U.S. federal excise taxes were due.
The Company’s Taxable Subsidiaries accrue income taxes payable based on the applicable corporate rates on the net unrealized appreciation generated by the controlled investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries. Such deferred tax liabilities amounted to $11,406,000 and $12,405,000 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, and are recorded as deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The change in deferred tax liabilities is included as a component of net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.
Investment Income
Management reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal or interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on management’s designation of non-accrual status. Interest receivable is analyzed regularly and may be reserved against when deemed uncollectible. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management’s judgment regarding collectability. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management’s judgment, are likely to remain current, although we may make exceptions to this general rule if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.
In addition, the first round of PPP began in the second quarter of 2020. The SBA reimburses the Company for originating loans and such SBA reimbursements are included as interest income on PPP loans. Such fees are accounted for under ASC-310 Receivables and deferred until the loan is sold to one of our PPP Participants. Income earned in connection with the PPP should not be viewed as recurring. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. See “Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.”
Dividend income is recognized on an accrual basis for preferred equity securities to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected or realized. In determining the amount of dividend income to recognize, if any, from cash distributions on common equity securities, we will assess many factors including a portfolio company’s cumulative undistributed income and operating cash flow. Cash distributions from common equity securities received in excess of such undistributed amounts are recorded first as a reduction of our investment and then as a realized gain on investment.
The Company earns servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA loan investments which it sells into the secondary market. These recurring fees are earned and recorded daily. Servicing income is earned for the full term of the loan or until the loan is repaid.
The Company earns a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting its business, including packaging, legal, late payment and prepayment fees. All other income is recorded when earned. Other income is generally non-recurring in nature and earned as “one time” fees in connection with the origination of new debt investments with non-affiliates.
Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. The Company reports current period changes in the fair value of investments as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the consolidated statements of operations.
Stock - Based Compensation
The Company accounts for its equity-based compensation plan using the fair value method, as prescribed by ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation. Accordingly, for restricted stock awards, the Company measures the grant date fair value based upon the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of the grant and amortizes this fair value to salaries and benefits ratably over the requisite service period or vesting term.
New Accounting Standards
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting,(“ASU 2020-04”). ASU 2020-04 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts and transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective upon issuance of ASU 2020-04 for contract modifications on a prospective basis. While the Company is currently assessing the impact of ASU 2020-04, the Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
In May 2020, the SEC adopted amendments to the financial disclosure requirements in Regulation S-X including the significance tests in the “significant subsidiary” definition in Rule 1-02(w), Securities Act Rule 405, and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 to improve their application and to assist registrants in making more meaningful determinations of whether a subsidiary or an acquired or disposed business is significant. In addition, to address the unique attributes of investment companies and business development companies, the SEC updated the significance tests in Rule 1-02(w), Securities Act Rule 405, and Exchange Act Rule 12b-2 by (i) revising the investment test to compare the registrant’s investments in and advances to the acquired or disposed business to the registrant’s aggregate worldwide market value if available; (ii) revising the income test by adding a revenue component; (iii) expanding the use of pro forma financial information in measuring significance; and (iv)
conforming, to the extent applicable, the significance threshold and tests for disposed businesses to those used for acquired businesses. The amendment became effective January 1, 2021; however, voluntary compliance with the final amendments will be permitted in advance of the effective date. No significant changes to our significant subsidiaries are expected.
In October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08, Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables-Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, (“ASU 2020-08”). This ASU clarifies that an entity should reevaluate whether a callable debt security is within the scope of ASC paragraph 310-20-35-33 for each reporting period. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application is not permitted. All entities should apply ASU 2020-08 on a prospective basis as of the beginning of the period of adoption for existing or newly purchased callable debt securities. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements since the Company does not have any convertible debt.
In December 2020, Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act was adopted by the SEC and establishes requirements for determining fair value in good faith for purposes of the 1940 Act. We are evaluating the impact of adopting Rule 2a-5 on the consolidated financial statements and intend to comply with the new rule's requirements on or before the compliance date in September 2022.
In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 815), (“ASU 2019-12”). ASU 2019-12 simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740. ASU 2019-12 also improves the consistent application of, and simplifies, GAAP for other areas of Topic 740 by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The standard is effective for all entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption was permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2019-12 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Segments
The Company has determined that it has a single reporting segment and operating unit structure. The Company issues debt and makes equity investments in portfolio companies in various industries. The Company separately evaluates the performance of each of its lending and investment relationships. However, because each of these debt and equity investment relationships have similar business and economic characteristics, they have been aggregated into a single lending and investment segment.
Reclassifications
Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.
NOTE 3-INVESTMENTS:
Investments, all of which are in portfolio companies in the United States, consisted of the following at:
SBA unguaranteed investments consisted of the following breakdown of accrual and non-accrual loans at:
SBA guaranteed investments consisted of the following breakdown of accrual and non-accrual loans at:
On March 27, 2020, Congress passed, and the President of the United States signed into law, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”). The CARES Act provided an over $2.0 trillion stimulus package to certain businesses and individuals affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with subsidies to certain existing SBA 7(a) borrowers in which the SBA paid all principal, interest, and fees on existing performing SBA 7(a) loans for six months beginning with such borrowers’ April 2020 payments. Among other things, the CARES Act allowed NSBF, as an SBA 7(a) lender, to originate loans under the newly-established Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) as an expansion of the existing SBA Section 7(a) loan program through June 30, 2020. On July 4, 2020, the President of the United States signed a bill to re-open the application window for the PPP until August 8, 2020. The first round of PPP closed on August 8, 2020. See “Recent Developments - PPP Additional Rounds.”
Under the PPP, SBA 7(a) lenders were automatically approved to extend 100% federally guaranteed PPP loans to certain small businesses for amounts up to 2.5 times of those businesses’ average monthly payroll expenses (capped at $10 million). The interest rate on PPP loans is capped at 1.0%, and the loans are forgivable after an 8 up to a 24 week forgiveness period, provided that the borrower uses the loans for eligible purposes (e.g., payroll/benefits (excluding employee compensation above $100,000), mortgage interest, rent and utilities) and maintains its payroll levels. The amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if the borrower reduces salaries or terminates employees during the forgiveness period.
As a result of the uncertain economic impact to U.S. small businesses created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s Executive Committee and Lending Team temporarily shifted the focus of NSBF from originating SBA 7(a) loans to originating PPP loans beginning in March 2020. On June 29, 2020, NSBF restarted its SBA 7(a) loan program and began accepting SBA 7(a) loan applications. During the duration of the PPP, NSBF funded approximately 10,570 PPP loans totaling $1.19 billion though the PPP. Pursuant to the PPP, the SBA reimbursed a lender authorized to make a PPP loan at a rate, based on the balance of the financing outstanding at the time of disbursement of the PPP loan, of: (i) 5% for PPP loans of not more than $350,000; (ii) 3% for loans of more than $350,000 and less than $2,000,000; and (iii) 1% for loans of not less than $2,000,000.
To facilitate NSBF’s involvement as an authorized lender in the PPP, during the second quarter of 2020, NSBF entered into PPP loan participation agreements where NSBF originated PPP loans and sold 90% participating interests to UBS Bank USA (“UBS”), Stifel Bank (“Stifel”), Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. (“Morgan Stanley”), and Amalgamated Bank (“Amalgamated”), collectively the “Participants.” The participations were sold at par due to the short term maturity of the loans. NSBF and the Participants share proportionally in all interest and principal payments made on the loans. Subsequently, UBS, Stifel, and Amalgamated amended their agreements with NSBF to allow the banks to purchase 100% participation interests in certain of the PPP loans originated by NSBF. In connection with the amendments, UBS, Stifel, and Amalgamated purchased the remaining 10% participation interests in their participation loans, bringing their participation interests to 100%, while Morgan Stanley continues to hold 90% participation interests as of December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, NSBF sold participations in $1.19 billion of PPP loans. NSBF continues to hold the PPP loan notes and the PPP loan documents in order to service the loans. The servicing liability in connection with the PPP loans was deemed immaterial. PPP loan origination fees are recognized as interest income on sale of PPP loan participations.
In accordance with the terms of the PPP participation agreements and SBA regulations and guidance, NSBF, as the originating lender, must continue to hold the PPP loan notes, the PPP loan documents and service the PPP loans (i.e., retain all servicing rights). Moreover, as the originating lender, NSBF is the party responsible to the SBA with respect to all servicing actions, including requests for advance purchases and loan forgiveness, and will be the party eligible for the guarantee purchase of the PPP loan. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by NSBF, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency. NSBF has agreed that it will repurchase from the Participant on demand the Participant’s Percentage of any outstanding principal and interest under the applicable PPP Loan under certain standard representations and warranties, including in the event of a loss due to fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of NSBF or any failure to recover under the SBA guarantee as a result of any deficiency in documenting or servicing such PPP Loan by NSBF.
The following table shows the Company’s SBA guaranteed accrual loans by SBA loan type at:

Newtek Conventional Lending, LLC
On May 20, 2019, the Company and its joint venture partner launched Newtek Conventional Lending, LLC (“NCL”) to provide non-conforming conventional commercial and industrial term loans to U.S. middle-market companies and small businesses. NCL is a 50/50 joint venture between Newtek Commercial Lending, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newtek, and Conventional Lending TCP Holding, LLC, a wholly-owned, indirect subsidiary of BlackRock TCP Capital Corp. (Nasdaq:TCPC).

Non-Control Debt Investments
On September 1, 2020, the Company purchased three loans from NBL, a wholly-owned controlled portfolio company. The purchases were made at par and no realized or unrealized gains or losses have been recorded related to the transaction. As of December 31, 2020, two of the loans have paid off and one remains on the Company’s balance sheet. The Company is not affiliated with the borrowers of the loans.
NOTE 4-TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED COMPANIES AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:
Transactions with Affiliated Companies
An affiliated company is an entity in which the Company has an ownership of 5% or more of its voting securities. A controlled affiliate is an entity in which the Company owns more than 25% of its voting securities. Transactions related to our investments with controlled and non-controlled affiliated companies for the year ended December 31, 2020 were as follows:
(1) On January 1, 2021, IPM and SIDCO became subsidiaries of NTS. The above table reflects the combined fair values, unrealized appreciation and amount of dividends credited to income. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $10,200,000 of unrealized appreciation related to the investment in NTS. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $350,000 and $825,000 of dividend income was earned from IPM and SIDCO, respectively.

NOTE 5-SERVICING ASSETS:
Servicing assets are measured at fair value. The Company earns servicing fees from the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans it originates and sells.
The following table summarizes the fair value and valuation assumptions related to servicing assets at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:
(1) Determined based on risk spreads and observable secondary market transactions.
Servicing fee income earned for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $11,154,000, $10,078,000, and $8,552,000, respectively.
NOTE 6-FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS:
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the “exit price”) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, management uses various valuation approaches, all of which have been approved by the Company’s Board. In accordance with GAAP, a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.
The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury, other U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.
Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes certain U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities, corporate debt securities, derivative contracts and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale.
Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category generally includes certain private equity investments, retained residual interests in securitizations, residential mortgage servicing rights, and highly structured or long-term derivative contracts.
In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company assesses the levels of assets and liabilities at each measurement date. There were no transfers to or from Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities during the years ended December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Level 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities.
For certain investments, the Company generally calculates the fair value of the investment primarily based on the net asset NAV of the entity and adjusts the fair value for other factors that would affect the fair value of the investment. The Company uses this valuation approach for its investment in NCL.
Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.
The Company’s investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented circumstance that could further negatively impact the fair value of the Company’s investments after December 31, 2020 by circumstances and events that are not yet known.
The following tables present fair value measurements of the Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair values as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:

NOTE 8-BORROWINGS:
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the Company had borrowings comprised of the following:
(1) Total combined commitments of the guaranteed and unguaranteed lines of credit were $150,000,000 at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, our asset coverage was 174%.
Outstanding borrowings under the 2023 Notes, 2024 Notes, 2025 Notes and Notes payable - Securitization Trusts consisted of the following:
At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the carrying amount of the Company’s borrowings under the Capital One lines of credit, Notes payable - related parties and Notes payable - Securitization Trusts, approximates fair value due to their variable interest rates.
The fair values of the fixed rate 2023 Notes and 2024 Notes are based on the closing public share price on the date of measurement. On December 31, 2020, the closing price of the 2023 Notes was $25.45 per note, or $58,535,000. On December 31, 2019, the closing price of the 2023 Notes was $25.68 per note, or $59,064,000. On December 31, 2020, the closing price of the 2024 Notes was $25.26 per note, or $63,908,000. On December 31, 2019, the closing price of the 2024 Notes was $25.94 per note, or $65,628,000. These borrowings are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fixed rate 2025 Notes are held at par as of December 31, 2020.
Total interest expense including unused line fees and amortization of deferred financing costs related to borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $17,875,000, $20,415,000 and $16,046,000, respectively.
Capital One Facilities
In May 2017, NSBF amended its Capital One facility to increase the facility from $50,000,000 to $100,000,000 and reduce the interest rate. The facility was amended again in June 2018 and the portion of the facility, collateralized by the government guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime minus 0.75% (previously Prime minus 0.25%). The interest rate on the portion of the facility, collateralized by the non-guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, was reduced to Prime plus 0.25% (previously Prime plus 0.75%). The facility provides for a 55% advance rate on the non-guaranteed portions of the SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates, and a 90% advance rate on the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans NSBF originates. In addition, the amendment extended the date on which the facility will convert to a term loan from May 16, 2017 to May 11, 2020 and extended the maturity date of the facility to May 11, 2022. In June 2019, the facility was increased from $100,000,000 to $150,000,000. In May 2020, the facility was amended to extend both the maturity date and date on which the facility will convert to a term loan by a period of three years.

Notes Payable - Securitization Trusts
Since 2010, NSBF has engaged in securitizations of the unguaranteed portions of its SBA 7(a) loans. In the securitization, it uses a special purpose entity (the “Trust”) which is considered a variable interest entity. Applying the consolidation requirements for VIEs under the accounting rules in ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing, and ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, which became effective January 1, 2010, the Company determined that as the primary beneficiary of the securitization vehicle, based on its power to direct activities through its role as servicer for the Trust and its obligation to absorb losses and right to receive benefits, it needed to consolidate the Trusts. NSBF therefore consolidated the entity using the carrying amounts of the Trust’s assets and liabilities. NSBF reflects the assets in SBA Unguaranteed Non-Affiliate Investments and reflects the associated financing in Notes Payable - Securitization trusts on the Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities.
In November 2016, NSBF completed its seventh securitization which resulted in the transfer of $56,073,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2016-1 Trust.

The Class A and Class B notes received an “A” and “BBB+” rating by S&P, respectively, and the final maturity date of the notes is February 2042. The Class A and Class B notes bear interest at a rate of 1 month LIBOR plus 3.0% and 4.25%, respectively.
In December 2017, NSBF completed its eighth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $76,188,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2017-1 Trust.

The Class A and Class B notes bear interest at a rate of 1 month LIBOR plus 2.0% and 3.0%, respectively.
In October 2018, the 2013-1 Trust was terminated as a result of NSBF purchasing the 2013-1 Trust assets, with the 2013-1 Trust’s noteholders receiving the redemption price. Certain of the 2013-1 Trust’s assets were subsequently transferred to the 2018-1 Trust.
In November 2018, NSBF completed its ninth securitization which resulted in the transfer of $108,551,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans to the 2018-1 Trust. The 2018-1 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $108,551,000, consisting of $82,876,000 Class A notes and $25,675,000 of Class B notes, against the assets in a private placement.

NOTE 10-FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS:
The financial highlights for the Company are as follows:
(1) Based on actual number of shares outstanding at the end of the corresponding period or the weighted average shares outstanding for the period, unless otherwise noted, as appropriate.
(2) Total return based on market value is calculated based on the purchase of stock at the current market price on the first day and a sale at the current market price on the last day of each period reported and assumes reinvestment of dividends at prices obtained by the Company's DRIP plan during the period. The return does not reflect any sales load that may be paid by an investor.
(3) Total return based on change in NAV is calculated using the change in net asset value plus dividends to stockholders during the period, divided by the beginning net asset value.
(4) Includes the impact of the different share amounts as a result of calculating certain per share data based on weighted average shares outstanding during the period and certain per share data based on shares outstanding as of a period end or transaction date.
(5) Calculated based on the amount of senior securities outstanding at period end.
(6) Portfolio turnover is calculated by dividing (a) the lesser of purchases or sales of portfolio securities by (b) the average total
investments at fair value. The calculation includes PPP loan activity beginning in 2020.
(7) The Company converted to a BDC on November 12, 2014 and therefore a partial period is shown through December 31, 2014.
NOTE 11-STOCK BASED COMPENSATION:
Stock Plan
The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plan using the fair value method, as prescribed by ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Accordingly, for restricted stock awards, the Company measured the grant date fair value based upon the market price of its common stock on the date of the grant and amortizes the fair value of the awards as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting term.
The Board approves the issuance of shares of restricted stock to employees and directors pursuant to the Equity Incentive Plan. These shares generally vest over a one to three year period from the grant date. The fair value is expensed over the service period, starting on the grant date. The following table summarizes the restricted stock issuances under the Equity Incentive Plan, net of shares forfeited, if any, and the remaining shares of restricted stock available for issuance as of December 31, 2020.
(1) A maximum of 20% of total shares of common stock issued and outstanding, calculated on a fully diluted basis, not to exceed 3,000,000 shares, are available for awards of restricted stock and stock options under the Equity Incentive Plan.

The following table summarizes the calculations for the net increase in net assets resulting from operations per common share for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
NOTE 14-LEASES:
Under ASC 842, operating lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The Company has entered into operating lease agreements for office space with remaining contractual terms up to 6 years, some of which include renewal options that extend the leases for up to 10 years. These renewal options are not considered in the remaining lease term unless it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise such options. The operating lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.
As the rate implicit in the leases generally is not readily determinable for our operating leases, the discount rates used to determine the present value of our lease liability are based on our incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date and commensurate with the remaining lease term. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and are excluded from our weighted-average remaining lease term.
The following table summarizes supplemental cash flow and other information related to our operating leases:
The following table represents the maturity of the Company’s operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020:

NOTE 16-BENEFIT PLANS:
Defined Contribution Plan
The Company’s employees participate in a defined contribution 401(k) plan (the “Plan”) adopted in 2004 which covers substantially all employees based on eligibility. The Plan is designed to encourage savings on the part of eligible employees and qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Code. Under the Plan, eligible employees may elect to have a portion of their pay, including overtime and bonuses, reduced each pay period, as pre-tax contributions up to the maximum allowed by law. The Company may elect to make a matching contribution equal to a specified percentage of the participant’s contribution, on their behalf as a pre-tax contribution. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company matched 50% of the
first 2% of employee contributions, resulting in $73,000, $131,000 and $126,000 in expense, respectively.
NOTE 17-INCOME TAXES:
As a RIC, the Company must distribute substantially all of its respective net taxable income each tax year as dividends to its shareholders. Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax has been made in the financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Dividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal tax regulations, which may differ from amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and those differences could be material. These book-to-tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature.
