REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of
Starwood Property Trust, Inc.
Opinion on the Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Starwood Property Trust, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the "financial statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2020 the Company has changed its method of accounting for expected credit losses due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326, Financial Instruments − Credit Losses.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matter
The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.
Investment Securities - Valuation of Level III Residential Mortgage Backed Securities and Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities - Refer to Notes 6 and 20 to the consolidated financial statements
Critical Audit Matter Description
The Company has commercial mortgage backed securities recorded in accordance with the fair value option and residential mortgage backed securities, available-for-sale recorded at fair value that are not actively traded and whose fair values are derived from proprietary pricing models that utilize unobservable inputs, market bids, other third-party prices or quotes. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, these financial instruments are generally classified as Level 3 assets. Management’s judgments in selecting the price estimate that is most reflective of fair value is inherently subjective.
Performing audit procedures to evaluate the appropriateness of these fair values requires a high degree of auditor judgement and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists who possess significant quantitative and modeling expertise.
How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit
Our audit procedures related to management’s fair value estimates for Level 3 assets, included the following, among others:
●We tested the effectiveness of controls, including those controls relating to investment security metrics and characteristics, pricing sources, pricing policy and pricing selection.
●With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we developed independent fair value estimates for selected investment securities and compared our estimates to management’s estimates.
●We evaluated the differences between our estimates of fair value and management’s estimates and considered whether there were any indicators of management bias.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of
Starwood Property Trust, Inc.
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Starwood Property Trust. Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedules and included an explanatory paragraph regarding the Company’s adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
As of December 31, 2020
1. Business and Organization
Starwood Property Trust, Inc. (“STWD” and, together with its subsidiaries, “we” or the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation that commenced operations in August 2009, upon the completion of our initial public offering. We are focused primarily on originating, acquiring, financing and managing mortgage loans and other real estate investments in both the United States (“U.S.”) and Europe. As market conditions change over time, we may adjust our strategy to take advantage of changes in interest rates and credit spreads as well as economic and credit conditions.
We have four reportable business segments as of December 31, 2020 and we refer to the investments within these segments as our target assets:
●Real estate commercial and residential lending (the “Commercial and Residential Lending Segment”)-engages primarily in originating, acquiring, financing and managing commercial first mortgages, non-agency residential mortgages (“residential loans”), subordinated mortgages, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and other real estate and real estate-related debt investments in both the U.S. and Europe (including distressed or non-performing loans). Our residential loans are secured by a first mortgage lien on residential property and consist of non-agency residential mortgage loans that are not guaranteed by any U.S. Government agency or federally chartered corporation.
●Infrastructure lending (the “Infrastructure Lending Segment”)-engages primarily in originating, acquiring, financing and managing infrastructure debt investments.
●Real estate property (the “Property Segment”)-engages primarily in acquiring and managing equity interests in stabilized commercial real estate properties, including multifamily properties and commercial properties subject to net leases, that are held for investment.
●Real estate investing and servicing (the “Investing and Servicing Segment”)-includes (i) a servicing business in the U.S. that manages and works out problem assets, (ii) an investment business that selectively acquires and manages unrated, investment grade and non-investment grade rated CMBS, including subordinated interests of securitization and resecuritization transactions, (iii) a mortgage loan business which originates conduit loans for the primary purpose of selling these loans into securitization transactions and (iv) an investment business that selectively acquires commercial real estate assets, including properties acquired from CMBS trusts.
Our segments exclude the consolidation of securitization variable interest entities (“VIEs”).
We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). As such, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on that portion of our net income that is distributed to stockholders if we distribute at least 90% of our taxable income to our stockholders by prescribed dates and comply with various other requirements.
We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our various wholly-owned subsidiaries. We are externally managed and advised by SPT Management, LLC (our “Manager”) pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. Our Manager is controlled by Barry Sternlicht, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our Manager is an affiliate of Starwood Capital Group, a privately-held private equity firm founded by Mr. Sternlicht.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Balance Sheet Presentation of Securitization Variable Interest Entities
We operate investment businesses that acquire unrated, investment grade and non-investment grade rated CMBS and RMBS. These securities represent interests in securitization structures (commonly referred to as special purpose entities, or “SPEs”). These SPEs are structured as pass through entities that receive principal and interest on the underlying collateral and distribute those payments to the certificate holders. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), SPEs typically qualify as VIEs. These are entities that, by design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.
Because we often serve as the special servicer or servicing administrator of the trusts in which we invest, or we have the ability to remove and replace the special servicer without cause, consolidation of these structures is required pursuant to GAAP as outlined in detail below. This results in a consolidated balance sheet which presents the gross assets and liabilities of the VIEs. The assets and other instruments held by these VIEs are restricted and can only be used to fulfill the obligations of the entity. Additionally, the obligations of the VIEs do not have any recourse to the general credit of any other consolidated entities, nor to us as the consolidator of these VIEs.
The VIE liabilities initially represent investment securities on our balance sheet (pre-consolidation). Upon consolidation of these VIEs, our associated investment securities are eliminated, as is the interest income related to those securities. Similarly, the fees we earn in our roles as special servicer of the bonds issued by the consolidated VIEs or as collateral administrator of the consolidated VIEs are also eliminated. Finally, a portion of the identified servicing intangible associated with the eliminated fee streams is eliminated in consolidation.
Refer to the segment data in Note 23 for a presentation of our business segments without consolidation of these VIEs.
Basis of Accounting and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our consolidated subsidiaries and VIEs. Intercompany amounts have been eliminated in consolidation.
Entities not deemed to be VIEs are consolidated if we own a majority of the voting securities or interests or hold the general partnership interest, except in those instances in which the minority voting interest owner or limited partner can remove us as general partner without cause, dissolve the partnership without cause or effectively participate through substantive participative rights. Substantive participative rights include the ability to select, terminate and set compensation of the investee’s management, if applicable, and the ability to participate in capital and operating decisions of the investee, including budgets, in the ordinary course of business.
We invest in entities with varying structures, many of which do not have voting securities or interests, such as general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability companies. In many of these structures, control of the entity rests with the general partners or managing members, while other members hold passive interests. The general partner or managing member may hold anywhere from a relatively small percentage of the total financial interests to a majority of the financial interests. For entities not deemed to be VIEs, where we serve as the sole general partner or managing member, we are considered to have the controlling financial interest and therefore the entity is consolidated, regardless of our financial interest percentage, unless there are other limited partners or investing members that can remove us as general partner without cause, dissolve the partnership without cause or effectively participate through substantive participative rights. In those circumstances where we, as majority controlling interest owner, can be removed without cause or cannot cause the entity to take actions that are significant in the ordinary course of business, because such actions could be vetoed by the minority controlling interest owner, we do not consolidate the entity.
When we consolidate entities other than securitization VIEs, the third party ownership interests are reflected as non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, a separate component of equity, in our consolidated balance sheet. When we consolidate securitization VIEs, the third party ownership interests are reflected as VIE liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet because the beneficial interests payable to these third parties are legally issued in the form of debt. Our presentation of net income attributes earnings to controlling and non-controlling interests.
Variable Interest Entities
In addition to the securitization VIEs, we have financed a pool of our loans through a collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) which is considered a VIE. We also hold interests in certain other entities which are considered VIEs as the limited partners of those entities with equity at risk do not collectively possess (i) the right to remove the general partner or dissolve the partnership without cause or (ii) the right to participate in significant decisions made by the partnership.
We evaluate all of our interests in VIEs for consolidation. When our interests are determined to be variable interests, we assess whether we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE. Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation, defines the primary beneficiary as the party that has both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the VIE which could be potentially significant. We consider our variable interests as well as any variable interests of our related parties in making this determination. Where both of these factors are present, we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and we consolidate the VIE. Where either one of these factors is not present, we are not the primary beneficiary and do not consolidate the VIE.
To assess whether we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, we consider all facts and circumstances, including our role in establishing the VIE and our ongoing rights and responsibilities. This assessment includes: (i) identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (ii) identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. The right to remove the decision maker in a VIE must be exercisable without cause for the decision maker to not be deemed the party that has the power to direct the activities of a VIE.
To assess whether we have the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, we consider all of our economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees and other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment requires that we apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE, including its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by us.
Our purchased investment securities include unrated and non-investment grade rated securities issued by securitization trusts. In certain cases, we may contract to provide special servicing activities for these trusts, or, as holder of the controlling class, we may have the right to name and remove the special servicer for these trusts. In our role as special servicer, we provide services on defaulted loans within the trusts, such as foreclosure or work-out procedures, as permitted by the underlying contractual agreements. In exchange for these services, we receive a fee. These rights give us the ability to direct activities that could significantly impact the trust’s economic performance. However, in those instances where an unrelated third party has the right to unilaterally remove us as special servicer without cause, we do not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the trust’s economic performance. We evaluated all of our positions in such investments for consolidation.
For securitization VIEs in which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary, all of the underlying assets, liabilities and equity of the structures are recorded on our books, and the initial investment, along with any associated unrealized holding gains and losses, are eliminated in consolidation. Similarly, the interest income earned from these
structures, as well as the fees paid by these trusts to us in our capacity as special servicer, are eliminated in consolidation. Further, a portion of the identified servicing intangible asset associated with the servicing fee streams, and the corresponding amortization or change in fair value of the servicing intangible asset, are also eliminated in consolidation.
We perform ongoing reassessments of: (i) whether any entities previously evaluated under the majority voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework, and (ii) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding our involvement with a VIE causes our consolidation conclusion regarding the VIE to change.
We elect the fair value option for initial and subsequent recognition of the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization VIEs. Interest income and interest expense associated with these VIEs are no longer relevant on a standalone basis because these amounts are already reflected in the fair value changes. We have elected to present these items in a single line on our consolidated statements of operations. The residual difference shown on our consolidated statements of operations in the line item “Change in net assets related to consolidated VIEs” represents our beneficial interest in the VIEs.
We separately present the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization VIEs as individual line items on our consolidated balance sheets. The liabilities of our consolidated securitization VIEs consist solely of obligations to the bondholders of the related trusts, and are thus presented as a single line item entitled “VIE liabilities.” The assets of our consolidated securitization VIEs consist principally of loans, but at times, also include foreclosed loans which have been temporarily converted into real estate owned (“REO”). These assets in the aggregate are likewise presented as a single line item entitled “VIE assets.”
Loans comprise the vast majority of our securitization VIE assets and are carried at fair value due to the election of the fair value option. When an asset becomes REO, it is due to non-performance of the loan. Because the loan is already at fair value, the carrying value of an REO asset is also initially at fair value. Furthermore, when we consolidate a trust, any existing REO would be consolidated at fair value. Once an asset becomes REO, its disposition time is relatively short. As a result, the carrying value of an REO generally approximates fair value under GAAP.
In addition to sharing a similar measurement method as the loans in a trust, the securitization VIE assets as a whole can only be used to settle the obligations of the consolidated VIE. The assets of our securitization VIEs are not individually accessible by the bondholders, which creates inherent limitations from a valuation perspective. Also creating limitations from a valuation perspective is our role as special servicer, which provides us very limited visibility, if any, into the performing loans of a trust.
REO assets generally represent a very small percentage of the overall asset pool of a trust. In new issue trusts there are no REO assets. We estimate that REO assets constitute approximately 1% of our consolidated securitization VIE assets, with the remaining 99% representing loans. However, it is important to note that the fair value of our securitization VIE assets is determined by reference to our securitization VIE liabilities as permitted under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-13, Consolidation (Topic 810): Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity. In other words, our VIE liabilities are more reliably measurable than the VIE assets, resulting in our current measurement methodology which utilizes this value to determine the fair value of our securitization VIE assets as a whole. As a result, these percentages are not necessarily indicative of the relative fair values of each of these asset categories if the assets were to be valued individually.
Due to our accounting policy election under ASU 2014-13, separately presenting two different asset categories would result in an arbitrary assignment of value to each, with one asset category representing a residual amount, as opposed to its fair value. However, as a pool, the fair value of the assets in total is equal to the fair value of the liabilities.
For these reasons, the assets of our securitization VIEs are presented in the aggregate.
Fair Value Option
The guidance in ASC 825, Financial Instruments, provides a fair value option election that allows entities to make an irrevocable election of fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain eligible financial assets and liabilities. Unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings. The decision to elect the fair value option is determined on an instrument by instrument basis and must be applied to an entire instrument and is irrevocable once elected. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value pursuant to this guidance are required to be reported separately in our consolidated balance sheets from those instruments using another accounting method.
We have elected the fair value option for certain eligible financial assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization VIEs, residential loans held-for-investment, loans held-for-sale originated or acquired for future securitization and purchased CMBS issued by VIEs we could consolidate in the future. The fair value elections for VIE and securitization related items were made in order to mitigate accounting mismatches between the carrying value of the instruments and the related assets and liabilities that we consolidate at fair value. The fair value elections for residential loans held-for-investment were made in order to maintain consistency across all our residential loans. The fair value elections for mortgage loans held-for-sale were made due to the expected short-term holding period of these instruments.
Fair Value Measurements
We measure our mortgage-backed securities, derivative assets and liabilities, domestic servicing rights intangible asset and any assets or liabilities where we have elected the fair value option at fair value. When actively quoted observable prices are not available, we either use implied pricing from similar assets and liabilities or valuation models based on net present values of estimated future cash flows, adjusted as appropriate for liquidity, credit, market and/or other risk factors.
As discussed above, we measure the assets and liabilities of consolidated securitization VIEs at fair value pursuant to our election of the fair value option. The securitization VIEs in which we invest are “static”; that is, no reinvestment is permitted, and there is no active management of the underlying assets. In determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the securitization VIEs, we maximize the use of observable inputs over unobservable inputs. Refer to Note 20 for further discussion regarding our fair value measurements.
Business Combinations
Under ASC 805, Business Combinations, the acquirer in a business combination must recognize, with certain exceptions, the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests when the acquisition constitutes a change in control of the acquired entity. As goodwill is calculated as a residual, all goodwill of the acquired business, not just the acquirer’s share, is recognized under this “full goodwill” approach. During the measurement period, a period which shall not exceed one year, we prospectively adjust the provisional amounts recognized to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized.
We apply the asset acquisition provisions of ASC 805 in accounting for acquisitions of real estate with in-place leases where substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired is concentrated in either a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. This results in the acquired properties being recognized initially at their purchase price inclusive of acquisition costs, which are capitalized. All other acquisitions of real estate with in-place leases are accounted for in accordance with the business combination provisions of ASC 805. We also apply the asset acquisition provisions of ASC 805 for acquired real estate assets where a lease is entered into concurrently with the acquisition of the asset, such as in sale leaseback transactions.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and short-term investments. Short-term investments are comprised of highly liquid instruments with original maturities of three months or less. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in multiple financial institutions and at times these balances exceed federally insurable limits.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash includes cash and cash equivalents that are legally or contractually restricted as to withdrawal or usage and primarily includes (i) cash collateral associated with derivative financial instruments, (ii) loan payments received by our Infrastructure Lending Segment which are restricted by our lender and periodically applied, in part, to the outstanding balance of the Infrastructure Lending debt facility and (iii) funds held on behalf of borrowers and tenants.
Loans Held-for-Investment
Loans that are held for investment (“HFI”) are carried at cost, net of unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs, as applicable, and net of credit loss allowances as discussed below, unless we have elected to apply the fair value option at purchase.
Loans Held-For-Sale
Our loans that we intend to sell or liquidate in the short-term are classified as held-for-sale and are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, unless we have elected to apply the fair value option at origination or purchase. We periodically enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge unpredictable changes in fair value of loans held-for-sale, including changes resulting from both interest rates and credit quality. Because these derivatives are not designated, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings. In order to best reflect the results of the hedged loan portfolio in earnings, we have elected the fair value option for these loans. As a result, changes in the fair value of the loans are also recorded in earnings.
Investment Securities
We designate our debt investment securities as held-to-maturity (“HTM”), available-for-sale (“AFS”), or trading depending on our investment strategy and ability to hold such securities to maturity. HTM debt securities where we have not elected to apply the fair value option are stated at cost plus any premiums or discounts, which are amortized or accreted through the consolidated statements of operations using the effective interest method. Debt securities we (i) do not hold for the purpose of selling in the near-term, or (ii) may dispose of prior to maturity, are classified as AFS and are carried at fair value in the accompanying financial statements. Unrealized gains or losses on AFS debt securities where we have not elected the fair value option are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) in stockholders’ equity. Our HTM and AFS debt securities are also subject to credit loss allowances as discussed below.
Our only equity investment security is carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in earnings.
Credit Losses
Loans and Debt Securities Measured at Amortized Cost
ASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, became effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. ASC 326 mandates the use of a current expected credit loss model (“CECL”) for estimating future credit losses of certain financial instruments measured at amortized cost, instead of the “incurred loss” credit model previously required under GAAP. The CECL model requires the consideration of possible credit losses over the life of an instrument as opposed to only estimating credit losses upon the occurrence of a discrete loss event under the previous “incurred loss”
methodology. The CECL model applies to our HFI loans and HTM debt securities which are carried at amortized cost, including future funding commitments and accrued interest receivable related to those loans and securities. However, as permitted by ASC 326, we have elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable (which is classified separately on our consolidated balance sheet), but rather write off in a timely manner by reversing interest income and/or cease accruing interest that would likely be uncollectible. Our adoption of the CECL model resulted in a $32.3 million increase to our total allowance for credit losses, which was recognized as a cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2020.
As we do not have a history of realized credit losses on our HFI loans and HTM securities, we have subscribed to third party database services to provide us with historical industry losses for both commercial real estate and infrastructure loans. Using these losses as a benchmark, we determine expected credit losses for our loans and securities on a collective basis within our commercial real estate and infrastructure portfolios. See Note 5 for further discussion of our methodologies.
We also evaluate each loan and security measured at amortized cost for credit deterioration at least quarterly. Credit deterioration occurs when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan or security. If a loan or security is considered to be credit deteriorated, we depart from the industry loss rate approach described above and determine the credit loss allowance as any excess of the amortized cost basis of the loan or security over (i) the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the contractual effective interest rate or (ii) the fair value of the collateral, if repayment is expected solely from the collateral.
Available-for-Sale Debt Securities
Separate provisions of ASC 326 apply to our AFS debt securities, which are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of AOCI. We are required to establish an initial credit loss allowance for those securities that are purchased with credit deterioration (“PCD”) by grossing up the amortized cost basis of each security and providing an offsetting credit loss allowance for the difference between expected cash flows and contractual cash flows, both on a present value basis. As of the January 1, 2020 effective date, no such credit loss allowance gross-up was required on our AFS debt securities with PCD due to their individual unrealized gain positions as of that date.
Subsequently, cumulative adverse changes in expected cash flows on our AFS debt securities are recognized currently as an increase to the allowance for credit losses. However, the allowance is limited to the amount by which the AFS debt security’s amortized cost exceeds its fair value. Favorable changes in expected cash flows are first recognized as a decrease to the allowance for credit losses (recognized currently in earnings). Such changes would be recognized as a prospective yield adjustment only when the allowance for credit losses is reduced to zero. A change in expected cash flows that is attributable solely to a change in a variable interest reference rate does not result in a credit loss and is accounted for as a prospective yield adjustment.
Properties Held-For-Investment
Properties, net, as reported on our consolidated balance sheets, consist of commercial real estate properties held-for-investment and are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairments, if any. Properties consist primarily of land, buildings and improvements. Land is not depreciated, and buildings and improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred; major replacements and betterments are capitalized and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We review properties for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the property to the undiscounted future net cash flows it is expected to generate. If such carrying amount exceeds the expected undiscounted future net cash flows, we adjust the carrying amount of the property to its estimated fair value.
Properties Held-For-Sale
Properties and any associated intangible assets are presented within properties held-for-sale on our consolidated balance sheet when the sale of the property is considered probable, at which time we cease depreciation and amortization of the property and the associated intangibles. Held-for-sale properties are reported at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. There were no properties held-for-sale at December 31, 2020 or 2019.
Servicing Rights Intangibles
Our identifiable intangible assets include domestic special servicing rights for which we have elected to apply the fair value measurement method, which is necessary to conform to our election of the fair value option for measuring the assets and liabilities of the VIEs consolidated pursuant to ASC 810.
Lease Intangibles
In connection with our acquisition of properties, we recognize intangible lease assets and liabilities associated with certain noncancelable operating leases of the acquired properties. These intangible lease assets and liabilities include in-place lease intangible assets, favorable lease intangible assets and unfavorable lease liabilities. In-place lease intangible assets reflect the acquired benefit of purchasing properties with in-place leases and are measured based on estimates of direct costs associated with leasing the property and lost rental income during projected lease-up and free rent periods, both of which are avoided due to the presence of in-place leases at the acquisition date. Favorable and unfavorable lease intangible assets and liabilities reflect the terms of in-place tenant leases being either favorable or unfavorable relative to market terms at the acquisition date. The estimated fair values of our favorable and unfavorable lease assets and liabilities at the respective acquisition dates represent the discounted cash flow differential between the contractual cash flows of such leases and the estimated cash flows that comparable leases at market terms would generate. Our intangible lease assets and liabilities are recognized within intangible assets and other liabilities, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. Our in-place lease intangible assets are amortized to amortization expense while our favorable and unfavorable lease intangible assets and liabilities where we are the lessor are amortized to rental income. Both our favorable and unfavorable lease intangible assets and liabilities are amortized over the remaining noncancelable term of the respective leases on a straight-line basis.
Leases
On January 1, 2019, ASC 842, Leases, became effective for the Company. ASC 842 establishes a right-of-use model for lessee accounting which results in the recognition of most leased assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet of the lessee. Lessor accounting was not significantly affected by this ASC. We elected to apply the provisions of ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 and not to retrospectively adjust prior periods presented. Such application did not result in any cumulative-effect adjustment as of January 1, 2019. We elected the “package of practical expedients” for transition purposes, which permits us not to reassess under the new standard our prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs for leases that commenced prior to January 1, 2019. We also elected not to apply the recognition provisions of ASC 842 to short-term leases, which have original lease terms of 12 months or less. As a lessor, we elected not to separate nonlease components, such as reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance (“CAM”), from lease components for all classes of underlying assets, and continue to recognize such nonlease components ratably in rental income. We also elected to continue to exclude from rental income all sales, use and other similar taxes collected from lessees. As required by ASC 842, we no longer record as revenues and expenses lessor costs (such as property taxes) paid directly by the lessees. The application of ASC 842 has had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements, as all of our leases, as both lessor and lessee, are currently classified as operating leases, which are subject to essentially the same straight-line revenue and expense recognition as in the past. As a lessee, our only significant long-term lease as of January 1, 2019 resulted in the recognition of a $12.0 million lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset, which are classified within “Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities” and “Other assets”, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Investment in Unconsolidated Entities
We own non-controlling equity interests in various privately-held partnerships and limited liability companies. Unless we elect the fair value option under ASC 825, we use the fair value practicability election described below to account for investments in which our interest is so minor that we have virtually no influence over the underlying investees. We use the equity method to account for all other non-controlling interests in partnerships and limited liability companies. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of income or loss, as well as contributions made or distributions received.
Our other equity investments set forth in Note 8 do not have readily determinable fair values. Therefore, we have elected the fair value practicability exception under ASC 321, Equity Securities, whereby we measure those investments within its scope at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus observable price changes from orderly transactions of identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Our investment in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) stock, which is not within the scope of ASC 321, is carried at cost less any impairment.
We review our equity method and other investments not subject to the fair value practicability election for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For our investments under the fair value practicability election, we perform a qualitative assessment to identify impairment at the end of each reporting period. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods, estimated fair values of underlying assets and available information at the time the analyses are prepared.
Goodwill
Goodwill is not amortized, but rather tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment. Goodwill at December 31, 2020 represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with the acquisitions of LNR Property LLC (“LNR”) in April 2013 and the Infrastructure Lending Segment in September 2018 and October 2018.
In testing goodwill for impairment, we follow ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, which permits a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill. If the qualitative assessment determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, then no impairment is determined to exist for the reporting unit. However, if the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill, or we choose not to perform the qualitative assessment, then we compare the fair value of that reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. ASU 2017-04, Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) - Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, became effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. This ASU specifies that if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is considered impaired with the impairment loss measured as the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying value (inclusive of goodwill) over its fair value, eliminating the requirement that all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit be remeasured individually in connection with measurement of goodwill impairment.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities
We record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and have satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting under GAAP. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We regularly enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of our risks, even though the
transactions may not qualify for, or we may not elect to pursue, hedge accounting. In such cases, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in earnings.
Generally, our derivatives are subject to master netting arrangements, though we elect to present all derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis within our consolidated balance sheets.
Convertible Senior Notes
ASC 470, Debt, requires the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion to be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects the issuer’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. ASC 470-20 requires that the initial proceeds from the sale of these notes be allocated between a liability component and an equity component in a manner that reflects interest expense at the interest rate of similar nonconvertible debt that could have been issued by the Company at such time. The equity components of our convertible senior notes (the “Convertible Notes”) have been reflected within additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets. The resulting debt discount is being amortized over the period during which the convertible senior notes are expected to be outstanding (the maturity date) as additional non-cash interest expense.
Upon settlement of convertible debt instruments, ASC 470-20 requires the issuer to allocate total settlement consideration, inclusive of transaction costs, amongst the liability and equity components of the instrument based on the fair value of the liability component immediately prior to repurchase. The difference between the settlement consideration allocated to the liability component and the net carrying value of the liability component, including unamortized debt issuance costs, is recognized as gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statements of operations. The remaining settlement consideration allocated to the equity component is recognized as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets.
Revenue Recognition
Interest Income
Interest income on performing loans and financial instruments is accrued based on the outstanding principal amount and contractual terms of the instrument. For loans where we do not elect the fair value option, origination fees and direct loan origination costs are also recognized in interest income over the loan term as a yield adjustment using the effective interest method. When we elect the fair value option, origination fees and direct loan costs are recorded directly in income and are not deferred. Discounts or premiums associated with the purchase of non-performing loans and investment securities are amortized or accreted into interest income as a yield adjustment on the effective interest method, based on expected cash flows through the expected maturity date of the investment. On at least a quarterly basis, we review and, if appropriate, make adjustments to our cash flow projections.
We cease accruing interest on non-performing loans at the earlier of (i) the loan becoming significantly past due or (ii) management concluding that a full recovery of all interest and principal is doubtful. Interest income on non-accrual loans in which management expects a full recovery of the loan’s outstanding principal balance is only recognized when received in cash. If a full recovery of principal is doubtful, the cost recovery method is applied whereby any cash received is applied to the outstanding principal balance of the loan. A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status at such time as the loan becomes contractually current and management believes all future principal and interest will be received according to the contractual loan terms.
For loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality, interest income is only recognized to the extent that our estimate of undiscounted expected principal and interest exceeds our investment in the loan. Such excess, if any, is recognized as interest income on a level-yield basis over the life of the loan.
Upon the sale of loans or securities which are not accounted for pursuant to the fair value option, the excess (or deficiency) of net proceeds over the net carrying value of such loans or securities is recognized as a realized gain (loss).
Servicing Fees
We typically seek to be the special servicer on CMBS transactions in which we invest. When we are appointed to serve in this capacity, we earn special servicing fees from the related activities performed, which consist primarily of overseeing the workout of under-performing and non-performing loans underlying the CMBS transactions. These fees are recognized in income in the period in which the services are performed and the revenue recognition criteria have been met.
Rental Income
Rental income is recognized when earned from tenants. For leases that provide rent concessions or fixed escalations over the lease term, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the noncancelable term of the lease. In net lease arrangements, costs reimbursable from tenants are recognized in rental income in the period in which the related expenses are incurred as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services for property operations. In instances where the tenant is responsible for property maintenance and repairs and contracts and settles such costs directly with third party service providers, we do not reflect those expenses in our consolidated statement of operations as the tenant is the primary obligor.
Securitizations, Sales and Financing Arrangements
We periodically sell our financial assets, such as commercial mortgage loans, residential loans, CMBS, RMBS and other assets. In connection with these transactions, we may retain or acquire senior or subordinated interests in the related assets. Gains and losses on such transactions are recognized in accordance with ASC 860, Transfers and Servicing, which is based on a financial components approach that focuses on control. Under this approach, after a transfer of financial assets that meets the criteria for treatment as a sale-legal isolation, ability of transferee to pledge or exchange the transferred assets without constraint, and transferred control-an entity recognizes the financial assets it retains and any liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes the financial assets it has sold, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished. We determine the gain or loss on sale of the assets by allocating the carrying value of the sold asset between the sold asset and the interests retained based on their relative fair values, as applicable. The gain or loss on sale is the difference between the cash proceeds from the sale and the amount allocated to the sold asset. If the sold asset is being accounted for pursuant to the fair value option, there is no gain or loss.
Deferred Financing Costs
Costs incurred in connection with debt issuance are capitalized and amortized to interest expense over the terms of the respective debt agreements. Such costs are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the related debt liability.
Acquisition and Investment Pursuit Costs
Costs incurred in connection with acquisitions of investments, loans and businesses, as well as in pursuing unsuccessful acquisitions and investments, are recorded within acquisition and investment pursuit costs in our consolidated statements of operations when incurred. Costs incurred in connection with acquisitions of real estate not accounted for as business combinations are capitalized within the purchase price. These costs reflect services performed by third parties and principally include due diligence and legal services.
Share-Based Payments
The fair value of the restricted stock (“RSAs”) or restricted stock units (“RSUs”) granted is recorded as expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for the award, with an offsetting increase in stockholders’ equity. For grants to employees and directors, the fair value is determined based upon the stock price on the grant date.
Effective July 1, 2018, we early adopted ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) -Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which aligns the accounting for nonemployee share-
based compensation with the existing accounting model for employee share based compensation. Prior to our adoption of ASU 2018-07, nonemployee share awards were recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award with the fair value of the award remeasured at each vesting date. After our adoption of ASU 2018-07, nonemployee share awards continue to be recorded as expense on a straight-line basis over their vesting period, however, the fair value of the award is only determined on the grant date and not remeasured at subsequent vesting dates, consistent with the accounting for employee share awards. For non-employee awards granted prior to our July 1, 2018 adoption date, the awards were remeasured at fair value as of our July 1, 2018 adoption date with no subsequent remeasurement.
Foreign Currency Translation
Our assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using foreign currency exchange rates at the end of the reporting period. Income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for each reporting period. The effects of translating the assets, liabilities and income of our foreign investments held by entities with a U.S. dollar functional currency are included in foreign currency gain (loss) in the consolidated statements of operations or other comprehensive income (“OCI”) for debt securities available-for-sale for which the fair value option has not been elected. The effects of translating the assets, liabilities and income of our foreign investments held by entities with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in OCI. Realized foreign currency gains and losses and changes in the value of foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in the determination of net income and are reported as foreign currency gain (loss) in our consolidated statements of operations.
Income Taxes
The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. The Company is subject to federal income taxation at corporate rates on its REIT taxable income, however, the Company is allowed a deduction for the amount of dividends paid to its stockholders in arriving at its REIT taxable income. As a result, distributed net income of the Company is subjected to taxation at the stockholder level only. The Company intends to continue operating in a manner that will permit it to maintain its qualification as a REIT for tax purposes.
Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets and recognizes a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, both positive and negative, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. When evaluating the realizability of its deferred tax assets, the Company considers, among other matters, estimates of expected future taxable income, nature of current and cumulative losses, existing and projected book/tax differences, tax planning strategies available, and the general and industry specific economic outlook. This realizability analysis is inherently subjective, as it requires the Company to forecast its business and general economic environment in future periods.
We recognize tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that, based on the technical merits of the tax position, the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized upon settlement. If, as a result of new events or information, a recognized tax position no longer is considered more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, a liability is established for the unrecognized benefit with a corresponding charge to income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations. We report interest and penalties, if any, related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.
Earnings Per Share
We present both basic and diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) amounts in our financial statements. Basic EPS excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the maximum potential dilution that could occur from (i) our share-based compensation, consisting of unvested RSAs and RSUs, (ii) shares contingently issuable to our Manager, (iii) the conversion options associated with our outstanding Convertible Notes (see Notes 11
and 18), and (iv) non-controlling interests that are redeemable with our common stock (see Note 17). Potential dilutive shares are excluded from the calculation if they have an anti-dilutive effect in the period.
Nearly all of the Company’s unvested RSUs and RSAs contain rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends and thus are participating securities. In addition, the non-controlling interests that are redeemable with our common stock are considered participating securities because they earn a preferred return indexed to the dividend rate on our common stock (see Note 17). Due to the existence of these participating securities, the two-class method of computing EPS is required, unless another method is determined to be more dilutive. Under the two-class method, undistributed earnings are reallocated between shares of common stock and participating securities. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the two-class method resulted in the most dilutive EPS calculation.
Concentration of Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash investments, CMBS, RMBS, loan investments and interest receivable. We may place cash investments in excess of insured amounts with high quality financial institutions. We perform an ongoing analysis of credit risk concentrations in our investment portfolio by evaluating exposure to various counterparties, markets, underlying property types, contract terms, tenant mix and other credit metrics.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant and subjective estimate that we make is the projection of cash flows we expect to receive on our investments, which has a significant impact on the amount of income that we record and/or disclose. In addition, the fair value of financial assets and liabilities that are estimated using a discounted cash flows method is significantly impacted by the rates at which we estimate market participants would discount the expected cash flows.
The outbreak of COVID-19 beginning in the first quarter of 2020 has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on economic and market conditions and trigger a period of global economic slowdown. The rapid development and fluidity of this situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate adverse impact of COVID-19 on economic and market conditions. We believe the estimates and assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements are reasonable and supportable based on the information available as of December 31, 2020. However, uncertainty over the ultimate impact COVID-19 will have on the global economy generally, and our business in particular, makes any estimates and assumptions as of December 31, 2020 inherently less certain than they would be absent the current and potential impacts of COVID-19. Actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates.
Recent Accounting Developments
On March 12, 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, and on January 11, 2021, issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Scope, both of which provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. These ASUs are effective through December 31, 2022. The Company has not adopted any of the optional expedients or exceptions through December 31, 2020, but will continue to evaluate the possible adoption of any such expedients or exceptions during the effective period as circumstances evolve.
On August 5, 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging- Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which removes certain separation models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock that require the separation into a debt component and an equity or derivative component. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost and a convertible preferred stock will be accounted for as a single equity instrument measured at its historical cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives
and the convertible instruments are not issued with substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. By removing those separation models, the interest rate of convertible debt instruments typically will be closer to the coupon interest rate. ASU 2020-06 also revises the derivative scope exception for contracts in an entity’s own equity and improves the consistency of EPS calculations. This ASU is effective for larger public business entities’ annual periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2021. Early application is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We expect to early adopt this ASU effective January 1, 2021 through the modified retrospective method of transition, resulting in a cumulative adjustment to our beginning stockholders’ equity components as of that date related to our outstanding Convertible Notes. We do not expect the application of this ASU, including the cumulative adjustment upon adoption, to materially impact our consolidated financial statements.
3. Acquisitions and Divestitures
Investing and Servicing Segment Property Portfolio
During the year ended December 31, 2019, our Investing and Servicing Segment acquired $8.6 million in net assets of a commercial real estate property from a CMBS trust for a gross purchase price of $8.8 million. This property, aggregated with the controlling interests in 14 remaining commercial real estate properties acquired from CMBS trusts prior to December 31, 2018 for an aggregate acquisition price of $207.4 million, comprise the Investing and Servicing Segment Property Portfolio (the “REIS Equity Portfolio”). During the year ended December 31, 2018, our Investing and Servicing Segment acquired $52.7 million in net assets of three commercial real estate properties from CMBS trusts for a gross purchase price of $53.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we had no acquisitions of commercial real estate property. When the properties are acquired from CMBS trusts that are consolidated as VIEs on our balance sheet, the acquisitions are reflected as repayment of debt of consolidated VIEs in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold a property within the REIS Equity Portfolio for $24.1 million. In connection with this sale, we recognized a gain of $7.4 million within gain on sale of investments and other assets in our consolidated statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold four properties within the Investing and Servicing Segment for $145.9 million. In connection with these sales, we recognized a total gain of $59.7 million within gain on sale of investments and other assets in our consolidated statement of operations, of which $5.3 million was attributable to non-controlling interests. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold nine properties within the Investing and Servicing Segment for $77.9 million. In connection with these sales, we recognized a total gain of $26.6 million within gain on sale of investments and other assets in our consolidated statement of operations, of which $5.1 million was attributable to non-controlling interests. One of these properties was acquired by a third party which already held a $0.3 million non-controlling interest in the property.
Ireland Portfolio Sale
On December 23, 2019, we sold the U.S. entity which held the net assets related to our Ireland Portfolio, which was comprised of 11 office properties and one multifamily property all located in Dublin Ireland. The properties within the entity were sold for a gross purchase price of €530.0 million. After certain adjustments, including a €20.7 million tax withholding which was treated as a reduction of purchase price, the net purchase price was €507.6 million, plus estimated net working capital. In connection with the transaction, the buyer assumed our existing third party debt totaling €316.3 million. Our basis in these assets was €394.7 million, net of €67.5 million of accumulated depreciation. The resulting gain, after selling costs, was €108.0 (or $119.7) million. This amount was included within gain on sale of investments and other assets in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Upon receipt of the net proceeds from the sale, we unwound all of our foreign currency hedges related to this portfolio, which had a fair value of $16.6 million at the unwind date.
There were no properties sold within the Ireland Portfolio during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018.
Infrastructure Lending Segment
On September 19, 2018, we acquired the project finance origination, underwriting and capital markets business of GE Capital Global Holdings, LLC (“GE Capital”) for approximately $2.0 billion (the “Infrastructure Lending Segment”) and on October 15, 2018, we acquired two additional senior secured project finance loans from GE Capital for $147.1 million. In total, the business included $2.1 billion of funded senior secured project finance loans and investment securities and $466.3 million of unfunded lending commitments (the “Infrastructure Lending Portfolio”) which are secured primarily by natural gas and renewable power facilities. We utilized $1.7 billion in new financing in order to fund the acquisition.
The Company hired a team of professionals from GE Capital’s project finance division in connection with the acquisition to manage and expand the Infrastructure Lending Portfolio. Goodwill of $119.4 million was recognized in connection with the Infrastructure Lending Segment acquisition as the consideration paid exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired.
We applied the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations, in accounting for our acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment. In doing so, we recorded all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the respective acquisition dates.
Woodstar II Portfolio
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we acquired the final 19 properties of the 27 affordable housing communities comprising our “Woodstar II Portfolio”. The Woodstar II Portfolio in its entirety is comprised of 6,109 units concentrated primarily in Central and South Florida and is 100% occupied.
The 19 affordable housing communities acquired during the year ended December 31, 2018 consist of 4,369 units and were acquired for $438.1 million, including contingent consideration of $29.2 million (the “2018 Closing”). The properties acquired in the 2018 Closing were recognized initially at the purchase price of $408.9 million plus capitalized acquisition costs of $4.1 million. Government sponsored mortgage debt of $27.0 million with weighted average fixed annual interest rates of 3.06% and remaining weighted average terms of 27.5 years was assumed at closing. We financed a portion of the 2018 Closing utilizing new 10-year mortgage debt totaling $300.9 million with weighted average fixed annual interest rates of 3.82%.
In December 2017, we acquired eight of the affordable housing communities (the “2017 Closing”), which include 1,740 units, for $156.2 million, including contingent consideration of $10.8 million. We financed the 2017 Closing utilizing 10-year mortgage debt totaling $116.7 million with a fixed 3.81% interest rate.
We effectuated the Woodstar II Portfolio acquisitions via a contribution of the properties by third parties (the “Contributors”) to SPT Dolphin Intermediate LLC (“SPT Dolphin”), a newly-formed, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In exchange for the contribution, the Contributors received cash, Class A units of SPT Dolphin (the “Class A Units”) and rights to receive additional Class A Units if certain contingent events occur. The Class A unitholders have the right to redeem their Class A Units for consideration equal to the current share price of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis, with the consideration paid in either cash or the Company’s common stock, at the determination of the Company.
The 2018 Closing resulted in the Contributors receiving cash of $225.8 million, 7,403,731 Class A Units and rights to receive an additional 1,411,642 Class A Units if certain contingent events occur. In aggregate, the 2018 Closing and 2017 Closing have resulted in the Contributors receiving cash of $310.7 million, 10,183,505 Class A Units and rights to receive an additional 1,910,563 Class A Units if certain contingent events occur. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we issued 62,323, 120,926 and 1,727,314, respectively, of the total 1,910,563 contingent Class A Units to the Contributors. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, redemptions of 493,318 and 974,176, respectively, of the Class A Units were received and settled in common stock or cash. No redemptions of Class A Units occurred during the year ended December 31, 2018. In consolidation, the issued Class A Units are reflected as non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries on our consolidated balance sheets.
Since substantially all of the fair value of the properties acquired was concentrated in a group of similar identifiable assets, the Woodstar II Portfolio acquisitions were accounted for in accordance with the asset acquisition provisions of ASC 805.
Master Lease Portfolio
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold four retail properties and three industrial properties within the Master Lease Portfolio for $235.4 million, recognizing a gain on sale of $28.5 million within gain on sale of investments and other assets in our consolidated statement of operations. There were no properties sold within the Master Lease Portfolio during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Purchase Price Allocations of Business Combinations
We applied the business combination provisions of ASC 805 in accounting for our acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment. In doing so, we recorded all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the acquisition dates.
The following table summarizes the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition dates (amounts in thousands):
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed. This determination of goodwill resulting from the Infrastructure Lending Segment acquisition is as follows (amounts in thousands):
Pro Forma Operating Data (Unaudited)
The unaudited pro forma revenues and net income attributable to the Company for the year ended December 31, 2018, assuming the Infrastructure Lending Segment was acquired on January 1, 2018, are as follows (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):
4. Restricted Cash
A summary of our restricted cash as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (amounts in thousands):
5. Loans
Our loans held-for-investment are accounted for at amortized cost and our loans held-for-sale are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value, unless we have elected the fair value option for either. The following tables summarize our investments in mortgages and loans as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):
(1)Calculated using LIBOR or other applicable index rates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 for variable rate loans.
(2)Represents the WAL of each respective group of loans as of the respective balance sheet date. The WAL of each individual loan is calculated using amounts and timing of future principal payments, as projected at origination or acquisition.
(3)First mortgages include first mortgage loans and any contiguous mezzanine loan components because as a whole, the expected credit quality of these loans is more similar to that of a first mortgage loan. The application of this methodology resulted in mezzanine loans with carrying values of $877.3 million and $967.0 million being classified as first mortgages as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
(4)Subordinated mortgages include B-Notes and junior participation in first mortgages where we do not own the senior A-Note or senior participation. If we own both the A-Note and B-Note, we categorize the loan as a first mortgage loan.
(5)During the year ended December 31, 2020, $104.3 million of infrastructure loans held-for-sale were reclassified into loans held-for-investment and $174.6 million of infrastructure loans held-for-investment were reclassified into loans held-for-sale.
(6)During the year ended December 31, 2020, $575.3 million of residential loans held-for-investment were reclassified into loans held-for-sale. During the year ended December 31, 2019, $340.9 million of residential loans held-for-sale were reclassified into residential loans held-for-investment.
(7)Residential loans have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 27.9 years and 29.3 years as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company received distributions totaling $15.1 million from a profit participation in a mortgage loan that was repaid in 2016. The loan was secured by a retail and hospitality property located in the Times Square area of New York City. The profit participation is accounted for as a loan in accordance with the acquisition, development and construction accounting guidance within ASC 310-10, which resulted in distributions in excess of basis being recognized within interest income in our consolidated statements of operations. There were no distributions from profit participations received during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
As of December 31, 2020, our variable rate loans held-for-investment were as follows (dollars in thousands):
Credit Loss Allowances
As discussed in Note 2, we do not have a history of realized credit losses on our HFI loans and HTM securities, so we have subscribed to third party database services to provide us with industry losses for both commercial real estate and infrastructure loans. Using these losses as a benchmark, we determine expected credit losses for our loans and securities on a collective basis within our commercial real estate and infrastructure portfolios.
For our commercial loans, we utilize a loan loss model that is widely used among banks and commercial mortgage REITs and is marketed by a leading CMBS data analytics provider. It employs logistic regression to forecast expected losses at the loan level based on a commercial real estate loan securitization database that contains activity dating back to 1998. We provide specific loan-level inputs which include loan-to-stabilized-value (“LTV”) and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) metrics, as well as principal balances, property type, location, coupon, origination year,
term, subordination, expected repayment dates and future fundings. We also select from a group of independent five-year macroeconomic forecasts included in the model that are updated regularly based on current economic trends. We categorize the results by LTV range, which we consider the most significant indicator of credit quality for our commercial loans, as set forth in the credit quality indicator table below. A lower LTV ratio typically indicates a lower credit loss risk.
The macroeconomic forecasts do not differentiate among property types or asset classes. Instead, these forecasts reference general macroeconomic growth factors which apply broadly across all assets. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a more negative impact on certain property types, principally retail and hospitality, which have withstood extended government mandated closures, and more recently office, which is experiencing lower demand due to remote working arrangements. The broad macroeconomic forecasts do not account for such differentiation. Accordingly, we have selected a more adverse macroeconomic recovery forecast related to these property types in determining our credit loss allowance.
For our infrastructure loans, we utilize a database of historical infrastructure loan performance that is shared among a consortium of banks and other lenders and compiled by a major bond credit rating agency. The database is representative of industry-wide project finance activity dating back to 1983. We derive historical loss rates from the database filtered by industry, sub-industry, term and construction status for each of our infrastructure loans. Those historical loss rates reflect global economic cycles over a long period of time as well as average recovery rates. We categorize the results between the power and oil and gas industries, which we consider the most significant indicator of credit quality for our infrastructure loans, as set forth in the credit quality indicator table below.
As discussed in Note 2, we use a discounted cash flow or collateral value approach, rather than the industry loan loss approach described above, to determine credit loss allowances for any credit deteriorated loans.
We regularly evaluate the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower. Specifically, the collateral’s operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess (i) whether cash flow from operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan and/or (iii) the collateral’s liquidation value. We also evaluate the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower’s competency in managing and operating the collateral. In addition, we consider the overall economic environment, real estate or industry sector, and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. Such analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and finance personnel who utilize various data sources, including (i) periodic financial data such as property operating statements, occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrower’s exit plan, and capitalization and discount rates, (ii) site inspections and (iii) current credit spreads and discussions with market participants.
The significant credit quality indicators for our loans measured at amortized cost, which excludes loans held-for-sale, were as follows as of December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands):
As of December 31, 2020, we had credit deteriorated commercial loans with an amortized cost basis of $48.7 million, of which $29.0 million had no credit loss allowance. These loans were on nonaccrual status, with the cost recovery method of interest income recognition applied. In addition to these credit deteriorated loans, we had a $184.1 million commercial loan and $18.6 million of residential loans that were 90 days or greater past due at December 31, 2020. Any loans which are modified to provide for the deferral of interest are not considered past due and are accounted for in accordance with our revenue recognition policy on interest income.
The following table presents the activity in our credit loss allowance for funded loans and unfunded commitments (amounts in thousands):
(1)Primarily relates to the charge-off of the credit loss allowance relating to credit deteriorated first mortgage and contiguous mezzanine loans that were eliminated as a result of consolidating the net assets of the borrower entities upon exercising control over their pledged equity interests in October 2020.
(1)Included in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
(2)Represents amounts expected to be funded (see Note 22).
Loan Portfolio Activity
The activity in our loan portfolio was as follows (amounts in thousands):
(1)Represents accrued interest income on loans whose terms do not require current payment of interest.
(2)See Note 12 for additional disclosure on these transactions.
(3)Represents the net carrying value of credit deteriorated first mortgage and contiguous mezzanine loans related to a residential conversion project located in New York City that is eliminated as a result of consolidating the net assets of the borrower entities upon exercising control over their pledged equity interests in October 2020.
(4)Includes $176.6 million of residential loans transferred from VIE assets upon redemption of a consolidated RMBS trust.
6. Investment Securities
Investment securities were comprised of the following as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):
(1)Certain fair value option CMBS and RMBS are eliminated in consolidation against VIE liabilities pursuant to ASC 810.
(2)Includes $179.5 million and $186.6 million of non-controlling interests in the consolidated entities which hold certain of these CMBS as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Purchases, sales and principal collections for all investment securities were as follows (amounts in thousands):
(1)Represents RMBS and CMBS, fair value option amounts eliminated due to our consolidation of securitization VIEs. These amounts are reflected as issuance or repayment of debt of, or distributions from, consolidated VIEs in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
RMBS, Available-for-Sale
The Company classified all of its RMBS not eliminated in consolidation as available-for-sale as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. These RMBS are reported at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded in AOCI.
The tables below summarize various attributes of our investments in available-for-sale RMBS as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):
(1)Calculated using the December 31, 2020 one-month LIBOR rate of 0.144% for floating rate securities.
(2)Represents the remaining WAL of each respective group of securities as of the balance sheet date. The WAL of each individual security is calculated using projected amounts and projected timing of future principal payments.
As of December 31, 2020, approximately $144.9 million, or 86.6%, of RMBS were variable rate. We purchased all of the RMBS at a discount, a portion of which is accreted into income over the expected remaining life of the security. The majority of the income from this strategy is earned from the accretion of this accretable discount.
We have engaged a third party manager who specializes in RMBS to execute the trading of RMBS, the cost of which was $0.8 million, $1.5 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, recorded as management fees in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold RMBS for proceeds of $13.3 million and realized gross gains of $3.5 million using the specific identification cost method. There were no sales of RMBS during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
The following table presents the gross unrealized losses and estimated fair value of any available-for-sale securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded (amounts in thousands):
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were two securities and one security with unrealized losses reflected in the table above. After evaluating the securities and recording adjustments for credit losses, we concluded that the remaining unrealized losses reflected above were noncredit-related and would be recovered from the securities’ estimated future cash flows. We considered a number of factors in reaching this conclusion, including that we did not intend to sell the securities, it was not considered more likely than not that we would be forced to sell the securities prior to recovering our amortized cost, and there were no material credit events that would have caused us to otherwise conclude that we would not recover our cost. Credit losses are calculated by comparing (i) the estimated future cash flows of each security discounted at the yield determined as of the initial acquisition date or, if since revised, as of the last date previously revised, to (ii) our net amortized cost basis. Significant judgment is used in projecting cash flows for our non-agency RMBS. As a result, actual income and/or credit losses could be materially different from what is currently projected and/or reported.
CMBS and RMBS, Fair Value Option
As discussed in the “Fair Value Option” section of Note 2 herein, we elect the fair value option for certain CMBS and RMBS in an effort to eliminate accounting mismatches resulting from the current or potential consolidation of securitization VIEs. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value and unpaid principal balance of CMBS where we have elected the fair value option, excluding the notional value of interest-only securities and before consolidation of securitization VIEs, were $1.2 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value and unpaid principal balance of RMBS where we have elected the fair value option, excluding the notional value of interest-only securities and before consolidation of securitization VIEs, were $236.0 million and $142.1 million, respectively. The $1.4 billion total fair value balance of CMBS and RMBS represents our economic interests in these assets. However, as a result of our consolidation of securitization VIEs, the vast majority of this fair value (all except $19.5 million at December 31, 2020) is eliminated against VIE liabilities before arriving at our GAAP balance for fair value option investment securities.
As of December 31, 2020, $96.9 million of our CMBS were variable rate and none of our RMBS were variable rate.
HTM Debt Securities, Amortized Cost
The table below summarizes our investments in HTM debt securities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):
The following table presents the activity in our credit loss allowance for HTM debt securities (amounts in thousands):
The table below summarizes the maturities of our HTM debt securities by type as of December 31, 2020 (amounts in thousands):
Equity Security, Fair Value
During 2012, we acquired 9,140,000 ordinary shares from a related-party in Starwood European Real Estate Finance Limited (“SEREF”), a debt fund that is externally managed by an affiliate of our Manager and is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The fair value of the investment remeasured in USD was $11.2 million and $12.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, our shares represent an approximate 2% interest in SEREF.
7. Properties
Our properties are held within the following portfolios:
Woodstar I Portfolio
The Woodstar I Portfolio is comprised of 32 affordable housing communities with 8,948 units concentrated primarily in the Tampa, Orlando and West Palm Beach metropolitan areas. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we acquired 18 of the 32 affordable housing communities of the Woodstar I Portfolio with the final 14 communities acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Woodstar I Portfolio includes total gross properties and lease intangibles of $635.2 million and debt of $572.5 million as of December 31, 2020.

The Medical Office Portfolio includes total gross properties and lease intangibles of $760.2 million and debt of $592.4 million as of December 31, 2020.
Master Lease Portfolio
The Master Lease Portfolio is comprised of 16 retail properties geographically dispersed throughout the U.S., with more than 50% of the portfolio, by carrying value, located in Florida, Texas and Minnesota. These properties, which we acquired in September 2017, collectively comprise 1.9 million square feet and were leased back to the seller under corporate guaranteed master net lease agreements with initial terms of 24.6 years and periodic rent escalations. The Master Lease Portfolio includes total gross properties of $343.8 million and debt of $192.7 million as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of the Master Lease Portfolio.
Investing and Servicing Segment Property Portfolio
The REIS Equity Portfolio is comprised of 15 commercial real estate properties and one equity interest in an unconsolidated commercial real estate property which we acquired from CMBS trusts over the previous five years. The REIS Equity Portfolio includes total gross properties and lease intangibles of $269.5 million and debt of $192.8 million as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of the REIS Equity Portfolio.
The table below summarizes our properties held as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):
(1)Represents properties acquired through loan foreclosure or exercise of control over loan borrower pledged equity interests.
(2)Represents assets related to the borrower entity that we exercised control over. Refer to Note 5 for further detail.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold an operating property and an outparcel for $25.0 million. In connection with these sales, we recognized a total gain of $7.9 million within gain on sale of investments and other assets in our consolidated statement of operations, of which $0.1 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold $407.2 million of net property assets relating to the Ireland Portfolio. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion. Also during the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold four operating properties within the REIS Equity Portfolio for $145.9 million. In connection with these REIS Equity Portfolio sales, we recognized a total gain of $59.7 million within gain on sale of investments and other assets in our consolidated statement of operations, of which $5.3 million was attributable to non-controlling interests.
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold 16 operating properties for $313.3 million. In connection with these sales, we recognized a total gain of $55.1 million within gain on sale of investments and other assets in our consolidated statement of operations, of which $5.1 million was attributable to non-controlling interest. One of these properties was acquired by a third party which already held a $0.3 million non-controlling interest in the property.
Future rental payments due to us from tenants under existing non-cancellable operating leases for each of the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in thousands):
8. Investment in Unconsolidated Entities
The table below summarizes our investments in unconsolidated entities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):
(1)None of these investments are publicly traded and therefore quoted market prices are not available.
(2)Includes a $4.5 million subordinated loan as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019.
(3)During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received a capital distribution of $8.4 million, our equity interest was reduced to 4% and the carrying value was reduced to zero. During April 2020, we sold 37% of our equity interest for $10.3 million in cash, reducing our interest to 2%. In connection with the sale, we recognized a gain of $10.3 million. Because the sale represented an observable price change in an orderly transaction, we also increased the value of our remaining investment to reflect its implied fair value. In doing so, we recognized a gain of $17.6 million. These amounts were recognized within earnings (loss) from unconsolidated entities in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.
We own a 33% equity interest in a fund that owns four regional shopping malls (the “Retail Fund”). The fund is an investment company which measures its assets at fair value on a recurring basis. We report our interest in the Retail Fund on a three-month lag basis at its liquidation value. As of December 31, 2019, we impaired the remainder of our investment based on our estimate of unrealized decreases in the fair value of the underlying real estate properties. Such decreases were recognized by the Retail Fund during the period included in the year ended December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our equity investment in a residential mortgage originator exceeded the underlying equity in net assets of such investee by $1.6 million. This difference is the result of the Company recording its investment in the investee at its acquisition date fair value, which included certain non-amortizing intangible assets not recognized by the investee. Should the Company determine these intangible assets held by the investee are impaired, the Company will recognize such impairment loss through earnings from unconsolidated entities in our consolidated statement of operations, otherwise, such difference between the carrying value of our equity investment in the residential mortgage originator and the underlying equity in the net assets of the residential mortgage originator will continue to exist.
Other than our equity interest in the residential mortgage originator, there were no differences between the carrying value of our equity method investments and the underlying equity in the net assets of the investees as of December 31, 2020.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not become aware of (i) any observable price changes in our other equity investments accounted for under the fair value practicability election, except as described above with respect to the servicing and advisory business, or (ii) any indicators of impairment.
9. Goodwill and Intangibles
Goodwill
Infrastructure Lending Segment
The Infrastructure Lending Segment’s goodwill of $119.4 million at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired on September 19, 2018 and October 15, 2018. The goodwill recognized is attributable to value embedded in the acquired Infrastructure Lending Segment’s lending platform and is fully tax deductible over 15 years.
As discussed in Note 2, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually. Based on our quantitative assessment during the fourth quarter of 2020, we determined that the fair value of the Infrastructure Lending Segment reporting unit to which goodwill is attributed exceeded its carrying value including goodwill. Therefore, we concluded that the goodwill attributed to the Infrastructure Lending Segment was not impaired.
LNR Property LLC (“LNR”)
The Investing and Servicing Segment’s goodwill of $140.4 million at both December 31, 2020 and 2019 represents the excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets of LNR acquired on April 19, 2013. The goodwill recognized is attributable to value embedded in LNR’s existing platform, which includes a network of commercial real estate asset managers, work-out specialists, underwriters and administrative support professionals as well as proprietary historical performance data on commercial real estate assets. The tax deductible component of this goodwill as of April 19, 2013 was $149.9 million and is deductible over 15 years.
Based on our qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter of 2020, we determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the Investing and Servicing Segment reporting unit to which goodwill is attributed is less than its carrying value including goodwill. Therefore, we concluded that the goodwill attributed to the Investing and Servicing Segment was not impaired.
Future changes in the expectations of the impact of COVID-19 on our operations, financial performance and cash flows could cause our goodwill to be impaired.
Intangible Assets
Servicing Rights Intangibles
In connection with the LNR acquisition, we identified domestic servicing rights that existed at the purchase date, based upon the expected future cash flows of the associated servicing contracts. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the balance of the domestic servicing intangible was net of $41.4 million and $26.2 million, respectively, which was eliminated in consolidation pursuant to ASC 810 against VIE assets in connection with our consolidation of securitization VIEs. Before VIE consolidation, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the domestic servicing intangible had a balance of $54.6 million and $43.2 million, respectively, which represents our economic interest in this asset.
Lease Intangibles
In connection with our acquisitions of commercial real estate, we recognized in-place lease intangible assets and favorable lease intangible assets associated with certain non-cancelable operating leases of the acquired properties.
The following table summarizes our intangible assets, which are comprised of servicing rights intangibles and lease intangibles, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):
The following table summarizes the activity within intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):
(1)Impairment of intangible lease assets is recognized within other expense in our consolidated statements of operations.
The following table sets forth the estimated aggregate amortization of our in-place lease intangible assets and favorable lease intangible assets for the next five years and thereafter (amounts in thousands):
Lease Liabilities
In connection with our acquisition of certain properties within our Medical Office Portfolio, we recognized aggregate unfavorable lease liabilities of $4.8 million with a weighted average life of 9.7 years at acquisition. The liability balance was $1.9 million and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
10. Secured Borrowings
Secured Financing Agreements
The following table is a summary of our secured financing agreements in place as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):
(a)Subject to certain conditions as defined in the respective facility agreement.

(d)The aggregate initial maximum facility size of $8.8 billion may be increased at our option, subject to certain conditions. This amount includes such upsizes.
(e)Certain facilities with an outstanding balance of $271.0 million as of December 31, 2020 carry a rolling 11-month or 12-month term which may reset monthly or quarterly with the lender's consent. These facilities carry no maximum facility size.
(f)A facility with an outstanding balance of $212.2 million as of December 31, 2020 has a weighted average fixed annual interest rate of 3.29%. All other facilities are variable rate with a weighted average rate of LIBOR + 1.80%.
(g)Includes: (i) $212.2 million outstanding on a repurchase facility that is not subject to margin calls; and (ii) $41.3 million outstanding on one of our repurchase facilities that represents the 49% pro rata share owed by a non-controlling partner in a consolidated joint venture (see Note 15).
(h)The initial maximum facility size of $300.0 million may be increased to $650.0 million, subject to certain conditions.
(i)Consists of an annual interest rate of the applicable currency benchmark index + 2.00%.
(j)The weighted average maturity is 6.8 years as of December 31, 2020.
(k)Includes a $600.0 million first mortgage and mezzanine loan secured by our Medical Office Portfolio. This debt has a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR + 2.07% that we swapped to a fixed rate of 3.34%. The remainder have a weighted average rate of LIBOR + 2.59%.
(l)Consists of: (i) a $645.0 million term loan facility that matures in July 2026, of which $395.0 million has an annual interest rate of LIBOR + 2.50% and $250.0 million has an annual interest rate of LIBOR + 3.50%, subject to a 75 bps LIBOR floor, and (ii) a $120.0 million revolving credit facility that matures in July 2024 with an annual interest rate of LIBOR + 3.00%. These facilities are secured by the equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries which totaled $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2020.
In the normal course of business, the Company is in discussions with its lenders to extend or amend any financing facilities which contain near term expirations.
In January 2020, we entered into a CMBS/RMBS repurchase facility to finance certain CMBS investments within a consolidated joint venture in which we hold a 51% ownership interest. The facility carries a rolling 12-month term which may reset quarterly with the lender’s consent and an annual interest rate of three-month LIBOR + 1.35% to 1.85%. The facility’s maximum facility size is at the discretion of the lender. This facility does not permit valuation adjustments based on capital markets activity.
In February 2020, we amended a Commercial Loans repurchase facility to increase available borrowings by $200.0 million to $1.8 billion.
In March 2020, we amended an Infrastructure Financing Facility to increase available borrowings by $250.0 million to $750.0 million.
In March 2020, we entered into a Commercial Financing Facility to finance non-U.S. commercial loans held-for-investment. The facility carries a two-year initial term with three one-year extension options and includes an option to extend the maturity for each underlying asset for up to four additional years. The facility has an annual interest rate of GBP LIBOR + 1.75%. This facility shares up to $500.0 million of $2.0 billion of maximum borrowings with a Commercial Loans repurchase facility.
During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we entered into mortgage loans with total borrowings of $217.1 million to refinance our Woodstar I Portfolio. The loans carry ten-year terms and weighted average annual interest rates of LIBOR + 2.71%. A portion of the net proceeds from the mortgage loans was used to repay $117.0 million of outstanding government sponsored mortgage loans. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.2 million in our consolidated statement of operations in connection with the repayment of the government sponsored mortgage loans.
In September 2020, we entered into a Residential Loan financing facility to finance residential loans held-for-sale. The facility carries a two-year initial term with the option to subsequently convert the loan to a three-year term loan. The facility has a maximum facility size of $250.0 million and an annual interest rate of the greater of 3.50% or one-month LIBOR + 2.75%. This facility does not permit valuation adjustments based on capital markets activity.
In October 2020, we amended the Term Loan facility to increase borrowings by $250.0 million. This increase to the Term Loan carries a six-year term and an annual interest rate of LIBOR + 3.50%, subject to a 75 bps LIBOR floor.
In October 2020, we entered into a Residential Loans repurchase facility to finance residential loans. The facility carries a three-year term consisting of an 18-month revolving period and an 18 month extension period and an annual interest rate of one-month LIBOR + 2.30%. The maximum facility size is $350.0 million.
In October 2020, we entered into a $50.0 million mortgage loan to finance a property in our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment. The loan carries a three-year term with no prepayment penalty after 12 months or upon sale of the asset, and an annual interest rate of one-month LIBOR + 2.40%.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we extended maturities by a period of one to two years on ten facilities with an aggregate maximum facility size of $6.0 billion, including $4.9 billion related to commercial lending facilities and $500.0 million related to infrastructure lending facilities.
Our secured financing agreements contain certain financial tests and covenants. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such covenants.
We seek to mitigate risks associated with our repurchase agreements by managing risk related to the credit quality of our assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds and market value. The margin call provisions under the majority of our repurchase facilities, consisting of 72% of these agreements, do not permit valuation adjustments based on capital markets activity Instead, margin calls on these facilities are limited to collateral-specific credit marks. To monitor credit risk associated with the performance and value of our loans and investments, our asset management team regularly reviews our investment portfolios and is in regular contact with our borrowers, monitoring performance of the collateral and enforcing our rights as necessary. For the 28% of repurchase agreements containing margin call provisions for general capital markets activity, approximately 15% of these pertain to our loans held-for-sale, for which we manage credit risk through the purchase of credit index instruments. We further seek to manage risks associated with our repurchase agreements by matching the maturities and interest rate characteristics of our loans with the related repurchase agreement.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately $36.4 million, $34.3 million and $27.0 million, respectively, of amortization of deferred financing costs from secured financing agreements was included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations.
Collateralized Loan Obligations
In August 2019, we refinanced a pool of our commercial loans held-for-investment through a CLO, STWD 2019-FL1. On the closing date, the CLO issued $1.1 billion principal amount of notes, of which $936.4 million was purchased by third party investors. We retained $86.6 million of notes, along with preferred shares with a liquidation preference of $77.0 million. The CLO contains a reinvestment feature that, subject to certain eligibility criteria, allows us to contribute new loans or participation interests in loans to the CLO in exchange for cash. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we utilized the reinvestment feature, contributing $134.7 million and $88.1 million, respectively, of additional interests into the CLO.
The following table is a summary of our CLO as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):
(a)Represents the weighted-average coupon earned on variable rate loans during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Of the loans financed during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the weighted-average fixed interest rate earned on fixed-rate loans was 7.07% and 6.84%, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, there were no fixed-rate loans financed by the CLO.
(b)Represents the weighted-average maturity, assuming the extended contractual maturity of the collateral assets.
(c)Represents the weighted-average cost of financing incurred during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, inclusive of deferred issuance costs.
(d)Repayments of the CLO are tied to timing of the related collateral asset repayments. The term of the CLO financing obligation represents the legal final maturity date.
We incurred $9.2 million of issuance costs in connection with the CLO, which are amortized on an effective yield basis over the estimated life of the CLO. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately $2.5 million and $0.9 million, respectively, of amortization of deferred financing costs was included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our unamortized issuance costs were $5.8 million and $8.3 million, respectively.
The CLO is considered a VIE, for which we are deemed the primary beneficiary. We therefore consolidate the CLO. Refer to Note 15 for further discussion.
Maturities
Our credit facilities generally require principal to be paid down prior to the facilities’ respective maturities if and when we receive principal payments on, or sell, the investment collateral that we have pledged. The following table sets forth our principal repayments schedule for secured financings based on the earlier of (i) the extended contractual maturity of each credit facility or (ii) the extended contractual maturity of each of the investments that have been pledged as collateral under the respective credit facility (amounts in thousands):
(a)Assumes utilization of the reinvestment feature.
11. Unsecured Senior Notes
The following table is a summary of our unsecured senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (dollars in thousands):
(1)Effective rate includes the effects of underwriter purchase discount and the adjustment for the conversion option on our Convertible Notes, the value of which reduced the initial liability and was recorded in additional paid-in-capital.
(2)The coupon on the 2025 Notes is 4.75%. At closing, we swapped $470.0 million of the notes to a floating rate of LIBOR + 2.53%.
Senior Notes Due February 2021
On January 29, 2018, we issued $500.0 million of 3.625% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “2021 February Notes”). The 2021 February Notes were set to mature on February 1, 2021, however in November 2020, we redeemed all of the 2021 February Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof.
Senior Notes Due December 2021
On December 16, 2016, we issued $700.0 million of 5.00% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “2021 December Notes”). The 2021 December Notes mature on December 15, 2021. Prior to September 15, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 2021 December Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium as of the applicable date of redemption. On and after September 15, 2021, we may redeem some or all of the 2021 December Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof.
Senior Notes Due November 2023
On November 2, 2020, we issued $300.0 million of 5.50% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”). The 2023 Notes mature on November 1, 2023. Prior to August 1, 2023, we may redeem some or all of the 2023 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium as of the applicable date of redemption. On and after August 1, 2023, we may redeem some or all of the 2023 Notes at a price equal to 100% of
the principal amount thereof. In addition, prior to November 1, 2022, we may redeem up to 40% of the 2023 Notes at a price equal to 105.5% of the principal amount thereof using the proceeds of certain equity offerings.
Senior Notes Due 2025
On December 4, 2017, we issued $500.0 million of 4.75% Senior Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”). The 2025 Notes mature on March 15, 2025. Prior to September 15, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the 2025 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus the applicable “make-whole” premium as of the applicable date of redemption. On and after September 15, 2024, we may redeem some or all of the 2025 Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof. In addition, prior to March 15, 2021, we may redeem up to 40% of the 2025 Notes at the applicable redemption price using the proceeds of certain equity offerings. The 2025 Notes were swapped to floating rate (see Note 13).
Our unsecured senior notes contain certain financial tests and covenants. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such covenants.
Convertible Notes
On March 29, 2017, we issued $250.0 million of 4.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Convertible Notes”) which remain outstanding at December 31, 2020 and mature on April 1, 2023.
On July 3, 2013, we issued $460.0 million of 4.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2019 (the “2019 Convertible Notes”). During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received and settled redemption notices related to the 2019 Convertible Notes with a par amount totaling $263.4 million. Total consideration of $296.8 million was paid via the issuance of 12.4 million shares and cash payments of $25.5 million. The $264.4 million of settlement consideration attributable to the liability component of the 2019 Convertible Notes exceeded the proportionate net carrying amount of the liability component by $2.1 million, which was recognized as a loss on extinguishment of debt in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $32.4 million of settlement consideration attributable to the equity component of the 2019 Convertible Notes was recognized as a reduction of additional paid-in capital in our consolidated statement of equity for the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offsetting the $271.2 million fair value of the shares issued. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we settled the remaining $78.0 million principal amount of the 2019 Convertible Notes through the issuance of 3.6 million shares of common stock and cash payments of $12.0 million.
We recognized interest expense of $12.2 million, $12.3 million and $28.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, from our Convertible Notes.
The following table details the conversion attributes of our Convertible Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2020 (amounts in thousands, except rates):
(1)The conversion rate represents the number of shares of common stock issuable per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes converted, as adjusted in accordance with the indentures governing the Convertible Notes (including the applicable supplemental indentures).
(2)As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the market price of the Company’s common stock was $19.30, $24.86 and $19.71 per share, respectively.
(3)The conversion spread value represents the portion of the Convertible Notes that are “in-the-money”, representing the value that would be delivered to investors in shares upon an assumed conversion.
The if-converted value of the 2023 Notes was less than their principal amount by $63.8 million at December 31, 2020 as the closing market price of the Company’s common stock of $19.30 was less than the implicit conversion price of $25.91 per share.
Effective June 30, 2018, the Company no longer asserts its intent to fully settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash upon conversion. The if-converted value of the principal amount of the 2023 Notes was $186.2 million as of December 31, 2020.
Conditions for Conversion
Prior to October 1, 2022, the 2023 Notes will be convertible only upon satisfaction of one or more of the following conditions: (1) the closing market price of the Company’s common stock is at least 110% of the conversion price of the 2023 Notes for at least 20 out of 30 trading days prior to the end of the preceding fiscal quarter, (2) the trading price of the 2023 Notes is less than 98% of the product of (i) the conversion rate and (ii) the closing price of the Company’s common stock during any five consecutive trading day period, (3) the Company issues certain equity instruments at less than the 10-day average closing market price of its common stock or the per-share value of certain distributions exceeds the market price of the Company’s common stock by more than 10% or (4) certain other specified corporate events (significant consolidation, sale, merger, share exchange, fundamental change, etc.) occur.
On or after October 1, 2022, holders of the 2023 Notes may convert each of their notes at the applicable conversion rate at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.
12. Loan Securitization/Sale Activities
As described below, we regularly sell loans and notes under various strategies. We evaluate such sales as to whether they meet the criteria for treatment as a sale-legal isolation, ability of transferee to pledge or exchange the transferred assets without constraint and transfer of control.
Loan Securitizations
Within the Investing and Servicing Segment, we originate commercial mortgage loans with the intent to sell these mortgage loans to VIEs for the purposes of securitization. These VIEs then issue CMBS that are collateralized in part by these assets, as well as other assets transferred to the VIE by third parties. Within the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment, we acquire residential loans with the intent to sell these mortgage loans to VIEs for the purpose of securitization. These VIEs then issue RMBS that are collateralized by these assets.
In certain instances, we retain an interest in the CMBS or RMBS VIE and serve as special servicer or servicing administrator for the VIE. In these circumstances, we generally consolidate the VIE into which the loans were sold. The securitizations are subject to optional redemption after a certain period of time or when the pool balance falls below a specified threshold. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we exercised the optional redemption on our first residential securitization that closed in 2018. In doing so, we acquired $176.6 million of loans and redeemed $10.5 million of our existing RMBS holdings. The net amount paid to a consolidated VIE to redeem the outstanding principal amount of its RMBS certificates and acquire the underlying loans pursuant to this provision are reflected as repayment of debt of consolidated VIEs in our consolidated statements of cash flows.
The following summarizes the face amount and proceeds of commercial and residential loans securitized for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (amounts in thousands):
The securitization of these commercial and residential loans does not result in a discrete gain or loss since they are carried under the fair value option.
Our securitizations have each been structured as bankruptcy-remote entities whose assets are not intended to be available to the creditors of any other party.
Commercial and Residential Loan Sales
Within the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment, we originate or acquire commercial mortgage loans, subsequently selling all or a portion thereof. Typically, our motivation for entering into these transactions is to effectively create leverage on the subordinated position that we will retain and hold for investment. We also may sell certain of our previously-acquired residential loans to third parties outside a securitization. The following table summarizes our loans sold by the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment, net of expenses (amounts in thousands):
(1)During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold $277.9 million and $168.2 million of senior interests in first mortgage loans and whole loan interests, respectively, for proceeds of $270.8 million and $172.0 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, all sales were of senior interests in first mortgage loans.
During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, (losses)/gains recognized by the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment on sales of commercial loans were losses of $1.0 million and gains of $4.6 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2018, gains recognized by the Commercial and Residential Lending Segment on sales of commercial loans were not material.
Infrastructure Loan Sales
During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Infrastructure Lending Segment sold loans held-for-sale with an aggregate face amount of $61.1 million for proceeds of $60.8 million, recognizing gains of $0.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Infrastructure Lending Segment sold loans held-for-sale with an aggregate face amount of $404.1 million for proceeds of $393.3 million, recognizing gains of $3.1 million. In connection with these sales, we sold an interest rate swap guarantee for cash payment of $3.1 million and recognized a decrease in fair value of $2.7 million within (loss) gain on derivative financial instruments, net in our consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of our interest rate swap guarantees. There were no sales of loans by the Infrastructure Lending Segment during the year ended December 31, 2018.
13. Derivatives and Hedging Activity
Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives
We are exposed to certain risks arising from both our business operations and economic conditions. We principally manage our exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of our core business activities. We manage economic risks, including interest rate, foreign exchange, liquidity and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of our debt funding and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, we enter into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates, credit spreads, and foreign exchange rates. Our derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing and duration of the known or expected cash receipts and known or expected cash payments principally related to our investments, anticipated level of loan sales, and borrowings.
Designated Hedges
The Company does not generally elect to apply the hedge accounting designation to its hedging instruments. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any designated hedges and there was no impact of cash flow hedges on our net income during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the impact of cash flow hedges on our net income was not material, and we did not recognize any hedge ineffectiveness in earnings associated with cash flow hedges.
Non-designated Hedges and Derivatives
Derivatives not designated as hedges are derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting under GAAP or which we have not elected to designate as hedges. We do not use these derivatives for speculative purposes but instead they are used to manage our exposure to various risks such as foreign exchange rates, interest rate changes and certain credit spreads. Changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are recorded directly in gain (loss) on derivative financial instruments in our consolidated statements of operations.
We have entered into the following types of non-designated hedges and derivatives:
●Foreign exchange (“Fx”) forwards whereby we agree to buy or sell a specified amount of foreign currency for a specified amount of USD at a future date, economically fixing the USD amounts of foreign denominated cash flows we expect to receive or pay related to certain foreign denominated loan investments and properties;
●Interest rate contracts which hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in interest rates;
●Credit index instruments which hedge a portion of our exposure to the credit risk of our commercial loans held-for-sale; and
●Interest rate swap guarantees whereby we guarantee the interest rate swap obligations of certain Infrastructure Lending borrowers. Our interest rate swap guarantees were assumed in connection with the acquisition of the Infrastructure Lending Segment.
The following table summarizes our non-designated derivatives as of December 31, 2020 (notional amounts in thousands):
The table below presents the fair value of our derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):
(1)Classified as derivative assets in our consolidated balance sheets.
(2)Classified as derivative liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
The tables below present the effect of our derivative financial instruments on the consolidated statements of operations and of comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (amounts in thousands):
14. Offsetting Assets and Liabilities
The following tables present the potential effects of netting arrangements on our financial position for financial assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 210-20, Balance Sheet-Offsetting, which for us are derivative assets and liabilities as well as repurchase agreement liabilities (amounts in thousands):
15. Variable Interest Entities
Investment Securities
As discussed in Note 2, we evaluate all of our investments and other interests in entities for consolidation, including our investments in CMBS, RMBS and our retained interests in securitization transactions we initiated, all of which are generally considered to be variable interests in VIEs.
Securitization VIEs consolidated in accordance with ASC 810 are structured as pass through entities that receive principal and interest on the underlying collateral and distribute those payments to the certificate holders. The assets and other instruments held by these securitization entities are restricted and can only be used to fulfill the obligations of the entity. Additionally, the obligations of the securitization entities do not have any recourse to the general credit of any other consolidated entities, nor to us as the primary beneficiary. The VIE liabilities initially represent investment securities on our balance sheet (pre-consolidation). Upon consolidation of these VIEs, our associated investment securities are eliminated, as is the interest income related to those securities. Similarly, the fees we earn in our roles as special servicer of the bonds issued by the consolidated VIEs or as collateral administrator of the consolidated VIEs are also eliminated. Finally, a portion of the identified servicing intangible associated with the eliminated fee streams is eliminated in consolidation.
VIEs in which we are the Primary Beneficiary
The inclusion of the assets and liabilities of securitization VIEs in which we are deemed the primary beneficiary has no economic effect on us. Our exposure to the obligations of securitization VIEs is generally limited to our investment in these entities. We are not obligated to provide, nor have we provided, any financial support for any of these consolidated structures.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we refinanced a pool of our commercial loans held-for-investment through a CLO, which is considered to be a VIE. We are the primary beneficiary of, and therefore consolidate, the CLO in our financial statements as we have both (i) the power to direct the activities in our role as collateral manager that
most significantly impact the CLO’s economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits from the CLO that could be potentially significant through the subordinate interests we own.
The following table details the assets and liabilities of our consolidated CLO as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 (amounts in thousands):
Assets held by this CLO are restricted and can be used only to settle obligations of the CLO, including the subordinate interests owned by us. The liabilities of this CLO are non-recourse to us and can only be satisfied from the assets of the CLO.
We also hold controlling interests in other non-securitization entities that are considered VIEs. SPT Dolphin, the entity which holds the Woodstar II Portfolio, is a VIE because the third party interest holders do not carry kick-out rights or substantive participating rights. We were deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE because we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and a significant economic interest in the entity. This VIE had total assets of $673.0 million and liabilities of $444.3 million as of December 31, 2020.
In December 2019, we entered into a newly-formed joint venture (the “CMBS JV”) within our Investing and Servicing Segment, which is considered a VIE because the third party interest holder does not carry kick-out rights or substantive participating rights. We hold a 51% ownership interest and are deemed the primary beneficiary of the CMBS JV. This VIE had total assets of $330.0 million and liabilities of $85.0 million as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 17 for further discussion.
In addition to the above non-securitization entities, we have smaller VIEs with total assets of $99.6 million and liabilities of $53.6 million as of December 31, 2020.
VIEs in which we are not the Primary Beneficiary
In certain instances, we hold a variable interest in a VIE in the form of CMBS, but either (i) we are not appointed, or do not serve as, special servicer or servicing administrator or (ii) an unrelated third party has the rights to unilaterally remove us as special servicer without cause. In these instances, we do not have the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance. In other cases, the variable interest we hold does not obligate us to absorb losses or provide us with the right to receive benefits from the VIE which could potentially be significant. For these structures, we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, and we do not consolidate these VIEs.
As of December 31, 2020, five of our six collateralized debt obligation (“CDO”) structures within our Investing and Servicing Segment were in default or imminent default, which, pursuant to the underlying indentures, changes the rights of the variable interest holders. Two of the five CDOs defaulted during the year ended December 31, 2020. Upon default of a CDO, the trustee or senior note holders are allowed to exercise certain rights, including liquidation of the collateral, which at that time, is the activity which would most significantly impact the CDO’s economic performance.
Further, when the CDO is in default, the collateral administrator no longer has the option to purchase securities from the CDO. In cases where the CDO is in default and we do not have the ability to exercise rights which would most significantly impact the CDO’s economic performance, we do not consolidate the VIE. As of December 31, 2020, none of these five CDO structures were consolidated.
As noted above, we are not obligated to provide, nor have we provided, any financial support for any of our securitization VIEs, whether or not we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. As such, the risk associated with our involvement in these VIEs is limited to the carrying value of our investment in the entity. As of December 31, 2020, our maximum risk of loss related to securitization VIEs in which we were not the primary beneficiary was $19.5 million on a fair value basis.
As of December 31, 2020, the securitization VIEs which we do not consolidate had debt obligations to beneficial interest holders with unpaid principal balances, excluding the notional value of interest-only securities, of $4.0 billion. The corresponding assets are comprised primarily of commercial mortgage loans with unpaid principal balances corresponding to the amounts of the outstanding debt obligations.
We also hold passive non-controlling interests in certain unconsolidated entities that are considered VIEs. We are not the primary beneficiaries of these VIEs as we do not possess the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and therefore report our interests, which totaled $25.1 million as of December 31, 2020, within investment in unconsolidated entities on our consolidated balance sheet. Our maximum risk of loss is limited to our carrying value of the investments.
16. Related-Party Transactions
Management Agreement
We are party to a management agreement (the “Management Agreement”) with our Manager. Under the Management Agreement, our Manager, subject to the oversight of our board of directors, is required to manage our day to day activities, for which our Manager receives a base management fee and is eligible for an incentive fee and stock awards. Our Manager’s personnel perform certain due diligence, legal, management and other services that outside professionals or consultants would otherwise perform. As such, in accordance with the terms of our Management Agreement, our Manager is paid or reimbursed for the documented costs of performing such tasks, provided that such costs and reimbursements are in amounts no greater than those which would be payable to outside professionals or consultants engaged to perform such services pursuant to agreements negotiated on an arm’s-length basis.
Base Management Fee. The base management fee is 1.5% of our stockholders’ equity per annum and calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in cash. For purposes of calculating the management fee, our stockholders’ equity means: (a) the sum of (1) the net proceeds from all issuances of our equity securities since inception and equity securities of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such issuances during the fiscal quarter of any such issuance), plus (2) our retained earnings and income to non-controlling interests with respect to equity securities of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties at the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter (without taking into account any non-cash equity compensation expense incurred in current or prior periods), less (b) any amount that we pay to repurchase our common stock since inception. It also excludes (1) any unrealized gains and losses and other non-cash items that have impacted stockholders’ equity as reported in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, and (2) one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP, and certain non-cash items not otherwise described above, in each case after discussions between our Manager and our independent directors and approval by a majority of our independent directors. As a result, our stockholders’ equity, for purposes of calculating the management fee, could be greater or less than the amount of stockholders’ equity shown in our consolidated financial statements.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately $76.6 million, $77.0 million and $73.2 million, respectively, was incurred for base management fees. In April 2020, our board of directors authorized the payment of our first quarter base management fee of $19.1 million in 1,422,143 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were $19.2 million and $19.3 million, respectively, of unpaid base management fees included in related-party payable in our consolidated balance sheets.
Incentive Fee. Our Manager is entitled to be paid the incentive fee described below with respect to each calendar quarter if (1) our Core Earnings (as defined below) for the previous 12-month period exceeds an 8% threshold, and (2) our Core Earnings for the 12 most recently completed calendar quarters is greater than zero.
The incentive fee is an amount, not less than zero, equal to the difference between (1) the product of (x) 20% and (y) the difference between (i) our Core Earnings for the previous 12-month period, and (ii) the product of (A) the weighted average of the issue price per share of our common stock of all of our public offerings and including issue price per equity security of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties multiplied by the weighted average number of all shares of common stock outstanding (including any RSUs, any RSAs and other shares of common stock underlying awards granted under our equity incentive plans) and equity securities of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties in such previous 12-month period, and (B) 8%, and (2) the sum of any incentive fee paid to our Manager with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such previous 12-month period. One half of each quarterly installment of the incentive fee is payable in shares of our common stock so long as the ownership of such additional number of shares by our Manager would not violate the 9.8% stock ownership limit set forth in our charter, after giving effect to any waiver from such limit that our board of directors may grant in the future. The remainder of the incentive fee is payable in cash. The number of shares to be issued to our Manager is equal to the dollar amount of the portion of the quarterly installment of the incentive fee payable in shares divided by the average of the closing prices of our common stock on the NYSE for the five trading days prior to the date on which such quarterly installment is paid.
Core Earnings is defined as GAAP net income (loss) excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization of real estate and associated intangibles, acquisition costs associated with successful acquisitions, any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in OCI, or in net income and, to the extent deducted from net income (loss), distributions payable with respect to equity securities of subsidiaries issued in exchange for properties. The amount is adjusted to exclude one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash adjustments as determined by our Manager and approved by a majority of our independent directors.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately $30.8 million, $20.2 million and $41.4 million, respectively, was incurred for incentive fees. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were $15.0 million and $18.1 million, respectively, of unpaid incentive fees included in related-party payable in our consolidated balance sheets.
Expense Reimbursement. We are required to reimburse our Manager for operating expenses incurred by our Manager on our behalf. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, we are required to reimburse our Manager for the cost of legal, tax, consulting, accounting and other similar services rendered for us by our Manager’s personnel provided that such costs are no greater than those that would be payable if the services were provided by an independent third party. The expense reimbursement is not subject to any dollar limitations but is subject to review by our independent directors. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, approximately $8.5 million, $7.7 million and $7.7 million, respectively, was incurred for executive compensation and other reimbursable expenses and recognized within general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were $5.0 million and $3.5 million, respectively, of unpaid reimbursable executive compensation and other expenses included in related-party payable in our consolidated balance sheets.
Equity Awards. In certain instances, we issue RSAs to certain employees of affiliates of our Manager who perform services for us. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we granted 341,635, 182,861 and 252,375 RSAs, respectively, at grant date fair values of $3.9 million, $4.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively. Expenses related to the vesting of awards to employees of affiliates of our Manager were $3.4 million, $4.1 million and $2.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are reflected in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. These shares generally vest over a three-year period.
Payments to Manager Employees. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we made a cash payment of $1.3 million directly to an employee of our Manager in connection with the Company’s Infrastructure Lending Segment acquisition which was recognized within general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations
for that year. No cash payments were made directly to employees of our Manager during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.
Termination Fee. We can terminate the Management Agreement without cause, as defined in the Management Agreement, with an affirmative two-thirds vote by our independent directors and 180 days written notice to our Manager. Upon termination without cause, our Manager is due a termination fee equal to three times the sum of the average annual base management fee and incentive fee earned by our Manager over the preceding eight calendar quarters. No termination fee is payable if our Manager is terminated for cause, as defined in the Management Agreement, which can be done at any time with 30 days written notice from our board of directors.

Investment in Unconsolidated Entities
In October 2014, we committed $150 million for a 33% equity interest in four regional shopping malls (the “Retail Fund”). In August 2017, we funded the remaining $15.5 million capital commitment associated with this investment. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized a loss of $114.4 million and earnings of $3.7 million, respectively. No earnings or losses were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the period included in our year ended December 31, 2019, the Retail Fund reported unrealized decreases in the fair value of its real estate properties, which resulted in a $47.2 million decrease to our investment. In addition, we provided an
impairment charge of $71.9 million against the remainder of the investment based on our estimate of the fair value of the underlying retail assets as of December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 8 for further detail. The Retail Fund was established for the purpose of acquiring and operating four leading regional shopping malls located in Florida, Michigan, North Carolina and Virginia. All leasing services and asset management functions for the properties are conducted by an affiliate of our Manager which specializes in redeveloping, managing and repositioning retail real estate assets. In addition, another affiliate of our Manager serves as general partner of the Retail Fund.
In April 2013, in connection with our acquisition of LNR, we acquired 50% of a joint venture which owns equity in an online real estate company. An affiliate of ours, Fund IX, owns the remaining 50% of the venture.
Lease Arrangements
In March 2020, we entered into an office lease agreement with an entity which is controlled by our Chairman and CEO through majority equity ownership of the entity. The leased premises are currently under construction and will serve as our new Miami Beach office when our existing lease in Miami Beach expires on December 31, 2021. The lease will commence after delivery of the office space to us, but no earlier than July 30, 2021. The lease is for approximately 74,000 square feet of office space, has an initial term of 15 years and requires monthly lease payments starting in the tenth month after lease commencement. The lease payments are based on an annual base rate of $52.00 per square foot that increases by 3% each anniversary following commencement, plus our pro rata share of building operating expenses. In April 2020, we provided a $1.9 million cash security deposit to the landlord. Prior to the execution of this lease, we engaged an independent third party leasing firm and external counsel to advise the independent directors of our board of directors on market terms for the lease. The terms of the lease were approved by our independent directors.
Acquisitions from Consolidated CMBS Trusts
Our Investing and Servicing Segment acquires interests in properties for its REIS Equity Portfolio from CMBS trusts, some of which are consolidated as VIEs on our balance sheet. Acquisitions from consolidated VIEs are reflected as repayment of debt of consolidated VIEs in our consolidated statements of cash flows. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we acquired $8.6 million and $27.7 million, respectively, of net real estate assets from consolidated CMBS trusts for a total gross purchase price of $8.8 million and $28.0 million, respectively. There were no net real estate assets acquired from consolidated CMBS trusts during the year ended December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 3 for further discussion of these acquisitions.
Acquisitions from Consolidated RMBS Trusts
When our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment exercises an optional redemption right in a securitization VIE, it unwinds the securitization structure and acquires the underlying loans from the VIE. Acquisitions of loans from consolidated VIEs are reflected as repayment of debt of consolidated VIEs in our consolidated statements of cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we acquired $176.6 million of residential loans from consolidated RMBS trusts at their par amounts. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of these acquisitions.
Other Related-Party Arrangements
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we established a co-investment fund which provides key personnel with the opportunity to invest in certain properties included in our REIS Equity Portfolio. These personnel include certain of our employees as well as employees of affiliates of our Manager (collectively, “Fund Participants”). The fund carries an aggregate commitment of $15.0 million and owns a 10% equity interest in certain REIS Equity Portfolio properties acquired subsequent to January 1, 2015. As of December 31, 2020, Fund Participants have funded $4.9 million of the capital commitment, and it is our current expectation that there will be no additional funding of the commitment. The capital contributed by Fund Participants is reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries. In an effort to retain key personnel, the fund provides for disproportionate distributions which allows Fund Participants to earn an incremental 60% on all operating cash flows attributable to their capital account, net of a 5% preferred return to us as general partner of the fund. Amounts earned by Fund Participants pursuant to this waterfall are reflected within net income attributable to non-controlling interests in our
consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the non-controlling interests related to this fund received cash distributions of $1.8 million, $1.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively.
Highmark Residential (“Highmark”), an affiliate of our Manager, now provides property management services for all 32 properties within our Woodstar I Portfolio. Fees paid to Highmark are calculated as a percentage of gross receipts and are at market terms. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, property management fees to Highmark of $2.1 million, $1.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively, were recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.
17. Stockholders’ Equity and Non-Controlling Interests
The Company’s authorized capital stock consists of 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, and 500,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share.
In May 2014, we established the Starwood Property Trust, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan (the “DRIP Plan”), which provides stockholders with a means of purchasing additional shares of our common stock by reinvesting the cash dividends paid on our common stock and by making additional optional cash purchases. Shares of our common stock purchased under the DRIP Plan will either be issued directly by the Company or purchased in the open market by the plan administrator. The Company may issue up to 11.0 million shares of common stock under the DRIP Plan. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, shares issued under the DRIP Plan were not material.
In May 2014, we entered into an amended and restated At-The-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement (the “ATM Agreement”) with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated to sell shares of the Company’s common stock of up to $500.0 million from time to time, through an “at the market” equity offering program. Sales of shares under the ATM Agreement are made by means of ordinary brokers’ transactions on the NYSE or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale or at negotiated prices. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were no shares issued under the ATM Agreement.
In February 2020, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $400.0 million of our outstanding common shares and Convertible Notes over a period of one year. Purchases made pursuant to the program will be made either in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchases are discretionary and will be subject to economic and market conditions, stock price, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 2,268,551 shares of common stock for $33.8 million and no Convertible Notes under our repurchase program. As of December 31, 2020, we had $366.2 million of remaining capacity to repurchase common stock and/or Convertible Notes under the repurchase program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased 573,255 shares of common stock for $12.1 million and no Convertible Notes repurchases under a previous repurchase program which expired in January 2019.
During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we issued 3.6 million shares and 12.4 million shares, respectively, in connection with the settlement of $78.0 million and $263.4 million, respectively, of our 2019 Convertible Notes. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion.
Our board of directors declared the following dividends during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:
Equity Incentive Plans
In May 2017, the Company’s shareholders approved the 2017 Manager Equity Plan and the Starwood Property Trust, Inc. 2017 Equity Plan (the “2017 Equity Plan”), which allow for the issuance of up to 11,000,000 stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs, RSUs or other equity-based awards or any combination thereof to the Manager, directors, employees, consultants or any other party providing services to the Company. The 2017 Manager Equity Plan succeeds and replaces the Manager Equity Plan and the 2017 Equity Plan succeeds and replaces the Starwood Property Trust, Inc. Equity Plan (the “Equity Plan”) and the Starwood Property Trust, Inc. Non-Executive Director Stock Plan (the “Non-Executive Director Stock Plan”). As of December 31, 2020, 4,709,531 share awards were available to be issued under either the 2017 Manager Equity Plan or the 2017 Equity Plan, determined on a combined basis.
To date, we have only granted RSAs and RSUs under the equity incentive plans. The holders of awards of RSAs or RSUs are entitled to receive dividends or “distribution equivalents” beginning on either the award’s effective date or vest date, depending on the terms of the award.
The table below summarizes our share awards granted or vested under the Manager Equity Plan and the 2017 Manager Equity Plan during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (dollar amounts in thousands):
(1)Of the amount granted, 218,898 vested immediately on the grant date and the remaining amount vests over a three-year period.
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we granted 1,014,753, 520,236 and 851,170 RSAs, respectively, under the 2017 Equity Plan to a select group of eligible participants which includes our employees, directors and employees of our Manager who perform services for us. The awards were granted based on the market price of the Company’s common stock on the respective grant date and generally vest over a three-year period. Expenses related to the vesting of these awards are reflected in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. No RSUs were granted under the 2017 Equity Plan during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
The following shares of common stock were issued, without restriction, to our Manager as part of the incentive and base management compensation due under the Management Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018:

(1)Share-based compensation expense relating to the Manager Equity Plan is reflected within the 2017 Manager Equity Plan. Share-based compensation expense relating to the Non-Executive Director Stock Plan and the Equity Plan are reflected within the 2017 Equity Plan.
(2)The income tax benefit associated with the share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was immaterial.
Schedule of Non-Vested Shares and Share Equivalents (1)
(1)Equity-based award activity for awards granted under the Equity Plan and Non-Executive Director Stock Plan is reflected within the 2017 Equity Plan column, and for awards granted under the Manager Equity Plan, within the 2017 Manager Equity Plan column.
The weighted average grant date fair value per share of grants during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $14.64, $24.01 and $21.20, respectively.
Vesting Schedule
As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $56.1 million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements which are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.2 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $35.7 million, $33.2 million and $18.3 million, respectively, as of the respective vesting dates.
Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries
As discussed in Note 3, in connection with our Woodstar II Portfolio acquisitions, we issued 10.2 million Class A Units in our consolidated subsidiary, SPT Dolphin, and rights to receive an additional 1.9 million Class A Units if certain contingent events occur. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we issued 0.1 million, 0.1 million and 1.7 million, respectively, of the total 1.9 million contingent Class A Units to the Contributors. The Class A Units are redeemable for consideration equal to the current share price of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis, with the consideration paid in either cash or the Company’s common stock, at the determination of the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2020, redemptions of 0.5 million of the Class A Units were received, of which 0.4 million were settled in common stock and 0.1 million were settled for $1.3 million in cash. During the year ended December 31, 2019, redemptions of 1.0 million of the Class A Units were received and settled in common stock. No Class A Units were redeemed during the year ended December 31, 2018. In consolidation, the outstanding Class A Units are reflected as non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries on our consolidated balance sheets, the balance of which was $226.7 million and $235.9 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
To the extent SPT Dolphin has sufficient cash available, the Class A Units earn a preferred return indexed to the dividend rate of the Company’s common stock. Any distributions made pursuant to this waterfall are recognized within net income attributable to non-controlling interests in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized net income attributable to non-controlling interests of $20.4 million, $21.6 million and $17.6 million, respectively, associated with these Class A Units.
As discussed in Note 15, we entered into the CMBS JV within our Investing and Servicing Segment in December 2019. In connection with the formation of this venture, we sold assets totaling $333.0 million to the CMBS JV, including $318.3 million of CMBS, $13.3 million of interests in various existing CMBS joint ventures, and $1.4 million of related interest receivables. We obtained a 51% interest in the venture for cash consideration of $169.8 million, and our joint venture partner obtained a 49% interest for $163.2 million. The $13.3 million of joint venture interests that we contributed into the CMBS JV relate to joint ventures which we consolidate. The CMBS within these ventures carried a fair value of $24.5 million at the time of sale and related non-controlling interests of $11.2 million.
Because the CMBS JV was deemed a VIE for which we were the primary beneficiary (see Note 15), this transaction was not recognized as a sale for GAAP purposes. Instead, the 49% interest of our joint venture partner is reflected as a non-controlling interest in consolidated subsidiaries on our consolidated balance sheets, and any net income attributable to this 49% joint venture interest is reflected within net income attributable to non-controlling interests in our consolidated statement of operations. The non-controlling interests in the CMBS JV were $126.7 million and $175.6 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2020, net income attributable to non-controlling interests was $9.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, net income attributable to non-controlling interests was immaterial.
In March 2018, we acquired the non-controlling interest held by a third party in one of our consolidated REIS Equity Portfolio properties, which was carried at $0.3 million, for $3.3 million. The excess of the consideration paid to acquire the non-controlling interest over the carrying value of the non-controlling interest was recorded as a reduction of stockholders’ equity in March 2018.
18. Earnings per Share
The following table provides a reconciliation of net income and the number of shares of common stock used in the computation of basic EPS and diluted EPS (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts):
(1)The Company does not intend to fully settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes in cash upon conversion. Accordingly, under GAAP, the dilutive effect to EPS for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is determined using the “if-converted” method whereby interest expense or any loss on extinguishment of our Convertible Notes is added back to the diluted EPS numerator and the full number of potential shares contingently issuable upon their conversion is included in the diluted EPS denominator, if dilutive. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion.
*Our Convertible Notes were not dilutive for the year ended December 31, 2020.
As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, participating shares of 14.4 million, 13.3 million and 13.8 million, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted shares as their effect was already considered under the more dilutive two-class method used above. Such participating shares at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included 10.6 million, 11.0 million and 11.9 million potential shares, respectively, of our common stock issuable upon redemption of the Class A Units in SPT Dolphin, as discussed in Note 17.
19. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income
The changes in AOCI by component are as follows (amounts in thousands):

GAAP establishes a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the observability of inputs utilized in measuring financial assets and liabilities at fair value. GAAP establishes market-based or observable inputs as the preferred source of values, followed by valuation models using management assumptions in the absence of market inputs. The three levels of the hierarchy are described below:
Level I-Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.
Level II-Inputs (other than quoted prices included in Level I) are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument’s anticipated life.
Level III-Inputs reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model.
Valuation Process
We have valuation control processes in place to validate the fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to assure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and the assumptions are reasonable.
Pricing Verification-We use recently executed transactions, other observable market data such as exchange data, broker/dealer quotes, third party pricing vendors and aggregation services for validating the fair values generated using valuation models. Pricing data provided by approved external sources is evaluated using a number of approaches; for example, by corroborating the external sources’ prices to executed trades, analyzing the methodology and assumptions used by the external source to generate a price and/or by evaluating how active the third party pricing source (or originating sources used by the third party pricing source) is in the market.
Unobservable Inputs-Where inputs are not observable, we review the appropriateness of the proposed valuation methodology to ensure it is consistent with how a market participant would arrive at the unobservable input. The valuation methodologies utilized in the absence of observable inputs may include extrapolation techniques and the use of comparable observable inputs.
Any changes to the valuation methodology will be reviewed by our management to ensure the changes are appropriate. The methods used may produce a fair value calculation that is not indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, while we anticipate that our valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies, or assumptions, to determine the fair value could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
We determine the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as follows:
Loans held-for-sale, commercial
We measure the fair value of our commercial mortgage loans held-for-sale using a discounted cash flow analysis unless observable market data (i.e., securitized pricing) is available. A discounted cash flow analysis requires management to make estimates regarding future interest rates and credit spreads. The most significant of these inputs
relates to credit spreads and is unobservable. Thus, we have determined that the fair values of mortgage loans valued using a discounted cash flow analysis should be classified in Level III of the fair value hierarchy, while mortgage loans valued using securitized pricing should be classified in Level II of the fair value hierarchy. Mortgage loans classified in Level III are transferred to Level II if securitized pricing becomes available.
Loans held-for-sale and loans held-for-investment, residential
We measure the fair value of our residential loans held-for-sale and held-for-investment based on the net present value of expected future cash flows using a combination of observable and unobservable inputs. Observable market participant assumptions include pricing related to trades of residential loans with similar characteristics. Unobservable inputs include the expectation of future cash flows, which involves judgments about the underlying collateral, the creditworthiness of the borrower, estimated prepayment speeds, estimated future credit losses, forward interest rates, investor yield requirements and certain other factors. At each measurement date, we consider both the observable and unobservable valuation inputs in the determination of fair value. However, given the significance of the unobservable inputs, these loans have been classified within Level III.
RMBS
RMBS are valued utilizing observable and unobservable market inputs. The observable market inputs include recent transactions, broker quotes and vendor prices (“market data”). However, given the implied price dispersion amongst the market data, the fair value determination for RMBS has also utilized significant unobservable inputs in discounted cash flow models including prepayments, default and severity estimates based on the recent performance of the collateral, the underlying collateral characteristics, industry trends, as well as expectations of macroeconomic events (e.g., housing price curves, interest rate curves, etc.). At each measurement date, we consider both the observable and unobservable valuation inputs in the determination of fair value. However, given the significance of the unobservable inputs these securities have been classified within Level III.
CMBS
CMBS are valued utilizing both observable and unobservable market inputs. These factors include projected future cash flows, ratings, subordination levels, vintage, remaining lives, credit issues, recent trades of similar securities and the spreads used in the prior valuation. We obtain current market spread information where available and use this information in evaluating and validating the market price of all CMBS. Depending upon the significance of the fair value inputs used in determining these fair values, these securities are classified in either Level II or Level III of the fair value hierarchy. CMBS may shift between Level II and Level III of the fair value hierarchy if the significant fair value inputs used to price the CMBS become or cease to be observable.
Equity security
The equity security is publicly registered and traded in the U.S. and its market price is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The security has been classified within Level I.
Domestic servicing rights
The fair value of this intangible is determined using discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows, including forecasted loan defeasance, control migration, delinquency and anticipated maturity defaults which are calculated assuming a debt yield at which default occurs. Since the most significant of these inputs are unobservable, we have determined that the fair values of this intangible in its entirety should be classified in Level III of the fair value hierarchy.
Derivatives
The valuation of derivative contracts are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market based inputs, including interest rate curves, spot and market forward points and implied volatilities. The fair values of interest rate swaps are determined using the market standard methodology of netting the discounted future fixed cash payments and the discounted expected variable cash receipts. The variable cash receipts are based on an expectation of future interest rates (forward curves) derived from observable market interest rate curves.
We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own non-performance risk and the respective counterparty’s non-performance risk in the fair value measurements. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of non-performance risk, we have considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts, and guarantees.
The valuation of over the counter derivatives are determined using discounted cash flows based on Overnight Index Swap (“OIS”) rates. Fully collateralized trades are discounted using OIS with no additional economic adjustments to arrive at fair value. Uncollateralized or partially collateralized trades are also discounted at OIS, but include appropriate economic adjustments for funding costs (i.e., a LIBOR OIS basis adjustment to approximate uncollateralized cost of funds) and credit risk. For credit index instruments, fair value is determined based on changes in the relevant indices from the date of initiation of the instrument to the reporting date, as these changes determine the amount of any future cash settlement between us and the counterparty. These indices are considered Level II inputs as they are directly observable.
Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level II of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level III inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties. However, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives. As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level II of the fair value hierarchy.
Liabilities of consolidated VIEs
Our consolidated VIE liabilities generally represent bonds that are not owned by us. The majority of these are either traded in the marketplace or can be analogized to similar securities that are traded in the marketplace. For these liabilities, pricing is considered to be Level II, where the valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments traded in active markets. We generally utilize third party pricing service providers for valuing these liabilities. In order to determine whether to utilize the valuations provided by third parties, we conduct an ongoing evaluation of their valuation methodologies and processes, as well as a review of the individual valuations themselves. In evaluating third party pricing for reasonableness, we consider a variety of factors, including market transaction information for the particular bond, market transaction information for bonds within the same trust, market transaction information for similar bonds, the bond’s ratings and the bond’s subordination levels.
For the minority portion of our consolidated VIE liabilities which consist of unrated or non-investment grade bonds that are not owned by us, pricing may be either Level II or Level III. If independent third party pricing similar to that noted above is available, we consider the valuation to be Level II. If such third party pricing is not available, the valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant unobservable assumptions, and we consider the valuation to be Level III. For VIE liabilities classified as Level III, valuation is determined based on discounted expected future cash flows which take into consideration expected duration and yields based on market transaction information, ratings, subordination levels, vintage and current market spread. VIE liabilities may shift between Level II
and Level III of the fair value hierarchy if the significant fair value inputs used to price the VIE liabilities become or cease to be observable.
Assets of consolidated VIEs
The securitization VIEs in which we invest are “static”; that is, no reinvestment is permitted, and there is no active management of the underlying assets. In determining the fair value of the assets of the VIE, we maximize the use of observable inputs over unobservable inputs. The individual assets of a VIE are inherently incapable of precise measurement given their illiquid nature and the limitations on available information related to these assets. Because our methodology for valuing these assets does not value the individual assets of a VIE, but rather uses the value of the VIE liabilities as an indicator of the fair value of VIE assets as a whole, we have determined that our valuations of VIE assets in their entirety should be classified in Level III of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis
We determine the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as follows:
Loans held-for-sale, infrastructure
We measure the fair value of infrastructure loans held-for-sale, which are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value, utilizing bids periodically received from third parties to acquire these assets. As these bids represent observable market data, we have determined that the fair value of these assets would be classified in Level II of the fair value hierarchy.
Fair Value Only Disclosed
We determine the fair value of our financial instruments and assets where fair value is disclosed as follows:
Loans held-for-investment and loans held-for-sale
We estimate the fair values of our loans not carried at fair value on a recurring basis by discounting their expected cash flows at a rate we estimate would be demanded by the market participants that are most likely to buy our loans. The expected cash flows used are generally the same as those used to calculate our level yield income in the financial statements. Since these inputs are unobservable, we have determined that the fair value of these loans in their entirety would be classified in Level III of the fair value hierarchy.
HTM debt securities
We estimate the fair value of our mandatorily redeemable preferred equity interests in commercial real estate companies and infrastructure bonds using the same methodology described for our loans held-for-investment. We estimate the fair value of our HTM CMBS using the same methodology described for our CMBS carried at fair value on a recurring basis.
Secured financing agreements, CLO and unsecured senior notes not convertible
The fair value of the secured financing agreements, CLO and unsecured senior notes not convertible are determined by discounting the contractual cash flows at the interest rate we estimate such arrangements would bear if executed in the current market. We have determined that our valuation of these instruments should be classified in Level III of the fair value hierarchy.
Convertible Notes
The fair value of the debt component of our Convertible Notes is estimated by discounting the contractual cash flows at the interest rate we estimate such notes would bear if sold in the current market without the embedded conversion option which, in accordance with ASC 470, is reflected as a component of equity. We have determined that our valuation of our Convertible Notes should be classified in Level III of the fair value hierarchy.

(f)23% and 34% of the portfolio falls within a range of 45% - 80% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
21. Income Taxes
Certain of our domestic subsidiaries have elected to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). TRSs permit us to participate in certain activities from which REITs are generally precluded, as long as these activities meet specific criteria, are conducted within the parameters of certain limitations established by the Code and are conducted in entities which elect to be treated as taxable subsidiaries under the Code. To the extent these criteria are met, we will continue to maintain our qualification as a REIT.
Our TRSs engage in various real estate related operations, including special servicing of commercial real estate, originating and securitizing mortgage loans, and investing in entities which engage in real estate-related operations. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, approximately $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of assets were owned by TRS entities. Our TRSs are not consolidated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but are instead taxed as corporations. For financial reporting purposes, a provision for current and deferred taxes is established for the portion of earnings recognized by us with respect to our interest in TRSs.
Our income tax provision consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (in thousands):
Deferred income taxes in our U.S. tax jurisdiction reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The following table presents the tax effects of temporary differences on net deferred tax assets which are classified in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. and many other governments have enacted, or are contemplating enacting, measures to provide aid and economic stimulus. These measures include deferring the due dates of tax payments and other changes to their income and non-income-based tax laws. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the U.S., includes measures to assist companies, including temporary changes to income and non-income-based tax laws, and to allow companies to carry back tax net operating losses (“NOLs”) generated in 2018 to 2020 to the five preceding tax years. The Company plans to carry back its NOL generated this year to a year in which the federal tax rate was 35%, resulting in a tax benefit from the NOL carryback for the year ended December 31, 2020. We continue to monitor additional guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and others.
22. Commitments and Contingencies
As of December 31, 2020, our Commercial and Residential Lending Segment had future commercial loan funding commitments totaling $1.6 billion, of which we expect to fund $1.3 billion. These future funding commitments primarily relate to construction projects, capital improvements, tenant improvements and leasing commissions.
As of December 31, 2020, our Infrastructure Lending Segment had future infrastructure loan funding commitments totaling $201.2 million, including $121.6 million under revolvers and letters of credit (“LCs”), and $79.6 million under delayed draw term loans. As of December 31, 2020, $19.5 million of revolvers and LCs were outstanding.
In connection with the Infrastructure Lending Segment acquisition, we assumed guarantees of certain borrowers’ performance under existing interest rate swaps. As of December 31, 2020, we had six outstanding guarantees on interest rate swaps maturing between March 2022 and June 2025. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion.
Generally, funding commitments are subject to certain conditions that must be met, such as customary construction draw certifications, minimum debt service coverage ratios or executions of new leases before advances are made to the borrower.
Management is not aware of any other contractual obligations, legal proceedings, or any other contingent obligations incurred in the normal course of business that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.
Lease Commitment Disclosures
Our lease commitments consist of corporate office leases and ground leases for investment properties, all of which are classified as operating leases.

25. Subsequent Events
Our significant events subsequent to December 31, 2020 were as follows:
Secured Financing Agreements
In January 2021, we entered into a Residential Loans repurchase facility to finance residential loans. The facility carries a one-year term, which we intend to extend every three months, and an annual interest rate of one-month LIBOR + 2.00% to 2.50% subject to a 25 bps LIBOR floor. The maximum facility size is $375.0 million.
Collateralized Loan Obligations
In February 2021, we priced STWD 2021-SIF1, a $500.0 million new issue CLO related to a pool of our infrastructure loans held-for-investment, with $410.0 million of third party financing at an average coupon of LIBOR + 181 bps. The CLO contains a reinvestment feature that, subject to certain eligibility criteria, allows us to contribute new loans or participation interests in loans to the CLO for a period of three years. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.
