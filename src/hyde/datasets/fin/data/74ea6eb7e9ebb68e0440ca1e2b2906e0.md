REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of i3 Verticals, Inc.
Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of i3 Verticals, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 30, 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in equity, and cash flows, for the period ended September 30, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2020, in conformity with principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Change in Accounting Principle
As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, using the modified retrospective adoption method on October 1, 2019.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.

1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS
i3 Verticals, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed as a Delaware corporation on January 17, 2018. The Company was formed for the purpose of completing an initial public offering (“IPO”) of its Class A common stock and other related transactions in order to carry on the business of i3 Verticals, LLC and its subsidiaries. i3 Verticals, LLC was founded in 2012 and delivers seamlessly integrated payment and software solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”) and organizations in strategic vertical markets. The Company’s headquarters are in Nashville, Tennessee, with operations throughout the United States. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “i3 Verticals” and the “Company” refer to i3 Verticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including i3 Verticals, LLC.
Initial Public Offering
On June 25, 2018, the Company completed the IPO of 7,647,500 shares of its Class A common stock at a public offering price of $13.00 per share. The Company received approximately $92.5 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, which the Company used to purchase newly issued common units from i3 Verticals, LLC (the “Common Units”), and Common Units from a selling Common Unit holder, in each case at a price per Common Unit equal to the price per share paid by the underwriters for shares of the Company's Class A common stock in the IPO.
Reorganization Transactions
In connection with the IPO, the Company completed the following transactions (the “Reorganization Transactions”):
•i3 Verticals, LLC amended and restated its existing limited liability company agreement to, among other things, (1) convert all existing Class A units, common units (including common units issued upon the exercise of existing warrants) and Class P units of ownership interest in i3 Verticals, LLC into either Class A voting common units of i3 Verticals, LLC (such holders of Class A voting common units referred to herein as the “Continuing Equity Owners”) or Class B non-voting common units of i3 Verticals, LLC (such holders of Class B non-voting common units referred to herein as the “Former Equity Owners”), and (2) appoint i3 Verticals, Inc. as the sole managing member of i3 Verticals, LLC upon its acquisition of Common Units in connection with the IPO;
•the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation to provide for, among other things, Class A common stock and Class B common stock;
•i3 Verticals, LLC and the Company consummated a merger among i3 Verticals, LLC, i3 Verticals, Inc. and a newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary of i3 Verticals, Inc. (“MergerSub”) whereby: (1) MergerSub merged with and into i3 Verticals, LLC, with i3 Verticals, LLC as the surviving entity; (2) Class A voting common units converted into newly issued Common Units in i3 Verticals, LLC together with an equal number of shares of Class B common stock of i3 Verticals, Inc., and (3) Class B non-voting common units converted into Class A common stock of i3 Verticals, Inc. based on a conversion ratio that provided an equitable adjustment to reflect the full value of the Class B non-voting common units; and
•the Company issued shares of its Class A common stock pursuant to a voluntary private conversion of certain subordinated notes (the “Junior Subordinated Notes”) by certain related and unrelated creditors of i3 Verticals, LLC.

(in thousands, except warrant, unit, share and per share amounts)
Following the completion of the IPO and Reorganization Transactions, the Company became a holding company and its principal asset is the Common Units in i3 Verticals, LLC that it owns. i3 Verticals, Inc. operates and controls all of i3 Verticals, LLC's operations and, through i3 Verticals, LLC and its subsidiaries, conducts i3 Verticals, LLC's business. i3 Verticals, Inc. has a majority economic interest in i3 Verticals, LLC.
Public Offerings
On June 10, 2019, the Company completed a secondary public offering (the “June 2019 Secondary Public Offering”) of 5,165,527 shares of its Class A common stock, at a public offering price of $22.75 per share, which included a full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase 673,764 additional shares of Class A Common Stock from the Company. The Company received approximately $111,640 of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before offering expenses. The Company used the net proceeds to purchase (1) 1,000,000 Common Units directly from i3 Verticals, LLC, and (2) 4,165,527 Common Units (including 673,764 Common Units due to the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares in full) and an equivalent number of Class B common stock (which shares were then canceled) from certain Continuing Equity Owners, in each case at a price per Common Unit equal to the price per share paid by the underwriters for shares of the Company's Class A common stock in the offering. i3 Verticals, LLC received $20,870 in net proceeds from the sale of Common Units to the Company, which it used to repay outstanding indebtedness.
On September 15, 2020, the Company completed a primary public offering (the “September 2020 Public Offering”) of 3,737,500 shares of its Class A common stock, at a public offering price of $23.50 per share, which included a full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase 487,500 additional shares of Class A Common Stock from the Company. The Company received approximately $83,400 of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before offering expenses. The Company used the net proceeds to purchase (1) 3,250,000 Common Units directly from i3 Verticals, LLC, and (2) 487,500 Common Units pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares in full and an equivalent number of Class B common stock (which shares were then canceled) from certain Continuing Equity Owners, in each case at a price per Common Unit equal to the price per share paid by the underwriters for shares of the Company's Class A common stock in the offering. i3 Verticals, LLC received $72,018 in net proceeds from the sale of Common Units to the Company, which it used to repay outstanding indebtedness.
i3 Verticals, Inc. is the sole managing member of i3 Verticals, LLC and as a result, consolidates the financial results of i3 Verticals, LLC and reports a non-controlling interest representing the Common Units of i3 Verticals, LLC held by the Continuing Equity Owners.
As the Reorganization Transactions are considered transactions between entities under common control, the financial statements retroactively reflect the accounts of i3 Verticals, LLC for periods prior to the IPO and Reorganization Transactions.
The Continuing Equity Owners who own Common Units in i3 Verticals, LLC may redeem at each of their options (subject in certain circumstances to time-based vesting requirements) their Common Units for, at the election of i3 Verticals, LLC, cash or newly-issued shares of the Company's Class A common stock.
As of September 30, 2020, i3 Verticals, Inc. owned 61.3% of the economic interest in i3 Verticals, LLC. As of September 30, 2020, the Continuing Equity Owners owned Common Units in i3 Verticals, LLC representing approximately 38.7% of the economic interest in i3 Verticals, LLC, shares of Class A common stock in the Company representing approximately 0.5% of the economic interest and voting power in the Company, and shares of Class B common stock in i3 Verticals, Inc., representing approximately 38.7% of the voting power in the Company. Combining the Class A common stock and Class B common stock, the Continuing Equity Holders hold approximately 39.2% of the economic interest and voting power in i3 Verticals, Inc.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the reporting and disclosure rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Principles of Consolidation
These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary companies. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers cash on hand, checking accounts, and savings accounts to be cash and cash equivalents. At times, the balance in these accounts may exceed federal insured limits. Cash equivalents are defined as financial instruments readily transferrable into cash with an original maturity less than 90 days.
Restricted Cash
Restricted cash represents funds held-on-deposit with processing banks pursuant to agreements to cover potential merchant losses. It is presented as long-term assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets since the related agreements extend beyond the next twelve months. Following the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash (Topic 230), the Company includes restricted cash along with the cash and cash equivalents balance for presentation in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Accounts Receivable and Credit Policies
Accounts receivable consist primarily of uncollateralized credit card processing residual payments due from processing banks requiring payment within thirty days following the end of each month. Accounts receivable also include amounts due from the sales of the Company’s technology solutions to its customers. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts, if necessary, which reflects management’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. The allowance is estimated based on management’s knowledge of its customers, historical loss experience and existing economic conditions. Accounts receivable and the allowance are written-off when, in management’s opinion, all collection efforts have been exhausted. The Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts was $310 and $232 as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively; however, actual write-offs may exceed estimated amounts.
Inventories
Inventories consist of point-of-sale equipment to be sold to customers and are stated at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted average basis, or net realizable value. Inventories were $1,309 and $1,294 at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are stated at cost or, if acquired through a business combination or an asset acquisition, fair value at the date of acquisition. Depreciation and amortization are provided over the assets’ estimated useful lives (or, if obtained in connection with a business acquisition, over their estimated remaining useful lives) using the straight-line method, except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the lease term.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. Expenditures for renewals or betterments are capitalized. Management reviews long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in
i3 VERTICALS, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except warrant, unit, share and per share amounts)
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset. There were no impairment charges during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Capitalized Software
Development costs for software to be sold or leased to customers are capitalized once technological feasibility of the software product has been established. Costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Technological feasibility is established when the Company has completed a detailed program design and has determined that a product can be produced to meet its design specifications, including functions, features and technical performance requirements. Capitalization of costs ceases when the product is generally available to clients. Software development costs are amortized using the greater of the straight-line method or the usage method over its estimated useful life, which is generally estimated to be three years.
Software development costs may become impaired in situations where development efforts are abandoned due to the viability of a planned project becoming doubtful or due to technological obsolescence of a planned software product. Management evaluates the remaining useful lives and carrying values of capitalized software at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review, to determine whether significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment in value may have occurred. To the extent estimated net realizable values, which are estimated to equal future undiscounted cash flows, exceed the carrying value, no impairment is necessary. If estimated net realizable values are less than the carrying values, an impairment charge is recorded. Impairment charges during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were nominal.
Identifiable software technology intangible assets resulting from acquisitions are amortized using the straight-line method over periods not exceeding their remaining estimated useful lives. GAAP requires that intangible assets with estimated useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their residual values, and reviewed for impairment. Acquisition technology intangibles’ net book values are included in capitalized software, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Notes Receivable
Notes receivable consist of loans made to unrelated entities. Notes receivable were $1,195 and $195 at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included within other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.
Acquisitions
Business acquisitions have been recorded using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 805, Business Combinations (“ASC 805”), and, accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition. Where relevant, the fair value of material contingent consideration included in an acquisition is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of merchant relationships and non-compete assets acquired is identified using the Income Approach. The fair value of trade names acquired is identified using the Relief from Royalty Method. The fair value of deferred revenue is identified using the Adjusted Fulfillment Cost Method. After the purchase price has been allocated, goodwill is recorded to the extent the total consideration paid for the acquisition, including the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration, if any, exceeds the sum of the fair values of the separately identifiable acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Acquisition costs for business combinations are expensed when incurred and recorded in selling general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.
i3 VERTICALS, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except warrant, unit, share and per share amounts)
Acquisitions not meeting the accounting criteria to be accounted for as a business combination are accounted for as an asset acquisition. An asset acquisition is recorded at its purchase price, inclusive of acquisition costs, which is allocated among the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based upon their relative fair values at the date of acquisition.
The operating results of an acquisition are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of such acquisition. Acquisitions completed during the year ended September 30, 2020 contributed $1,275 and $327 of revenue and net income, respectively, to the results in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year then ended.
Goodwill
In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, the Company tests goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit on an annual basis in the fourth quarter, or when events or circumstances indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value.
The Company’s goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in business combinations. The goodwill generated from the business combinations is primarily related to the value placed on the employee workforce and expected synergies. Judgment is involved in determining if an indicator or change in circumstances relating to impairment has occurred. Such changes may include, among others, a significant decline in expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in the business climate, and unforeseen competition. No goodwill impairment charges were recognized during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
The Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment of impairment to determine whether any further quantitative testing for impairment is necessary. The option of whether or not to perform a qualitative assessment is made annually and may vary by reporting unit. Factors the Company considers in the qualitative assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance of the Company’s reporting units, events or changes affecting the composition or carrying amount of the net assets of its reporting units, sustained decrease in its share price, and other relevant entity specific events. If the Company determines not to perform the qualitative assessment or if it determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying value, then the Company performs a quantitative test for that reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill. Subsequent to the adoption on January 1, 2017 of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-04, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment equal to the excess carrying value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
For a discussion of the estimation methodology, the qualitative factors considered when performing a qualitative assessment and the significance of various inputs, please see the subheading below titled “Use of Estimates.”
The Company has determined that it has five reporting units as of the date of the most recent annual good impairment test. For each of the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the Company performed a quantitative assessment for each of its reporting units. The Company determined that none of the reporting units were impaired.
Intangible Assets
Intangible assets include acquired merchant relationships, residual buyouts, referral agreements, trademarks, tradenames, website development costs and non-compete agreements. Merchant relationships represent the fair value of customer relationships purchased by the Company. Residual buyouts represent the right to not have to pay a residual to an independent sales agent related to certain future transactions with the agent’s referred
i3 VERTICALS, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except warrant, unit, share and per share amounts)
merchants. Referral agreements represent the right to exclusively obtain referrals from a partner for their customers' credit card processing services.
The Company amortizes definite lived identifiable intangible assets using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are expected to be consumed or otherwise utilized. The estimated useful lives of the Company’s customer-related intangible assets approximate the expected distribution of cash flows, whether straight-line or accelerated, generated from each asset. The useful lives of contract-based intangible assets are equal to the terms of the agreement.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2019, management determined it was appropriate to change the amortization rate of our merchant contract intangible assets to reflect the expected distribution of future cash flows. This change was applied prospectively beginning on October 1, 2018 and resulted in $1,290 in additional amortization expense recorded in the year ended September 30, 2019.
Management evaluates the remaining useful lives and carrying values of long-lived assets, including definite lived intangible assets, at least annually, or when events and circumstances warrant such a review, to determine whether significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that a change in the useful life or impairment in value may have occurred. There were no impairment charges during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018.
Income Taxes
i3 Verticals, Inc. is taxed as a corporation and pays corporate federal, state and local taxes on income allocated to it from i3 Verticals, LLC based on i3 Verticals, Inc.'s economic interest in i3 Verticals, LLC. i3 Verticals, LLC's members, including the Company, are liable for federal, state and local income taxes based on their share of i3 Verticals, LLC's pass-through taxable income. i3 Verticals, LLC is not a taxable entity for federal income tax purposes, but is subject to and reports entity level tax in both Tennessee and Texas. In addition, certain subsidiaries of i3 Verticals, LLC are corporations that are subject to state and federal income taxes.
The amount provided for state income taxes is based upon the amounts of current and deferred taxes payable or refundable at the date of the consolidated financial statements as a result of all events recognized in the financial statements as measured by the provisions of enacted tax laws.
Under GAAP, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the “more likely than not” test, no tax benefit is recorded. The Company reports a liability for unrecognized tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense. See additional discussion in Note 10.
Valuation of Contingent Consideration
On occasion, the Company may have acquisitions which include contingent consideration. Accounting for business combinations requires the Company to estimate the fair value of any contingent purchase consideration at the acquisition date. For a discussion of the estimate methodology and the significance of various inputs, please see the subheading below titled “Use of Estimates.” Changes in estimates regarding the fair value contingent purchase consideration are reflected as adjustments to the related liability and recognized within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Short and long-term contingent liabilities are presented within accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, respectively.
i3 VERTICALS, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except warrant, unit, share and per share amounts)
Classification of Financial Instruments
The Company classifies certain financial instruments issued as either equity or as liabilities. Determination of classification is based upon the underlying properties of the instrument. See specific discussion regarding the nature of instruments issued, the presentation on the consolidated financial statements and the related valuation method applied in Notes 9, 11, 12, and 13.
Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue
For the year ended September 30, 2020, revenue is recognized as each performance obligation is satisfied, in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (“ASC 606”). The Company accrues for rights of refund, processing errors or penalties, or other related allowances based on historical experience. The Company utilized the portfolio approach practical expedient within ASC 606-10-10-4 Revenue from Contracts with Customers-Objectives and the significant financing component practical expedient within ASC 606-10-32-18 Revenue from Contracts with Customers-The Existence of a Significant Financing Component in the Contract in performing the analysis. The Company adopted ASC 606 on October 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective method and applying the standard to all contracts not completed on the date of adoption. Results for the reporting period beginning October 1, 2019 are presented under ASC 606, while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historic accounting practices under previous guidance.
The majority of the Company's revenue for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is derived from volume-based payment processing fees (“discount fees”) and other related fixed transaction or service fees. The remainder is comprised of sales of software licensing subscriptions, ongoing support, and other POS-related solutions the Company provides to its clients directly and through its processing bank relationships.
Discount fees represent a percentage of the dollar amount of each credit or debit transaction processed or a specified per transaction amount, depending on the card type. The Company frequently enters into agreements with clients under which the client engages the Company to provide both payment authorization services and transaction settlement services for all of the cardholder transactions of the client, regardless of which issuing bank and card network to which the transaction relates. The Company’s core performance obligations are to stand ready to provide continuous access to the Company’s payment authorization services and transaction settlement services in order to be able to process as many transactions as its clients require on a daily basis over the contract term. These services are stand ready obligations, as the timing and quantity of transactions to be processed is not determinable. Under a stand-ready obligation, the Company’s performance obligation is defined by each time increment rather than by the underlying activities satisfied over time based on days elapsed. Because the service of standing ready is substantially the same each day and has the same pattern of transfer to the client, the Company has determined that its stand-ready performance obligation comprises a series of distinct days of service. Discount fees are recognized each day based on the volume or transaction count at the time the merchants’ transactions are processed.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except warrant, unit, share and per share amounts)
The Company follows the requirements of ASC 606-10-55 Revenue from Contracts with Customers-Principal versus Agent Considerations, which states that the determination of whether a company should recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to a client or the net amount retained is a matter of judgment that depends on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement. The determination of gross versus net recognition of revenue requires judgment that depends on whether the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the merchant or whether the Company is acting as an agent of a third party. The assessment is provided separately for each performance obligation identified. Under its agreements, the Company incurs interchange and network pass-through charges from the third-party card issuers and card networks, respectively, related to the provision of payment authorization services. The Company has determined that it is acting as an agent with respect to these payment authorization services, based on the following factors: (1) the Company has no discretion over which card issuing bank will be used to process a transaction and is unable to direct the activity of the merchant to another card issuing bank, and (2) interchange and card network rates are pre-established by the card issuers or card networks, and the Company has no latitude in determining these fees. Therefore, revenue allocated to the payment authorization performance obligation is presented net of interchange and card network fees paid to the card issuing banks and card networks, respectively, for the year ended September 30, 2020, subsequent to the adoption of ASC 606.
With regards to the Company's discount fees, generally, where the Company has control over merchant pricing, merchant portability, credit risk and ultimate responsibility for the merchant relationship, revenues are reported at the time of sale equal to the full amount of the discount charged to the merchant, less interchange and network fees. Revenues generated from merchant portfolios where the Company does not have control over merchant pricing, liability for merchant losses or credit risk or rights of portability are reported net of interchange and network fees as well as third-party processing costs directly attributable to processing and bank sponsorship costs.
Revenues are also derived from a variety of fixed transaction or service fees, including authorization fees, convenience fees, statement fees, annual fees, gateway fees, which are charged for accessing our payment and software solutions, and fees for other miscellaneous services, such as handling chargebacks. Revenues derived from service fees are recognized at the time the services are performed and there are no further performance obligations. Revenue from fixed transactions, which principally relates to the sale of equipment, is recognized upon transfer of ownership and delivery to the client, after which there are no further performance obligations.
Revenues from sales of the Company’s software are recognized when the related performance obligations are satisfied. Sales of software licenses are categorized into one of two categories of intellectual property in accordance with ASC 606, functional or symbolic. The key distinction is whether the license represents a right to use (functional) or a right to access (symbolic) intellectual property. The Company generates sales of one-time software licenses, which is functional intellectual property. Revenue from functional intellectual property is recognized at a point in time, when delivered to the client. The Company also offers access to its software under software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) arrangements, which represent services arrangements. Revenue from SaaS arrangements is recognized over time, over the term of the agreement.
Arrangements may contain multiple performance obligations, such as payment authorization services, transaction settlement services, hardware, software products, maintenance, and professional installation and training services. Revenues are allocated to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price of each good or service. The selling price for a deliverable is based on standalone selling price, if available, the adjusted market assessment approach, estimated cost plus margin approach, or residual approach. The Company establishes estimated selling price, based on the judgment of the Company's management, considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, client segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. In arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the Company determines allocation of the transaction price at inception of the arrangement and uses the standalone selling prices for the majority of the Company's revenue recognition.

Contract Liabilities
Deferred revenue represents amounts billed to clients by the Company for services contracts. Payment is typically collected at the start of the contract term. The initial prepaid contract agreement balance is deferred. The balance is then recognized as the services are provided over the contract term. Deferred revenue that is expected to be recognized as revenue within one year is recorded as short-term deferred revenue and the remaining portion is recorded as other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The terms for most of the Company's contracts with a deferred revenue component are one year. Substantially all of the Company's deferred revenue is anticipated to be recognized within the next year.

The following table presents the changes in deferred revenue as of and for the year ended September 30, 2020:
Costs to Obtain and Fulfill a Contract
The Company capitalizes incremental costs to obtain new contracts and contract renewals and amortizes these costs on a straight-line basis as an expense over the benefit period, which is generally the contract term, unless a commensurate payment is not expected at renewal. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had $3,140, of capitalized contract costs, which relates to commissions paid to obtain new sales, included within “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and “Other assets" on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded commissions expense related to these costs for the year ended September 30, 2020 of $398.
The Company expenses sales commissions as incurred for the Company's sales commission plans that are paid on recurring monthly revenues, portfolios of existing clients, or have a substantive stay requirement prior to payment.
Interchange and Network Fees and Other Cost of Services
Interchange and network fees consist primarily of fees that are directly related to discount fee revenue. These include interchange fees paid to issuers and assessment fees payable to card associations, which are a percentage of the processing volume the Company generates from Visa and Mastercard, as well as fees charged by card-issuing banks. Other costs of services include costs directly attributable to processing and bank sponsorship costs, which may not be based on a percentage of volume. These costs also include related costs such as residual payments to sales groups, which are based on a percentage of the net revenues generated from merchant referrals. In certain merchant processing bank relationships the Company is liable for chargebacks against a merchant equal to the volume of the transaction. Losses resulting from chargebacks against a merchant are included in other cost of services on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. The Company evaluates its risk for such transactions and estimates its potential loss from chargebacks based primarily on historical experience and other relevant factors. The reserve for merchant losses is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The cost of equipment sold is also included in other cost of services. Interchange and other costs of services are recognized at the time the merchant's transactions are processed.
The Company accounts for all governmental taxes associated with revenue transactions on a net basis.
Advertising and Promotion Costs
Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1,813, $1,443 and $926 for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Equity-based Compensation
The Company accounts for grants of equity awards to employees in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. This standard requires compensation expense to be measured based on the estimated fair value of the share-based awards on the date of grant and recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period.
Equity-based compensation was $10,452, $6,124 and $1,567 for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, the value of purchase consideration paid and identifiable assets acquired and assumed in acquisitions, goodwill and intangible asset impairment review, warrant valuation, revenue recognition for contracts with multiple performance obligations, loss reserves, assumptions used in the calculation of equity-based compensation and in the calculation of income taxes, and certain tax assets and liabilities as well as the related valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on certain of the Company's estimates, including goodwill and intangible assets, is uncertain at this time. If general economic conditions continue to deteriorate or remain uncertain for an extended period of time, the trading price of our common stock, which has already declined in recent months, could decline further. If the stock price continues to be depressed or decreases further, it may cause a triggering event for impairment testing of fair-valued assets, including goodwill and intangible assets.
During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company has recorded a $2,668 reduction in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to the Company’s investment in partnership and a corresponding reduction in the Company's income tax expense for the year ended September 30, 2020. Management has determined an additional portion of the deferred tax asset will be more likely than not realized based off an evaluation of the four sources of taxable income.
During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company has elected to make a policy change to allocate stock compensation expense to the holders of shares of Class B common stock of i3 Verticals, Inc. This change resulted in a $235 reduction in the benefit from income taxes and a corresponding reduction in the Company's net loss, a $3,728 increase to the net loss attributable to non-controlling interest and a $3,493 decrease to the net loss attributable to i3 Verticals, Inc. for the year ended September 30, 2020.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (“ASU 2014-09”). The FASB issued updates and clarifications to ASU 2014-09, including ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Gross versus Net) issued in March 2016, ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing issued in April 2016 and ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients issued in May 2016. ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC 605. The new standard provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized, based upon the core principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also requires additional disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The new standard, as amended, became effective for the Company on October 1, 2019. The amendment allows companies to use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach, through a cumulative adjustment, to adopt this ASU No. 2014-09.
The new standard changed the timing of certain revenue and expenses to be recognized under various arrangement types. More judgment and estimates are required when applying the requirements of the new standard than were required under prior GAAP, such as estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in transaction price and estimating expected periods of benefit for certain costs. Through management's review of individual contracts and historical revenue recognition patterns in comparison to the provisions under ASU 2014-09, the Company determined the timing of revenue to be recognized under ASU 2014-09 for each of the Company’s revenue categories, including discount fees, software licensing subscriptions, ongoing support, and

other POS-related solutions, is similar to the timing of revenue recognized under the historical guidance under ASC 605. The Company will evaluate, on an ongoing basis, costs to obtain contracts with clients, as well as certain implementation and set-up costs, and, in some cases, may be required to amortize these costs over longer periods than they were historically amortized. Finally, the new standard required additional disclosures regarding revenues and related capitalized contract costs, if any.
The Company adopted the new revenue standard using a modified retrospective basis on October 1, 2019. The Company has recorded a $1,345 cumulative increase to equity, including a $705 cumulative increase to accumulated earnings and a $640 cumulative increase to non-controlling interest, as a result of the adoption, due to capitalized costs to obtain contracts with clients being amortized over the expected life of the client rather than the life of the specific contract.
The Company determined that the most significant ongoing impact of adopting the new revenue standard was driven by changes in principal versus agent considerations, with the majority of the change overall in total net revenue attributable to reflecting the Company's payment authorization services net of related interchange and network fees prospectively. The Company's interchange and network fees of $242,867 and $214,543 were classified in “Operating Expenses” on the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended September 30, 2019, and 2018, respectively. The Company's interchange and network fees of $244,097 were included as a reduction to revenue on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2020. Under the modified retrospective basis, the Company has not restated its comparative consolidated financial statements for these effects. The adoption of the new revenue standard did not have a material impact on net income. The following table presents the material impacts of adopting ASC 606 on the Company's consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 2020:

The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2020. The Company has expanded its consolidated financial statement disclosures as required by this new standard. See above for additional disclosures provided as a result of the adoption of ASC 606.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement: Disclosure Framework-Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820) (“ASU 2018-13”). The amendments in ASU 2018-13 provide clarification and modify the disclosure requirements on fair value measurement in Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. The amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. As the Company is an emerging growth company and has elected to use the extended transition period of such companies, the Company will not be required to adopt ASU 2018-13 until October 1, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this principle on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) (“ASU 2016-13”). The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10 (“ASU 2019-10”), which extends the effective date for adoption of ASU 2016-13 for certain entities. As a result of the provisions in ASU 2019-10, and as the Company was a smaller reporting company as of November 15, 2019, the Company will not be required to adopt ASU 2016-13 until October 1, 2023. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this principle on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (“ASU 2016-02”), with amendments in 2018 and 2019. This ASU No. 2016-02 aims to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements.
The amendments in this ASU No. 2016-02 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, which extends the effective date for adoption of ASU 2016-02 for certain entities. In June 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-05, which further extends the effective date for adoption of ASU 2016-02 for certain entities. As a result of the provisions in ASU No. 2020-05, and as the Company is an emerging growth company and has elected to use the extended transition period of such companies, the Company would not be required to adopt this ASU No. 2016-02 until October 1, 2022. The Company has elected to early adopt this ASU No. 2016-02 on October 1, 2020, using the optional modified retrospective transition method, under which the prior period financial statements were not restated for the new guidance.
The Company has elected to apply the package of practical expedients whereby the Company does not reassess whether expired or existing leases contain a lease, does not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and does not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases. The Company has further elected to account for lease and nonlease components in a lease arrangement as a combined lease component for all classes of leased assets.
The Company has calculated that the adoption of Topic 842 will result in the recognition of the right-of-use assets of $9,093 and the lease liabilities of $9,760 as of October 1, 2020 on the consolidated balance sheet. Lease liabilities will be measured as the present value of remaining lease payments, utilizing the Company’s

incremental borrowing rate based on the remaining lease term as of the adoption date. The right-of-use assets will be measured at an amount equal to the lease liabilities adjusted by the amounts of certain assets and liabilities, such as deferred lease obligations and prepaid rent, that were previously recognized on the balance sheet prior to the initial application of Topic 842.
The Company does not expect the adoption of Topic 842 to have an impact on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income, consolidated statements of changes in equity, and consolidated statements of cash flows.
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) (“ASU 2020-04”). The amendments in ASU 2020-04 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments in ASU 2020-04 are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. An entity may elect to apply the amendments for contract modifications by Topic or Industry Subtopic as of any date from the beginning an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or prospectively from the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. Once elected for a Topic or an Industry Subtopic, the amendments must be applied prospectively for all eligible contract modifications for that Topic or Industry Subtopic. The Company may elect to apply ASU 2020-04 as its contracts referenced in London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) are impacted by reference rate reform. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this principle on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)-Accounting For Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity (“ASU 2020-06”). ASU 2020-06 simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. ASU 2020-06 removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for it. ASU 2020-06 also simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The amendments in ASU 2020-06 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. As the Company is an emerging growth company and has elected to use the extended transition period of such companies, the Company will not be required to adopt ASU 2020-06 until October 1, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this principle on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
3. CREDIT RISK AND OTHER CONCENTRATIONS
The Company places its cash with high credit quality financial institutions which provide Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance. The Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of these institutions and does not expect any losses related to such concentrations.
The Company’s revenues are earned by processing transactions for merchant businesses and other institutions under contract with the Company. The Company utilizes the funds settlement services of primarily six processing banks, from which most accounts receivable are remitted monthly.
No single merchant accounted for more than 10.0% of the Company's revenue during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Company believes that the loss of any single merchant would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.
The Company uses third party payment processors, three of which facilitate more than 10% of our processing revenues for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

4. ACQUISITIONS
During the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 the Company acquired the following intangible assets and businesses:
Residual Buyouts
From time to time, the Company acquires future commission streams from sales agents in exchange for an upfront cash payment. This results in an increase in overall gross processing volume to the Company. The residual buyouts are treated as asset acquisitions, resulting in recording a residual buyout intangible asset at cost on the date of acquisition. These assets are amortized using a method of amortization that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are expected to be utilized over their estimated useful lives.
During the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company purchased $1,788, $3,585 and $1,567, respectively, in residual buyouts using a combination of cash on hand and borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility. The acquired residual buyout intangible assets have weighted average estimated amortization periods of eight, seven and two years, respectively.
Referral Agreements
From time to time, the Company enters into referral agreements with agent banks or other organizations (“referral partner”). Under these agreements, the referral partner exclusively refers its customers to the Company for credit card processing services. Total consideration paid for these agreements in the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $0, $0 and $815, respectively, all of which was settled with cash on hand. Because the Company pays an up-front fee to compensate the referral partner, the amount is treated as an asset acquisition in which the Company has acquired an intangible stream of referrals. This asset is amortized over a straight-line period. The weighted-average amortization period for all intangibles acquired is five years.
2018 Business Combinations
During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company completed the acquisitions of businesses, including San Diego Cash Register Company, Inc., and additional unrelated businesses which were considered individually immaterial but collectively material.
Purchase of San Diego Cash Register Company, Inc.
On October 31, 2017, the Company closed an agreement to purchase all of the outstanding stock of San Diego Cash Register Company, Inc. (“SDCR, Inc.”).

The acquisition was funded using $20,000 in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt from the 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility (as defined in Note 9) and $730 of contingent cash consideration.
The goodwill associated with the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes. The acquired merchant relationships intangible asset has an estimated amortization period of twelve years. The non-compete agreement and trade name have amortization periods of two and five years, respectively. The weighted-average amortization period for all intangibles acquired is eleven years.
Acquisition-related costs for SDCR, Inc. were $293 and were expensed as incurred.
Certain provisions in the purchase agreement provide for additional consideration of up to $2,400, in the aggregate, to be paid based upon the achievement of specified financial performance targets, as defined in the purchase agreement, through October 2019. The Company determined the acquisition date fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration based on a discounted cash flow analysis. In each subsequent reporting

2020 Exchangeable Notes Offering
On February 18, 2020, i3 Verticals, LLC issued $138,000 aggregate principal amount of 1.0% Exchangeable Senior Notes due 2025 (the “Exchangeable Notes”) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company received approximately $132,762 in net proceeds from the sale of the Exchangeable Notes, as determined by deducting estimated offering expenses paid to third-parties from the aggregate principal amount.
The Exchangeable Notes are senior secured notes and are guaranteed solely by the Company. The Exchangeable Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.00% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on February

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2020. The Exchangeable Notes will mature on February 15, 2025, unless converted or repurchased at an earlier date.
i3 Verticals, LLC issued the Exchangeable Notes pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of February 18, 2020 (the “Indenture”), among i3 Verticals, LLC, the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee.
Prior to August 15, 2024, the Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable only upon satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods described in the Indenture, and thereafter, the Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. The Exchangeable Notes are exchangeable on the terms set forth in the Indenture into cash, shares of Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at i3 Verticals, LLC’s election. The exchange rate is initially 24.4666 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Exchangeable Notes (equivalent to an initial exchange price of approximately $40.87 per share of Class A common stock). The exchange rate is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or i3 Verticals, LLC’s delivery of a notice of redemption, i3 Verticals, LLC will increase, in certain circumstances, the exchange rate for a holder who elects to exchange its Exchangeable Notes in connection with such a corporate event or notice of redemption, as the case may be.
If the Company or i3 Verticals, LLC undergoes a fundamental change, holders may require i3 Verticals, LLC to repurchase all or part of their Exchangeable Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the fundamental change repurchase date. As of September 30, 2020, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the Exchangeable Notes to early convert have been met.
i3 Verticals, LLC may not redeem the Exchangeable Notes prior to February 20, 2023. On or after February 20, 2023, and prior to the 47th scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, if the last reported sale price per share of Class A common stock has been at least 130% of the exchange price for the Exchangeable Notes for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), i3 Verticals, LLC may redeem all or any portion of the Exchangeable Notes at a cash redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on such note to, but not including, the redemption date.
The Exchangeable Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of i3 Verticals, LLC and the guarantee is the Company’s senior unsecured obligation and rank senior in right of payment to all of i3 Verticals, LLC’s and the Company’s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Exchangeable Notes or the guarantee, as applicable. The Exchangeable Notes and the guarantee rank equally in right of payment with all of i3 Verticals, LLC’s and the Company’s existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so expressly subordinated in the right of payment to the Exchangeable Notes or the guarantee, as applicable. The Exchangeable Notes and the guarantee are effectively subordinated to any of the Companies’ existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness (including obligations under the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facility, defined below). The Exchangeable Notes and the guarantee will be structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities and obligations (including the debt and trade payables) of the Company’s subsidiaries, other than i3 Verticals, LLC.
In accounting for the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, the Company separated the Exchangeable Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component before the allocation of any transaction costs was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated exchangeable feature. The carrying amount of the equity component (before the allocation of any transaction costs), representing the conversion option, which does not require separate accounting as a derivative as it meets a scope exception for certain contracts involving an entity's own equity, was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the par value of the Exchangeable Notes. The difference between the principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes and the liability component represents the debt discount, which is recorded as a direct deduction from the related debt liability in the consolidated balance sheet and accreted over
i3 VERTICALS, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except warrant, unit, share and per share amounts)
the period from the date of issuance to the contractual maturity date, resulting in the recognition of non-cash interest expense. The equity component of the Exchangeable Notes of approximately $28,662 is included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet and is not remeasured as longs as it continues to meet the conditions for equity classification. Transaction costs were allocated to the liability and equity components in the same proportion as the allocation of the proceeds. Transaction costs attributable to the liability component were recorded as debt issuance costs in the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Exchangeable Notes, and transaction costs attributable to the equity component were netted with the equity component in stockholders' equity.
The Company incurred third-party issuance costs totaling $5,238, in connection with the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes. The Company capitalized $4,150 of debt issuance costs in connection with the Exchangeable Notes and allocated $1,088 of the third-party issuance costs to equity. Non-cash interest expense, including amortization of debt issuance costs, related to the Exchangeable Notes for the year ended September 30, 2020 was $365, respectively. The Company also wrote off a portion of the debt issuance costs in connection with the repurchase transactions in April and September 2020, as described below. Total unamortized debt issuance costs related to the Exchangeable Notes were $3,193 as of September 30, 2020.
The estimated fair value of the Exchangeable Notes was $102,064 as of September 30, 2020. The estimated fair value of the Exchangeable Notes was determined through consideration of quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value is classified as Level 2, as defined in Note 11.
The Company can choose to purchase its Exchangeable Notes on the open market. In April and September 2020, the Company paid $17,414 in aggregate to repurchase $21,000 in aggregate principal amount of the Exchangeable Notes and to repay approximately $24 in accrued interest on the repurchased portion of the Exchangeable Notes. The Company recorded a loss on retirement of debt of $2,297 due to the carrying value exceeding the fair value of the repurchased portion of the Exchangeable Notes at the dates of repurchases. The Company wrote off $592 of debt issuance costs in connection with the repurchase transactions.
Exchangeable Note Hedge Transactions
On February 12, 2020, concurrently with the pricing of the Exchangeable Notes, and on February 13, 2020, concurrently with the exercise by the initial purchasers of their right to purchase additional Exchangeable Notes, i3 Verticals, LLC entered into exchangeable note hedge transactions with respect to Class A common stock (the “Note Hedge Transactions”) with certain financial institutions (collectively, the “Counterparties”). The Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the Exchangeable Notes, the same number of shares of Class A common stock that initially underlie the Exchangeable Notes in the aggregate and are exercisable upon exchange of the Exchangeable Notes. The Note Hedge Transactions are intended to reduce potential dilution to the Class A common stock upon any exchange of the Exchangeable Notes. The Note Hedge Transactions will expire upon the maturity of the Exchangeable Notes, if not earlier exercised. The Note Hedge Transactions are separate transactions, entered into by i3 Verticals, LLC with the Counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Exchangeable Notes. Holders of the Exchangeable Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Note Hedge Transactions. i3 Verticals, LLC used approximately $28,676 of the net proceeds from the offering of the Exchangeable Notes (net of the premiums received for the warrant transactions described below) to pay the cost of the Note Hedge Transactions.
The Note Hedge Transactions do not require separate accounting as a derivative as they meet a scope exception for certain contracts involving an entity's own equity. The premiums paid for the Note Hedge Transactions have been included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity.
Warrant Transactions
On February 12, 2020, concurrently with the pricing of the Exchangeable Notes, and on February 13, 2020, concurrently with the exercise by the initial purchasers of their right to purchase additional Exchangeable Notes, the Company entered into warrant transactions to sell to the Counterparties warrants (the “Warrants”) to acquire,
i3 VERTICALS, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except warrant, unit, share and per share amounts)
subject to customary adjustments, up to initially 3,376,391 shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate at an initial exercise price of $62.88 per share. The Company offered and sold the Warrants in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Warrants will expire over a period beginning on May 15, 2025.
The Warrants are separate transactions, entered into by the Company with the Counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Exchangeable Notes. Holders of the Exchangeable Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Warrants. The Company received approximately $14,669 from the offering and sale of the Warrants. The Warrants do not require separate accounting as a derivative as they meet a scope exception for certain contracts involving an entity's own equity. The premiums paid for the Warrants have been included as a net increase to additional paid-in capital within stockholders' equity.
Senior Secured Credit Facility
On May 9, 2019, the Company replaced its existing 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility (defined below) with a new credit agreement (the “Senior Secured Credit Facility”). The Company concluded that the replacement of the 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility should be accounted for as a debt modification based on the guidance in ASC 470-50. In connection with the replacement of the 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility, the Company recorded a debt extinguishment charge of $152 for the write-off of deferred financing costs, which was recorded in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The Senior Secured Credit Facility, as amended on February 18, 2020 in connection with our offering of Exchangeable Notes, consists of a $275,000 revolving credit facility, together with an option to increase the revolving credit facility and/or obtain incremental term loans in an additional principal amount of up to $50,000 in the aggregate (subject to the receipt of additional commitments for any such incremental loan amounts). The Senior Secured Credit Facility accrues interest at LIBOR (based upon an interest period of one, two, three or six months or, under some circumstances, up to twelve months) plus an applicable margin of 2.25% to 3.25% (3.25% as of September 30, 2020), or the base rate (defined as the highest of (x) the Bank of America prime rate, (y) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (z) LIBOR plus 1.00%), plus an applicable margin of 0.25% to 1.25% (1.25% as of September 30, 2020), in each case depending upon the consolidated total leverage ratio, as defined in the agreement. Interest is payable at the end of the selected interest period, but no less frequently than quarterly. Additionally, the Senior Secured Credit Facility requires the Company to pay unused commitment fees of 0.15% to 0.30% (0.30% as of September 30, 2020) on any undrawn amounts under the revolving credit facility and letter of credit fees of up to 3.25% on the maximum amount available to be drawn under each letter of credit issued under the agreement. The Senior Secured Credit Facility requires maintenance of certain financial ratios on a quarterly basis as follows: (i) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 3.00 to 1.00, (ii) a maximum total leverage ratio of 5.00 to 1.00, provided, that for each of the four fiscal quarters immediately following a qualified acquisition (each a “Leverage Increase Period”), the required ratio set forth above may be increased by up to 0.25, subject to certain limitations and (iii) a maximum consolidated senior secured leverage ratio of 3.25 to 1.00, provided, that for each Leverage Increase Period, the consolidated senior leverage ratio may be increased by up to 0.25, subject to certain limitations. The maturity date of the Senior Secured Credit Facility is May 9, 2024. As of September 30, 2020, there was $275,000 available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility, subject to the financial covenants.
The Senior Secured Credit Facility is secured by substantially all assets of the Company. The lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility hold senior rights to collateral and principal repayment over all other creditors.
The provisions of the Senior Secured Credit Facility place certain restrictions and limitations upon the Company. These include, among others, restrictions on liens, investments, indebtedness, fundamental changes and dispositions; maintenance of certain financial ratios; and certain non-financial covenants pertaining to the activities of the Company during the period covered. The Company was in compliance with such covenants as of September 30, 2020. In addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facility restricts the Company's ability to make dividends or other distributions to the holders of the Company's equity. The Company is permitted to (i) make cash distributions to the holders of the Company's equity in order to pay taxes incurred by owners of equity in i3 Verticals, LLC, by reason of such ownership, (ii) move intercompany cash between subsidiaries that are joined to the Senior Secured Credit Facility, (iii) repurchase equity from employees, directors, officers or consultants in an

aggregate amount not to exceed $3,000 per year, (iv) make certain payments in connection with the Tax Receivable Agreement, and (v) make other dividends or distributions in an aggregate amount not to exceed 5% of the net cash proceeds received from any additional common equity issuance. The Company is also permitted to make non-cash dividends in the form of additional equity issuances. Each subsidiary may make ratable distributions to persons that own equity interests in such subsidiary. All other forms of dividends or distributions are prohibited under the Senior Secured Credit Facility.
2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility
On October 30, 2017, the Company replaced its then-existing credit facility with the 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility (the “2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility”). The 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility consisted of term loans in the original principal amount of $40,000 and a $110,000 revolving line of credit. The 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility accrued interest, payable monthly, at the prime rate plus a margin of 0.50% to 2.00% or at the 30-day LIBOR rate plus a margin of 2.75% to 4.00%, in each case depending on the ratio of consolidated debt-to-EBITDA, as defined in the agreement. Additionally, the 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility required the Company to pay unused commitment fees of up to 0.15% to 0.30% on any undrawn amounts under the revolving line of credit. The maturity date of the 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility is October 30, 2022. Principal payments of $1,250 were due on the last day of each calendar quarter until the maturity date, when all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest were due.
The 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility was secured by substantially all assets of the Company. The lenders under the 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility held senior rights to collateral and principal repayment over all other creditors.
As previously mentioned, on May 9, 2019, the Company replaced its existing 2017 Senior Secured Credit Facility with the Senior Secured Credit Facility.
Notes to Mezzanine Lenders
During 2013, the Company issued notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of $10,500 (the “Mezzanine Notes”) to three creditors. The Mezzanine Notes accrued interest at a fixed rate of 12.0%, payable monthly, and initially were due to mature in February 2018. In April 2016, the Mezzanine Notes were amended and restated and the maturity dates were extended to November 29, 2020, when all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest was due. The amendment was accounted for as a modification under the guidance at ASC 470-50. The Mezzanine Notes were secured by substantially all assets of the Company in accordance with the terms of a security agreement and were subordinate to the Senior Secured Credit Facility.
The provisions of the Mezzanine Notes placed certain restrictions and limitations upon the Company. These included restrictions on additional borrowings, capital expenditures, maintenance of certain financial ratios, and certain non-financial covenants pertaining to the activities of the Company during the period covered. The Company was in compliance with such covenants as of September 30, 2017. The Mezzanine Lenders participated in the July 2017 Class A unit offerings (see Note 13).
In June 2018, all of the outstanding aggregate principal balance and accrued interest on the Mezzanine Notes was repaid with proceeds from the Company’s IPO. As part of the extinguishment of the Mezzanine Notes, $78 of unamortized debt issuance costs were written off.
Mezzanine Warrants
During 2013, the Company issued notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of $10,500 (the “Mezzanine Notes”) to three creditors. In June 2018, all of the outstanding aggregate principal balance and accrued interest on the Mezzanine Notes was repaid with proceeds from the Company’s IPO.
In connection with the issuance of the Mezzanine Notes, the Company granted the Mezzanine Warrants to purchase 1,423,688 common units in i3 Verticals, LLC. The Mezzanine Warrants were determined to have no
i3 VERTICALS, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except warrant, unit, share and per share amounts)
material value as of the grant date. The intrinsic value of the Mezzanine Warrants was $767 as of September 30, 2017, and they had an exercise price of $0.01. On June 25, 2018, in conjunction with the Reorganization Transactions described in Note 1, all existing Mezzanine Warrants were exercised for common units in i3 Verticals, LLC. The intrinsic value of the Mezzanine Warrants at that date was $9,241. The change in the fair market value of the warrants for the year ended September 30, 2018 is reflected within the consolidated statement of operations.
Unsecured notes payable to related and unrelated creditors
During 2014, the Company issued the Junior Subordinated Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $17,608 to unrelated and related creditors. The Junior Subordinated Notes accrued interest, payable monthly, at a fixed rate of 10.0% and were due to mature on February 14, 2019, when all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest was due. However, the unsecured notes were subordinate to the Mezzanine Notes and the Senior Secured Credit Facility, which both had maturities beyond the Junior Subordinated Notes, and the provisions of the Mezzanine Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility did not permit the payment of any subordinated debt prior to its maturity. Should the Junior Subordinated Notes have reached maturity and the terms of the Mezzanine Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility remained in place, the term of the Junior Subordinated Notes would have been extended until after the maturity of the Mezzanine Notes and Senior Secured Credit Facility, in accordance with the terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes.
In connection with the issuance of the Junior Subordinated Notes, the Company granted detachable warrants (“Junior Subordinated Notes Warrants”) to purchase 1,433,920 common units in i3 Verticals, LLC. Management determined that the warrants had no material value as of the grant date, and none of the proceeds from the notes was attributed to the warrants. The warrants were accounted for as equity. See additional disclosures in Note 13.
In July 2017, $500 of the Junior Subordinated Notes were retired and exchanged for 148 Class A units of the Company. The fair value of the Class A units issued approximated the carrying amount of the Junior Subordinated Notes, so no extinguishment gain or loss was recognized. See additional disclosures in Note 13 and Note 15.
In June 2018, in connection with the Company's IPO and as part of the Reorganization Transactions, $8,054 of the Junior Subordinated Notes were converted to newly issued shares of the Company's Class A common stock, as described in Note 1, and the remaining $8,054 of the Junior Subordinated Notes was repaid with proceeds from the Company's IPO. As part of the extinguishment of the Junior Subordinated Notes, $43 of unamortized debt issuance costs were written off.
Debt issuance costs
During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company capitalized $4,212 in connection with the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes, the Note Hedge Transactions and the Warrants and in connection with entering into the second amendment to the Senior Secured Credit Facility. During the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company incurred debt issuance costs totaling $1,245 in connection with the issuance of long-term debt. The debt issuance costs are being amortized over the related term of the debt using the effective interest rate method, and are presented net against long-term debt in the consolidated balance sheets. The amortization of debt issuance costs is included in interest expense and amounted to approximately $758, $721 and $1,072 during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and tax basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities. Net deferred taxes spanning multiple jurisdictions as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:
Federal net operating loss carryforwards as of September 30, 2020 were $26,984 and federal tax credits were $901, resulting in a deferred tax benefit of $6,568. The federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2034 and the federal tax credits will begin to expire in 2033. The use of federal net operating losses and credits are limited to the future taxable income of separate legal entities. As a result, a valuation allowance of $388 has been provided for certain federal deferred tax assets, an increase of $383 during the year ended September 30, 2020. State net operating loss carryforwards as of September 30, 2020 totaled $81,827, resulting in a deferred tax benefit of $5,302. The state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2024. The use of certain state net operating losses are limited to future taxable earnings of separate legal entities. As a result, a valuation allowance of $3,571 has been provided for state loss carryforwards, an increase of $1,094 during the year ended September 30, 2020. The Company also considered a valuation allowance on its $47,897 outside basis of investment in i3 Verticals, LLC deferred tax benefit as of September 30, 2020. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $16,271 against the portion of the deferred tax benefit that is capital in nature, resulting in an increase in valuation allowance of $2,143 during the year ended September 30, 2020. Management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets after giving consideration to the valuation allowance.

The components of the Company’s liability for uncertain tax benefits are as follows:
As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had accrued interest of $7 and $0, respectively, and no accrued penalties in either period related to uncertain tax positions. It is the Company’s policy to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, or local examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, there were unrecognized tax benefits of $184 and $0 that if recognized would affect the annual effective tax rate.
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted into law. The legislation contains several key tax provisions, including the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018, as well as a variety of other changes, including limitation of the tax deductibility of interest expense, acceleration of expensing of certain business assets and reductions in the amount of executive pay that could qualify as a tax deduction. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, which allowed the Company to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year after the enactment date. As of December 22, 2018, the Company completed its accounting for all of the enactment-date income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Company made no material adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded.

On June 25, 2018, the Company entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement with i3 Verticals, LLC and each of the Continuing Equity Owners (the “Tax Receivable Agreement”) that provides for the payment by the Company to the Continuing Equity Owners of 85% of the amount of certain tax benefits, if any, that it actually realizes, or in some circumstances, is deemed to realize in its tax reporting, as a result of (i) future redemptions funded by the Company or exchanges, or deemed exchanges in certain circumstances, of Common Units of i3 Verticals, LLC for Class A common stock of i3 Verticals, Inc. or cash, and (ii) certain additional tax benefits attributable to payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. These tax benefit payments are not conditioned upon one or more of the Continuing Equity Owners maintaining a continued ownership interest in i3 Verticals, LLC. If a Continuing Equity Owner transfers Common Units but does not assign to the transferee of such units its rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement, such Continuing Equity Owner generally will continue to be entitled to receive payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement arising in respect of a subsequent exchange of such Common Units. In general, the Continuing Equity Owners’ rights under the Tax Receivable Agreement may not be assigned, sold, pledged or otherwise alienated to any person, other than certain permitted transferees, without (a) the Company's prior written consent, which should not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (b) such persons becoming a party to the Tax Receivable Agreement and agreeing to succeed to the applicable Continuing Equity Owner’s interest therein. The Company expects to benefit from the remaining 15% of the tax benefits, if any, that the Company may realize.
During the year ended September 30, 2018, in conjunction with the Company's IPO, i3 Verticals, Inc. purchased Class B common stock from a Continuing Equity Owner for $4,635. This transaction triggered an increase in the tax basis of the Company's Common Units in i3 Verticals, LLC subject to the provisions of the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Company recognized a deferred tax asset in the amount of $960 and a corresponding liability of $816, representing 85% of the tax benefits due to the Continuing Equity Owners related to exchanges in the year ended September 30, 2018.
During the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company acquired an aggregate of 4,292,169 common units of i3 Verticals, LLC in connection with the redemption of common units, which resulted in an increase in the tax basis of our investment in i3 Verticals, LLC subject to the provisions of the Tax Receivable Agreement.

(in thousands, except warrant, unit, share and per share amounts)
Primarily as a result of these exchanges, during the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company recognized an increase to its net deferred tax assets in the amount of $25,776, and corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities of $22,413, representing 85% of the tax benefits due to the Continuing Equity Owners. The results of these transactions brought the deferred tax asset and corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement liability balances to $26,736 and $23,229, respectively, as of September 30, 2019.
During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company acquired an aggregate of 1,021,016 common units of i3 Verticals, LLC in connection with the redemption of common units, which resulted in an increase in the tax basis of our investment in i3 Verticals, LLC subject to the provisions of the Tax Receivable Agreement. As a result of these exchanges, during the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recognized an increase to its net deferred tax assets in the amount of $6,307, and corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement liabilities of $5,361, representing 85% of the tax benefits due to the Continuing Equity Owners.
The deferred tax asset and corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement liability balances were $31,626 and $27,565, respectively, as of September 30, 2020.
Payments to the Continuing Equity Owners related to exchanges through September 30, 2020 will range from $0 to $2,460 per year and are expected to be paid over the next 25 years. The amounts recorded as of September 30, 2020, approximate the current estimate of expected tax savings and are subject to change after the filing of the Company’s U.S. federal and state income tax returns. Future payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement with respect to subsequent exchanges would be in addition to these amounts.
11. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
The Company applies the provisions of ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for its measurement and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability as of the measurement date. A three-tier, fair-value reporting hierarchy exists for disclosure of fair value measurements based on the observability of the inputs to the valuation of financial assets and liabilities. The three levels are:
Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets.
Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable in active exchange markets.
The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, other assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximated their fair values as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, because of the relatively short maturity dates on these instruments. The carrying amount of debt approximates fair value as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, because interest rates on these instruments approximate market interest rates.
i3 VERTICALS, Inc.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(in thousands, except warrant, unit, share and per share amounts)
The Company has no Level 1 or Level 2 financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The following tables present the changes in the Company's Level 3 financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.
The fair value of contingent consideration obligations includes inputs not observable in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. The amount to be paid under these obligations is contingent upon the achievement of certain growth metrics related to the financial performance of the entities subsequent to acquisition. The fair value of material contingent consideration included in an acquisition is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation. The contingent consideration is revalued each period until it is settled. Management reviews the historical and projected performance of each acquisition with contingent consideration and uses an income probability method to revalue the contingent consideration. The revaluation requires management to make certain assumptions and represent management's best estimate at the valuation date. The probabilities are determined based on a management review of the expected likelihood of triggering events that would cause a change in the contingent consideration paid. The Company develops the projected future financial results based on an analysis of historical results, market conditions, and the expected impact of anticipated changes in the Company's overall business and/or product strategies.
Approximately $10,062 and $10,223 of contingent consideration was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Approximately $2,972 and $8,003 of contingent consideration was recorded in other long-term liabilities as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Disclosure of Fair Values
The Company's financial instruments that are not remeasured at fair value include the Exchangeable Notes (see Note 9). The Company estimates the fair value of the Exchangeable Notes through consideration of quoted market prices of similar instruments, classified as Level 2 as described above. The estimated fair value of the Exchangeable Notes was $102,064 as of September 30, 2020.

12. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION
A summary of equity-based compensation expense recognized during the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 is as follows:
Amounts are included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. Income tax benefits of $604 and $160 were recognized related to equity-based compensation during the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No income tax benefits were recognized related to equity-based compensation during the year ended September 30, 2018.
TRA Non-Participation Compensatory Shares
On June 25, 2018, the Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement as described in Note 10. The Former Equity Owners did not participate in the Tax Receivable Agreement. Therefore, as part of the Reorganization Transactions, the Class B common units held by the Former Equity Owners were converted into shares of Class A common stock based on a conversion ratio that provided an equitable adjustment to reflect the full value of the Class B common units. For employees who are Former Equity Owners, this arrangement was a modification under ASC 718. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $741 as part of the Reorganization Transactions as a result of this conversion.
Stock Options
In May 2018, the Company adopted the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”) under which the Company may grant up to 3,500,000 stock options and other equity-based awards to employees, directors and officers. The number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the 2018 Plan includes an annual increase on the first day of each year, beginning with the 2019 calendar year, equal to 4.0% of the outstanding shares of all classes of the Company's common stock as of the last day of the immediately preceding calendar year, unless the Company’s board of directors determines prior to the last trading day of December of the immediately preceding calendar year that the increase shall be less than 4%. As of September 30, 2020, there were 205,151 options available to grant under the 2018 Plan.
The fair value of stock option awards during the years ended September 30, 2020, and 2019, and from June 20, 2018 through September 30, 2018 was determined on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model based on the following weighted-average assumptions:
_________________
1.Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a selected peer group over a period equivalent to the expected term.
2.The Company has assumed a dividend yield of zero as management has no plans to declare dividends in the foreseeable future.
3.Expected term represents the estimated period of time until an award is exercised and was determined using the simplified method as details of employee exercise behavior are limited due to limited historical data.
4.The risk-free rate is an interpolation of yields on U.S. Treasury securities with maturities equivalent to the expected term.

(in thousands, except warrant, unit, share and per share amounts)
A summary of stock option activity for the year ended September 30, 2020 is as follows:
The weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the year ended September 30, 2020 was $9.07. As of September 30, 2020, there were 5,210,566 stock options outstanding, of which 1,686,957 were exercisable. As of September 30, 2020, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options, including an estimate for pre-vesting forfeitures, was $18,620, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. The Company's policy is to account for forfeitures of stock-based compensation awards as the occur. The total fair value of stock options that vested during the year ended September 30, 2020 was $8,100.
13. STOCKHOLDERS' / MEMBERS' EQUITY AND REDEEMABLE CLASS A UNITS
In connection with the Company’s IPO, the Company’s board of directors approved an amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation”), which became effective on June 25, 2018. The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 150,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, up to 40,000,000 shares of Class B common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each having a par value of $0.0001 per share. Shares of Class A common stock have both economic and voting rights. Shares of Class B common stock have no economic rights, but do have voting rights. Holders of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters presented to stockholders generally. The Company’s board of directors has the discretion to determine the rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of any series of preferred stock.
On June 25, 2018, the Company completed the IPO of 7,647,500 shares of its Class A common stock. In connection with the IPO, the Company and i3 Verticals, LLC completed the Reorganization Transactions, pursuant to which all outstanding vested and non-vested Class A units, Class P units and common units were converted into new Common Units. Former Equity Owners' Common Units were converted into newly issued shares of Class A common stock. Continuing Equity Owners received newly issued shares of Class B common stock. For further descriptions of the IPO and Reorganization Transactions, see Note 1.
i3 Verticals, LLC Recapitalization
As noted above, the i3 Verticals, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement, among other things, appointed the Company as i3 Verticals, LLC’s sole managing member and reclassified all outstanding membership interests in i3 Verticals, LLC as non-voting common units. As the sole managing member of i3 Verticals, LLC, the Company controls the management of i3 Verticals, LLC. As a result, the Company consolidates i3 Verticals, LLC’s financial results and reports a non-controlling interest related to the economic interest of i3 Verticals, LLC held by the Continuing Equity Owners.
The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the i3 Verticals, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement discussed above require i3 Verticals, LLC and the Company, at all times, to maintain (i) a one-to-one ratio between the number of shares of Class A common stock issued by the Company and the number of Common Units owned by the Company and (ii) a one-to-one ratio between the number of shares of Class B common stock owned by the Continuing Equity Owners and the number of Common Units owned by the Continuing Equity Owners (other than shares of the Company's Class A common stock under unvested options

the Company issues, treasury stock and preferred stock (the “Excluded Common Units”)). The Company may issue shares of Class B common stock only to the extent necessary to maintain the one-to-one ratio between the number of Common Units of i3 Verticals, LLC held by the Continuing Equity Owners (other than the Excluded Common Units) and the number of shares of Class B common stock issued to the Continuing Equity Owners. Shares of Class B common stock are transferable only together with an equal number of Common Units of i3 Verticals, LLC. Only permitted transferees of Common Units held by the Continuing Equity Owners will be permitted transferees of Class B common stock.
The Continuing Equity Owners may from time to time at each of their options (subject, in certain circumstances, to time-based vesting requirements) require i3 Verticals, LLC to redeem all or a portion of their Common Units in exchange for, at i3 Verticals, LLC’s election, newly-issued shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis or a cash payment equal to a volume weighted average market price of one share of Class A common stock for each Common Unit redeemed, in each case in accordance with the terms of the i3 Verticals, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement; provided that, at the Company’s election, the Company may effect a direct exchange of such Class A common stock or such cash, as applicable, for such Common Units. The Continuing Equity Owners may exercise such redemption right for as long as their Common Units remain outstanding. Simultaneously with the payment of cash or shares of Class A common stock, as applicable, in connection with a redemption or exchange of Common Units pursuant to the terms of the i3 Verticals, LLC Limited Liability Company Agreement, a number of shares of the Company's Class B common stock registered in the name of the redeeming or exchanging Continuing Equity Owner will be canceled for no consideration on a one-for-one basis with the number of Common Units so redeemed or exchanged.
Redeemable Class A Units
Prior to the Company's recapitalization, as of September 30, 2017, there were 4,900,000 redeemable Class A units issued and outstanding. Upon receipt of a redemption request following the termination of employment of the current Chief Executive Officer of the Company (the redemption event), the Company was required to redeem all of the outstanding redeemable Class A units held by certain members. The redemption price of the redeemable Class A units was equal to the greater of (i) the fair value of the redeemable Class A unit or (ii) original issue price per redeemable Class A unit plus any preferred returns through the date of the redemption request.
Holders of redeemable Class A units had preferred return rights in preference to any declaration or distribution to holders of Class P units or common units, and equal to other Class A units. Preferred returns on the redeemable Class A units accrued at an amount equal to 10.0% per unit per annum of the original issue price, compounded annually, whether or not declared by the board of directors, and were cumulative. After preferential payment to the holder of redeemable Class A units and other Class A units, any additional distributions declared were distributed pro-rata to the holders of Class A units, common units and Class P units, in proportion to their respective units. Total cumulative preferred returns included within the carrying amount of the redeemable Class A units amounted to $3,376 and $2,823 as of June 25, 2018, the date of the Reorganization Transactions, and September 30, 2017, respectively.
During 2017, as obligated under the provisions of its member agreements, the Company declared distributions of approximately $131 to its redeemable Class A unit holders in connection with the members’ estimated tax liabilities.

All Class P units were issued at a participation threshold above the valuation of the Company at the grant date. As a result, they had a nominal value, individually and in the aggregate, at the grant date. Using an option-pricing model and considering liquidation preferences of the Class P units, as well as the lack of marketability, management determined that any compensation expense related to the restricted units was immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.

Litigation
With respect to all legal, regulatory and governmental proceedings, and in accordance with ASC 450-20, Contingencies-Loss Contingencies, the Company considers the likelihood of a negative outcome. If the Company determines the likelihood of a negative outcome with respect to any such matter is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records an accrual for the estimated amount of loss for the expected outcome of the matter. If the likelihood of a negative outcome with respect to material matters is reasonably possible and the Company is able to determine an estimate of the amount of possible loss or a range of loss, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, the Company discloses the estimate of the amount of possible loss or range of loss. However, the Company in some instances may be unable to estimate an amount of possible loss or range of loss based on the significant uncertainties involved in, or the preliminary nature of, the matter, and in these instances the Company will disclose the nature of the contingency and describe why the Company is unable to determine an estimate of possible loss or range of loss.
In addition, the Company is involved in ordinary course legal proceedings, which include all claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings, including unasserted claims, which are probable of being asserted, arising in the ordinary course of business and otherwise not described below. The Company has considered all such ordinary course legal proceedings in formulating its disclosures and assessments.

17. NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST
i3 Verticals, Inc. is the sole managing member of i3 Verticals, LLC and as a result, consolidates the financial results of i3 Verticals, LLC and reports a non-controlling interest representing the Common Units of i3 Verticals, LLC held by the Continuing Equity Owners. Changes in i3 Verticals, Inc.’s ownership interest in i3 Verticals, LLC while i3 Verticals, Inc. retains its controlling interest in i3 Verticals, LLC will be accounted for as equity transactions. As such, future redemptions or direct exchanges of Common Units of i3 Verticals, LLC by the Continuing Equity Owners will result in a change in ownership and reduce or increase the amount recorded as non-controlling interest and increase or decrease additional paid-in capital when i3 Verticals, LLC has positive or negative net assets, respectively.
As of September 30, 2020, and 2019, respectively, i3 Verticals, Inc. owned 18,864,143 and 14,444,115 of i3 Verticals, LLC's Common Units, representing a 61.3% and 52.8% economic ownership interest in i3 Verticals, LLC.

The following table summarizes the impact on equity due to changes in the Company's ownership interest in i3 Verticals, LLC:
During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company corrected for immaterial misstatements of equity between the Company and non-controlling interest related to its June 2019 Secondary Public Offering by increasing non-controlling interest and reducing additional paid-in capital. This adjustment related to immaterial errors associated with the ownership percentage change used in the underlying calculation giving effect to the offering.
18. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net income available to i3 Verticals, Inc. by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net income available to i3 Verticals, Inc. by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding adjusted to give effect to potentially dilutive securities.
Prior to the IPO, the i3 Verticals, LLC membership structure included Class A units, common units and Class P units. The Company analyzed the calculation of earnings per unit for periods prior to the IPO using the two-class method and determined that it resulted in values that would not be meaningful to the users of these consolidated financial statements. Therefore, earnings per share information for the year ended September 30, 2018 represents only the period from June 25, 2018 through September 30, 2018.

The following table sets forth reconciliations of the numerators and denominators used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock:
____________________
1.Basic and diluted earnings per Class A common stock is presented only for the period after the Company’s Reorganization Transactions. As such, net income used in the calculation for the year ended September 30, 2018 represents the net income attributable to Class A common stockholders for the period from June 25, 2018 through September 30, 2018.
2.Excludes 204,969, 282,801 and 299,412 shares of restricted Class A common stock for the years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
3.For the year ended September 30, 2019, all potentially dilutive securities were anti-dilutive, so diluted net loss per share was equivalent to basic net loss per share. The following securities were excluded from the weighted average effect of dilutive securities in the computation of diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock:
a.15,856,855 shares of weighted average Class B common stock for the year ended September 30, 2019, along with the reallocation of net income assuming conversion of these shares, were excluded because the effect would have been anti-dilutive,
b.626,500 options to purchase shares of Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2019, were excluded because the exercise price of these options exceeded the average market price of our Class A common stock during the period (“out-of-the-money”) and the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive, and
c.1,009,858 shares of Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2019, resulting from estimated stock option exercises as calculated by the treasury stock method, and 282,801 shares of restricted Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2019 were excluded because the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive.
4.For the year ended September 30, 2020, the following securities were excluded from the weighted average effect of dilutive securities in the computation of diluted earnings per share of Class A common stock:
a.1,327,500 options to purchase shares of Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2020, were excluded because the exercise price of these options exceeded the average market price of our Class A common stock during the period (“out-of-the-money”) and the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive, and
b.1,179,538 shares of Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2020, resulting from estimated stock option exercises as calculated by the treasury stock method, and 204,969 shares of restricted Class A common stock for the year ended September 30, 2020 were excluded because the effect of including them would have been anti-dilutive.

5.The reallocation of net income assuming conversion of common units represents the tax effected net income attributable to non-controlling interest using the effective income tax rates described in Note 10 above and assuming all common units of i3 Verticals, LLC were exchanged for Class A common stock at the beginning of the year. The common units of i3 Verticals, LLC held by the Continuing Equity Owners are potentially dilutive securities, and the computations of pro forma diluted net income per share assume that all common units of i3 Verticals, LLC were exchanged for shares of Class A common stock at the beginning of the year.
Since the Company expects to settle the principal amount of its outstanding Exchangeable Notes in cash and any excess in cash or shares of the Company's Class A common stock, the Company uses the treasury stock method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per share, if applicable. The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of the Company's Class A common stock for a given period exceeds the exchange price of $40.87 per share for the Exchangeable Notes.
The Warrants sold in connection with the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes are considered to be dilutive when the average price of the Company's Class A common stock during the period exceeds the Warrants' stock price of $62.88 per share. The effect of the additional shares that may be issued upon exercise of the Warrants will be included in the weighted average shares of Class A common stock outstanding-diluted using the treasury stock method. The Note Hedge Transactions purchased in connection with the issuance of the Exchangeable Notes are considered to be anti-dilutive and therefore do not impact our calculation of diluted net income per share. Refer to Note 9 for further discussion regarding the Exchangeable Notes.
Shares of the Company's Class B common stock do not participate in the earnings or losses of the Company and are therefore not participating securities. As such, separate presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share of Class B common stock under the two-class method has not been presented.

21. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Recent Acquisitions
Subsequent to September 30, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of four businesses. The first acquisition is within the Company’s Public Sector vertical and provides software services to public safety and law enforcement customers. The second acquisition is within the Company’s Healthcare vertical and offers medical billing and other software. The third acquisition offers proprietary technology that will augment the Company’s existing platform across several verticals. The final acquisition sells a combination of proprietary and third-party software, which eliminates paper-based systems by creating integrated electronic workflows for courts and government agencies. Total purchase consideration for the four businesses included $59,600 in cash and revolving line of credit proceeds, and an amount of contingent consideration, which is still being valued.
Certain provisions in the purchase agreements provide for additional consideration of up to $30,200, in the aggregate, to be paid based upon the achievement of specified financial performance targets, as defined in the purchase agreements, through no later than April 2023. The Company is in process of determining the acquisition date fair values of the liabilities for the contingent consideration based on discounted cash flow analyses. In each subsequent reporting period, the Company will reassess its current estimates of performance relative to the targets and adjust the contingent liabilities to their fair values through earnings.
The effect of three of the acquisitions will be included in the consolidated statements of operations beginning October 1, 2020. The effect of the fourth acquisition will be included in the consolidated statements of operations beginning November 1, 2020.
The Company is still evaluating the allocations of the preliminary purchase consideration and pro forma results of operations.
