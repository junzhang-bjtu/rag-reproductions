**Introduction**

Reggae has risen, against the odds, to wield a tremendous influence on contemporary popular culture. Despite being initially dismissed even in its land of origin, reggae's liberating message has inspired a broad spectrum of humanity in global superpowers and developing nations alike: freedom fighters, dissidents, dignitaries and above all, ordinary people have rocked to its beat on every continent. Its distinct musical elements increasingly permeate other popular forms: for instance, the dub techniques of Jamaica's pioneering engineers have become the bedrock of modern dance remixes, and sub-genres such as ska, roots and dancehall are the basis of prevalent hybrids abroad. Perhaps most notably, the innovations of Jamaican toasters helped spawn the earliest versions of rap and hip-hop culture, and vibrant cross-fertilization of those forms continues. Though detractors may seek to demean reggae's status, it is evident that it remains a music of great importance; that such an internationally noteworthy innovation has been fostered by the ghetto folk of a small island, born with little more than natural creativity and musical sensibility at their disposal, makes reggae's unlikely rise all the more incredible.

My main motive in writing this book was to allow the men and women, who built the solid foundation upon which the house of reggae music rests, to state their views about its progression and the roles that they played in its formation. Rather than providing a slanted, outsider's view that claims to be a 'definitive' history, this book lets the pioneers of Jamaican popular music use their own voices to tell its tale. And I hoped to answer questions. Who exactly created this remarkable music? Where did these people come from, and how did they become the singers and players, the engineers and producers, the sound system operators and entrepreneurs who fashioned a distinctly Jamaican music? Why did the music take the shape it did, and how did it come to wield such a significant influence – an influence that is sometimes downplayed or glossed over? What were the singers and players trying to express? How do they now feel about the music they created and the chain of events that brought it to the outside world?

I chose an oral history in the hope of presenting as honest and genuine a portrait of the music as possible; first-hand testimony seemed the best way to get there. An oral history also seems to capture the spontaneous circumstances of much reggae invention, and allows the wit and wisdom of its propagators to be better represented. The cadence of Jamaica's spoken patois lends itself more readily to this form than to the dry monotone of a foreign observer seeking to relate events never witnessed and possibly misunderstood. As the people in this book all played important roles in reggae's complex history, they are surely the ones whose voices must be guiding it. Readers will notice that conflicting accounts appear from time to time, notably when the songs in question concern a major shift in style or were particularly popular hits; I have stringently checked conflicting assertions in the hope of presenting information that is as near to accurate as possible.

Another reason for publishing this book is that I wanted to give something back to the originators of music that has been a constant and profoundly moving soundtrack for much of my life. I first became awrare of reggae in my early teens, through the progressive radio stations of the San Francisco Bay area; Junior Murvin's 'Police And Thieves' is among the first tunes I recall. Seeing the films _Tlie Harder They Come_ and _Rockers_ drew me in deeper, as did the early books _Reggae Bloodlines, Catch A Fire_ and _Reggae International,_ but experiencing the floor-shaking reality of Jack Ruby's 50,000-watt sound system in 1982 hooked me completely. Spending several months in London at the age of seventeen was a further revelation: well-established Jamaican communities, vibrant pirate radio stations and the intense festivities of the Notting Hill Carnival brought the context of reggae into clearer focus. It was partly the prominence of reggae that made me base myself in London a few years later, and meeting Lee 'Scratch' Perry shortly after my return in 1987 had all kinds of repercussions on the type of life I have chosen to lead since then. Being part of Scratch's private entourage for a number of years naturally brought me into contact with all manner of reggae folk, yet all this seemed only a minor prelude to the dramatic assault on my senses of subsequent trips to Jamaica, where reggae music is everywhere and cultural revelations abound.

One of the things I have tried to make plain in this book is that reggae is all about connections; its sounds and styles have largely been shaped by select groups of musicians and singers interacting with a small number of producers in different combinations. Finding the characters in this book was often a largely intuitive process, aided by the same connections that are so crucial to the music; this wras particularly true in Jamaica, where the reggae fraternity is very much an extended family. Thus, after taking me to meet producer Bunny Lee, who introduced me to the legendary singer Dennis Brown by telephone, the singer Max Romeo could bring me to guitarist Earl 'Chinna' Smith, who knew where the percussionist Sticky was; Winston Jarrett knew where to find fellow singer Stranger Cole, who directed me to keyboardist Gladdy Anderson. Sometimes, just hanging out at the right spot could work wonders: in an afternoon at Leggo studio on Orange Street I caught toasters U Brown and Tappa Zukie, percussionist Skully and producer Linval Thompson, after mingling with bassist Flabba Holt and trumpeter Johnny Moore next door; at Tuff Gong I encountered singers Albert Griffiths and Carl Dawkins, plus the toaster Dillinger and musicians such as Alva Lewis and Bongo Herman. Having the right connection could really be decisive; for example, Clement 'Sir Coxsone' Dodd refused to give me an interview when I first approached his record shop in New York, but after the Silvertones trio brought me to Studio One in Jamaica he did so without the slightest hesitation.

The earliest interviews I have drawn on in this book began while I was researching _People Funny Boy,_ my biography _of_ Lee 'Scratch' Perry. Scratch's insistence that I was the ghost writer sent to assist the writing of his life story felt like both a blessing and a curse – a cumbersome burden yet at the same time an honour that I could not refuse. Whether the end result was anything close to what either of us had in mind is another matter; nevertheless the quest for knowledge initiated on Perry's behalf was a catalyst that would ultimately lead me to _Solid Foundation._

Just as dub music has taught us that what is absent from a mix is as important as what stays in, one of the hardest parts of assembling this book has been deciding what to leave out. The bulk of the book consists of formal interviews conducted with more than 250 of reggae's prime movers over fifteen years. Suffice to say that for practical reasons I have not been able to include all the material I have compiled, and readers may therefore find that some _of_ their favourite songs or artists are not represented. There were some interviews I was unable to obtain: certain performers died before I had the chance to meet them, others could not be located, and a few declined for reasons best known to themselves or their managers. I am grateful to the few fellow journalists and friends who have allowed me to use extracts from their own interviews, each of which is indicated by a footnote.

This book does not claim to tell the 'complete' story of reggae music. Indeed, as an oral history it has certain natural limitations. Thus the earliest testimony refers to Jamaica's 1930s'j azz scene, with first-hand accounts explaining more fully the postwar R&B, mento and calypso that led directly to the reggae precursors of ska and rock steady; earlier styles from the colonial period, some of which had a decisive impact on reggae, receive only brief mention. Additionally, the book finishes in the mid-1980s, when reggae was on the verge of going digital, as the changes that have come since Jamaican music became computerized are too vast and varied to cover adequately here.

Though I have attempted to highlight the most important songs and styles that made an impact in Jamaica and abroad, this book does not restrict itself to the Jamaican hit parade; equally, while I have never been wilfully obscure, certain lesser-known or forgotten figures are also given voice. The book does not explore in great detail the reggae music that has been made outside Jamaica; though expatriate communities have formed vibrant reggae scenes in London, New York, Miami, Toronto and elsewhere, the reggae of Britain and North America is only commented on where it directly relates to the dominant creations of Jamaica.

This book has taken me to places I surely would not have reached otherwise; much of the journey has been truly wondrous, and all of it highly instructive. I have listened to Ken Boothe sing a chilling a capella in his uptown Kingston front room, eaten roast fish cooked by Congo Ashanti Roy in the ghetto of Independence City, and passed the chalice with several luminaries at the Freedom Sounds yard in Greenwich Farm. I have analyzed the scriptures with Yabby You and Cocoa Tea, debated women's rights with Michael Rose and Junior Reid, and discussed the shortcomings of Western medicine with Augustus Pablo's personal herbalist. I shot the breeze in Gregory Isaacs' shop, swapped African travel stories with U Roy and Niney the Observer, and was regaled by tales of gang warfare from Prince Buster and Big Youth. I drank beer with Rico, sipped vodka with Rupie Edwards, had rum with LKJ, and gnawed sugar cane with Beres Hammond. I traded jazz anecdotes with the Skatalites, dissected rhythmic techniques with Sly and Robbie, learned that Glen Brown's culinary skills are on a par with his music productions, and was treated to the best Chinese meal I'v e ever eaten by Clive Chin. I have met Twelve Tribes, Ethiopian Orthodox, Bobo Dreads, Niyabinghi Theocracy and adherents to other branches of the Rastafari faith. I have pulled the bronze eagle's claw that is the door handle _of_ Edward Seaga's office in New Kingston, heard the frenzied beats of a Pukumina church meeting in Saint Thomas, and been transfixed by the pulsating heartbeat of Niyabinghi groundation drums in Saint Elizabeth. To hear Winston Blake's Merritone sound system at the Turntable club was exquisite; to dance the rub-a-dub in the moonlight at a Sunday night session outside Rae Town's Capricorn Inn was positively heavenly.

In addition to travelling all over Jamaica and spending extended periods in Kingston, this book has brought me to expatriate communities in California, Florida and New York. Almost everyone I came in contact with treated me with the utmost kindness, not only being forthright with tales of their musical careers but welcoming me into their private homes and sometimes their personal lives. Of course, when things did not go according to plan that too became part of the experience. To reach a musician who lived in a remote village I had to drive on dirt roads though a flooded sugar cane estate, guided by an aspiring concert promoter who was apparently the resident 'bad man'. One singer, who lives uptown, insisted on bringing his loaded shotgun when I asked him to drop me at a local bus stop. Another artist invited me to the countryside, but neglected to tell me that on the return journey he and a colleague would be transporting a consignment of counterfeit Gucci bags and the largest quantity of marijuana I have ever seen. As was rightly pointed out by the artist, such experiences helped me see aspects of life normally concealed from the average visitor to Jamaica, and thus understand better the type of tribulation to which the architects of reggae have regularly been subjected.

Overall, I hope this book will contribute to a greater understanding of reggae's complex history, so that the music's significance may be better valued and comprehended. _Solid Foundation_ is also intended to be a testament to the greatness of its originators, whose intense creativity has brought forth such stunning, unique sounds. Reggae sprang from desperation, fashioned by those with little at hand as an expression of their predicament; its rallying cry against injustice and its growing influence ensure that the music will remain a continual source of inspiration.
_I'm going to tell you how reggae music really came about: our foreparents were taken from Africa and sold into slavery out here, that means them lower we down to some lower standard. They carry them to the Indian man's land and call we West Indians, but we know we is not Indians. The white man give we European names, and we know we is not European; we is African descendants, and we don't get African names. Wlien my elders were before me, them try to use this reggae music to establish ourselves, establish a dignity and establish a music that could reach the world, and then the whole world would have to recognize we as a nation – a dreadlocks nation with that light shining upon our hilltop. Our light that we are supposed to shine with the reggae music, it is a light of righteousness, a light of dignity, because that is the only thing that can deliver us from the bondage we find ourselves in._

Yabby You

_Our goal is to have reggae music as exposed as any other music in the world, 'cause it's just as popular as any other music, maybe even more so, but we being a small Third World country, the money power no there behind it to move it. Me know each day the barriers are being broken down bit by bit. It still ain't come yet, but it going come. Right now we still a underground music, a rebel music, which is good, 'cause you have to be a rebel, but you want your work to reach the masses. Every Jamaican musician supposed to have that same hunger to see them work maximize. Not just from a financial standpoint, but from an artistic standpoint, you want your work to go to the widest possible audience._

JAMAICA'S POPULAR MUSIC has undergone a series of labyrinthine changes, part of a process of transformation that mirrors certain aspects of the island's cultural and political growth. Born from the everyday struggles of the dispossessed in a seemingly peripheral island nation, reggae has often been infused with issues of identity and reactions to the centuries of colonialism that have shaped modern Jamaican society. The music's progression charts a complicated course, shadowing the growing pains of a developing nation.

When independence from Britain was achieved in 1962 the island celebrated with ska, a uniquely Jamaican hybrid creation. As ska is intricately connected to the independence movement and was the first Jamaican style to attract significant foreign interest, it is often regarded as the starting point of contemporary reggae. But in order to understand the emergence of ska properly, certain earlier strands of musical culture must be traced. The most important include Jamaican boogie (its immediate predecessor), the sound system culture (the perpetual arbiter ofJamaican musical taste) that has dominated since the 1940s, the earlier thriving urban jazz scenes and the indigenous folk style called mento.

As the present-day inhabitants _of_ the 'Isle of Springs' all have ancestors from somewhere else, its popular culture has a wide range of influences. Though the British maintained the chief colonial presence for over four hundred years, it was the music of black America that provided the strongest model for Jamaica's urban musicians in the 1940s and 1950s – perhaps not surprising, given the proximity _of_ its largest northern neighbour. The USA continues to exercise not only the greatest industrial, financial and military power in the region, but cultural dominance as well: the airwaves of Jamaica and of many other Caribbean nations are disproportionately filled by American radio and television programmes.

Though black American music may have had the strongest influence on Jamaica in the post-war years, other forms were also important. The _son_ and _bolero_ styles of Cuba, the largest Caribbean island nation, sandwiched between Jamaica and the USA, were also highly influential, as was the music of other nearby Latin American countries including Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Panama. Perhaps the most important elements derived from the ancestral homeland of the majority of Jamaica's population: vestiges of African culture have been retained by Jamaican slave descendants to a much larger degree than by their counterparts in the United States. Examples include the drumming of Pukumina church services and that which accompanies rural Junkanoo masquerade dances; such sacred drumming techniques and percussive practices further evolved from the backbone of Jamaica's folk music and ultimately became defining elements of reggae. Other folk elements developed during slavery days were also drawn upon in later urban styles, including the call-and-response chants of work songs and children's ring games and the adaptation of nineteenth-century European dance music known as quadrille.

The fife and drum of quadrille music was a particularly notable influence on mento, a local platform for social commentary originally associated with the Jamaican countryside; though it has certain similarities to the calypso form popular in other English-speaking Caribbean islands, many commentators have noted uniquely Jamaican aspects of mento. In the 1940s, increased migration to kingston brought mento bands with it. These roving groups of troubadours gave informal street performances satirizing current events. The bands used a particular set of instruments that typically included hand drums, banjo and the oversized _kalimba_ or 'rumba box' (a distant relative of the _mbira_ used for bass notes), often with a fife or penny whistle and perhaps a bamboo saxophone. From the early 1950s, mento groups also became regular features on the North Coast hotel circuit.

Among the sawier of Jamaica's city-dwellers, jazz held greater currency. Since at least the 1930s there had been a vibrant, thriving jazz scene, and in the economically buoyant post-war years big band jazz and swing groups remained the most popular music among the upper echelons of society. At high-class clubs and hotel venues bands played American jazz standards and adapted pan-Caribbean forms like calypso and merengue, but the more creative players were forming new variations of jazz through complex original compositions. 'Big band, that music was also our pop music here,' says Winston Blake, operator of Merritone, the longest-running sound system in Jamaica. 'That was the swing era, the big band era: Count Basie, Tommy Dorsey, Stan Kenton, Glenn Miller. The formative bands in Jamaica played that music as dance music'

**Winston Blake [Trax on Wax archives]**

Chief among the island's hotel groups were the Arawaks, featuring pianist Luther Williams, and saxophonist Val Bennett's band. Eric Deans' Orchestra became the most popular live act in Kingston through a long residence at the Bournemouth Club at East Kingston's Bournemouth Beach; Deans was a multi-instrumentalist whose skills on saxophone drew comparison to Glenn Miller. Redver Cook's band was a favourite of the light-skinned upper class and played regularly at a society spot called the Glass Bucket. John Weston's twelve-piece band, Milton McPherson's group, the Baba Motta Quartet, Wilton Gaynair Quintet and Foggy Mullins Trio were among the other popular acts of the period; trumpeter Sonny Bradshaw, formerly active in several of the above, formed the Sonny Bradshaw Seven in the early 1950s after organizing a landmark jazz concert at Kingston's Ward Theatre. Down at the Coney Island amusement park on East Queen Street, a hot house band with a shifting line-up was blowing jazz nearly every night of the week; its members would later emerge as the key set of studio session players once entrepreneurs began recording local talent.

But poor, working-class Jamaicans could not afford these smart venues. Their entertainment was then – and still is now – most often provided by the sound system. These huge sets of sound equipment first appeared on the island after Jamaicans who had gone to Florida or elsewhere in the American South to do casual farm labour attended dance parties held by black Americans. Restaurant owners and other aspiring businessmen had systems with powerful amplifiers sent down from the States, or had powerful sets custom-built in Jamaica, firing up the sound through any number of large speaker boxes; the sheer power and volume of such systems inevitably drew a large audience when booming out at an open-air dance event. The advent of the sound system was extremely important to Jamaica's popular culture, particularly as it was a defining element in setting up the island's home-grown music industry.

Winston Blake's father, a civil servant, established the Mighty Merritone set in 1950 as a way of earning extra pocket money. It was then the first sound system in Saint Thomas parish and considerably smaller than the Kingston sound systems. When Blake Senior died in 1956 at the age of forty-one, Winston and his older brother Trevor took over the set, moving it to Kingston in 1962. More than fifty years after its creation, Merritone is still going strong. Seated under a portrait of Fidel Castro in his uptown Kingston home, the burly, grey-bearded Blake reminisces on the early days of sound system. 'The situation in Jamaica then was that schoolrooms or church halls was where you had social functions. Then you had the most important part of the Jamaican scenario called lawns, like Jubilee Tile Gardens and Chocomo Lawn, big places that were either concrete slab or wire fence, and you'd have a dance in that area, either at the back of a house or the side of a building – a space where you could put up music. You had control, because there was an entrance gate. That's how the sound system started.'

These dances had a low entry price, and the sound systems' mobility and the fact that live musicians were not involved meant they could be set up at country venues that lacked a stage or had only minimal facilities. So this kind of entertainment was accessible to a wide general audience who were often barred from the elite venues where live jazz was featured. 'In Saint Thomas, you have three big dances a year with bands coming in: one for the police and two for the tennis club,' recalls Blake. 'It was like South Africa: only a certain clientele could attend, so "proper" people would go to those dances and the little people were left out. In Kingston, there was the sound system thing – no bands and people on the ballroom floor and others not getting an entertainment, so the sound system started a certain thing in those poorer areas.'

Those who attended sound system events were further inspired by the witty live commentary from the deejays attached to a particular set and by virtuoso dancers. Each sound was associated with a particular area – typically, a tough patch of the ghetto – with a set of fanatically loyal followers attached to it.

By the start of the 1950s, the sound systems made US rhythm and blues the music of the day. 'Rhythm and blues probably crept in here about '49,' says Blake, 'and became an institution in the fifties.' Sound system competition has always been fierce, with exclusivity particularly important. In this early phase the sound men imported records from America, removing the labels from the most prized ones to stop the competition from locating a copy.

'Those days, our records came into the country in two ways,' Blake explains. 'When the ships came in, the guys would go to the whorehouses, and the touts of the sounds used to hang around the whorehouses – that's where they used to get the records to tout to various sound people. Then a lot of our people used to go up to do farm working and carry back records. Later on, there was some station [WLAC] sponsored by Randy's Record Shop out of Tennessee, and you also had a station out of Miami, WINZ, and we could hear those stations just like we pick up the local station. In those days we would listen to WINZ because we only had one radio station at that time, which was ZQI, and we would hear Cuban stations; later in the night, after about twelve or one o'c lock, the Tennessee stations would come in very clear and they would advertise specials, which would include ten records for a price. That's how a lot of records came into Jamaica. Later on, one or two of the guys started to travel, started shopping for these records and carrying them back.'

From at least as early as 1952, confrontations based on exclusive discs were staged between two sets at downtown venues such as the King's Lawn or Pioneer Club. Sound system battles were waged to establish dominance of an area, with the dancing public making clear which of the rivals they felt had a superior selection. The first sound to rise to prominence in the 1940s was Tom the Great Sebastian, established by Tom Wong, the proprietor of a downtown hardware store. Wong was of mixed parentage: his father was a Chinese Jamaican, his mother of African descent. He is said to have taken his professional name from a circus performer.

'Tom was the number one sound,' the former Sebastian selector and sound system legend now known as Duke Vin states unequivocally. 'He started in the early forties, but I wasn't playing from them times. It was rhythm and blues: Louis Jordan, Coleman Hawkins. I used to stand up outside and listen to him play in a club called Young Men's Progressive in Drum-mond Street; it was a club people hire to keep parties, not far from Tom's Hardware Store at Charles Street and Luke Lane.'

**Legendary sound man Duke Vin** [Mamad **Mossadegh]**

In a West London basement flat lined with sheepskin rugs, Vin relates that Tom's popularity was partly due to the steady supply of records sent by a friend in New York. 'He was a top-class tailor, we call him Won. He was along with Tom's sister.' Another element that contributed to Tom's success was his custom Hi-Fi set, designed by an electrical technician named Headley Jones who had trained in the _KAF_ during World War II; his speakers were hung from trees until more powerful free-standing units were constructed. That Tom sometimes strung up the sound at his hardware store was also beneficial; as Vin notes, 'Some evening he hang up the box and play his music, and people gather round and listen, Jamaica style.'

Singer Derrick Morgan moved to Kingston from rural Clarendon as a child in 1943, after a relative noticed how poor his night vision was. 'I'm born in a district called Mucco, where my father was a deacon for the Presbyterian church. My mother was in Vineyard Town before me and they found out that my eyes weren't good; I was born with retinitis pigmentosa, so they sent me up to come to the doctor at the age of three. I stay in Vineyard Town till I was about five and then I live in a big yard they call Orange Lane, downtown in Orange Street.' Steeped in sound system culture, Morgan points out that Tom had predecessors. 'The first set you have in Jamaica was called Waldron,' he insists. 'Tom the Great Sebastian was more popular than Waldron, but Waldron have him sound long before them man, and Waldron used to play just one place on Slipe Road. Orange Street run into Slipe Road, and he was right at Torrington Bridge corner.'

**Derrick Morgan [David Katz]**

By the start of the 1950s Tom had much competition, but he remained the most respected and popular set to the middle of the decade. Prince Buster, who insists Tom was 'the first dance hall sound system in Jamaica', recalls a number of his early rivals. 'The sounds at the time were Count Nick, Dean's sound system – a mighty sound system run by an Indian man at Maxfield Avenue and Spanish Town Road, him had a bicycle shop – Doc's Thunderstorm at Brotherton Avenue, and Mellow Canary is from the beginning, he had a powerful sound in Saint Thomas. Waldron was a good sound and Buckram was off Lyndhurst Road, a little bit above Waldron's place. There was also Sherwood, but Sherwood wasn't a dancehall sound system: him make him sound to make people come in him shop.' Other notable early rivals included Lord Koos and a somewhat upmarket set called V-Rocket. 'V-Rocket didn't carry that heavy beat,' Morgan notes. 'It was a more lighter sound, what we call Hi-Fi. He would play at a venue called Caterers' in Manchester Square, by Heroes Park.'

'I'd say Count Nick was the biggest competition,' says a misty-eyed Duke Vin, 'because the two first sound system clashes in Jamaica was between Tom and Nick in 1952. Tom beat Nick, and the return was up at Nick's yard in Waltham Park Road – Tom beat him both times. Tom was great, man! Him friend send some big tune for him from New York and that night, if you see the crowd...'

Vin was born in Kingston in 1928 and grew up on Wildman Street, 'right beside the Success Club'. He says his Christian upbringing means he does not smoke or drink, but his smiling mouth still often fills with swearwords despite his advanced age, and he continues to operate his sound sporadically. Vin says that in his teenage years, during the 1940s, he was just another of Tom's local supporters until fate intervened in the form of a punctured tyre; Tom was then reaching the height of his popularity and had three separate sound systems. 'I stand up outside Tom's Hardware Store one evening, him car get puncture and him was fighting to take off the tyre with a spring-blade. I come and press my foot on the spring-blade and him say, "Thank you very much, Vinnie man." When him done and fix up him thing, him say, "You think you can handle a sound, play a party down on Princess Street? Come, we go set up the sound next week." The Monday morning after, them come and pay Tom and say, "Who's that likkle fella you send to play the sound? Everybody was clapping and praising him." Tom say, "From now on, you play the number two sound." It's three set him have: when all three play, his brother play the number three, I play number two and Tom play the number one; when people don't book the number two, I play the number one with Tom.'

Tom the Great Sebastian reigned supreme through a varied selection, which included merengue and Latin music as well as the more standard rhythm and blues. Vin recalls that Tom varied his music so as to reach the upper-class sections of his audience, who were less enamoured of the harder rhythm and blues styles favoured by ghetto folk. 'Tom play everything, because the uptown people like those things like "Mockingbird Hill". We also play calypso, like "She 'Pon Top."'

'I enjoyed the way he played his music probably more than any other sound, because he was adventurous,' confirms Winston Blake. 'He used to play merengue, and Spanish music. He played a repertoire, whereas most of the other sounds would play a hard core of slow and fast rhythm and blues, and drop in a few mentos – that was the music in the fifties that was really dominant, and the slow type of New Orleans music'

Duke Reid the Trojan, who used strong-arm tactics to eliminate competition, eventually superseded Tom downtown. The Duke, who was born Arthur Reid in Port Antonio in 1915, served for ten years in the Kingston police force where he rose to the rank of sergeant; it left him with close connections to the criminal fraternity and a lasting love of guns. After Reid's wife Lucille won the national lottery, the couple set up the Treasure Isle liquor store, restaurant and dry cleaners. Though originally operating from a spot on Pink Lane, it was at 33 Bond Street that the Duke based his Trojan sound system, which he operated with selector Leroy 'Cuttings' Cole and another man called Clifford. It quickly became the most successful system in Jamaica, largely because the Duke's notorious henchmen from the nearby slum of Back-O-Wall launched regular attacks to sabotage his rivals.

Some have suggested that Duke Reid made Tom the Great Sebastian flee the downtown Kingston area; others, including Duke Vin, refute the notion. 'Tom and Duke Reid were good friends,' Vin insists. 'Duke Reid don't [sabotage]. The only person who do that is him followers, the rough guys. They'l l do it to other sound men, but they never do that to Tom. Those rough guys know Tom very good, always come to the shop and say, "Wha'p pen Tom, you all right?"'

**Duke Reid the Trojan**

In any case, Tom's general fear of violent conflict made him move his set to the smart Silver Slipper club in the Cross Roads area, away from the downtown trouble spots and closer to the wealthier residences. 'Tom used to play for the aristocratic, up-class people them,' Vin explains. 'He never like to play for the rough guy – him can't take it, he's a coward. I have to face everything for him: when the police raid the dances, me have to go talk to the police. He don't like rough crowd, so he go and play in Slipper because the crowd is more selective.'

Though Vin denies that Duke Reid used intimidation tactics against Tom Wong, he admits that Reid tried to lure him away from Tom's set with the promise of better pay. The pair first became acquainted when Reid was a policeman and Vin was still wearing short trousers. 'Duke Reid know me as a little boy going to Calabar School, on James's Street and Sutton Street. We likkle youth used to romp out of the Central Police Station, that was not far from the school. Him used to like me, so you find that when I play for Tom, he want to take me away to play for him. Tom used to give me thirty shillings a night to play and Duke offer me five pounds, but I never leave Tom. I dedicated to the man, because the man is a good man to me; it's not the money, it's the loyalty. I stick with Tom to the last, until I come to England in 1954.'

It was only after establishing the first sound system in Britain in 1955 that Tom's former selector became known as Duke Vin - the expatriate public were reminded of Duke Reid. Vin clarifies that during all the years he selected for Tom, the Great Sebastian never officially took part in a head-to-head clash with the Trojan; the closest was when the two sounds were set up at separate parties in adjacent yards. 'It was in the late part down in 1953,' he explains. 'We play next door to each other in Jones Town – me over there so, him here so. Tom have a steel [speaker] and turn it to Reid, Reid have a steel and turn it to Tom, and the crowd come to our dance and Reid flopped. It was fun. We played R&B: Smiley Louis, Fats Domino, James Wayne's "Tend To Your Business", "Little Red Rooster", the Griffen Brothers.'

Jamaica's first commercial station, Radio Jamaica Rediffusion (RJR), was launched in 1950; its broadcasts were supplied to listeners by an inexpensive cable subscription service after a British firm took over the former government station ZQI. Later in the decade, both Tom and Duke sponsored radio programmes to help keep their sound systems in the minds of the public. 'Duke Reid had a programme called _Treasure Isle Time,_ and Tom the Sebastian had a programme called _Sebastian Time,'_ recalls Winston Blake. 'They would play all the new records and tell them where the sound system was playing over the weekend.' But down in Kingston's slum areas, different kinds of battles were being waged.

The early onset of sound-system violence drew definite results, first as Duke Reid carved out a gradually widening territory. Following the Duke's lead, King Edwards the Giant used bullying tactics to secure sound-system glory. The set was established in 1955 by Vincent Edwards, with selector Red Hopeton; Edwards also built up a rough crew that was adept at spoiling dances held by rival sets, and their activities greatly assisted his rise to the top by 1959. As for the pioneering Great Sebastian set, it came to a tragic end in the early 1960s when Tom Wong committed suicide, apparently due to relationship problems rather than to the financial difficulties that have been reported elsewhere. 'He didn't have no debts,' Duke Vin insists. 'He got money, he loaded, but he kill himself because of his wife.'

Derrick Morgan started singing professionally at the age of seventeen; forty-five years later he continues to give energetic stage performances, and was recently awarded the Order of Distinction for his contribution to Jamaica's popular music. Morgan says his debut recording was a sound system exclusive that ultimately helped King Edwards retain popularity. 'I started on the _VereJohns' Opportunity Hour_ at the Palace Theatre; they had double-bill [film] shows [on] the night and a half-hour contest in between. I compete against Monty Morris, Owen Gray, Wilfred Edwards, Hortense Ellis, and I came in first imitating Little Richard. Bim and Bam, the comedians, they hear me at the show and took me on, and I used to go around with them doing stage shows. I stay with them for two years, then '59 I start recording. After hearing Owen Gray, Wilfred Edwards, Higgs and Wilson coming over the radio, I asked them how them get through with it and they wouldn't tell. After a while, I heard of Duke Reid doing auditions, so I wrote "Lover Boy" and "Oh My" and take it by Duke; him say I must come to the rehearsal at Majestic Theatre with Drumbago and the All Star band. I went and rehearsed with them, that was a Wednesday, and we recorded it Thursday at Federal; Saturday I heard my song "Oh My" on the radio, on Duke Reid's _Treasure Isle Time,_ at four in the evening. Now we call it dub plate, but we used to call it soft wax [acetate]; the public couldn't get those songs in their home to play. Duke Reid give "Lover Boy" to King Edwards to play on his sound as they were friends, and Edwards used to play on a corner they call S-corner – at Tewari Crescent, off Spanish Town Road, the road set like an S. This dancehall was right on S-corner, and "Lover Boy" was the top sound on that comer; Edwards would be playing that song all the while.'

Morgan adds that a number of smaller sets, popular with an upscale crowd, were established at this time on the northern borders of Central Kingston. 'Caterers' and number one Lissant Road, those are the two places those Hi-Fi play, like Billy's Hi-Fi, Thunderbird, El Suzy and El Toro, younger sounds than Duke Reid; those are the sound that celebrity people go to, you don't have the ragamuffin dance there. V-Rocket was the top of them, he spin the music better and he have a double-changer [two turntables]; what we calling mix now, they doing that from the early sixties.'

Before the rise of King Edwards the Giant, the most notable challenge to the downtown hegemony of Duke Reid was posed by Sir Coxsone's Downbeat. The set was established by a young friend of the Reids named Clement Dodd, born in Kingston in 1932 and nicknamed Coxsone after an English cricketer. Dodd's selector was Count Machuki, an innovative, jive-talking toaster who had honed his microphone skills on Tom the Great Sebastian's set; his off-the-cuff wisecracks and Coxsone's supreme record collection made the Downbeat sound a formidable contender.

Seated in the dishevelled Kingston office that was once his base of operations, and flanked by deejay King Stitt and other associates, Sir Coxsone details the family fondness for the exciting sounds of rhythm and blues. 'My father was a contractor mason, he built the Carib Theatre and other country theatres. My mother eventually ran a liquor store, but it started out from a little restaurant on Lawes Street and Ladd Lane called Nanny's Corner. This is going back to 1951. We used to play music in the place on a Morphy Richards radio, play Billy Eckstine, Sarah Vaughan, Lionel Hampton and Louis Jordan. My mother loved music, was a great dancer and won many prizes.'

In the early 1950s, Dodd worked as a farm labourer in the USA and began to think about going into the music business after seeing money being made at outdoor block parties. Coxsone explains that it was because of his family association with the Reids that he made his first guest appearances on the Trojan set, and infers that this relationship may have helped keep their rivalry on a more civilized level after he established the Downbeat set. 'Duke was a close friend of the family. Mom and Dad knew him well, and his signature tune was given to him by my mother: "My Mother's Eyes", an instrumental by [alto saxophonist] Tab Smith. I was a cabinetmaker and I did a course on automobile mechanics, used to train at the Ford garage on Church Street. I attended a lot of orchestra dances in the early days, but when the rhythm and blues came in about '53 or '54, I used to attend dances when Duke was playing and play some of my sides. His fans always look forward to seeing me coming with my little case of records, so I eventually went into the sound thing myself. My memories of the days of Duke and meself, it was like a musical challenge.'

Duke Vin contradicts part of Coxsone's account, claiming it was Tom the Great Sebastian who sold Reid his treasured signature tune. 'It was 1951,' Vin insists. 'Reid come to him and ask if him have any old record to sell and Tom said, "I have a few that I don't use." Tom use "Blue Moon" as him sign-on tune. When him sell Duke Reid "My Mother's Eyes", Duke Reid use it as a signature tune and it become a hit as a sign-on. That time Coxsone never have no sound at all. I was there when Tom was selling the record.'

Another associate, too, does not recall that the family friendship kept Coxsone's and Duke Reid's rivalry 'clean' – quite the opposite. Prince Buster, born Cecil Bustamante Campbell in downtown Kingston in 1938, speaks of violence and sabotage. Dodd, he says, recruited him from an area associated with those loyal to Duke Reid because of his reputation for toughness. 'I born and grow on Orange Street, right there in West Kingston. Coxsone grow in Saint Thomas, Duke Reid come from Port Antonio, so I am the only one born on Orange Street. My father work with the railroad, my mother work at the match factory and my parents grew me up with a strict principle of Christianity. How I came to work with Coxsone was that on Luke Lane and Charles Street corner, there was two set of gangsters, and one night Noel Horse Jaw and them big men were gambling, playing Parapinto dice. I had some money, asked them if I can join the game and I broke the whole of them – lucky for me, the dice was rolling my way that night. When I start to scrape up the money, one of them named Mean Stick just fling up a foot and kick the felt hat offa me head. The whole _of_ them draw them knife and I couldn't see where my money went to. A week after, I was in my bathroom at Drummond Street and someone call me and say, "Them 'pon the corner!", so I just draw on the clothes _on_ my wet skin and come out and chase Mean Stick with me knife in me hand, and Coxsone and Count Machuki was coming down Luke Lane. Machuki told me later that as Coxsone was scared of people like Mean Stick, it shocked him. He said to Machuki, "Who's the little youth?" Machuki said, "Oh, we grew him, that's who you want to have on your side to take the face off Duke Reid." Then Machuki come to me and say Coxsone want to see me, so me and some youth go in him shop, have some nice drink, and him nice and friendly and say he would like me to move with him, but 1 wouldn't tell him yes. I went back on my corner at Luke Lane and Charles Street and have a meeting writh the youths, and then 1 start to stay at Love Lane and Beeston Street; this was about '57–' 58.'

**Prince Buster live in London, early 1960s, with trombonist Rico Rodriguez at right [Archive du Peuple]**

Buster emphasizes that, though he knew shifting his allegiance could endanger his personal safety, he felt compelled to do so as he bore a lasting grudge against the Duke. 'The only sound system I backed before was Tom the Great Sebastian, which is still the greatest sound system ever, and then Duke Reid ran him out _of_ town. I had vengeance in my heart for Duke Reid, 'cause that man Tom was a nice, decent, calm, respectable man who want to just play music, but Duke Reid come with a band of Back-O-Wall bad man to the dance, they jump the fence and pull over the amplifier, mash up the boxes. Brother Baby Wire, who just die the other day, him was the 'Don' of Back-O-Wall. When him and Rushy and Big Boy them take off at night time, Coxsone haffe jump fence! When wrord reach Duke Reid's camp that I am at Coxsone's sound system, the problem that arise is that I grow with these men, but I'd have to oppose them now because them is Duke Reid's people.'

The conflict rapidly escalated when Coxsone and Duke Reid fought each other in a sound system clash – Buster even resorted to breaking Duke Reid's stylus. 'The first night I went out with Coxsone is a drama, because when the time come for Duke Reid to come on, I tell Machuki, "Don't sign off, continue to play more." Machuki go to play and I scratch [Reid's ] needle, and Duke Reid can't come on. I don't know why I do it, just that this is the thing wha' haffe do and I haffe do it. Duke Reid, when [I] scratch him needle, about half an hour gone, then after him start, we still a play. Duke Reid had a song named "Hey Mr Berry", and Coxsone couldn't find that tune in all his searches of America, so it was Duke Reid's top tune. When he put on the tune, that actually hurt Duke Reid the next day, because the whole town thought Coxsone was playing it. Right there now, the charge of the Back-O-Wall brigade coming to the amplifier that we set up with Machuki, so that was the first forceful demonstration against the criminals them. I was forced that night – for although it's them who grow me and them know me temperament – I flash my knife wild. This is how Coxsone get to become recognized, because the people who want to come to him dance didn't come 'cause them was 'fraid of getting hurt, but because them hear me and other Duke Reid youth now with Coxsone, his dance start to full.'

Buster's formal acceptance within the ranks of Coxsone's camp seems to coincide roughly with a shift in the nascent Jamaican record industry: calypso and mento were being usurped by Jamaican rhythm and blues as a direct byproduct of sound system activity. Members of the Jamaican business community, often of Middle Eastern or Asian origin, were releasing records by the early 1950s. Mento and calypso had been recorded and sold in Jamaica at least as early as 1952, when Jewish Jamaican businessman Stanley Motta issued 78 rpm records on the MRS (Motta's Recording Studio) label by artists such as Lord Fly and the Dan Williams Orchestra, Harold Richardson and the Ticklers, Lord Composer and His Silver Seas Orchestra, and Monty Reynolds' Calypso Clippers featuring singer Boysie Grant. Though Motta's main business was supplying Kodak photographic goods, he also sold records in his store and had a room at the back with a piano, one microphone and primitive recording equipment. Motta had to send the material to Britain to have his records mastered and pressed before being shipped back to Jamaica – a costly and time-consuming process.

'In those days, there was only one recording studio in Jamaica,' says singer Laurel Aitken. 'That was Stanley Motta on Harbour Street. In those days recording wasn't a business – it was more live music' Resident in England since the early 1960s, Aitken is still recording and performing in his seventies; he was born in Havana in 1927 and moved to Kingston at the age of eleven. 'My dad is Jamaican, my mom is Cuban,' he explains, 'and my dad just wanted to go back home.' By 1952, Aitken was a popular figure on talent shows. 'I used to sing from [when I was] a little boy in Cuba, and when I came to Jamaica there was nothing like ska. You had to sing jazz and calypso, which come from Trinidad. I sang "Blue Moon", "Embraceable You", and I won three big contests in Kingston with "Pennies From Heaven". At the time, I used to work with the Jamaica Tourist Board, welcoming people with a big broad hat at the wharf when the ships come in, singing calypsos: "Welcome to Jamaica", "Jamaica Farewell", "Coconut Woman", and they fling money and give me.'

Aitken says his recording debut, at Motta's studio, was a self-produced effort. 'The first recording that I did, I did it for myself, that was a song called "I Met A Senorita". I used my own money and got my own musicians – nobody that's living now. The saxophonist [went by] the name of "Number One" – he was well known in those days. Then I did a merengue, "Merenguitu", and it was released by a man that had a record shop on King Street, by the name of Mr DePass.'

After establishing a residency at the Colony club in Half Way Tree, Aitken recorded further material. His first substantial hit was released by Dada Tewari, another early entrepreneur cutting local product using basic equipment. A Jamaican of Indian descent, Tewari first operated from a small downtown base. By 1956 he had formed the Caribbean Recording Company to release mento and calypso on the Caribou label, later issuing some of the earliest Jamaican R&B recordings as the style moved to the forefront of the Kingston music scene. Tewari has also been named as the first person in Jamaica to have mastering capabilities, but a fire at his Torrington Road premises resulted in his early departure from the music business. 'Dada Tewari was well dressed all the time, with necktie and suit,' recalls Laurel Aitken. 'V-Rocket used to be a top sound, he heard me doing a rehearsal and said, "I'l l take you to see Dada". I did quite a lot [of songs], but the biggest one I did for him was "Roll Jordan Roll", my first big hit in Jamaica.'

The duo of Noel 'Zoot' Sims and Arthur 'Bunny' Robinson – known first as Sims and Robinson and later as Bunny and Skully – were the first Jamaican artists to record blues ballads and home-grown R&B, initially for exclusive sound system acetates. 'We started off the first recording in Jamaica on soft wax, for Dada Tewari,' the now partially sighted Skully wistfully recalls, perched on the kerb outside Kingston's Sonic Sounds. 'We did the first recordings in 1953 at a little demo studio at the corner of Hanover Street and Lawes Street – he had a little matches box with quarter-inch tape, but he used to do calypso recording in there with Count Lasher [Terence Parkins], Lord Flea [Norman Thomas], Count Owen [Owen Emanuel] and Lord Tanamo' [Joseph Gordon].

Skully remembers cutting only two songs at this initial session: 'End Of Time' and 'Give Me Another Chance'. 'That was the first tunes made apart from Calypsonians,' he recalls proudly. 'That was the first R&B.' According to Skully, Tewari was not present during the session, which was arranged by the resident pianist. 'He really wasn't so much of a producer,' says Skully of Tewari. 'It was an Indian who owned the theatre that they call Tivoli. Williams played keyboard and you had Lloyd Brevett's father playing bass, a drummer by the name of Percy, and Val Bennett played the saxophone. I don't know if him release them, but we got £37 – 'nough money for me and Bunny.'

Skully was born in 1935 in an area west of Kingston that was then called Smith Village; when the district's population swelled and it became part of the Kingston conurbation it was renamed Denham Town. He and Bunny were school friends who launched their singing careers 'when the first talent show come to Jamaica, which was Vere Johns – he used to write for the _Gleaner._ We was the champion for two years straight. We do rhythm and blues songs – all Jamaican artists in those days try to do rhythm and blues.' The pair favoured slow ballads and were not averse to covering mainstream hits from white America. Skully says that, in these early days, the group concentrated more on live performances than on recording. 'We keep going to shows on the North Coast, but we did not do much more recording because it wasn't popular like now.'

**Noel 'Zoot' Sims, aka Skully: first Jamaican blues on wax [David Katz]**

Skully says a big influence from this era was his neighbour Lord Flea, star of the film _Bop Goes Calypso._ He names Flea as 'the first artist in Jamaica to make a big hit. He was a born Jamaican, start him career at the corner of Regent Street and North Street where they had a little night club, the Esperanza. Then he go to Back-O-Wall and form a little band for himself, and go on the North Coast and sing at hotels before he did the film.'

Flea's main role models were Slim Beckford and Sam Blackwood, street singers active in Kingston in the 1930s. 'Slim and Sam were the two men who start music in Jamaica on the streetside of Spanish Town Road,' says Skully, 'one playing guitar and both of them sing in harmony. The songs that they sing, they have it on paper, printed out, and sell it for a penny – that was their livelihood for years. They used to sing songs like "Man Piabba, Woman Piabba" [a Caribbean folk song], and sometimes Negro spiritual songs.'

Skully could not confirm whether Tewari issued either of their debut recordings, but other singers remember 'End Of Time' as a popular hit in Jamaica. Another early Sims and Robinson number, 'Silent Dreams', is said to have been released on a 78 by Kenneth Khouri and his wife Gloria, founders _of_ the Federal recording studio and group _of_ labels.

Though Stanley Motta is most often cited as the primary issuer of Jamaican recordings, Ken Khouri claims to have been the first. 'He came in long after me,' Khouri insists, 'and that was just a little voice recording set-up he had. Tewari is about two years after. I am the complete pioneer _of_ everything.'

At eighty-four, Ken Khouri is certainly an elder statesman in the Jamaican music industry; he was part _of_ its inception, and was inducted at Jamaica's Hall of Fame for his contributions in January 2001. 'I was born in Kingston in 1917,' he recalls at his uptown Kingston home. 'I had three sisters and I'm the only boy. My father was born in Lebanon, came to Jamaica with his parents when he was twelve. My mother was born here, she was of Cuban parents. When I was growing up, my father had a dry goods stores in the country and a furniture store in Kingston.'

Instead of joining the family business Ken went to work for Joseph Issa, the son of a Syrian immigrant who had established a leading dry goods business; the family would later control a number of luxury hotels. 'His father came and opened a dry goods store and it mushroomed; then the sons took over. I used to work in the office there, controlling the goods that came in. Then I had a furniture business myself at West Street, but I didn't like it. I was born musically [inclined], so that's why I went into the music business. It happened by accident in Miami: I took my father there for his illness and I met someone who was selling a recording machine - a disc recorder; I bought it and came back to Jamaica. I used to go around recording calypsos at different night clubs; the first recording was with Lord Flea, "Where Did The Little Flea Go?" [aka 'Naughty Little Flea']. The discs that I made, I send them as masters to Decca in England, and they made a record out of it and send it down to me.'

'Naughty Little Flea' surfaced on a Capital 78; other Lord Flea sides, plus at least eight 78s by fellow Calypsonian Hubert Porter, were issued by Khouri on Times records, distributed from a variety store on King Street. 'Times Store belonged to Alec Dune – they distributed my first calypso records. All the Hubert Porter, I record them in a studio that I built up myself, in 129 King Street: Records Limited. I brought down equipment from California, just one microphone, one track.' Records Limited controlled the Kalypso label, Khouri's vehicle for calypso 78s. The company also coordinated releases for concerns like Count Lasher's Lasher Disc and Chin's label releases by the Calypso Sextet, featuring a certain A. Bedasse; the Chin's material was backed by Stanley Chin, owner of a radio repair service. Khouri also arranged the first Trojan and Hi Lite 78s, pressed exclusively for Duke Reid's sound system and featuring vocalist Lord Power.

In September 1954 Khouri set up the Pioneer company, securing the Jamaican manufacturing and distribution rights for Mercury records after travelling to New York. 'I used to have franchises from the States, and the first records I put out were "Skokian", [the Chords'] "Sh-Boom" and [the Gaylords'] "The Little Shoemaker".' He brought the first record-pressing equipment to Jamaica while still based on King Street, and subsequently moved to an industrial area west of the wharf to establish Federal, the first fully fledged recording studio and pressing facility on the island. 'I had pressing equipment from 129 King Street,' he recalls, 'where the little studio was, then I moved to the industrial estate at Marcus Garvey Drive in 1957.' For his resident sound engineer Khouri chose Graeme Goodall, an Australian radio technician trained in London who initially came to Jamaica to help set up RJR's cable service. Khouri's sons Richard (born in 1943) and Paul (born in 1946) also joined the business at an early age.

The establishment of Federal gave entrepreneurs greater scope to record local talent; the monophonic studio at radio station RJR was also occasionally used for recording in this period. Gradually, the leading sound system operators saw the potential benefits of recording boogie and R&B with local musicians. Coxsone Dodd says he was recording acts at Federal by 1956, and Skully notes that Dodd was quick to make further use of his group's talents. 'After it start to develop, we did some more recording for Clement Dodd, otherwise known as Coxsone. We started working for Coxsone about '55 – do a few originals and some foreign stuff.'

It is said that much locally created non-calypso music at first remained exclusive to the sound system, and was not pressed for general release. The turning point seems to have been 1957, when Caribou released 'Aitken's Boogie'. The song was a local variant of the type of rhythm and blues that originated in New Orleans – black American music with a pronounced, shuffling beat – and was a template for much of what would follow. 'That was done for Tewari as well, with the same band with Number One,' notes Laurel Aitken, 'and Crackers was the drummer.'

The enthusiastic reception given by Jamaican dance fans to such locally recorded material meant it was only a matter _of_ time before the prominent sound system figures began issuing Jamaican boogie records. Towards the end of the decade Duke Reid, Coxsone Dodd, King Edwards and Lloyd 'the Matador' Daley were all issuing material on seven-inch 45 rpm singles. They were followed shortly by a handful of other business entrepreneurs including Vincent 'Randy' Chin, a record shop owner whose carpenter father had left mainland China in the 1920s to settle in Jamaica after a brief stay in Cuba; Chris Blackwell, the son of a wealthy Jamaican Jewish mother and a military English father; and Edward Seaga, a Harvard-educated anthropologist of Anglo-Syrian and part-African origin, whose father ran a lucrative travel agency.

Seaga, of course, is better known for his highly active role in the nation's politics, as he has been one of the most prominent members of the conservative Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) since the early 1960s; he was Prime Minister from 1980 to 1989, and has since been leader of the opposition. Though his involvement in Jamaica's music industry was brief and happened almost incidentally, his contribution to its development was an important one that was linked to his early political career.

**Edward Seaga: the juncture of music and politics [David Katz]**

At his office in New Kingston the JLP leader, now in his seventies, is surrounded by framed photographs of himself grinning in harmony with such right-wing luminaries as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. Seaga explains that he went into the music business after conducting research into African-Jamaican religious practices; his field recordings of folk music were issued in 1956 as _From The Grass Roots Of Jamaica_ on the Smithsonian Folkways label of New York. 'It took three-and-a-half years, because I lived in the communities – was a part of the regular life of the communities – in one rural and one urban setting. I finished the research, but I never used it to get a PhD, because there were no postgrad degrees being given in Jamaica at that time. Smithsonian Folkways were about the only one I knew of who would publish folk music, so I visited them, saw the mass of albums that they had done and this fitted right into that category.'

Seaga recalls that it was an attempt to distribute the record in Jamaica that brought him into the music industry. 'When the album was out in about '56,1 was interested in having the material exposed to people – what's the use of doing research and nobody knows about it? I took it around to music stores – Stanley Motta's on Harbour Street, KG's at Cross Road and Wonard's on Church Street - but they weren't too interested. It was a little bit too way out for them. Then they asked me if I could import other types of music for them, which I did. They wanted stuff like Pat Boone and Nat King Cole, but there was also a very strong interest in rhythm and blues music, like [Marvin and Johnny's ] "Cherry Pie", Professor Longhair, people like those. I found a source for that kind of music: Savoy Records, up in the northern part of Manhattan, and I brought them in, artists like Fats Domino, Stevie Wonder, Wilbert Harrison's "Kansas City", in lots of fifty or one hundred – if it was a big hit, two hundred and fifty. And there would be repeat orders after a certain time.'

Before long, Seaga turned to the domestic manufacturing of foreign material. 'I became an agent for Columbia, Atlantic, ATCO, Epic – probably more labels than anybody else. Then I had a manufacturing operation and there was only one other manufacturer, Khouri – Federal records, but he was more interested in calypsos and mentos. He started two years before me, but they were manufacturing for the tourist market.'

Seaga established his manufacturing base at 13 Bell Road, in the same industrial area as Federal. The next step, naturally, was that Seaga would begin to produce local artists, issuing the work from 1958 on a label called WIRL (West Indies Records Limited). After hearing the duo of Joe Higgs and Roy Wilson at a talent contest, Seaga brought them into the studio to cut 'Manny Oh', a landmark recording as one of the earliest hits by a local Jamaican act. 'The popular music for the masses was rhythm and blues,' Seaga recalls, 'and from that, young Jamaicans began to compose their own rhythm and blues-type music – not exactly the same beat, but that type of music. And I happened to be around at that time, importing and selling rhythm and blues and other types of music. Youngsters were now beginning to compose, but they didn't have an outlet other than to be able to sing on the radio or in live performance. The first popular hit song from those competitions was a song called "Manny Oh". I went to one of the performances at Ward Theatre, because of my interest in the music. I didn't go there with the idea of looking for a song to produce, but when I heard it and heard the audience response, I thought why not try producing it? I spoke with the writer Jackie Edwards, and the singers Higgs and Wilson, about recording it, and we worked out a good arrangement.'

Seaga says he actively supervised the recording session, but notes that the artists themselves selected the musicians. 'That was done at RJR,' he clarifies, 'that big studio they had there. It opened the door, because Jamaicans now realized that they could not only compose and sing their music, but they could get it reproduced on records – it could go on the air and they were on their way. That one effort on record really opened the door for what followed as Jamaican music, and from there it blossomed into different beats.'

Though 'Manny Oh' made quite an impact, Seaga says sales figures have been exaggerated. 'It never sold that many,' he insists. 'I'v e seen figures from other people writing about it, saying it sold thirty thousand copies, but I doubt that. I don't think anything sold thirty thousand copies until much later in the development of the music'

Despite working with other popular artists such as Slim Smith, Seaga says other commitments resulted in him leaving the music industry within a year or two of the success of 'Manny Oh'. 'I didn't do too much after that, because I was moving away from commercial activities to political life.' Seaga was appointed to the Legislative Council in 1959 and shortly afterwards purchased Chocomo Lawn, using it as a base to meet the public. 'Chocomo Lawrn was the first dancehall in Jamaica,' he explains. 'Dances before that wrould take place in back yards, yards with enough space that you could set up your sound and so on, but the first dedicated location that was a dancehall only was Chocomo Lawn. I bought it somewhere around the turning of that decade, because I needed space for the activities. I was using it as my political office, but that was just where I would see people who needed to see me.'

And why, exactly, did Edward Seaga want to leave the academic and commercial worlds he had already tried and enter politics? 'The research that I had done had given me a whole range of new experiences that made me have the benefit of seeing life in a different wTay, from the point of view of the people in folk society,' he explains with gravity. 'Politics is all about dying to better the life of people, especially the people who constitute the majority. And on that basis, I found myself being able to contribute. I gravitated to politics because that's where I could do things that would make a difference.' His role in the music industry, he states, 'wasn't a career objective. It was just something I got involved in out of interest. But when it became a commercial activity, it didn't replace the original interest that I had in folk ways and wanting to do something for the betterment and improvement of the lives of the people. Chris Blackwell and I were at that time mostly doing the same thing; he started a little after I did. I could have continued along that route, and today I guess I would have been like him. But he chose the private life, I chose the public one.'

Meanwhile, developments on the Jamaican airwaves helped the island's homegrown music industry to expand. In September 1959 a second radio station was opened, the government-owned Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation (JBC); its premises were quickly used by entrepreneurs recording Jamaican boogie. In the early 1960s Sonny Bradshaw established _Teenage Dance Party,_ a weekday programme showcasing domestic product; but despite this show's extreme popularity, most radio airplay remained resolutely foreign.

It has been reported elsewhere that the first locally made song aired on JBC was Laurel Aitken's 'Boogie Rock', but Aitken says the song in question was 'Boogie In My Bones', the first hit single produced by Chris Blackwell. It entered the JBC chart in October 1959 and stayed at number one for thirteen weeks. 'Chris came to see me one day, he say, "You been doing quite a few things recently and I like them, I'v e got to do something with you," and I say, "Quite possible,"' Aitken recalls. 'When Chris came the second time, we went to a bar with a piano and I played him a few of the things that I have written. He said, "I'v e got a band I would like you to meet." They was five white guys – I think they were Canadian. We went to JBC with a friend of mine, [saxophonist] Caroll McLaughlin, and I did "Boogie In My Bones" and "Little Sheila".'

'Little Sheila' reached the Jamaican charts too, but 'Boogie In My Bones' was the more substantial hit. Aitken quickly tried to reproduce the formula with 'Boogie Rock', one of a handful of tunes cut with a group dubbed the Boogie Cats for aspiring producer Ruddy Abrahams, whose Downbeat label releases were pressed by Tewari's Caribbean Recording Company; other numbers included 'I'm Crying Over You' and the mento-styled 'Baba Kill Me Goat'.

Though Jamaican boogie may have been little more than a crude attempt to emulate the music of the American South, these early recorded efforts were exciting and retain a distinctly Jamaican feel. The Duke Reid Group's earliest instrumentals, such as 'What Makes Honey' and 'Joker', were fairly unadorned eight- or twelve-bar blues numbers set to a loping beat; Laurel Aitken's 'More Whiskey' and 'Low Down Dirty Girl' (featuring a hot sax solo from Trenton Spence) were much the same, though 'Daniel Saw The Stone' and 'Judgement Day' (backed by guitarist Ken Richards and His Harmonisers) drew from church music. Subsequent Duke Reid productions, such as 'Blackberry Brandy' and 'Yard Broom', used the shuffling boogie blues beat as a platform for expressive soloing by saxophonist Roland Alphonso, whilst drummer Arkland 'Drumbago' Parks' 'Duck Soup' was a somewhat more competent effort augmented by vibrant African hand-drumming. Such early attempts reveal an emerging style, as Jamaicans grappling with African-American rhythms sowed the seeds of a national genre. In contrast, many early Coxsone productions consisted of slower, softer, American-styled R&B ballads such as Alton and Eddie's 'Muriel' and Tony Gregory's 'Baby Come On Home', though other numbers like Lascelles Perkins' 'Lonely Robin' were also mutations of the shuffle mode.

Simeon L. Smith was another early entrepreneur who found success with ballads and mutated blues at the end of the 1950s. At his home in the Bronx, Smith says it was a regular source of records from New Orleans that helped him find a way into the music business. 'I'm from Manchester, a little district called Harry Watch; I come to Kingston when I was seventeen, had a lot of family to welcome me there. Me and a friend named Delfos worked at the wharf together and he has a sound system called Deltone in Mountain View Avenue. I used to be more a business person, so I used to get records from a fellow who come on the SS _America_ every two weeks: Fats Domino, Shirley and Lee. Then I opened a record shop, Hi-Lite Music Store, at the corner _of_ Harris Street and Spanish Town Road. I had a haberdashery also, a hardware store and a wholesale liquor store.'

Naturally Hi-Lite became a focal point for budding local talent, prompting Simeon to launch the Smith's label. 'My place full of young people. I buy an old piano and have a place next door where everybody practise. I put on a lot of shows, helping the artists to make some money. I used to be in my shop every day, have a Grundig tape recorder, and several [singers] would come by and say them have a tune. I would take them in my car up to a man in Hagley Park Road that have a old piano who can play good, practise with them and it grows. First session was with Owen Gray, at JBC studio with Sonny Bradshaw. The first big hit was Keith and Enid, "Worried Over You". They went to Federal records and Federal said they'r e singing too soft. Nobody wanted to record them, because recording business was like Laurel Aitken and heavy beats. But I love harmony and ballads, so I break with "Worried Over You" and make everybody worried.'

This soft duet, backed by tenor saxophonist Trenton Spence's group, topped the Jamaican charts in 1960. It was one of the first recordings licensed to Blue Beat, the subsidiary of Melodise records specifically designed for Jamaican product; the label would later be largely devoted to Prince Buster's output. Emil Shalit, an Eastern European Jewish immigrant, founded Melodise in 1949 as one of the first companies to issue black music in Britain; he was also involved in the pressing of the earliest Jamaican calypso discs. 'Shalit used to do the calypso business with Khouri,' says Simeon Smith. 'He came out and heard about ["Worried Over You"]; Sonny Bradshaw put him on to me and I gave him the rights to release the record in London. Then I start to do a whole lot.'

Smith's next substantial hit wras 'Fat Man' by Derrick Morgan, again backed by Trenton Spence, which blended the cadence of Cuban _bolero_ with the structure of American blues. Morgan recalls that 'Fat Man' was his first recording to gain an official release. 'After I do "Lover Boy" and "Oh My", I find Patsy, which is Millicent Todd. Her mum, Miss Kitty, meet me one day on Orange Street and asked me to come and listen [to] her daughter; she was living at Drummond Street, and I had to pass that street to reach Orange Lane where I live. Patsy start hum two lines of a gospel song and I like the voice I heard, so I sit right there and wrote a song, "Love Not To Brag", and I take her to Duke, and him record that. Then we do "Feel So Fine" off Shirley and Lee, "Feel So Good". Duke been playing these songs against Sir Coxsone Downbeat, play it for whosoever him come up against in contests, but it would be only [on] sound system. I also did "Leave Earth" and "Wigger Wee Shuffle" for Dodd in the early part, when we was just recording for sound systems. Then I hear about "Little Wonder", Mr Smith. King Edwards and Mr Smith is two brothers. I went to Smith with "Fat Man", and Monty Morris and myself do "Now We Know", so Smith was the first person to release. He put out "Fat Man" and people hark up the song; it pick up number one and Duke Reid was vexed about that. He sent some bad men to take me back to him, ask me why I do this, say I can't do that and so on. I said I didn't know it would be offending to him, I don't under no contract with nobody, but I just stay back in his stable for a while.'

Another notable Simeon Smith production was 'Album Of Memory' by the Magic Notes, a duo Smith recalls as 'Victor and Cecil, two guys from over Maverley'. Their hit was one of a handful of songs that Smith recorded with Drumbago. 'His beat was getting very popular,' Smith emphasizes. 'Drumbago was really good on drums.'

Diverted by other activities, Simeon Smith created very little music after 1963. Instead, he concentrated on his sound system, Little Wonder, and on promoting live events; he even wrote popular plays such as _Two Time In Bed,_ starring the rumba dancer Esmarie. 'Sound system, I had about six sets,' says Smith of Little Wonder. 'It was set up in '63 or '64.'

In addition to Trenton Spence and Drumbago, Simeon Smith singled out pianist Theophilus Beckford for particular mention in shaping his recorded material. Beckford's 'Easy Snappin', said to have been recorded in late 1956 but not issued on vinyl for several years, shifted the standard blues blueprint by emphasizing the after-beat of every measure. The song was a favourite on Coxsone's sound system, and was a precursor of the later ska style.

Though Beckford's cadence was original, the shuffle boogie was its most obvious root. Coxsone himself pointed out that Southern American music had the greatest influence on the earliest recordings he issued: 'At that time, my main emphasis was on rhythm and blues, boogie woo-gie, rhythm with a shuffle, and some slow pop music'

**Easy snapping: Theophilus Beckford [Beth Lesser]**

Once regular recording sessions were under way, musicians came together in various forms to impart a particular style for individual producers. Coxsone's earliest backing bands were Hersang and His City Slickers, led by pianist Herman Sang, and the Dew Droppers, led by pianist and organist Aubrey Adams. Clue J and His Blues Blasters, a slightly later combo, featured guitarist Keith Stoddart, drummer Ken Williams, bassist Lloyd Mason and Herman Sang, Aubrey Adams or Theophilus Beckford on piano; the teenage Monty Alexander also occasionally sat in. Duke Reid's early bands included the Duke Reid Group, Drumbago's Orchestra and trumpeter Baba Brooks' Band, which typically featured horn players such as trombonist Don Drummond and his Cuban-born protege, Emmanuel 'Rico' Rodriguez, saxophonist Roland Alphonso, drummer Aston 'Wackie' Henry, and any number of the players mentioned above. Popular music in Jamaica has always been a communal activity, and such groups tended to have overlapping and constantly shifting memberships, recording in various conglomerations under a variety of names.

**Cornell Campbell [David Katz]**

Some of these pioneering musicians are largely forgotten today, despite their important contributions. Singer Cornell Campbell says that during the mid-1950s pianist Herman Sang was a key man in Coxsone's operations, directly responsible for selecting him as a vocalist. 'I started recording at eleven years of age,' he says, seated inside the darkened offices of Freedom Sounds in Greenwich Farm. 'That was 1956, with a song named "My Treasure" for Sir Coxsone's Downbeat. In those days we didn't have reggae and ska – it was just rhythm and blues, not to mention the kind of boogie beat them had. A schoolmate urged me to be recorded. Someone told him Rico live somewhere on Gold Street, so we went to look for Rico and Rico tell us about Coxsone. I was in line for auditions, but Downbeat was very embarrassing. He call everybody "Jackson", and when Downbeat listen to the [singer], he say, "Jackson, which part you come from?" and the guy say he come from somewhere like Trelawney. Coxsone say, "But Jackson, you mean to say you come from so far to mash up my business?" I think the guy sound good, so when Downbeat say that, I just walk out of the line. The other week me go back again, the pianist see me and say, "But hold on, every week me see that little guy come up and he never sing a song yet. Come in, likkle youth, and let me hear what you have to do." I start to get nervous, and when I sing the song "My Treasure", my friend was supposed to harmonize with me, but him couldn't sing a note, so the pianist said my friend must stop. When Downbeat come down in the afternoon, he ask the musicians what's going on, and Hersang say, "That little guy is bad." Him say I must come back for the rehearsal Thursday.'

Cornell's fragile soprano was featured on a number of other sides cut for Dodd in the late fifties and early sixties, but disputes over payment ultimately drove him elsewhere. 'I did a sequence of songs there for Coxsone, and in those days I was taught printing, so I used to print the record labels for him, but through financial problems I leave Downbeat and went to King Edwards.'

As the heated rivalry between sound systems carried over to the production sphere, aspiring producers sometimes fought over artists, particularly if an unsigned act was causing a buzz in live performance, was a talent-contest winner featured on a radio programme, or had created an impact on sound systems with a self-financed acetate. A case in point involves 'Lollipop Girl', the debut recording by the Jiving Juniors.

One of the industry's enduring figures, founding member and group leader Derrick Harriott has been active as a singer, producer, record retailer and exporter for several decades. Though perpetually busy, Harriott is a courteous host at his One Stop record, video and shoe store in Half Way Tree; the shop is a major meeting point, and its packed space has a pleasant and friendly atmosphere. Harriott says that before the Jiving Juniors there was Sang and Harriott, and remarks that his singing career stemmed largely from a love of sound systems. 'That time, I'm always with the sound systems,' he grins. 'If I'm at school, any sound that we picked up coming from far, sometimes maybe four miles down Mountain View Avenue, we would follow that sound just to stand up for a couple of hours and listen to music. Anywhere a sound was, we always go.' An important ally at this time was a young man called Skitter, another of Arthur 'Bunny' Robinson's singing partners. 'I used to tour certain sound systems way downtown, High Holborn Street area, with Skitter of Bunny and Skitter. He was a type of friend in the music business that if you wanted to get the words for a song, he only needs to hear it once and he knows all the words.'

**Derrick Harriott at work [David Katz]**

In 1957 Harriott entered his first talent contest, and says the success of Sims and Robinson then inspired him to team up with a schoolmate. 'I used to go to the Palace Theatre, where they had _Vere Johns' Opportunity Hour,_ and I'm thinking, hey, I can do better than some of them guys. So I decided to enter and do a song by the Turbans named "When You Dance". I was about fifteen. Sims and Robinson, they had a big song in the earlies called "Til The End Of Time". Maybe because of the inspiration of Sims and Robinson, I decided to go back with my partner that attended Excelsior High School, Claudie Sang Junior. The name was Sang and Harriott. We entered and that was it – we tear down everywhere you can think of, like Ambassador Theatre in the west. We sang a song called "You'r e Mine, All Mine" by Bobby and Ronald, an R&B thing. That is a song I remember Admiral Cosmic playing at the Shady Grove all fifteen times straight, so when we did that song the crowd went wild.'

Not long afterwards Harriot's partner went abroad: 'Claudie Sang wrent on a Cable and Wireless course to Barbados. Then we formed the Jiving Juniors with myself as leader, Maurice Wynter tenor, Eugene Dwyer wTas baritone and Herman Sang was the pianist – the same Hersang that played for Downbeat, brother of Claudie Sangjunior. He used to be around the piano like Little Richard, with him foot way out.'

Shortly after their formation, the group decided to cut an acetate of an original song for sound system usage. 'About '58,' Harriott recalls, 'we decided we want to hear our voices, so we actually went down to Stanley Motta's – they had like a dub [cutting] machine. We did a song called "Lollipop Girl": Claudie Sang played the piano, we sang, and then we put in a hand clap – that's all we had. While you'r e singing it, they'r e cutting it same time, straight on to acetate – so if you make any mistakes, you'r e in trouble. Carlyle Ho-Yun, he had the sound called Thunderbird. He used to play at some Friday evening sessions in Maxfield Avenue at Cham-pagnie Lawn – it was an open air thing. He played the song, couldn't take it off, big song just playing and playing. Finally, one day Coxsone swapped a foreign record for that record, 'cause it was making waves.'

The one-off special became so popular on Coxsone's set that Duke Reid apparently used underhand tactics to acquire a copy of it, causing serious friction between the two camps. 'I heard there was a clash between Duke Reid and Sir Coxsone's Downbeat at a hall right beside the Gaiety Theatre, just off East Queen Street. The only person who was supposed to play was Coxsone, but then Duke Reid play too, and according to what them say, guns were drawn, because how the hell Duke Reid get it – whether it was one of the operators stole it out of Coxsone's box, went and make another dub plate and give it to Duke Reid, 'cause he was desperate for it.'

By this time, Harriott had made his first trip to New York to join other family members. 'I was in the States for about five months, but when it comes round to Christmas, my bones started tickling, so I had to find a way to get a fare to come back to Jamaica to sing at the big Christmas morning show kept by Vere Johns at the Carib Theatre. When I came back to Jamaica, Claudie Sang also came back home, so he joined the group.'

Within days of their Christmas morning performances, the group was ushered into the studio by Reid. 'When I come down for the show, I heard that Duke Reid wanted to send a ticket for me to come down to record "Lollipop Girl" for him,' Harriott remembers. 'He had me in the studio in late December 1959 and recorded it with "My Heart's Desire" and "Duke's Cookies".' According to Harriott, Reid kept the material for sound system usage for a long period, boosting its popularity before it was officially released. 'He had the song ["Lollipop Girl"] on his sound for one whole year before releasing it, and when he released it, it went straight to number one, and we had the number four song, "My Heart's Desire" – that was how big it was.'

By that time Harriott had already formed the Crystal label, its first issue being his cover of Donnie Elbert's 'What Can I Do [The Wedding]'. 'I was the first artist-producer in Jamaica,' he states proudly. 'Nobody ever thought about anything like that. Crystal started from 1960, same year we did "Lollipop Girl".'

In 1961, not long after their hits for Duke Reid were finally released, the group began recording for Coxsone, scoring their biggest number one chart hit with the spiritual 'Over The River'; the song benefited from an individual rhythmic pattern and expressive instrumental soloing. 'Trombone solo was Rico Rodriguez, the guitar solo was Dennis Sindry from Australia,' Harriott explains. 'I don't know if he came on a cruise, but he came to Jamaica with some other Australians and he played on a couple of things. They had a very7 good drummer too.' The following year Harriott and Claudie Sang were back in New York, cutting material with an augmented Jiving Juniors line-up at Mirasound studio with soul arranger Teacher Wiltshire, from which the Frankie-Lymon styled hit 'Sugar Dandy' emerged. 'We got the group together with Winston Service, who used to sing with the Downbeats, and Valman Burke – he was the son of a great Jamaican cricket umpire, Perry Burke. We did four songs in New York – that's where "Sugar Dandy" was born. The back-up band was the band that used to back up the Shirelles and Chuck Jackson.'

Harriott says the Jiving Juniors switched from Duke Reid to Coxsone because 'we just wanted to be a little flexible at the time', but it was typical that Dodd would score the bigger hit and bring out the best of the group's abilities in this era. Dodd says he kept the edge over Duke Reid by presenting stronger material to the people, both in the days when the sound men played strictly imported tunes and later when they started issuing locally recorded discs such as those mentioned above. 'With importation, I had the stronger set of records, also when we started recording locally. But the rivalry was like this: you have weeks when I would be more successful at the places I played, much more than Duke. I remember really heading off Duke by myself.'

Prince Buster expresses a different view, having been an integral part of the rising popularity of Sir Coxsone's Downbeat in the late 1950s. Buster was often on the front line for Coxsone, staving off physical attacks from the henchmen of Duke Reid and King Edwards. But it was not only his muscle that Dodd employed; Buster was also the one who played the crucial role of identifying the hottest records featured by the competition.

After having his head broken open numerous times without receiving the promised financial compensation, Buster decided to break with Coxsone and establish himself as another competitive entity on the sound system circuit. 'One of the main reasons I left Coxsone was that I wras being stifled. I never work with Coxsone as a job, but I was the man who bring up his sound, because he didn't know nobody and I was a popular man. Coxsone used to bring records in from America and when Duke Reid had a record that he didn't have, people in the country put that record on pedestal. So Coxsone and Duke would go away and bring back a copy, and that became their own master recording – they would bootleg the thing on blank labels. I am the one who used to go to the dances when Duke Reid play and tell Coxsone who the artists are, try to discover the name through the lyrics. He had promised to recompense me in a certain way when he got the records, and every time the records come he always have a truck broke down or something – always short. I conscious that I am the man who carry the whole sound system and this don't make no sense, so I talk to Machuki 'bout it - Machuki was the number one disc jockey, and Machuki was constantly leaving him for the same reason.'

After choosing independence, Buster planned to travel to America to buy a stack of hot R&B for musical battle; but despite making use of government connections his record-buying trip to the States never came off. 'A man named Zar and another one named Parker used to work at the Ministry of Labour. After I tell them I set up my own sound, they arrange that I do farm working. I took test after test and pass everything, and the morning when wTe supposed to leave they did one more inspection, and the man came down and look at my hands and say, "Your hands can't cut cane" and take me out of the line.' The reason, Buster explains, was that his badly mangled hands had taken 'too much blows', according to the inspector, 'so I can't get to America to buy rhythm and blues, but I didn't decide to stop my intention to build up a sound, because I was going to overthrow them and show that I am the man'.

Once his plan to beat the opposition with American exclusives had been foiled, Buster settled for the next best option: recording original tunes with local musicians. He went to a popular uptown night club to discuss the situation with Drumbago, and began rehearsing with a set of musicians that included guitarist Jerome 'Jah Jerry' Haines, saxophonist Dennis 'Taste' Campbell and trombonist Rico, with vocalist Teddy Charmers (aka Roy Willis) from the Charmers duo assisting. 'I went to Drumbago at the Baby Grand, a drummer who I know for a long time, tell him I would like to make some music. You did have an abundance _of_ [Jamaican] rhythm and blues that I did buy from them and have as exclusives, so Drumbago and me talk, and then me and Charmers would go up in the early morning and rehearse with him, show him how we want it done. This is around '59. The musicians that were there didn't play the music that I wanted, because Baby Grand is a club where people sit down and eat and then get up and dance with wife and girlfriend, so the music was somewhat different from what I intended. But, Drumbago being an instrumental man, it didn't take him long to understand what we were moving to. We went to JBC studio with Rico and we make a tune called "Little Honey". That was the first tune I ever made on record.'

By then, Prince Buster had established his Record Shack and Voice of the People sound system, just around the corner from Coxsone's premises. 'I started at 49 Charles Street, but I was sharing that shop with a girl named Claudette and I needed more space because she was doing hair and dressmaking.' He eventually moved across the street, renting a larger space at number 36 from Winston Blake's aunt. 'It was first where Son the Junior Sebastian's sound system used to be,' Buster recounts. 'There was a baker there and a Chinese shop, and the sound system was in the shop. After Son left, I went across. Miss Blake say she was enjoying the music I was playing on the other side, so she rented me the place. That was where all them shocks came out of. I used to rehearse the band at the back of my record shop with different artists, and we went down to Federal records and recorded what we now call ska.'

Ska was the excitement _of_ the independence era personified, and its creation brought widespread changes to the Kingston music scene. Ska not only gave vast impetus to the fledgeling music industry, it also increased the exports of Jamaican cultural product. Perhaps most crucially, ska was a great creative stimulus to the island's musicians, as its emergence allowed for less curtailed and more honest musical expression. With the arrival of this uniquely Jamaican genre, the island's popular music had come of age.

Authentic Ska](Davi_solidfou_9781596918269_epub_part6.html#d4115881)

_People who don't suffer like us can't perform that sound – it's a sufferer's sound. No middle class Jamaicans can play the music we play; it's a ghetto sound that we play out of instruments, real suffering ghetto sound. It sound happy, yes, for it's relief!_

Rico Rodriguez

_I didn 't even know that the music was going to be serious. I didn 't know it was going to go all over the world._

Roland Alphonso, OD

SKA DIFFERED FROM boogie mainly in the accent of its beat. Instead of the fore-beat emphasis of boogie woogie, ska used honking horns or staccato guitar chords to emphasize the after-beat – that is, the second and fourth beats _of_ every measure, rather than the first and third. It was also a faster music than most R&B, with wild drum rolls accelerating the pace, while vibrant horn players used jazz techniques for expressive solos and melodic backing. Often, it was the defining honk of Dennis Campbell's sax that gave ska its rhythmic delineation; at other times, the raw rhythm of Jah Jerry's guitar divided the beat.

Many musicians and producers claim to have originated ska, and conflicting explanations have been given for its name. One of ska's most prominent musicians, saxophonist Tommy McCook, related in a radio interview the common tale that the name 'ska' derived from Clue J's use of 'skavoovie' to address his fellow musicians – notably pianist Theophilus Beckford, who is often cited as changing the beat with 'Easy Snapping'. 'Skavoovie is a greeting. That's the way he used to greet you, even long before the ska came in. Instead of saying, "What's up, Jack?", "Hello, Ronnie", "What's cooking, John?" or whatever, he would say, "What happen, Skavoovie?" or "Hail, Skavoovie!" Then, later on, I think Mr Dodd asked for a Jamaican music. He said to experiment and came with the ska thing, which was really the swing and the guitar playing the upbeat.'

Leading reggae producer Bunny Lee, who rose to prominence in the late 1960s and dominated much of the 1970s, names Clue J, Dennis 'Taste' Campbell, Val Bennett and Jah Jerry as some of ska's most noteworthy innovators. 'Them don't talk about Clue J. Talk about ska, Coxsone says it was him, but it's not him, it's Clue J. When we make the American blues, Clue J used to call himself Clue J and the Blues Blasters. Him and Rico did have a band. Him tell them, "Make the guitar go ska! ska!" If we did play the rhythm and blues guitar, it would be rhythm and blues. It's really Clue J bring in the ska and nobody don't talk about him – him dead and gone and nobody don't remember is Clue J say, "Make it go ska." Coxsone start call people "Skavoovie" after you have a man named Taste Campbell, him play pure ska, him and Val Bennett hold the ska in a tune. The ska hold up the tempo of the tune when the drums fall down. Those horn man, them neck fat because them can't out of breath, and Jah Jerry a do him thing, but them no talk about Jah Jerry neither. Those guys are some great guys who are the foundation.'

Though numerous records from the period credit Clue J's band – including the pivotal 'Shufflin' Jug', named by many as the first ska recording – guitarist Ernest Ranglin contradicts Lee's statement, insisting that it was he who was the driving force behind the group and arranger of all their recorded material. As he was a leading player on the upper-class circuit, he felt the need to remain incognito on downtown recordings associated with the masses. 'It's my band, not Clue J's band,' the amiable guitarist insists, with perhaps only the slightest trace of annoyance in his voice. 'Clue J was my bass player, but at that time the music was like a rebel underground music. I used to play in the hotels and it wouldn't be too good for my reputation to really front a group like that.'

**Ernest Ranglin [Robert Schoenfeld]**

Ranglin was born in Manchester in 1932 and raised by his grandmother. A gifted musician and arranger, he began teaching himself guitar at the age of five. After moving to Kingston and meeting his mentor, Cecil Houdini, Ranglin joined Val Bennett's band at the age of fifteen and Eric Deans' Orchestra a year later. He then passed through Baba Motta's group, and began fronting a hotel quintet.

By the end of the 1950s Ranglin's versatility and confidence with any number of styles, from Hawaiian music to merengue, mambo and boogie, made him in high demand as a session player. When Chris Blackwell released his first album, a live recording made at Montego Bay's Half Moon Hotel, Ernest Ranglin was featured on one side of the disc. So began a long working relationship. 'I was the A&R man for Island records, that was 1958,' Ranglin confirms at the label's London headquarters. 'During that time, I did things for Coxsone, Buster, all of them. I did thirty-eight tunes for Buster – any tune that you can think of that was done in that era.'

Ranglin was featured on some of the earliest recordings ever made in Jamaica, in the days of turn-crank operated Recordio-disc type machines. 'The first time I went into the studio, I was with seven guys. We used to play Hawaiian music in a little group when I was a young boy. We did this one record, and in those days they had to turn the vinyl – it has to keep turning. I don't think it was for a company – it was just a record that we did. This was long before studios were being built. It wasn't for commercial purposes.' By the time the ska era was underway, Ranglin was one of the most prominent studio musicians. He was a part of the JBC studio orchestra when Prince Buster began recording there, and arranged some of Coxsone Dodd's biggest ska hits before travelling to London in 1964 for a nine-month residence at Ronnie Scott's jazz club.

It was the Prince who kick-started a change in Jamaica's musical gears once he was free to record his first productions. An early session yielded a number of significant hits employing a markedly different beat, including the Buster vocal 'They Got To Go' and the Folkes Brothers' astounding 'Oh Carolina', which placed Count Ossie's burru drumming over a back-beat that was inching away from boogie despite its inclusion of a piano line taken from an American blues number.

Count Ossie, aka Oswald Williams, had long been a creative catalyst. From the late 1940s, Kingston's leading jazz men often mingled with the drummers at Ossie's downtown yard in Salt Lane for late night jams. After Hurricane Charlie destroyed the space in 1951, the Count established a large Rasta camp at Adastra Road in Rennock Lodge, East Kingston, and the capital's leading jazz men congregated for regular sessions in the surrounding Wareika Hills, making music in praise of the 'Most High'. By placing Ossie's drums on 'Oh Carolina', Prince Buster brought the sound of Rastafari into Jamaica's popular consciousness.

The Rastafari movement had been slowly on the rise since 1930, when the crowning of Haile Selassie as Emperor of Ethiopia was interpreted by certain unconventional Jamaican religious figures as the fulfilment of biblical prophecy. They held a statement said to have been uttered by Marcus Garvey, a Jamaican radical campaigning for black self-determination, as proof that Selassie was the only true and living God, a black redeemer who would usher in an age of deliverance and repatriate black Jamaicans to Africa. The most significant Rastafari community was established in 1940 at Pinnacle, a commune headed by Leonard P. Howell (aka Gangungu Maraj) near Sligoville in the hills above Spanish Town; in 1954 the police destroyed it and Howell was forcibly detained at Bellvue mental hospital. Many of his followers dispersed to the West Kingston slums of Back-O-Wall and the Dungle, which was clustered on the edge of the city's garbage dump. It was here that the Rastafari are said to have encountered another group of social outcasts, the burru men, who migrated from Clarendon in the 1930s. The burru propagated the drumming traditions of their West African Asante ancestors, using a large bass drum (hit with a rounded or padded stick) and the smaller _funde_ to hold the rhythm, with the repeater or _kette_ taking the percussive lead. The two groups, who both venerated aspects of African culture that were rejected by Eurocentric mainstream Jamaican society, traded religious indoctrination for musical instruction. Count Ossie's mastery of the drum, learned from a burru man in Back-O-Wall, made the trio of burru drums the root of Rastafari music.

'Oh Carolina' was not the first Jamaican recording to make use of African percussion techniques. Laruel Aitken's 'Ghana Independence' and 'Nebuchanezer,' released on Caribou 78s around 1957, had similar backing; the featured drummer, according to Aitken, was 'a guy called Feely-Feely, from the same area we came from, the Greenwich Town-Maxfield Avenue area'. Likewise, Lord Tanamo's Caribou 78s 'Call Calypso', 'Calypso Tango' and 'Give And Get' all featured Jerome Walter's Conga Drums, and a number of Count Lasher's 78s include prominent African-style hand-drumming. Lord Lebby's 'Ethiopia' took things one step further by using backing of this kind to declare a longing for a Utopian African homeland – it was probably the first Jamaican record to do so. But it was 'Oh Carolina' that had a phenomenal effect on the Jamaican public. Demand for the tune wras so intense that both radio stations were forced to give it regular airing, despite initial bans. The song's spine-tingling arrangement has never gone out of fashion; in 1994, Shaggy's electric cover version was a worldwide smash. The repercussions of the particular combination of musical elements that came together in the original 'Oh Carolina' over forty years ago are still rippling through Jamaica's popular music.

After this success, music proclaiming an African identity became somewhat less taboo. Count Ossie made a series of recordings for Spanish Town soundman Harry Mudie, though none repeated the success of Buster's hit, while Coxsone cut a number of discs with strong undercurrents of African awareness informed by Rastafari. For instance, Noel 'Skully' Sims transformed the hymn 'Golden Pen' into a jumping Rasta ska, introducing it and a song called 'Press Along' with words in the Amharic language of Ethiopia (after learning its rudiments from Rasta leader Mortimer Planno in Trench Town). However, such material was still in the minority; a more popular Bunny and Skully song from the same period was a faithful cover of Bing Crosby's 'White Christmas', doubly ironic in tropical Jamaica.

As a vocalist for Coxsone in 1960-1, Clancy Eccles was one of those who helped to bridge the boogie and ska periods. His hit 'Freedom' was another early tune that proclaimed a longing for an African homeland. The son of a tailor and builder who often moved the family, Eccles was born in Saint Mary in 1940. He began performing in his late teens in Ocho Rios. 'Higgs and Wilson, the Blues Busters, Busty Brown and quite a number of us were on the North Coast,' Eccles recalls at home in the Garvey Mead area of Portmore. 'We all wanted to perform on various shows, and then I start producing my own thing by the White River Club - just myself and a fire dancer.' He began recording for Coxsone after making an impact at a talent contest. 'In early 1960, Coxsone had a talent hunt. It was sixty of us and I was a runner-up, but I was the first one that Coxsone recorded out of that crop. I did "Freedom" and "I Live And I Love". Around eight months later I did "River Jordan", "More Proof and quite a lot of other tracks.' These numbers hover somewhere between Jamaican boogie and full-blown ska. 'Freedom' has a pronounced ska rhythm guitar, but its rolling bass sounds like American blues; though recorded later, 'More Proof is a booze-praising number with a jump-boogie beat that also includes a ska-type horn solo.

**Clancy Eccles [Beth Lesser]**

Although these songs show the music in transition, Eccles jumped Coxsone's ship – mostly due to arguments about payment – before ska was really in full swing. For the next few years he made his living from tailoring and promoting concerts. 'It was around late 1961,' Eccles says. 'I signed a contract with Coxsone that would last for three years, so after I left Coxsone I didn't do any recording because I didn't want him to have anything on me that say I break the contract.' It was in this period that ska really came to the fore.

The creation of ska coincided with the Jamaican independence movement gathering steam, though the first concrete step towards self-sufficiency had been taken some decades earlier. The Great Depression of the 1930s had crippled the nation's economy: by 1938 20 per cent of the population was unemployed, and most of those who were in work were grossly underpaid. A series of strikes led to increased police brutality, which in turn sparked large-scale rioting and looting after a number of workers were killed by police at the West Indies Sugar Company in Frome. In the aftermath a charismatic, middle-class moneylender called William Alexander Bustamante formed BITU (the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union), the first trade union in the Caribbean. In the same year Bustamante's cousin, a light-skinned lawyer and Oxford-educated Rhodes scholar named Norman Washington Manley, formed the nation's first political party, the People's National Party (PNP), which was originally aligned with BITU. When Bustamante was imprisoned during the struggles of 1938, it was Manley who negotiated his release.

In 1943, Bustamante broke with Manley and formed the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). Many commentators have noted that Bustamante was an impressive extrovert, and his willingness to organize strikes and stand up to the nation's most powerful figures earned him great admiration and respect, particularly among the masses. Hand in hand with such qualities came a tendency to self-mythologize. Bustamante had been born William Alexander Clark; though his father was Irish and his mother from the Jamaican upper class, the JLP leader liked to claim his parentage was Latin American, implying a lineage unrelated to the colonial rulers, the British, and an in-born affinity with the downtrodden and oppressed.

When elections were held in 1944, the campaigns of both parties were sullied by stone-throwing and stabbing incidents, particularly in downtown ghetto areas; ultimately, Bustamante's call for higher wages gave the JLP a landslide victory. He remained in power until 1955, when Manley and the PNP were voted in, again after campaigns marred by ghetto violence associated with each camp. Whilst initially there may have been little difference between the two parties, they would eventually become polar opposites; in this period, Manley's easy-going Fabian socialism gradual shifted towards the left, and Bustamante's liberal capitalism moved further right.

Once the PNP took power, Manley entered strident negotiations with the colonial rulers to determine the method of Jamaica's independence. In 1958, with Britain's approval, Jamaica joined the twelve other territories of the English-speaking Caribbean in the short-lived Federation of the West Indies. These separate islands, united by language and similar histories, were due to gain independence from Britain in 1962 as a single nation, with Trinidad awarded the seat of central government.

In 1960 Bustamante began a vociferous campaign against the Federation, arguing instead for Jamaica's direct and individual independence. To drive home this point the JLP used Clancy Eccles' 'Freedom', despite the song's non-related portrayal _of_ African-Jamaican repatriation; it was the first of many instances of a non-partisan song being co-opted by a political party in Jamaica. 'The politicians used it as an escape route to bring their thing back to order,' explains Eccles, 'but we were thinking about a Rastafarian movement. It got to me by seeing the Rastamen out there preaching in different districts in Jamaica, trying to let the word reach people. They was talking about the back-to-Africa movement, and originally my mother's side of the family is African.'

When Manley called a referendum in September 1961 to resolve the question of Jamaica's membership of the Federation, the people voted overwhelmingly for an independent Jamaica; it signalled the end for the Federation. In April 1962 there was a general election which Bustamante won by a narrow margin; he thus became Jamaica's first Prime Minister when independence arrived on 6 August. In that same election Edward Seaga won the notoriously volatile but strategically important Western Kingston constituency; he says his anthropological studies played a major role in his choice of seat. 'Part of that study was in that very same area, West Kingston. That's the area that is richest in folk life and folk material.' When he was appointed Minister of Development and Welfare, Seaga was no longer able to oversee WIRL's operations – particularly the running of the recording studio that had been constructed at Bell Road. 'Once I became a minister, I had no time to operate a business, so my father took it off my hands, along with Dora, a cousin of mine who was involved in it from the beginning. They ran it just long enough to be able to dispose of it, sold it to a man by the name of [George] Benson. He owned a studio which was destroyed by fire, so he bought this one.'

While the island's inhabitants struggled to free themselves of their colonial shackles, its musicians were striving to establish a popular music that they could truly claim as their own. By the time of independence, ska had fully permeated Jamaica. The shuffling, American-based boogie hits of 1959 and 1960, like Laurel Aitken's 'Jeannie Is Back' (aka 'Come Back Jeannie', issued by Regal in Jamaica), 'Boogie In My Bones' and Derrick Morgan's 'Fat Man', gave way to the more clearly Jamaican ska of Chuck and Dobby's 'Du Du Wop', produced by Coxsone, Derrick Morgan's 'Forward March' and Derrick and Patsy's 'Housewife's Choice', both produced by Leslie Kong, another highly significant producer.

Derrick Morgan says it was budding singer Jimmy Cliff who got Kong involved in the music business. 'One day this little youth come to me which was Jimmy Cliff, but he was James Chambers at the time. He said he meet a man named Leslie Kong that would like me to listen to his song. If it sound good, he should take me to Leslie. Beverley's was Leslie Kong's place, on the corner of Orange Street and North Street. It was a restaurant and ice cream parlour, with a real estate office in the back and upstairs. You have one brother named Fats, he was the head of it, then Leslie and Cecil used to do real estate together. Leslie was inspired to go into the music by Jimmy Cliff, because Jimmy go to him with a song named "Dearest Beverley". The place was called Beverley's restaurant, so he thought if he go in with that song, it would inspire them to do recording. When I listen to the song, it was a nice, slow ballad – but we was doing ska music, so him say him have another title, which was "Hurricane Hattie", and I have a friend in the yard, a poet, who wrote "King Of Kings". We put a melody to it and go to Beverley's , and I told him about Drumbago and the All Star band. Drumbago take me and Jimmy to Greenwich Farm to rehearse, and we go to Federal the following day and recorded those songs. There I met Owen Gray, he do "Darling Patricia", boasting on it, so I write a song named "Be Still, I Am Your Superior" – I was throwing words at Owen. I record "Be Still" and "She's Gone", Owen did "Darling Patricia", and Jimmy did "Hurricane Hattie" and "King of Kings", and that was Leslie Kong starting off with a bang – all of them hit number one.'

James Chambers took the stage name Jimmy Cliff to perform Fats Domino songs at boy scout camp singing contests held near his home of Somerton, located a few miles from Montego Bay. Shortly after moving to Kingston to study radio and television engineering at the age of thirteen, Cliff made his debut recording, 'Daisy Got Me Crazy', for West Kingston sound system operator Count Boysie the Monarch; the song was retained as a sound system acetate, and Cliff offered one shilling for his labour. After forming the unsuccessful duo Cliff and Swift with a neighbourhood friend, Cliff cut 'I'm Sony' for sound system operator Sir Cavalier, but the single failed to hit. It was his arrival at Beverley's that put the singer firmly _on_ the road to stardom.

'One night I was walking, frustrated, going back home in West Kingston, and I saw this place called Beverley's ', confirms the soft-spoken Cliff by telephone in Paris. 'I saw records in the shop, but it was also a ice cream parlour and a cosmetics shop, so I thought maybe if I write a song called 'Beverley's ', I could probably get my foot through the door. I wrote the song just then and forced my way in: there were three Chinese brothers, and they said no, they'r e not recording, and I said 'But I think you can get into recording", and I sang the song 'Dearest Beverley'. The two other Chinese brothers, they laughed, but the one other one, he said 'Oh, I think he has the best voice I'v e heard in Jamaica'. Thus was initiated one of the island's most consistently successful labels, as Cliff became a major star in ska.

In the years to follow, horn players would provide a defining musical element that truly elevated the ska genre through highly charged instrumental hits. These ranged from Baba Brooks' ska adaptation of the ring-game song 'Riverbank Cobberley' (recorded for Duke Reid as 'Bank To Bank!') and Don Drummond's cheeky 'Schooling The Duke' (an instrumental dig at Reid recorded for Coxsone) to Roland Alphonso's 'El Pussy Cat' and the Skatalites' 'Guns Of Navarone' (both for Coxsone).

Prince Buster's early productions often made use of Rico's trombone talents. 'I would say I did about a hundred records for Buster before I come to England in December 1961,' Rico recalls. 'He was a mentor for Duke Reid, so he used to come and say he wanted us to do some recording. Maybe he was doing it for Duke Reid, maybe for himself, but it didn't matter to us – we were young musicians and we wanted to go on the records. I was working for Coxsone, Duke Reid, the Kong brothers, and I used to play for every sound system – they have sound system contests, so they get you to make one instrumental for them.'

Rico was very close to Count Ossie and lived for long periods at the camp near Wareika Hills, where he was heavily involved in the early days of Ossie's Mystic Revelation of Rastafari. 'He is my brother,' Rico exclaims fondly. 'He is the only person in this society that really loved me. It's a lot of us, maybe fourteen playing in the band, and if he got ten pounds, he want to give me five out of it. When I was coming to England, he didn't feel too good – you could see the sadness. When they looked around amongst the musicians after me, they didn't find no dedicated ones as myself and Drummond. We weren't playing for tourists in Montego Bay, Port Antonio or Negril, we were just in Kingston, playing among the community – that is why we are so popular. Drummond maybe played with big bands, but I am one of the few musicians who have never played one iota with a band – that's how I got my popularity. I am always where the sufferers are and where the dangers are. I don't live out of it, I live into it. Maybe that's where I get my good musical buzz from, to see people suffering and living it myself.'

Rico says he learned a great deal from Don Drummond, who was a fellow student at the Alpha School for Boys, a well-known Catholic charitable institution for underprivileged children which placed a strong emphasis on musical tuition. 'The most that I know on trombone is what he taught me,' Rico reveals. 'He was the only musician that I could sit and practise with every day. More than any other musician from Jamaica, he was my friend. I got a lot from Don Drummond.'

**Rico Rodriguez [Pekka Vuorinen/ courtesy of Top Beat]**

Life at Alpha, Rico explains, was difficult but in the end rewarding. 'As a junior, I listened to Drummond and great musicians like Vernon Muller, Ossie Hall, Tony Brown. Because they were so advanced, they were playing at clubs. All the juniors want to be as good as the seniors, but we didn't have much joy 'cause we didn't have an instrument. To get an instrument you got to be very excellent – the competition was high. A lot of development come through that. If you have ten trombone players, maybe you have four trombones. To get a trombone, you have to be better than two or three people. The upbringing was not really happy, but very hard. Listening to people like Clifford Brown, the Modern Jazz Quartet and Charlie Parker at that early stage was like magic – to achieve this magic is one of the world's very hard [things]. We don't go to school all day, like the average person, we go to school half-day, music half-day. You didn't have a whole day to play music, so the little chance you get, you did as much as you could – and that have a lot to do with our style. We listen to a lot of Tommy Dorsey, Duke Ellington, Lionel Hampton. Our upbringing was very enlightening.'

Several other leading horn players of the ska period learned their craft at Alpha under the tutelage of band master Lennie Hibbert, a multi-talented musician who eventually recorded an excellent vibraphone album for Coxsone called _Creation._ The long roll call includes trombonists Ron Wilson, Raymond Harper and Vin Gordon, trumpeters Johnny 'Dizzy' Moore, Bobby Ellis, David Madden and Jo Jo Bennett, and saxophonists Tommy McCook, Lester Sterling, Cedric 'Im' Brooks, Glen DaCosta and 'Deadley' Headley Bennett. Besides the broken beat of ska and the lung power of its vocalists, perhaps the most crucial contribution to its uniquely Jamaican development was that brought by these horn players. The brass sections would add a uniquely Jamaican take on jazz to give ska a particular feeling, be it in the big-band arrangements of a jumping tune or in the expressive soloing of horn-led instrumentals.

Another noticeable change in the treble section of ska arrangements came on the piano. Instead of playing a strolling rhythm with the left hand and treble chords with the right (as heard on 'Jeannie Is Back' or 'Easy Snappin'), ska piano parts often had chord melodies played with both hands on the upper end of the piano keys (as heard on Don Drummond's 'Rain Or Shine' or the Skatalites' 'El Pussy Cat'). One of the most notable performers to develop this style was Gladstone Anderson, a session player and mainstay of Duke Reid's team.

Gladdy was born on the outskirts of Kingston in 1934; his father was a railway engineer. It was his mother's brother, the respected keyboardist Aubrey Adams, who taught the young Gladdy to play the family piano. Aubrey went to Panama when Gladdy was in his teens, but returned to Jamaica in time to play organ on the earliest sessions held by Duke Reid and Coxsone. Gladdy says his uncle brought him to Duke Reid in these early days: 'I start with Duke Reid from around the middle fifties. My uncle used to play the organ, and we had many more keyboardists come around when he is not available, but I always have to be there in the rhythm. Those times we used to play sentimental tunes, rhythm and blues and rock and roll.'

**Gladdy Anderson [right] with Winston Jarrett [David Katz]**

As a session player, Gladdy helped to increase the pace of ska. 'When we reach in the sixties, that vibes come to me for a change of rhythm. I used to play rhythm, bass and treble [on the piano]. We was playing a rhythm ['Tear Up'] in the studio with Don Drummond and I was playing a rhythm and blues to the music, but what I was playing with the left hand was clashing with what the bass was playing, and they say I must play the rhythm with both hands instead of playing the rock and roll style. From I start play with both hands in the treble section, it change – it step up a little faster.'

While the musicians were experimenting with such styles, the sound system operators and music producers were struggling to maintain dominance. When Prince Buster left Sir Coxsone's sound system Count Machuki defected with him, leaving Coxsone to rely on his second-string deejay and sometime security man King Stitt (aka Winston Sparks), whose gruff and vigorous shouting style complemented a terribly disfigured face that earned him the nickname 'The Ugly One'. But if Coxsone was surprised that Buster's Voice of the People gave his Downbeat set tough competition, he must have been truly shaken by the volley of hits that came from Buster's recorded works in ska.

'Prince Buster, when he started his session, I help him with this song called "They Got To Go",' says Derrick Morgan. 'I record "Shake A Leg", Monty Morris recorded "Humpty Dumpty" and Basil Gabbidon do "War Paint". Buster get about thirteen hit songs that day. One spoiled song, he gave it to Duke, which was "Let George Do It" by Rico Rodriguez [miscredited to Don Drummond]. The engineer didn't pick up the bass good, so you have mostly bass drum. That whole song, if you listen to it, the bass would be Drumbago's feet, but that was a number one seller – every one of those songs was.'

Buster's departure left a large gap in Coxsone's stable. As a replacement, he eventually settled on a small and highly individual young man from Hanover named Lee Perry. Little Lee, as he was then known, was born Rainford Hugh Perry in the country town of Kendal in 1936. He was raised on the edge of a sugar plantation, but avoided such lowly toil by becoming a dance champion – he amazed audiences with his mastery of wild American steps like the Mashed Potato and the Yank; subsequently he became a domino tournament winner. In the 1950s Perry helped build roads to develop the Negril area for tourism and married a woman of Indian descent in the town of Little London, but their relationship did not last long and Perry soon grew tired of road work. He was already writing songs and had a secret dream to make it as a singer, so when at the start of the 1960s divine voices told him to go to Kingston this deeply spiritual man heeded their call and went to offer his services to Duke Reid. However, Reid refused to record Perry and let more seasoned talent like Stranger Cole use the country youth's lyrics without permission. So Perry moved on and went to work for Coxsone in 1961.

'He and Duke had some fuss at Federal studio over some song that was recording and he claimed that is his lyrics,' Coxsone says. 'I realized he was outnumbered, so I took him away from the crowd and whatever was happening. He told me where he's from, we spoke and I created a job for him. It was more like a handyman, because we used to be up and down and he'd run some errands, but he loved the studio so he stick by me in the studio, until we came up with the first song, "Chicken Scratch". I would say it was after about two months that we started recording him.'

Roughly based on Jimmy McCracklin's jump boogie tune that celebrated a popular dance, 'Chicken Scratch' was an exclusive acetate on the Downbeat sound. Despite never being given an official release as a single it bestowed upon Perry his most lasting nickname. 'Me never take it serious,' says Perry, 'but the people think it start, so that's where me get the name Scratch.'

Though Perry would eventually cut dozens of vocal tunes for Dodd and play percussion on many a Downbeat session, his early role was more down-to-earth. He was chiefly a record plugger, delivery person and general assistant, and one of his more important tasks was to take over the spying previously handled by Buster, whom he began to attack in song on Coxsone's behalf. Perry co-wrote lyrics aimed at Buster for Jamaica's first child star, Delroy Wilson, who signed a contract with Coxsone at the tender age of thirteen in 1961 'while still attending Boy's Town Primary. The attacks included 'I Shall Not Remove', 'Spit In The Sky' and 'Joe Lieges', which reversed the themes of Buster's 'One Hand Wash The Other'. Then Perry started aiming volleys in song at the Prince himself with 'Bad Minded People', countering Buster's smash 'Madness' with 'Mad Head' and providing further general denigration on 'Prince In The Back' and 'Prince And Duke', which decried Buster's alliance with Duke Reid.

**Lee Scratch Perry [left] and Sir Coxsone at Studio One [David Katz]**

Buster says he took such vinyl assaults in his stride, noting that the parties involved remained on good terms and that it was all done, and taken, with humour. After all, it was Buster himself who had initiated an earlier feud with Derrick Morgan, accusing him of being a 'Black Head Chinaman' after Morgan began recording for Leslie Kong. 'In '62, when Jamaica going independent, I did "Forward March",' Morgan recalls. 'Buster say the solo that Headley Bennett took sounded like one that Lester Sterling took for him in "They Got To Come". He said me stole his belongings and give it to the Chineyman [in] "Black Head Chinaman", and I answer to him with "Blazing Fire": he must walk the blazing fire and leave me alone. That cause a little rival [ry], with the both of us singing off of one another.'

The dispute continued with songs such as Buster's 'Thirty Pieces Of Silver' and Morgan's 'No Raise No Praise', leading to commotion among supporters. 'The government did have to intervene, because the fans were getting outraged,' Morgan laughs. 'They would cause a war over it. Prime Minister Shearer had to come in and we had to take pictures in the paper, showing that we are the best of friends, just to cut down on the consequences.'

However, such intervention failed to stop the words from being throwTn. As Morgan explains, 'I see Desmond Dekker [aka Desmond Dacres] in the market for nearly two years before he record a song and his first was "Honour Your Mother And Father", the ska way. Bob Marley came to Kong in 1963 with "Judge Not". Jimmy Cliff brought him, just about the time when I was going to leave with Prince Buster and go to England – Buster bribe me back into him market and we came and record for Blue Beat, and the blazing fire would never stop burn yet. I signed a contract with Melodise records – it was a binding contract, and I didn't like the idea after six months. I decide to come back home to Jamaica and I don't want to see Buster no more. Leslie Kong didn't want to record me, because he said I'm under a contract and he don't want to breach it. I form a group called the Blues Blenders. We were recording for Coxsone, but I still never comfortable there, because I really want to go back to Leslie – he treat us better as a promoter, pay us better and he was a nice man to be with. I went to Eddie Seaga, he was Finance Minister at the time, and he get me out of that contract with Melodise. Then I went back to Leslie Kong and did "I'm A Blackhead Again". Prince Buster, we'r e not cursing each other any more, but... every time he do a song off me, somebody come tell me before I hear it. I used to swing around more as a freelancer; when I make "Don't Call Me Daddy" for Duke, Prince write a song named "Derrick, A Fi You Baby", so I write one and show it to him. Him wife, Blossom, we used to call her Bea, so I say, "Prince Buster, while you were away at sea, I was along with Bea, all your children have the mark of this blackhead Chiney." That's how he and I stop that one – he didn't put his out and I didn't record [mine], I only give him the words in him shop.'

Another figure who became involved in the feuding was Chenley Duffus, a baritone who was then one of Coxsone's prized hit-makers. Duffus died from heart failure in 2002 at the age of sixty-four. A few years before his death, on a street near his home in Ocho Rios, Duffus spoke of his early musical career. 'I were born at the border of two parish, Saint Thomas and Portland, a place called Roland Field. My father worked with United Fruit Company and I grew up in Kingston and Spanish Town. Some Saint Jago High School girls was boarding in the yard where I lived. Every day they ask me to sing the blues, so I discover myself singing the blues at eight years old. One of my main songs was by Jackie Brenston, "Independent Woman", a bad blues. Approaching twelve, I make my stage debut at the Crystal Theatre in Spanish Town, then I move right into the Vere Johns' thing, went all over Jamaica singing rhythm and blues: Joe Turner, Louis Jordan, Ben E. King, James Brown. All the inspiration came definitely from the American music, but we were putting our own thing in.'

**Chenley Duffus: singing the blues from age eight [David Katz]**

His first recordings, made at the end of the 1950s, were for Simeon L.Smith. 'I did my first recordings for Hi-Lite on Spanish Town Road at Federal two-track studio, round about '58, with Trenton Spence and Sonny Bradshaw, top-class musicians.' Duffus was so steeped in the blues at this point that his 'Million Dollar Baby', a duet with a certain Annette, was also a success in America. 'I had a big impact with "Million Dollar Baby" – it was a big song all over the States. Then Coxsone take me away from Smith. He said, "This little man is going to be a star."'

Coxsone's words were prophetic, as Duffus' Yankee-twanged baritone was featured on a subsequent series of popular songs, often with lyrics that insulted the competition. 'I turned out nothing but hit songs for Coxsone,' Duffus gloated. 'Every session is hit songs. My first for Coxsone was "What A Disaster". I wrote it off of Derrick Morgan and Prince Buster – stopped them from throwing words at each other. When they do "Black Head Chiney" and "Blazing Fire", the three of us were good friends, so I get right in the middle and write "What A Disaster".' More successful was a follow-up proto-ska, co-written by Lee Perry, called 'Fret Man Fret'. ' "Fret man fret that you fret to death," 'Duffus quoted. 'I dig it off Buster again.'

The song that Duke Reid and Lee Perry originally fought over, resulting in Perry becoming a member of Coxsone's crew, is said to have been Stranger Cole's hit 'Rough And Tough'. Cole was definitely then on the brink of local stardom and brought Duke Reid several of his biggest hits in 1963. The singer, born Wilburn Cole in Jones Town during the 1940s, explains that he had his nickname from birth. 'I didn't resemble anybody in the family, so they said I was a stranger – but during my growth in life, they say that I more resemble my father.' Cole also recalls that several members of his immediate family were involved in Jamaica's emerging music. 'My father plays guitar and used to jam with people like Ernest Ranglin. My uncle, Gilbert Cole, is a more professional guitarist who also used to jam with Ernest Ranglin in the early days when the music wasn't so good, and I have an uncle called Roy Roachie, he used to be a great singer in Jamaica once before. You could say I'm coming out of a music family.'

**Stranger 'Soul' Cole [Beth Lesser]**

Stranger's brother Leroy first brought him to Duke Reid shortly after he won a singing competition at school. 'The way I get into singing,' Cole explains, 'I think it's all come through a kind of spirituality and the musical family background that I had. In my very early teens, I was going to an evening institute in Denham Town where I was learning chemistry, and they happens to have a function and my friends all know that I love to sing, so they put my name to sing at that function. One of my favourite singers was Wilfred "Jackie" Edwards, so I sang "Tell Me Darling" and "I Know", and I got two ice cream that day. I decided to go to Duke Reid as my brother used to be there as the number one disc jockey and one of his big engineers. Duke Reid said I wasn't such a great singer like Eric "Monty" Morris and Derrick Morgan, but I sang a song that he liked very much titled "In And Out The Window". He asked me to give Monty Morris that song, and after the song went number one, Mr Reid said that I was a good writer and I had a tone like Derrick Morgan. As Derrick Morgan was away in England, he said he was going to try me on a song in the studio. Patsy, who used to sing with Derrick Morgan, he said I should learn her one of my songs. I teaches her "When You Call My Name," and I rehearse "Rough And Tough" for myself. On that first three outings, I did three number one songs.'

'When You Call My Name' still echoed the cadence of American blues, but the boastful 'Rough And Tough' was pure ska, with Cole's deep voice and grave delivery doing much to establish the reputation that was later enhanced by a series of hit records with Ken Boothe. 'I was the first one to take Ken Boothe to the studio to make a record,' Cole says, 'and the very first [hit] song we recorded was for Mr Reid, called "Uno Dos Tres". It went way up in the charts, like number one, and then I and Ken Boothe went on to make many hit records like "Artibella" and "World's Fair" for Coxsone.'

Boothe says he came to know Stranger when the older singer had a group that used to congregate near an establishment called Bar Twenty in Denham Town. 'Leaving school every evening I would go to Boys Town, because that was the sports complex in those days where poor people could go freely,' says the world-famous yet still humble Boothe at his Kingston home. 'On my way home I would pass a corner and hear people singing. I want to sing so much that when they'r e singing, I fill in. Then the group drift apart and Stranger start recording for Duke Reid with people like Patsy and Millie Small. Stranger was one of the first ones who inspire me in every way, both creating and excelling into what I do, and I was always at the house waiting to sing with him, so one day he took me to Duke Reid to audition. I heard Duke Reid say, "Who that likkle boy? Him can't sing," but I don't pay him no mind.'

**The great Ken Boothe [David Katz]**

According to Boothe, the duo auditioned with a song they had written called 'Mo Sen Wa', built on an imaginary phrase that an invented Chinese girlfriend was meant to have uttered to the song's protagonist. 'Me and Stranger could write for all culture – we could pick some words that sound like Chinese, we can pick some that sound American. It was me and Stranger who created those words. There isn't even a language that go like that, but we say we'r e going to write something like a Chinese song, and we say "A mo sen wa, that's what she says to me". We did it with Drumbago and Ribs [tenor saxophonist Stanley Notice] and it was playing in the dancehall. Duke Reid try us again, and me and Stranger make "Uno Dos." Then me and Stranger do songs for people like Mr Pottinger, Edward Seaga and Byron Lee. After "Uno Dos", I didn't really so fond of Duke Reid, he's too rugged. My type of music that I truly love, it was Sir Coxsone who was doing it. Me and Stranger decide we'r e going to Sir Coxsone now with "World's Fair", "Artibella" and "My Marie".'

Eventually, Dodd suggested that Boothe should try to make it as a solo singer. 'I don't know if he would remember this, but he said he would like me to sing on my own. I didn't consider that none at all, so I said to him, "You'r e sure that I can sing on my own?" Him say, "You is the best." It was an encouragement – it really make me feel good. The first song that Sir Coxsone let me do was a song named "Prevention", by Federal. When I started growing up, he start to really record me by Studio One.'

The establishment by October 1963 of Dodd's Studio One, officially the Jamaica Recording and Publishing Studio, was one of the most significant moves in the solidification of ska's popularity. It was built in a former night club called The End at 13 Brentford Road in the Cross Roads area of Kingston, and its equipment was installed by the supreme sound technician and session guitarist Headley Jones. It has been reported elsewhere that Studio One was the first Jamaican recording facility owned by a black man, but that honour goes to Linden O. Pottinger, an accountant who ventured into record production and distribution with the Gay Disc label; his small but well-equipped studio on Molynes Road was in use from 1961. However, Studio One quickly became the home of ska: many of the era's biggest hits were created here, despite technically inferior one-track equipment purchased from Federal when that studio upgraded to two-track. It was Coxsone's strong team of musically inspired individuals which helped draw the best from the talent he located, notably keyboardist and arranger Donat Roy Mittoo, known as Jackie. Many artists were successfully groomed by Coxsone during this period after making it through the crowd of hopefuls who turned up seeking to impress the producer and his team at a Sunday audition - though hot talent could be snapped up on other days too. 'We was open to it,' Dodd points out, 'if on a Monday we see a guy.' Lee Perry, who was promoted to talent scout and auditions supervisor, says that talent could be recruited any time, any place. If a singer was located elsewhere, 'we bring him in and then we arrest him – see him on the street and go and arrest him on the street.' Perry has been credited with bringing in some of Dodd's biggest acts, including the sensational Maytals trio.

It was the gospel-like intensity of lead singer Frederick 'Toots' Hibbert, nicely balanced by harmonies from Ralphus 'Raleigh' Gordon and Nathaniel Matthias (aka Jerry McCarthy), that gave the Maytals its exciting difference. Toots, who was born in Clarendon in the late 1940s, says the near-religious fervour of his vocal style came from a mixture of American soul and church choir influences. 'I grew up in the church before I went to Kingston to do my music – Seventh Day Adventist and many other churches, where people would gather and singing so nice, praising God, so I always want to be there. I grow up in a spiritual way, as my father was a preacher and my mom was a preacher – it was a clapping church. I began in the church, therefore my music goes as a churchical order. I used to listen to Ray Charles, Mahalia Jackson, Wilson Pickett and James Brown on the radio and I wanted to sing, so I went to Trench Town [when] I were about maybe thirteen. I used to do boxing in my youthful days, but people told me I could sing so I stopped boxing. I stuck with some people who do barbering and I trim people's hair. Then I met Jerry and Raleigh, they was living in Trench Town. They say, "I like the way you sing, I want you to teach me," so I began to teach people in my youthful days, people who was elder than me.'

**Toots Hibbert of the fabulous Maytals [Adrian Thomas]**

Through early scorchers like 'Fever' and 'Never Grow Old' the Maytals helped keep Coxsone on top, but their material was often miscredited abroad to the Vikings, a popular live band that sometimes backed them on performances. In contrast, the apocalyptic 'Get Ready', also attributed to the group, was actually Toots in combination with another duo. 'I sing the song with Bunny and Skitter,' Toots confirms. 'I was just the one who arrange it and do some slants in it. I never used to get credit, but from [when] I started [in] the business I do my own arrangements.'

'Six And Seven Books Of Moses', the Maytals' first significant hit, was the trump card of a particularly noteworthy sound system victory. 'One Monday night, we actually disintegrated Duke Reid with it,' says Lloyd Daley, known as the Matador and founder of the sound system and label of the same name. 'Duke Reid and myself played at the Success club for a co-star of _Doctor_ No, just after that movie was done. He's a very popular guy called Big Junior, an associate of Clement Dodd. Duke Reid wouldn't stop play and the Matador signed on and drowned him, couldn't hear him again. Coxsone had to come and seize the "Six And Seven Books Of Moses" that was lent to me, because I was killing Duke Reid with it. But it's not just the record, it's the sound – the weight I was dropping, the amount of bass. I was the first sound system to ever have signed on and completely overpowered Duke Reid, so that you couldn't hear him.'

Born in the early 1940s and raised in Central Kingston, Daley had an early fascination with electronics. 'From the age of eight or nine I used to make telephones, lights that would go on by remote control, alarm systems. I was very involved in anything intricate that involve electricity. Later, I built a RF [radio frequency] linear amplifier: it amplified the signal from a walkie-talkie, so I was able to speak to people overseas. I turned it into a sound system amplifier and started to play at birthday parties. I met Coxsone Dodd and challenged him, about 1956 or '57, at 2h Windward Road. Coxsone played until twelve o'c lock and I played until four in the morning. I didn't want a name like a king, a sir, a duke, a princess or anything like that. A matador really is a bullfighter, and I would actually take my opponent as a bull.'

Though bad experiences in the music business have made him reluctant to be interviewed, Daley is a resolutely courteous man. 'The whole music thing, it's like you have a barrel of crabs,' he protests. 'That is why the Matador step aside. Most of the guys out there are still going through it, but I don't want to walk that road again. I am a electronic engineer and that is what I live off, because the money that I put into recording, I have not been repaid or compensated for it in any way.'

Daley says he began producing around 1958 because his rivals refused to sell him their better tunes. Early sessions at Federal yielded Roland Alphonso's 'Bridgeview Shuffle', plus 'some tunes with Neville Esson – he sang for Coxsone in the early days, even before Owen Gray. Owen Gray and Rico Rodriguez done several recordings for me in '59–' 60, and I played at the send-off for Rico Rodriguez when he was leaving Jamaica, at 2a Water Lane, beside General Penitentiary.'

Though hits were not forthcoming until the late 1960s, the Matador was one of the top sound systems of the ska years, retaining an edge in the field by building and servicing his own set. 'I started in 1956,' he recalls, 'and I was a small sound, until about '59-'60, when I decided to get serious. My mam dancehall was at Victoria Avenue, in front of the Machado cigarette factory. It was a great house that was used strictly for dances, with a big palm tree in front of it. We had a disc jockey by the name of Icky Man, he used to play Lord Koos' sound, and after I demolish Lord Koos he came to me for a job. Koos is a Chiney guy that had this restaurant called Sterling at the corner of East Street and East Queen Street, right across from the central police station. In '62-'63, a next big night was when the Matador alone played at the Gold Coast and six of Jamaica's top sounds were playing at Club Monaco, in very close proximity along the Saint Thomas Road: Duke Reid, Coxsone Downbeat, King Edwards the Giant, Sinclair the Lion from Central Kingston – that was a very good sound, he was even heavier than Sir Coxsone – and Count Boysie – that was a next good sound that came from Oxford Street. Five of them, and I destroyed them the night. I was playing my heavy KT 88 amplifier and I shake the earth in such a way that everybody had to leave their dance and come to my dance, and they had to stop playing before nine o'c lock. Gold Coast was overfilled – it was the sweetest victory I ever had. There is only six top sounds that the government recognized when we had independence: Duke, Coxsone, King Edwards, Prince Buster, Bells the President and Lloyd the Matador. We played for the government on street dances and floats during the time of Edward Seaga and Sir Alexander Bustamante, right in independence, and it went on for around three or four years after.'

The Matador also built amplifiers for several other leading sound systems, mostly in the key period of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Though most have been omitted from written reggae histories, those who were there recall their great importance. 'Sir Percy was a very good sound from Regent Street,' Daley says, 'owned by Percival Tibby, who had gaming machines. His sound was very recognized and his deejay was Whitey, who was as popular as Machuki in his time. Admiral Chin was quite a large sound on Blake Road, at the back of Kingston College. Percel Chin owned it – they had Chin's Travel Service. Unitone was a very massive sound from Annotto Bay, from the sixties right back until the eighties, but he's dead now – his name was Joe Chin. Duke Hamilton from Saint Anne's Bay is owned by Ken Hamilton, OD – he got an OD [Jamaican Order of Distinction] for contribution to sound system in 1999 or 2000, even before Buster – Buster got his own in November 2001. Count Muncey, that was built in 1959, went until about 1968. It was a very popular sound, played all over the Maxfield Avenue area and other places. It was owned by Roy Muncey, a machine repair man for Singer from Galloway Road, off Maxfield Avenue. He's a full Indian, and Tom the Great Sebastian's eldest son got married to his sister, some time in the seventies after Tom died. Cavaliers is a next sound based mostly in the Maxfield Avenue area, but he played in all of Jamaica. It was owned by Mr Chung, the manager of Lanneman's sweets factory. He was a prominent sound man, had a sound system before Duke Reid and Coxsone – I wasn't the first person who built his amplifier, but I built him a very large amplifier in the fifties. There was also King Prof of Spanish Town Road, he was a next older man again. I also built an amplifier for Prince Buster and I'v e worked for Duke Reid and Coxsone, repairing their amplifiers.'

As with the battles perpetually waged on the sound system circuit, Kingston's ska producers continued to fight for dominance with record releases, and though Coxsone clearly kept the upper hand in ska, rivals also issued highly popular material. One of Duke Reid's most significant ska hits was 'Carry _Go_ Bring Come' by country trio Justin Hinds and the Dominoes; remaining exclusively with Reid into the 1970s, they were ultimately his most loyal and prolific act. The soft-spoken Hinds still lives in Steer Town, the Saint Anne's hillside community in which he was born in 1942. The son of a builder and quarryman, he began singing in the local Seventh Day Adventist church and formed the Dominoes with Dennis Sinclair and Egorton 'Junior' Dixon while the three were on the fringes of the tourist trade.

'A guy named Ernie Smatt, he started the water sports enterprise in Ocho Rios by doing skin diving, scuba diving, glass bottom boat tour,' Hinds says in the plumbing and air conditioning shop that acts as his office. 'I become a part of it when I was about sixteen, and I used to sing for tourists on the beach, sing B. B.King, Chuck Jackson, Louis Jordan, Smiley Lewis, Fats Domino – that's why I name my group the Dominoes. And I used to create my own sound in those days too. Dominoes group was from about '57 to '58, because all of us grew up in one village, go to one school. We started to sing young, all of us together, and all of us used to work for the water sports. At the Windsor Hotel in Saint Anne's Bay, close to where Marcus Garvey was born, we used to sing for these people. We don't have any pay, but the people love us and we realize we was going to be a star one day.'

That stardom beckoned in late 1963, when the Dominoes eventually found their way to Duke Reid's headquarters. 'Charlie Babcock used to be a disc jockey on RJR, we call him "CB, the cool fool with the live jive". He came on the North Coast to work at the Arawak Hotel as the entertainment manager, and he said to me one day, "We need you to sing for this party", so I sing that night and the people love my show. Two days after, he said, "You should go to see the Duke." Before that, Carl Young was the first man I used to sing for on the North Coast. He's the guy that now own the radio station Irie FM and Grove recording studio. He was the only guy on the North Coast that was playing R&B music from the older days. He had a big sound system called Strand in Saint Anne's Bay and he was competing with Sir Coxsone and Duke Reid, so he was telling me about his good friend Sir Coxsone. I went to Kingston one day to see Coxsone, just by myself, but Coxsone don't have time to talk to me – he was driving away, leaving me standing on Orange Street. I walked and find Charles Street and I realize that was the street that Prince Buster have a little record shop [on], and I find out that the Duke was further within Bond Street and Charles Street, so I went over to see the Duke and there comes the rest of Dominoes. We didn't plan to go together, but they realized that I was in Kingston and they realized the day they should be there too. Duke having a audition, with about a hundred boys and girls that line up along the street. They say, "You should go back to trade. Next!" I was shaking when it was my turn and I didn't want to sing on the street, so I went to Back-O-Wall where I meet Bongo Noel as the elder dread in Kingston – he was one of the first spiritual leaders for the Rastafari. They was chanting Niyabinghi and I was there chanting with them. A guy that used to stay by Duke come get me and I went up to see the Duke. He said, "What's the name _of your_ song?" and I said, "Carry Go Bring Come", so he said, _llGo_ upstairs." I meet Baba Brooks, Tommy McCook, Lester Sterling, Lloyd Brevett, Roland Alphonso, Theophilus Beckford, Jackie Mittoo - all the greatest of the music, it was very impressive. The three of us went to Federal to record the song and "The Stone That The Builder Refuse" the next day.'

Like much of the group's subsequent work, both songs were based on proverbs and folk sayings, incorporating gospel undertones. ' "Carry Go Bring Come" is just a everyday system that people live within, where people double-back [gossip] on each other,' Hinds explains. 'The first time I hear it [was at] Forrester's Hall – it was a clash between the Duke and Sir Coxsone, and Cuttings was at the control. When Duke come at eleven o'c lock at night, they play "Carry _Go_ Bring Come" for seven times straight. Then he put it on the street and it hit Jamaica like a storm: number one for eight wreeks.'

Though Justin Hinds and the Dominoes gave Duke Reid potent ammunition, Coxsone's secret weapon was the Wailers, a Western Kingston harmony group that signed with Studio One as a five-piece in December 1963. Schooled in Trench Town by Joe Higgs, the group was then composed of Bob Marley, Neville 'Bunny' Livingston, Peter Tosh, Junior Braithwaite and Beverley Kelso. Their first release, 'It Hurts To Be Alone', was a ballad led by Braithwaite. The song hit, but was not nearly as successful as its follow-up, 'Simmer Down', Marley's call to the swaggering 'rude boys' of Kingston's street gangs to cool their terrorizing attacks on innocent ghetto dwellers. 'Simmer Down' hit number one in February 1964, a tantalizing taste of the greater fame and glory that awaited the group's core in the future. Ernest Ranglin, who is rightly proud of his role in the group's rise to stardom, arranged this early material. 'I did their very first hit tune, "It Hurts To Be Alone",' he recounts. 'After that I did things like "Simmer Down" and "I'm Still Waiting".'

Holding a privileged place in Coxsone's stable, the Wallers' line-up underwent a series of changes. Junior Braithwaite's role had diminished by the summer of 1964, when Bob Marley emerged as the natural leader; Braithwaite left the group when that September he emigrated to Chicago. Beverley Kelso would leave the following year, allowing the core of Marley, Tosh and Livingston to tighten their harmonies and song-writing skills.

Like Lee Perry, the Wailers performed a number of tasks for Dodd in addition to their primary roles as singers. Bob Marley was made musical arranger of the Soulettes trio, led by his future wife, Cuban-born Alpharita Anderson. Peter Tosh recruited other singers for Dodd and often provided guitar accompaniment at auditions, for which all three members were typically present. One of the most notable singers whom Tosh brought to Studio One was baritone Jack Sparrow, born Leonard Dillon in 1942 in Portland, where he was raised by his Seventh Day Adventist grandparents who brought him up singing in the church. He was active in a local band called the Playboys, covering tunes by Fats Domino and Wilson Pickett with his classmate, guitarist Hux Brown; after a change of management, the group became known as Ray and the Gladiators. Though Dillon made occasional trips to Kingston in an attempt to break into the music business, it was not until he had spent a year in the USA that he came to the capital to live.

**Leonard Dillon: The Ethiopian [David Katz]**

'I went in '63 on farm work, end up in Fellsmere, Florida,' he recounts. 'Sugar cane, but I couldn't cut it. [After] two days, I tell them I can't make it and they send me to plant the cane.' His main ambition in America was to bring back enough fancy duds to convince record producers that he had star potential. 'It was a whole trunk of clothes I wanted to go back to Jamaica with, that way me have clothing to see if I can achieve being a musician. I want to look good when I am going around the studios, as at shows I always see the artists them very smart.'

Dillon returned from Florida in 1964 full of determination to succeed in music, and now with the clothes to look the part, but with no real money to speak of. King Sporty, an old friend from Port Antonio, was then one of the top deejays on the Kingston sound system scene; he had briefly replaced Machuki on Coxsone's set before settling into residence on Duke Reid's . Sporty arranged for Dillon to stay with a relative in the overflowing slum of Back-O-Wall. 'Where I had to sleep some of the time,' he recalls with a grin, 'I had to go in there bent, 'cause if I stand up, my head going through the top. But I have to give thanks, especially to King Sporty's aunt, because she always prepare something for me to eat twice per day and always give me encouragement. I always be ashamed that I cannot finance the food, so I try to get home late, but don't care how late I get home, that woman always up and she going hot up food and give me, asking me if I got through today. If I try to leave the house without having a breakfast, I can't , because she always prepare for me.'

Through hanging out on street corners in the musical hotbed of Trench Town Dillon eventually met Peter Tosh, who was impressed with his vocal talent. 'I met up with Peter Touch [Peter Tosh] and sang some songs for him. He took me to Second Street and introduce me to Bob and Bunny. Two days after they took me to Studio One.' Dodd liked what he heard at Dillon's audition, when the singer's country accent lent a near-mento feel to his delivery, and recorded four songs with the eager young man straightaway. 'I did "Woman Wine And Money", harmonized by Delroy Wilson, "Ice Water", "What You Get You Must Take", and "Bull Whip", harmonized by Peter, Bob and Bunny.'

The pick of the bunch was 'Ice Water', a tale of a simmering romance that was a fairly substantial hit, but Dillon's initial stay at Studio One was brief. 'The Wailers did not have enough time to spend with me, so I decided to see if I could get a group for myself. I'm a mason by trade and Coxsone gave me some money to buy some tools. I left Studio One, went to Waterhouse and started to work on my trade in the day, the meantime rehearsing in the nights.'

The Wailers enjoyed further hits at Studio One, but the Maytals quickly tired of the advantage they felt Dodd wTas taking and in 1964 began recording for other producers, including Vincent Chin and Leslie Kong. Another successful period followed with Prince Buster, for whom they cut notable works such as 'Judgement Day', 'Pain In My Belly' and 'Broadway Jungle', an electrifying stomper in which the group celebrated their departure from Coxsone's stable. The song remained popular enough for Toots to revive it in 1998 with a recut, used as a European Cup football theme in 2000. Unfortunately, the optimism of the original recording was short-lived. As Toots put it, 'I went to record the song with Prince Buster when I was singing for Coxsone Downbeat. He treat me shabby, so I think Prince Buster would treat me better. [When] I went over to his place, he treat me the same shabby way: he let me down by not paying me well.' The group's response was to move on again, recording the last of their ska works with producer and bass player Byron Lee.

Accounts of reggae music have often been unduly critical of Lee, partly because much of the music he created was middle-of-the-road material aimed at the Jamaican middle-class and overseas pop markets. A lot has also been made of his supposedly middle-class status and Chinese heritage, but those who focus on the latter seem unaware that Lee's mother is a black Jamaican from a rural area near the town of Balaclava and that he was raised in a family that actively upheld the surviving musical and cultural practices of their African ancestors. 'They were from a place called Auchtembeddie, that's way down in the depths,' says Lee of his mother's family. 'They were up in the hills and they knew mento and Junkanoo and things called "Brukins" [a celebration of emancipation by former slaves], and I broke in that too. I spend a lot of time down there from [when] I was born, so the music was into my blood. I was born in Christiana, in the parish of Manchester, went to school there, and then when I was age eight or nine come to the city – to Third Avenue in Mountain View Gardens.'

**Byron Lee: Dynamic Dragon [David Katz]**

Lee takes a pragmatic view of his dual heritage. 'My father is from Kowloon in Hong Kong and my mother is an African Jamaican,' he says, seated beneath a map of the world in his office at Dynamic Sounds. 'Whether I am called a half-Chinese or mixed blood, that's how it is. A lot of the Chinese who settled here came to finish the Panama Canal – it was the Chinese who could withstand malaria. The boats going through the Canal to take them back to China went through the Caribbean, and they dispersed all over the Caribbean. My father came to teach the Chinese children here how to speak English. He was a teacher who only knew a little English, but he was able to translate from English to Chinese.'

Lee learned to play the piano at a convent school in Mandeville, but temporarily abandoned music when he became a member of the Jamaican national football team. He later taught himself to play bass on a home-made instrument, and in 1957 founded the Dragonaires band. According to Lee, the early line-up included guitarist Rupert Bent, trumpeter Frank Anderson, saxophonist Sam Ismay, a trombonist called 'Mullo' and veteran jazz man Granville Williams. The band began recording after being approached by Edward Seaga, following his success with Higgs and Wilson's 'Manny Oh'. 'We didn't know each other then,' says Lee of Seaga. 'We met one day when the band was playing and he said, "Would you like to make a record for us?" '

The resultant debut recording was a calypso-based instrumental called 'Dumplings' – not a particularly popular piece _of_ music, but nevertheless marking the start of a recording career that would span more than forty years. ' "Dumplings" didn't have the beat the people wanted,' recalls Edward Seaga. 'But that was for a different market – it wasn't for the popular market.'

Byron says it was Seaga's departure from WIRL that prompted him to conduct regular sessions at Federal. 'Clifford Rae and George Benson took over West Indies Records – it was a joint company affiliated with West Indies Records Barbados. After Seaga left, I went across to Federal where we did all those ska music: Ahmet Ertegun from Atlantic Records came down and then we did Monty Morris' "Oil In My Lamp", "Sammy Dead", the Blues Busters – a lot of that stuff I play bass on. Jimmy Cliff, Stranger Cole and Patsy, Prince Buster, Millie Small, Ken Lazarus, Keith Lyn – all these artists worked through the first couple of years of ska with us.'

Some have protested that Byron Lee is not a ska originator but merely cashed in on the music's popularity, yet Lee has always acknowledged that he was not directly involved in its creation. He says he began playing ska only after being sent to the ghetto to study it writh mento band leader Carlos Malcolm. 'Eddie Seaga was the politician in whose constituency ska was. In 1962 he sent us down there to study the music, as he wanted to be the Minister of Culture who said, "I have given you a music from the ghettos of Kingston to celebrate our sovereignty of independence." We knew nothing about ska until Seaga sent us down there. It was being played down in the western sound systems, but it was kept down in the ghetto and wasn't recognized by the people mid-town and uptown who could afford to buy it and support it. It was not played on the radio stations, because they wouldn't accept the quality – the guitars were out of tune, the records were hop, skip and jump. When I went down and learned ska, I didn't know about it before. We took it along – not with my band alone, but with the people who produced it – exposing them to the middle, uptown people who looked down, saying, "That is music for the poor people – we don't want to be associated with it." But we crossed the barrier and brought it up, because Byron Lee was accepted by the middle, up-class. We helped to promote ska. I didn't find it, nor did I originate it, but by bringing it out we made it famous.'

'I took Byron because he was somebody that I knew,' Seaga confirms. 'I said, "You need to come and hear this beat." He came down, heard it and tried it uptown, but it didn't work because uptown people are different from downtown people. It was when the ska left Jamaica and went to England as "blue beat" that it became popular over there. After becoming popular in London, uptown people started to accept it.'

In 1964 Prince Buster, Jimmy Cliff, Monty Morris and Millie Small appeared at the World's Fair in New York; the backing band was Byron Lee and the Dragonaires. Lee's band was chosen by Edward Seaga, who let his uptown, mixed-race friend be the presentable face of ska at a commercially oriented international event. Lee cut ska material aimed at US audiences, and it was issued in the States by Atlantic; he was also awarded the licence to distribute Atlantic product in Jamaica. Adding to the irony is that Millie's 'My Boy Lollipop', delivered in a shrill teenage yelp, brought an awareness of ska to a broader American and British audience despite being a rhythmically faithful cover of an American record by Barbie Gaye. Millie's incredibly successful novelty hit was produced by Chris Blackwell in London and arranged by Ernest Ranglin, using London-based session musicians.

Much criticism has since been levelled at the choice of the Dragonaires over the Skatalites, as the latter are seen as ska's true originators and Lee as a mere pretender to their unacknowledged ghetto throne. Seaga himself says he sent the Dragonaires to New York for purely practical reasons. 'Byron Lee went because he had the experience in travelling – he had certain experience _of_ touring and his music was more danceable. The Skatalites would have played the Skatalites' pieces, which were limited in number and not as danceable. Byron Lee would be playing the songs _of_ the different artists – it would have come at a much wider range.' Winston Blake suggests that the fluid nature of the Skatalites contributed to their being passed over. 'I know for sure that it was a discipline problem. Those guys were great, talented, the best, but they were not disciplined.'

Regardless of who was and who was not sent to the World's Fair, the highly talented musicians that made up the Skatalites are definitely those most associated with ska. The group was officially together for only fourteen months from June 1964, but most of its members had played together regularly since the late 1940s. Its nucleus included tenor saxophonist Roland Alphonso, alto saxophonist Lester Sterling, trombonist Don Drummond, trumpeter Johnny 'Dizzy' Moore, drummer Lloyd Knibb, bassist Lloyd Brevett, rhythm guitarist Jerry Haines and pianist Jackie Mittoo. Despite being at first opposed to the idea, and wary of the ska form in general, the gifted tenor saxophonist and arranger Tommy McCook was eventually persuaded to lead the band by Coxsone Dodd, after returning from an eight-year stint leading a jazz group in the Bahamas.

**Roland Alphonso: King of Tenor Sax**

Roland Alphonso said that several core members first played together at the Coney Island amusement park, down on the Kingston pier, and also performed at night spots like the Orange Bowl. 'We meet each other as teenagers,' Alphonso revealed on a trip to London shortly before his death. 'Knibb was living at West Street, Brevett was living with his dad and I was living in Jones Town. We were playing Coney Island six nights a week.' Like Tommy McCook and Rico Rodriguez, Alphonso was born in Cuba of mixed parentage. 'I was born in Havana in 1931 – my mother is Jamaican and my father is Cuban. My mother took me to Clarendon, where most of my family lives, in 1933, and afterwards she took me to Kingston. I went to Saint Aloysius School and then I went to Stony Hill School at the age often – my mother was poor, that's why she sent me there. My father came to Jamaica, but though he speak Spanish nobody couldn't understand him. They lock him up in a soldiers' camp and send him back to Cuba, but he didn't correspond with my mother. The year 1941, that's when I start to play music. I was too young to blow an instrument, so they put me on marching drums.'

Alphonso progressed to trumpet at Stony Hill and learned saxophone at the age of thirteen; by the start of the 1950s he was one of the leading players on the island. 'I was playing alto first of all. They rated Joe Harriott number one alto sax, and I was a young player in my early twenties – they rated me number two. I was playing with Redver Cook for a start, and Eric Deans. Eric Deans was playing up at Bournemouth Club. He claims that he's going to pay me _£2_ for six nights a week, but everything him get, he tell me, "Boy, wait!" '

Alphonso said his first recording session came towards the end of the boogie period while he was a member of the Cecil Lloyd Quintet, a jazz band led by Jamaica's top pianist, a graduate of the noted Juilliard School of Music in New York. 'I was working at a hotel, Cecil Lloyd lead the band. The band came in to do a session and Coxsone said, "Rolie, cut a tune for me now, man!" So I said to them boy, "Let's do a blues in C", and them call it "Four Corners Of The World". I can't forget it at all - it was five of us.'

Lester Sterling, the group's youngest member, recorded for Coxsone from the late fifties with Rico, Deadley Headley and Johnny Moore. 'Playing for Coxsone, it was Rico carry me there,' says Sterling of his debut session. 'Rico was going to look for Coxsone with this song, he told me to come along, so I meet Coxsone and he had a session the following day. It was a vocal, I think [with] Lloyd Clarke.'

Lloyd Knibb was born in Portland in 1931, attended school in Kingston and gained experience drumming at North Coast hotels in Eric Deans' Orchestra and other groups, as well as by attending Count Ossie's Wareika Hills encampment. Knibb says he started recording after hearing the compositions of local players on the radio. I was living in Montego Bay, playing in different hotels, and I hear a tune over the radio and go back in Kingston and present myself. Everything was cool, playing rhythm and blues.' It was Knibb's individual rim-shots and drum rolls, along with Drumbago's rhythmic flourishes, that gave the ska beat its particular character. 'I changes the beat in 1964,' Knibb insists, 'so that's definitely my style.'

Lloyd Brevett says he learned his bouncing bass accompaniment from his father, a jazz bassist who fashioned his own instruments and founded the Count Brevett Band in 1950. Lloyd was also a member of Eric Deans' Orchestra. 'My dad taught me to play bass, he play in a lot of groups. At this time, I play stand-up bass.'

After their first performance as the Skatalites at the Hi Hat club in Rae Town, the group was soon in demand all over town. Their subsequent residence at the Bournemouth Club, where Lee Perry often joined them on percussion, is legendary for its electrifying performances. This intensity was captured on their studio recordings, mostly cut for Coxsone Dodd: many of them encapsulate the best of ska's musical possibilities.

Upbeat Skatalites numbers such as 'Tear Up', with Alphonso's fast solo flourishes, seemed to reflect the optimism of the newly independent island; others, like the raucous 'Ball Of Fire' and 'Guns Of Navarone', simply hold unbridled musical heat. McCook's compositions, such as 'Cow And Gate', tended towards the spacious, as did his understated solos which often favoured the lower notes of the scale. When McCook and Alphonso traded solos on numbers like 'Black Sunday', 'Trotting In' and 'Hot Cargo', the contrast was always invigorating; Moore and Sterling, though more in the background, also contributed enthralling solos on songs such as 'Beardman Ska' and 'Killer Diller'.

As with ska itself, the Skatalites' music was created from a pool of disparate influences. Group members explain that some of their biggest hits at Studio One were based on Latin tunes that Coxsone asked them to adapt. ' "El Pussy Cat" come from Cuba,' Roland noted. 'It's a Cuban song. Coxsone give it to me and say, "Rolie, write this tune now", and I wrote it.' 'Coxsone used to use a lot of Cuban tunes and we would write the tune in ska form,' Lloyd Knibb recalls. 'We would generally get those tunes, because a staccato thing was happening in ska.' Lloyd Brevett adds, 'Mongo Santamaria did have an LP that time, and all those tunes like "Prince Duke", "Pussy Cat" and "Christine Keeler"...' 'We play the songs as it had been played,' Roland cut in, 'but we arrange it and play the ska thing our style. We don't copy the solos.'

Jazz was always the biggest source of inspiration for the Skatalites and members covered songs that moved them, such as Roland's take on Horace Silver's 'Forest Flowers' or his adaptation of Duke Ellington's 'Caravan' as 'Skaravan'. Alphonso spoke of his joy at sharing the stage with Count Basie's band in Nassau, and gave John Coltrane his utmost admiration. 'Coltrane is my man, and I respect him and honour him because his songs is on earth.' Lester Sterling named Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Cannonball Adderley and Sonny Stitt as musicians he was thrilled to see performing.

Although the bulk of their work was recorded at Studio One, the Skatalites also cut material for the other leading producers of the ska years. 'We didn't sign any contracts with anyone, so we were free,' Roland Alphonso stated. 'We work with Duke Reid and King Edwards also. We did some for Prince Buster too, but Coxsone get the most 'cause I sign contract with him.' 'The songs we do with Buster was like "Al Capone" and them tunes,' says Lester Sterling, 'with Val Bennett and Stanley Notice, Headley Bennett and Jah Jerry.'

Coxsone says he was powerless to stop Reid offering better money to these musicians. 'Whatever it costs, Duke would find the money. Even if I had a contracted artist, Duke would still insist and use them, like Don Drummond and Roland was contracted to me, but after a while you realize the man is a musician and that's the only way he could really earn, so you let him play, which is different from vocalists.' Despite this protestation, Dodd says he and Reid exchanged two Skatalites songs: Dodd recorded Drummond's 'Green Island' but gave it to Reid to release, whilst Reid allowed Dodd to handle his recording of Drummond's 'Eastern Standard Time'. Chenley Duffus also reveals that Dodd gave Reid a helping hand when the former policeman was down on his luck: 'When Duke Reid wasn't making any hit, Coxsone sent about a dozen of his artists, including me, on a session for Duke Reid. I did a song called "Bitter Rose", which is on the flipside _of_ "Reload" with the Skatalites, a wicked instrumental for Duke Reid.'

'Duke like to hear a certain kind of tune and Coxsone like to hear certain tunes,' Lloyd Knibb continues. 'Duke would hear us sing a "banton" by Coxsone, then he would do a repeat "banton", that kind of throw word, cursing record. We also did a lot of instrumentals for [Top Deck records proprietor] Justin Yap, the "Chiney Dread" down Barbican – a lot of tunes he get from Don Drummond.'

Drummond was a major creative force in the group. According to the school records, he left Alpha six weeks early to join Eric Deans' band; he also played with alto saxophonist Headley Bennett in tenor saxophonist Tony Brown's Orchestra, a band entirely composed of former Alpha students. Drummond's typically chilling compositions often employed unusual minor-key arrangements, perhaps reflecting the personal anguish of a man who voluntarily checked himself into Bellevue psychiatric hospital on several occasions. 'Confucius', 'Chinatown', 'Marcus Junior' (Top Deck), 'Away From It All' (Randy's ) and 'Don Cosmic' (Studio One) are notable examples, their minor chord changes and expressive solos tinged with shades of melancholy. Drummond also asked Lloyd Knibb to emulate the burru style for the exquisite 'Dan De Lion' (Treasure Isle) and 'Addis Ababa' (Studio One), the African rhythmic root allowing for complex personal expression.

Don Drummond's vision gave his music a thrilling difference, but his idiosyncratic behaviour had a volatile side and his heavy medication probably exacerbated his drastic mood swings. Clancy Eccles recalls some of the trombone player's peculiar traits: 'By working with Coxsone, I happen to meet Don Drummond on his first session. He did a song named "That Man Is Back", and I worked eight months with Don Drummond on stage after that. While we were recording down by Khouri, they was digging out that piece of land, and Don used to go over and pick up this pretty piece of clay and put it in his Ovaltine. Don Drummond never eat anything hot – everything cold, lot of fruits and so on. One day Roland and Johnny looked in the bottle, it was clay and all those things mixed together, and Drummond said, "People are supposed to live in an atomic energy, you are supposed to build atoms inside of you" – that's why he ate the clay. For a mad man, Drummond was extraordinary – I wouldn't call Drummond mad. There's another story of Don Drummond [performing] in Port Antonio, and the MC said, "Now we present Don Drummond!" and Drummond just came right out, in a suit, and just pull down the zip and just piss on them! Drummond was just something else. Drummond never wear a shoe – always wear his felt hat, him look beautiful, but he's not wearing a shoe. He was like _one_ of those American jazz musicians, just a different type of person. Any time I hear Drummond play I hear something good.'

On New Year's Day 1965, Jamaica was rocked by the news that Don Drummond had murdered his common-law wife, the rumba dancer Marguerita Mahfood. He was sent to Bellevue, where he remained until his death in 1969. The murder was a tragic moment in Jamaica's musical history, and Drummond's detention had other repercussions: it contributed to the demise of the Skatalites, ultimately signalling the end of ska.

The keen musicianship _of_ the Skatalites meant that the group was really overloaded with talent; it was, in some ways, the first Jamaican super-group. So it is not surprising that the group had difficulty sustaining itself as an entity after Drummond's death, especially since bust-ups had been threatened from the very first. As a result of internal rivalries, exacerbated by external pressures from competing producers, the band split into two after a final performance in August 1965. Roland Alphonso stayed at Studio One, first with a new version of his Orchestra that included Lloyd Brevett; later, with Jackie Mittoo, he led the Soul Brothers band with drummer Joe Isaacs and bassist Brian Atkinson. Tommy McCook at first took over the horn arrangements of uptown club act Kes Chin and the Souvenirs, but later fronted the Supersonics with Johnny Moore and Lloyd Knibb and eventually became the leader of the house band at Duke Reid's newly constructed Treasure Isle studio along with bassist Jackie Jackson, organist Winston Wright and drummer Hugh Malcolm. Alphonso admitted there was 'something near to' animosity between himself and McCook after the rupture, 'but not on an all-out basis'.

'Duke Reid started with Tommy and Roland was with Coxsone,' Lloyd Brevett summarizes. 'Roland was Coxsone's fancy and Tommy was Duke Reid's fancy'; hence their respective roles once the Skatalites split. The break-up of the band meant the ska era was over in Jamaica, but nearly fifteen years later a group of black and white musicians in the English Midlands revived the music of the Skatalites and Prince Buster for the Two-Tone movement; another decade on, white Americans brought in the 'third wave' of ska, and even Japanese groups successfully re-created the genre. In addition, the Skatalites re-formed themselves on several occasions and McCook and Alphonso were blowing ska right up until their deaths in the late 1990s.

Though ska has continued to enthral audiences outside Jamaica, it has all but disappeared in its homeland. Indeed, within a year of the initial break-up _of_ the Skatalites a new style swept the nation: the cool and spacious sound known as rock steady.

[Take It Easy:  
Cool Rock Steady](Davi_solidfou_9781596918269_epub_part6.html#d4115961)

_The integral part of the rock steady beat is the background of the musicians. What is not well known is that a musician's type and style of play is governed by the section of the country he grew in. The intangible feel for words and music is part of the answer, and is difficult to explain. It is inborn, an inherent quality which comes from culture, heritage and the tradition of the people of West Kingston._

From the sleeve notes of Ken Boothe's _Mr Rock Steady_ (Studio One)

_The musicians were very creative, and the dance again have a lot to do with it – the dancing change the music a lot. In those times, when you make a song, you have to make a dance with it for it to sell._

Leonard Dillon

IF SKA HIT the newly independent Jamaica with the force of Hurricane Hattie, then rock steady arrived in the shape of a cool breeze nestled in the calm after the storm. The division of the Skatalites into two self-contained recording units signalled an end to the era of big-band jazz arrangements; rock steady was created by smaller, studio-based groups that used horns as complementary instruments rather than as musical focal points. As with the shift from boogie to ska, the gradual ascendance of the slower, less cluttered rock steady came largely from a change to the dominant beat. Instead of the after-beat emphasis of ska, rock steady made use of a rhythm known as the 'one drop', encompassing a pronounced whack on the bass drum or floor toms on the third beat of every bar. The new rhythm, driven by chugging snare beats, was offset by strolling electric bass patterns, full of rest stops and pushed to the fore to provide the melody line. The greater prominence and melodic importance _of_ the bass would allow dancers to abandon the clenched fists swinging between splayed legs of ska in favour of a stationary pose with a rocking body, jerking shoulders and snapping fingers.

As with the creation _of_ ska, the shift to rock steady was accomplished by a handful of talented musicians working from various vantage points to fashion a new genre. But this new shift was more disparate than that of boogie to ska and its exact creation is difficult to pinpoint, especially since conflicting claims have further obscured its origin. Among the most notable contributors were saxophonist and band leader Tommy McCook, pianist Gladdy Anderson, bassist Jackie Jackson and drummer Hugh Malcolm of the Supersonics band at Treasure Isle, guitarist/bassist and studio arranger Ernest Ranglin at Federal, saxophonist Roland Alphonso and keyboardist Jackie Mittoo at Studio One, drummer Winston Grennan and guitarist and band leader Bobby Aitken of the Caribbeats, and freelance guitarist, arranger and band leader Lynn Taitt. 'It was the feel of the musicians,' confirms Leonard Dillon, leader of harmony group the Ethiopians. 'The musicians were very creative, and the dance again have a lot to do with it - the dancing change the music a lot. In those times, when you make a song, you have to make a dance with it for it to sell.'

Dillon formed the Ethiopians just prior to rock steady's emergence, while he was working as a stonemason after cutting his first solo sides at Studio One. One of their first recordings for Coxsone, issued in 1966, was 'Owe Me No Pay Me', a tune demanding fair recompense for one's efforts, cut in what would emerge as the rock steady style; 'Free Man', recorded later that year, has the faster pace and honking horns of the waning ska form. 'That was just between the ska and rock steady,' explains Dillon. 'Ska didn't die – it was just in the middle. It's like a little piece of ska would be on this, and a little piece of rock steady. Ska don't totally leave off when rock steady take it up. It was a transition period.'

Leonard Dillon was the only member of the Ethiopians with earlier recording experience. After cutting his solo sides at Studio One as Jack Sparrow with the Wailers and Delroy Wilson, he teamed up with street-corner singers in Water-house, forming the Ethiopians group with Stephen 'Tough Cock' Taylor and Aston 'Charlie' Morrison on harmonies. 'We rehearse for over a year,' Dillon recalls. 'I introduce them to Studio One, because I'v e been there already. We sang four songs [including the popular "Owe Me No Pay Me"] but Coxsone did not give us much money for that and Charlie was making a lot of noise about I'm giving away him talent. Him leave the group and we went back, I and Stephen now, with "I'm Gonna Take Over" and "Free Man".'

Shortly after the Ethiopians' Studio One sessions, Dillon found a backer for his first self-productions with the group. 'By working on my trade, I met up on a man named Lee Robertson, he build house and sell it. I'm working and always singing, until one day he offered to finance a session and that session bring forth "Train To Skaville", the one that really took off

'Train To Skaville' had the strolling bass line and subtle horn accompaniment of classic rock steady, but retained the choppy guitar chords of ska; Dillon himself insists the song is 'a part-way ska rock steady'. When describing in retrospect the many stylistic shifts that have occurred in Jamaican pop, it is easy to overstate the way such changes were adopted and a distorted picture often emerges. But just as mento songs such as 'Rukumbine' and 'Penny Reel' were adapted in ska, and the Wailers recorded the 'ska-quadrille' medley 'Rude Boy Ska' even as rock steady was marching in, such changes have rarely been absolute or definite and have typically come about through a gradual transition. Likewise, the conventional wisdom that fast ska gave way to slow rock steady, which in turn gave way to reggae, is not always how those involved in creating the music view the way it happened. 'The music don't change,' claimed Roland Alphonso, 'because in music you have fast, middle, and slow, so to me the music don't change because we'v e been playing the three music from the beginning. From we start at school, we'v e been playing fast, medium and slow, so it's nothing new to me.'

'Ska is not a matter of speed,' Leonard Dillon insists. 'Ska is a matter of arrangement. I can play you ska and it's slow; you have slow ska and fast ska, slow rock steady and fast rock steady.' The defining element of ska, according to him, is the relation of the drum to what he calls the 'riff, that is, the rhythmic bursts provided by the rhythm guitar or horns. 'The snare drum and the bass drum, the way they drop on your riff, that's the main thing. The bass can be any way, the bass can be slow as ever.' He sees rock steady, in contrast, to be defined by the one-drop rhythm. 'Rock steady is the one drop. It's the drum.'

**A hard blow on the third: Winston Grennan [Ted Hoffman/courtesy of Nancy Lewis/ Entertainment Works]**

'I give a hard blow on the third,' confirmed Winston Grennan, whom some credit with originating the one drop. 'That would be a hard one drop, and it would cut the beat in half Grennan died of cancer in 2000 at the age of fifty-six. Speaking by telephone from his home in Massachusetts, some years before he encountered health problems, Grennan explained that he grew in Saint Thomas, where he played drums for Junkanoo dancers at Christmas. He drummed in jazz groups with Trenton Spence, trumpeter Raymond Harper and trombonist Carl Masters in the early 1960s, but then because the pay was so bad he became a professional boxer for a while. After joining the Caribbeats on keyboards for a stage production he subsequently became one of the leading rock steady drummers. 'We went to Mandeville to do a show and the drummer didn't show up. I didn't have any sticks, so I cut me a nice guava limb and make two pairs of sticks. When the show finish, Bobby says, "You'r e great with keyboard, but stick with this." They didn't know that I play drum because I don't tell people that.'

'It's coming from calypso, with a _bolero_ beat, then the ska came in from the blues,' says Bobby Aitken, leader of the Caribbeats. 'They double up on the blues and bring in ska, but rock steady is a different thing: the guitar just "bop... bop... bop", and every two "bop", you drop the drum.'

Now known as the Reverend Robert Simmonds, Laurel Aitken's younger brother Bobby began his musical career after a youth marked by hardship. 'My father was an Al carpenter from Saint Anne's , my mother from Saint Elizabeth,' he says at home in Florida. 'They got married and went to Cuba on a honeymoon, started having kids and catch right there. I was born in Havana, 1933, went back to Jamaica maybe '39. We were living in the Whitfield Town area, Kingston 13, but my mother got sick and died, and my father had heart failure and died when I was about eight. We all grew on the streets, everybody scatter.' Bobby was raised among strangers and ended up in the Eventide Home. 'That's what you call the poor house,' he explains. 'That's where they put me because I'm too big for little orphanage.'

Aitken avoided a life of crime when an uncle took him out of a street gang and put him into the masonry trade. He built his first banjo at the age of eleven from melted sardine cans, and eventually became proficient on a succession of borrowed and home-made guitars. 'After a while, the mason work get slow and I decide to turn to music. I form the Caribbeats around '59-'60, but it was only three of us: me, Charlie Organaire [harmonica player Charles Cameron] and the third guy's name was something like Morgan - just bass, box guitar and harmonica. We was playing calypso and a little ska, but that time ska was not too bright; everybody was mostly coming from calypso. We try to perform one night in Shortwood Road at Blue Ribbon club, but the guys didn't show up, so we break up. I was discouraged and I went back in the masonry work.'

**Bobby Aitken [Courtesy of John Mason/Top Beat]**

In 1961 Aitken made his recording debut as a singer with 'Crackers Rush,' which commented on a foodstuffs shortage; as Aitken recalls, 'You had to line up to get crackers.' The disc was issued by Count P, operator _of_ a sound system on Spanish Town Road. The following year Prince Buster produced Aitken's first big hit, 'Never Never', which joined elements of several American pop hits (including 'one from Lois Prima') with an irresistible horn line. 'Duke Reid used to have rehearsals in the evening,' Aitken notes, 'and while I was coming to Duke, I met Prince Buster on a little Honda. Him say, "Don't go down to no Duke, meet me at Federal on Tuesday," and he gave me £8 without even knowing me. Those days, £8 was money. Because I had the money, I got drunk and I get hoarse, could hardly sing, but it work out to be the style _of_ the song and nobody know it was spoiled.'

After cutting other vocal sides issued by Coxsone, King Edwards and Linden Pottinger, Bobby Aitken re-formed the Caribbeats and concentrated on guitar. The Caribbeats became the top rock steady session group and live act, until various frustrations led to its premature demise. Aitken subsequently became a gospel performer after a dramatic conversion in the Cayman Islands. 'I start up back Caribbeats with Charlie, at that time we have Mike Williams [later bassist with Zap Pow] playing drums. Every Monday evening I would sit at my yard gate on Galloway Road and practise under a big tree, and everybody would make a big crowd.' Other notable members included bassist Vincent White ('a country guy'), pianists Bobby Kalphat ('a clear-skinned guy from Tower Hill') and Conroy Cooper (who later led the show band Fabulous Five), saxophonist Val Bennett and keyboardist Ansel Collins, whom Aitken originally placed on drums. 'Sometimes [drummer] Santa Davis would come through,' Aitken adds. 'I taught him how to play rock steady music. We tired of the ska, so me and Charlie get together and say we'r e going to change this thing, after we did "Baby I Love You" for Pottinger.'

'Baby I Love You', a grainy tale of disappointed romance voiced by Carl Dawkins and issued on Karl Johnson's Sir JJ label, was one of the earliest hit ballads to retain a rock steady feel. The rock steady dance craze seems to have arrived in earnest by the autumn of 1966, though the dance itself may have been prevalent from the spring _of_ 1965. Another of the earliest dance-oriented hits most readily identified as rock steady is Hopeton Lewis' 'Take It Easy', recorded at Federal with Lynn Taitt and the Jets. The song is said to have taken its form because Lewis had difficulty fitting his lyrics into ska's rapid grooves. 'The first tune we do on the rock steady was with Hopeton Lewis, "Take It Easy",' confirms session keyboardist Gladdy Anderson. 'From there, the ska rhythm change, become slow. I was so glad, because the ska was beating me shoulder – whole heap of years playing this fast rhythm pain the shoulder. So when Hopeton Lewis come with that "Take It Easy", it kind of give the hand a rest, because it was like going back to a kind of rock rhythm.'

Though not present for the original session, the drummer on this record was Hugh Malcolm, whom many claim as the originator of the rock steady beat. 'I was in Miami and they did the record,' Malcolm explains. 'I think it's Byron Lee's drummer back it up, but Ken Khouri didn't like it, so he says, "OK, let's keep the rhythm. When Malcolm comes, we'l l make him dub the drums in." Then I dubbed the rock steady drums in it and turned it into the real "Take It Easy".' Hopeton Lewis' follow-up, an even cooler tale of sound system battles called 'Sounds And Pressure', helped to consolidate the popularity of this relaxed beat.

The band leader and musical arranger _of_ Lewis' Federal sessions, and of many of the best rock steady numbers to follow, was a talented guitarist and steel-pan player from Trinidad named Nerlynn (Lynn) Taitt. Taitt played rhythm guitar on several of the most noteworthy ska numbers, but truly flourished as a lead player during the rock steady period.

As a boy growing up in San Fernando, Lynn Taitt discovered his innate musical abilities within his community. 'I used to beat a rhythm on the edge of a barrel down at the standpipe, and a guy heard me and brought a steel pan for me,' Taitt explains. 'I grew up with twenty-four boys in one area, we used to hang out together, and we built up a steel band when I was about eight or ten years old. I entered the competition for the best soloist in Trinidad and came first in 1956.' Eventually, Taitt acquired a guitar that a friend pilfered from a drunken sailor, and joined a band called the Dutchey Brothers.

By 1960, Taitt's prodigious skills saw him leading the Nerlynn Taitt Orchestra. He was brought to Jamaica in 1962 by Byron Lee to back calypso artists such as Lord Melody at the independence celebrations. When an unscrupulous manager disappeared with the money Taitt stayed in Jamaica, playing in bands on the evolving ska scene. 'I ended up in the Sheikhs with Lloyd Wilks, [tenor saxophonist] Bobby Gaynair, [bassist] Lloyd Spence, Deadley Headley and [vocalist] Honey Boy Martin. That is where I met Jackie Mittoo – he was on piano. The bassist get to know I could arrange, and he and I left the Sheikhs and went and formed the Cavaliers. The organist Winston Wright and Johnny Moore played in that group, and then when I meet Lloyd Knibb, he like how I play guitar.'

Knibb brought Taitt down to Duke Reid for whom he played rhythm on some landmark ska recordings, including Baba Brooks' 'Shank I Sheck' (released by Reid's friend, King Edwards), and Justin Hinds and the Dominoes' 'Carry Go Bring Come'. Taitt also became a substitute for Jerry Haines in the Skatalites at Studio One. By the start of the rock steady period, Taitt was fronting the Comets. 'In 1967 I was with Prince Buster in England – we tour for about four months. At that time I changed platform and had a group called the Comets: Lloyd Wilks was there, Honey Boy, [vocalist] Glen Miller, trombonist Ron Wilson, and Lloyd Knibb used to play stage shows in my group. Then I formed the Jets with Headley Bennett, Brian Atkinson on bass, a trumpet, tenor, and alto [saxophones] and a second guitarist named Jerry.'

**Lynn Taitt [Robert Schoenfeld]**

Taitt says the unique picking style he developed on his Hofner, which helped define many a rock steady tune, was inspired by the cadence of the music he used to play in his native Trinidad. 'The bubbling of the guitar comes from the steel drum,' he emphasizes. 'I try to imitate that.'

When not making one of his regular appearances on Supersonics sessions for Duke Reid, Lynn Taitt was essentially a freelancer whose skills were put to optimum use by various other producers. For Federal, he arranged not only Hopeton Lewis' debut hits but also work by the Paragons and his own casually expressive instrumentals. The Jets were also the backing band at WIRL for much of the rock steady period, including the brief but crucial phase when Lee Perry was in-house producer, fresh from his long apprenticeship at Studio One. They also provided the backing for the earliest material produced by Joel Gibson, a record salesman and television repair shop proprietor better known as Joe Gibbs.

Gibson hailed from Montego Bay, but in his teens worked on the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. He returned to Kingston at the tail end of the ska period, rising to prominence as a producer with Roy Shirley's 'Hold Them', another of rock steady's defining moments perceptively arranged by Lynn Taitt.

Roy Shirley is a singer who draws heavily from American soul, and his quavering tones and restrained delivery have drawn comparison with Solomon Burke. As with Hopeton Lewis' 'Take It Easy', Shirley explains, the peculiar timing of 'Hold Them' stemmed from his inability to adapt the soul style to a ska beat. 'The first thing that came on the scene was ska. Ska was a very powerful music, ruled by a band named the Skatalites. I don't know how they get that ska thing, but I think it was built up between them, Sir Coxsone and some jazz thing from America, because most of those guys was away abroad, and when they come back, they just form that thing into their era. I find out that it was difficult still – I couldn't score into the ska, because I was still into that kind of soul vibes; it was difficult to cross over. I remember I went to Sir Coxsone and I manage to get round the piano. I start to sing "Hold Them" and him say, "No man, that youth there, come back and check me in three years' time." I check out Coxsone because he put on a lot of big shows, have artists like Theophilus Beckford and tunes like "Four Corners Of The World" with the Skatalites, "Freedom" by Clancy Eccles, and the man Owen Gray, some tune named "On The Beach" – that's real influence to bring any young singer with ambition forward. I think I was too small for him, because at the time their beat was more up-tempo and I was coming with a slow thing, so it was too new.' Coxsone's refusal was a humiliating response for a singer who already had some recording experience under his belt, but Shirley says it only strengthened his resolve to make the song hit.

Roy Shirley grew up in Trench Town with his mother and stepfather, part of a community centred on a Revivalist church. Like many of Jamaica's foundation singers, he got his start on talent contests. Early recordings for Simeon Smith failed to gain release, but 'Oh Shirley', his debut issue on the Kong Brothers' Beverley's label, co-arranged by Jimmy Cliff, was a hit in 1965. He then formed the Leaders with Ken Boothe, Joe White and Chuck Josephs (a singer known as Chuck Berry Junior), but recordings for Federal failed to be of much consequence. Subsequently with Slim Smith and Franklyn White, Shirley joined the first incarnation of the Uniques, a spin-off of the frequently changing Techniques vocal group. 'We are the original Uniques,' Shirley clarifies. 'Out of Techniques or Uniques come the same set of man, them fall out and form different name. Me and the Uniques sang tune for JJ, but he was always a little guy in the production field.' The group also recorded for Caltone, a label established by the late Blondel Calnek, a former manager of the Skatalites, known professionally as Ken Lack; but the material was as unsuccessful as that cut for JJ and the group temporarily disbanded.

**Roy Shirley, rock steady's high priest [David Katz]**

Left on his own, Shirley crafted the unique and influential 'Hold Them'. As the singer recalls, 'I always sing a lot of soul, like Sam Cooke, but I could only play two chord on the guitar, so that's how this "Hold Them" start to come up. I said, "Get in the groove and move those feet", and everywhere I go, people love the tune, so I just keep singing it, but I couldn't start a beat, neither a bass line to get it going. One day I was standing just opposite Beverley's and I happens to see some Salvation Army people coming down Orange Street. The man was beating the drum and cymbal, and the thing just come into me.'

A mutual friend brought Shirley to Joe Gibbs' attention. 'I used to sing with Slim Smith, because we were very close friends. There was a tailor friend of ours who was impressed by how me and Slim Smith sing, and him and Joe Gibbs was friends because they was in Guantanamo Bay together, but Slim Smith's guys never really want to know, because them sing for Duke Reid and them no want fi mash up them group. When I find I couldn't get nobody else from Slim Smith's group, I go to Ken Boothe and we go to a rehearsal place at Cross Roads with Drumbago. We start to rehearse the song, but for some reason, Slim Smith and Ken Boothe couldn't manage that part that I am singing. They are still singing the ska, because the ska was stealing everybody – them start to war and quarrel until the producer say, "A good tune that." Then Gladstone Anderson call the producer and say, "You have to make Roy sing the tune, a him write it. Make him alone sing it." And from me start go 'pon the mike, everybody start dance. We go to Federal about a week after with Lynn Taitt, Drumbago, Jackie Jackson and Jerry on [rhythm] guitar.'

**Joe Gibbs [David Katz]**

When Joe Gibbs aired the song at his Amalgamated television repair shop on Beeston Street, it was obvious that 'Hold Them' was something special. Its augmented marching-drum beat, given further demarcation by a choppy piano line and embellished by off-beat bursts of Lynn Taitt's guitar, is a thrilling backdrop to Roy's individual delivery, his quavering voice exhorting his audience to let the music take hold of their dancing feet. 'Hold Them' was a massive hit that helped the music shift further from ska.

'Joe Gibbs cut a dub to test it out,' Shirley recalls, 'and as the man put on the dub, the youth left the corner and come in the shop, "Play back that tune there!" In the evening, I go carry it over east, to Dunkirk. [Singer] Maxie Romeo was a deejay playing with a sound at the time at Longstone Road, and I remember that he played it seventeen times that night.'

The immediate success of the song was so great that Coxsone had Ken Boothe cover the tune, apparently in an effort to capture the overseas market. Boothe scored a number of solo hits for Coxsone in ska, including 'You'r e No Good', backed by the Sharks, and 'Come Running Back,' but it was in the rock steady idiom that he began to be recognized internationally.' "Train Is Coming", that is the hit that make me big all over Jamaica,' Boothe recalls. 'During that period, Downbeat was going to foreign and bringing back songs that he think me can sing over, like "Moving Away", and "Come Tomorrow" by Manfred Mann – that song was a big hit. Me was a big household name in Jamaica and start to get big in Nassau [Bahamas], but the song that take me abroad is "Puppet On A String" that won the Euro vision with Sandie Shaw.'

The Studio One version of 'Puppet On A String' transformed the pop song into something akin to rock steady. Boothe pointed out that Coxsone's recently upgraded equipment now allowed for multi-track recording and separate over-dubs: 'You could do the rhythm without the singer present, so Jackie Mittoo made the rhythm of "Puppet On A String" without even I knowing about it. It take off in the dancehall, and then Downbeat release it in England and it took off there too.'

Another of Boothe's biggest hits in this period was 'I Don't Want To See You Cry', a song which Roy Shirley says was originally composed for the Leaders group. After the success of 'Hold Them', Shirley himself recorded a series of other tunes for Joe Gibbs, including 'Dance The Arena', 'The World Needs Love' and 'Music Is The Key', but none had the impact of his debut hit.

**Errol Dunkley at home [David Katz]**

Gibbs followed 'Hold Them' with rock steady hits by Errol Dunkley, a pubescent singer who emerged as the next child star after Delroy Wilson. Dunkley was born in 1951 and raised in West Kingston. 'The music business were about in its second generation when I started singing,' he explains. 'I started at the tail end of ska, then it change to rock steady and I was really popular in Jamaica in the rock steady era. As a kid, I was mostly a dancer, and this is how I used to hustle at my mum's bar - people used to pay me to dance, then I develop singing from that. I started singing at churches and at talent concerts, and my gate on Woodrow Street was a hangout point for the kids in the evening, because there was a lamp-post. Night-time we'd be under the light post, singing and writing songs.'

Dunkley joined a street corner group with Junior English, who later became a popular solo artist in London. As Dunkley recalls, 'Junior English come and see me and ask me if I want to team up and form a group. I was about eleven, Junior was about fourteen.' The duo answered an ad in the _Gleaner_ for new talent, placed by Prince Buster who would produce Dunkley's first inconsequential sides. Eventually, a chance encounter with future producer Bunny Lee led to the link with Joe Gibbs that would bring Dunkley to the top of the Jamaican charts. 'I was a member of a youth club and I had a letter to see Vic Sampson, one of the owners of West Indies studio, to do an audition. When I went there, Bunny Lee was outside the gate, and he say, "I know you, don't I? You sing some tunes already for Prince Buster. What you do around here so?" He wasn't a producer then – he was trying to be a singer at the time, moving around the circuit. He tell me he know this man who is just coming in the recording business and is looking for artists, and took me to Joe Gibbs' on Beeston Street, just the other street from Prince Buster. He had a shop fixing TV, radio and amplifiers, and [was] selling records, but he had done "Hold Them" with Roy Shirley.'

Gibbs liked Dunkley's singing voice, but thought he would be more successful doing cover tunes. 'He was living in Guantanamo Bay for a long time and had a lot of songs that he brought back, so he gave me this seven-inch [by] Gloria Lynn, "You'r e Gonna Need Me". I did like that song, so I said, "All right, we'r e going to work on this one". It was Slim Smith and I, because Slim Smith and Bunny Lee was friends. I did "You'r e Gonna Need Me" for Joe Gibbs and it was a hit – my first hit song. We recorded it at West Indies with Lynn Taitt, Hugh Malcolm, Jackie Jackson, Gladstone Anderson and Winston Wright – some classic musicians we had at the time.'

As the rock steady form solidified, Treasure Isle emerged as its leading proponent. Though Joe Gibbs and Federal may have released the first efforts in the new genre it was Duke Reid who ruled the rock steady era, reversing disappointments during the ska period when he was largely in the shadow of young challengers Coxsone and Prince Buster. Reid's Treasure Isle studio above his liquor store at 33 Bond Street had a wooden interior that gave its acoustics an added warmth and richness. Much of its equipment was purchased from the defunct studio of Linden Pottinger, whose wife Sonia ran the Tip Top record shop and distribution service from various addresses on Orange Street; as Linden left the business, she launched labels such as Gay Feet, Excel, Rainbow and Tip Top.

Duke Reid's chief engineer, Byron Smith, had a perceptive ear for recording and was respected for his expertise in balancing sound. Perhaps most crucially, the talents of the Supersonics house band provided the perfect backdrop for the love songs, dance tunes and 'rude boy' commentaries on street violence that comprised the rock steady genre. Band leader Tommy McCook played a central role in the definition of the Supersonics' sound, especially where horn arrangements were concerned, whilst the combined efforts of bassist Jackie Jackson and pianist Gladdy Anderson gave their recordings greater texture, augmented by scintillating organ from Winston Wright, complex beats from Hugh Malcolm and steady rhythm guitar from Lorraine (Ronnie 'Bop') Williams.

Williams was born in Spanish Town in 1942 and joined the Supersonics after a spell on the North Coast hotel circuit. 'When I reach nineteen or twenty, I started to play music and travel,' the guitarist explains. 'I was discovered by Tommy McCook in Ocho Rios, playing at the Maracas club. He told me he wanted me to play with him in Kingston with his band as a rhythm player. I think the first tune I played on was "Expo 67" [a huge rock steady smash for the Melodians] and I stayed at Treasure Isle until I went to England in 1970.'

**Ronnie Bop [Beth Lesser]**

Clifton (Jackie) Jackson was born in 1947 and grew in various parts of downtown Kingston. His uncle was the pianist Luther Williams, leader of one of Jamaica's first big jazz bands. Jackie studied piano in his youth, but switched to bass after encountering Lioyd Brevett's artistry; Stax session player Duck Dunn was also a major influence. Like Brevett, Jackie Jackson has a tall frame perfectly suited for the bass. He adapted well to the instrument, and eventually switched from upright to electric to play in small live bands. 'I didn't get into a band until four or five years after. In those days, the big bands were Carlos Malcolm, Byron Lee, Kes Chin and the Souvenirs and the Vagabonds. Then you had the little bands – the Cavaliers and Ty and the Titans. I play with Ty and the Titans by accident: I knew the drummer and followed him to a rehearsal, and the bass player and the band leader got into a fight. I was in that band for three years. By that time the Skatalites had disbanded. Lester Sterling formed this band called Cavaliers, and I became the bass player for two or three years.'

It was while he was in the Cavaliers that Jackson received a surprise visit at home from one of his idols, resulting in his installation at Duke Reid's recently completed studio. 'My mother said somebody's at the gate for me. When I went out there, this gentleman said, "My name is Tommy McCook. I'm forming this band called Tommy McCook and the Supersonics – I'm here to put you in the band as the bass player." That was it – I was in university now, being in that band. The rest of the stuff I was doing was just comprehensive school. After about a month in the band, I started recording. I was the resident bass player for Treasure Isle for years. My first song was "Girl I'v e Got A Date", and that became like an anthem in Jamaica.'

'Girl I'v e Got A Date' was the first of many substantial hits by Alton Ellis and the Flames that really worked to establish rock steady as Jamaica's dominant music; 'Rock Steady', a later smash, is the song most associated with the dance and genre itself. Drummer Hugh Malcolm claims this as the first rock steady recording. 'The type of drums that I play on that rhythm,' he says with great sincerity, 'was the very first type anywhere in the world.'

Malcolm lives with his family in a modest bungalow in an isolated village in the depths of rural Jamaica. Cutlass in hand, he says he was born in a small town in Hanover, was raised in Westmoreland by farming parents, and brought into a big jazz band in 1955, a year after moving to Kingston to study woodwork. 'From baby days in the country, I used to go where the big bands are playing in the Christmas party, and I used to request playing the drums, so from those days, I know about drums. When I was seventeen, a band master placed me in the Jocelyn Trapp Orchestra – that was the biggest orchestra in the West. We work at the Montego Beach Hotel, the Half Moon, for a long likkle period. Those days I didn't start to read music yet - play by ear.'

**Jackie Jackson**

After living for a while with an uncle in Port Antonio in order to attend high school Malcolm returned to Kingston, where he studied music at Alpha under band masters Alfred Delgado and Vincent Tullo. He started playing in small live bands while doing building work during the day, and appeared on sporadic recordings for Coxsone and Duke Reid from the late 1950s. In the early 1960s, he was a regular drummer on the live circuit. 'When Vere Johns started the _Opportunity Knocks,_ they elect me for most of the shows, 'cause I was a drummer that plays every beat. Skatalites go on for a while. I do one and two hits with them, such as "Simmer Down" with Bob Marley, and Jackie Opel, "Cry Me A River", and I back other artists like Doreen Schaffer for Coxsone.'

When the Skatalites split, Malcolm declined an offer to play with the Soul Brothers and instead joined the Supersonics. 'Roland Alphonso wanted me to come and play drums with him, but he was a kind of ignorant band leader and we couldn't wrap too tough – I got some ways he didn't like, and he got some ways I didn't like. Those days I used to rent house, so I go down to Bournemouth Gardens to look at this apartment; I saw a car driving behind me, and I noticed it was Kes Chin, my former band leader, running me down. He say, "Some instrument we put together, and Tommy say he elect you as his drummer." I drove behind him and go out to Club Havana, owned by Matthew Chin in those days – he was also one of the band manager, of which Duke Reid was the founder. He spend his money to buy these instruments. When we get there, [McCook] names that he wants me on drums, and who and who on other instruments.'

It was the Supersonics, Malcolm insists, who originated rock steady. 'I'v e heard a lot of people say they make this, they make that, but Hux Brown and Lynn Taitt, we make that beat with Jackie Jackson, Winston Wright, Gladstone Anderson – we make the beat, rock steady.' Malcolm himself defines the beat as complex: 'I play a galloping, like a horse, on my snare, and on the bass drum I play funky and one drop in between, so it's very tricky – funky sometimes, because the one drop is the beat, but the accents sometimes are funky. When the space is there, we just put the double in it. Then I used to get a lot of fight from musicians to play sixteen on my high-hat – that's the spice on the rock steady: you play triplet, but as soon as you go in like a horse, riding and put in the sixteen, then you gotta get up and _wind_ to this thing.'

Despite his acknowledgement of 'Take It Easy' as an early rock steady disc, Hugh Malcolm says Alton Ellis' 'Rock Steady' was the first recording built on a rock steady drum beat. 'That time, ska was raising Cain and there was no beat named rock steady yet, so we do that rhythm "Get Ready, Let's Do Rock Steady" with Alton Ellis.'

**Hugh Malcolm at home [David Katz]**

**Alton Ellis [Beth Lesser]**

Ellis was born in 1935 and raised in Trench Town. In 1961, he and his partner Eddie Perkins hit big with 'Muriel' for Coxsone. The duo cut further work with Dodd and recorded for Vincent Chin. When Perkins went to the USA Ellis teamed up briefly with John Holt before the latter became a member of the Paragons. Then Alton formed the Flames with neighbours Winston Jarrett and Eggar Gordon; Alton's brother Leslie and a friend named Ronnie were temporary members of the group. As Jarrett recalls, 'After Eddy leave and go to the States, Alton was vexed, 'cause they singing so long time. I came by and say, "We could form a group," and him say he's going to think it over. We start practice every night, write lyrics like "Girl I'v e Got A Date", "Cry Tough" and "Preacher", the first song we recorded at Treasure Isle. Jackie Jackson was there and Lynn Taitt, Tommy McCook, Drumbago, Gladstone Anderson, Winston Wright. We was the first man who christen Duke Reid's studio.'

**Winston 'Flames' Jarrett [Adrian Thomas]**

Winston Jarrett is one of the few artists I did not have to search for in Jamaica. Within days of my arrival he turned up at my door in a T-shirt bearing his name and photograph, in case I had any doubt who he was; he was then effectively homeless since his downtown living quarters had recently burned down. Jarrett says his early inspiration stemmed from spiritual singing and American soul. 'I born 1940 and grow in Saint Anne, Lime Tree Gardens. I came to Kingston at an early age with my mother and father. My mother came to Kingston to work with white people in the colonial days. My bigger brothers was living in Trench Town, so I grow up at 24 Fourth Street, Kingston 12. I really grow up in a Christian family, Church of God, where everybody clap hands and praise God, read your Bible two times a day to drive vampire away. My father was a deacon in the church them days, but Sundays in the dining room, he would put on the gramophone, put on those 78s, and that's where I get all my ideas from. Many songs inspired me by the great Impressions with Curtis Mayfield, and I love Sam Cooke, Dinah Washington, Chuck Berry. In those days I get my little sardine pan and lay a flat piece of board across. I made a little guitar, put that puss-gut fishing line on it and made three string that you could pick like a banjo, and I have that little bamboo drum stick underneath my arm. That's where I started from.'

Trench Town, one of the least privileged places on the island, was a community built around Kingston's main sewage gully. Jarrett speaks of the neighbourhood as one of the most fertile grounds for vocalists. 'Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer, Ken Boothe, Jimmy Cliff, Alton Ellis, Hortense Ellis, Higgs and Wilson, the Richards Brothers, so many singers in the same little district, in Kingston 12, Trench Town.'

Jarrett says the Flames had a shifting line-up, with men such as Noel 'Zoot' Sims and Lloyd Charmers occasionally taking the place of Eggar Gordon. They took the name Flames, he explains, 'because I was on a show with James Brown and the Flames, we perform together at the Carib Theatre'. The Flames' earliest material warned of the excesses of rude boy life: their 1965 late-ska smash 'Dance Crasher' detailed the exploits of a thug named Busby who caused mayhem at sound system events. The following year saw slower rock steady numbers with a similar message, including 'The Preacher', 'Blessings Of Love' and the popular 'Cry Tough', another tune inspired by Busby's brutality and given melodic structure by the violin of a player known as White Rum Raymond.

That such songs would hit in 1966 is understandable, as the rudie violence that had begun in the late 1950s had intensified to such an extent that the government was forced to call a State of Emergency that lasted a month. Violence was not only more commonplace in the ghetto, but had rapidly taken a political dimension. In the early 1960s a number of street gangs were formed, some overtly criminal like the Denham Town Park Gang, but others based more on kinship and mutual support in fragmented communities that lacked basic amenities. The Spanglers, originally formed downtown on Regent Street, were loyal followers of Duke Reid's sound, which notorious criminals such as Whoppi King also frequented; the gang was based in the slums of Back-O-Wall and Lizard Town, until Edward Seaga had the tenements there bulldozed in the summer of 1966 in order to build Tivoli Gardens, Jamaica's first government housing scheme. However, this new concrete estate was populated not by those whose dwellings had been destroyed but by JLP supporters, and the area was kept loyal to the ruling party by the heavily armed 'enforcers' of the rival Tivoli Gang.

Seaga is unrepentant about the way Tivoli was created. 'Back-O-Wall was the worst criminal den in the entire country,' he says with obvious displeasure. 'Police couldn't go there. It wasn't a community, it was just a collection of shacks, and part of it was on what is now Marcus Garvey Drive, which was in full sight of everyone travelling by. We had to do something to remove that type of unsightly community there, so the intention was really to remove the shacks and to bring a community with proper housing.' Is it true that the residents were not given warning before the slum clearance, as has often been stated in print? 'We always give prior warning, even unto today, but no matter how much warning you give, persons who are squatters on land, they don't go, they are there right at the end. You rarely find a community where warning is given and the people take warning and go. Some might, but the bulk of them stay to the end.' What about the fact that the newly created Tivoli was housed by JLP supporters who had not been living in the area? 'People who were housed there were people who wanted to go there. It was open to everyone, but I guess because the government that I was a part _of_ bulldozed the area, the people who were then there, who had by that time taken up residence in other areas of Western Kingston, didn't see themselves as wanting to go back there, because they have not felt comfortable, so they weren't making applications – but somebody did.' Could Seaga confirm whether the original Spanglers were supporters of Duke Reid's sound? 'That's correct, but they had nothing to do with Duke Reid – Duke Reid wasn't involved with any group known as a gang. Duke Reid had a number of fellows who were always around with him, because if his sound system was going out to be played, you need people, and some of them were deejays for the sound system. But that didn't make them into a gang. Matter _of_ fact, one of his top deejays was someone who was very helpful to me, a man called Dapper Dan. He became involved at the very beginning when we wTere building up a constituency. You'd have to build up your support from all levels and he was from that sort of working-class level of vendors and higglers and so on, one of those who worked with us.'

Before 1966 most rudie battles were waged with knives, bottles or open fists, but now the Tivoli Gang had handguns and live ammunition; so the Spanglers moved their power base to Matthews Lane and accepted arms and support from the opposition PNP. Likewise the previously independent Vikings, based on the Kingston waterfront, threw in their lot with the PNP when the originally apolitical Phoenix gang tried to gain control of the area, allegedly at the instigation of the JLP.

By the following year, the violence had got so out of hand that thugs raped a schoolgirl and assaulted a teacher at Denham Town School, prompting Prince Buster to record what is perhaps the best-known anti-rude boy song, 'Judge Dread', following Derrick Morgan's 'Tougher Than Tough'. Though his peers warned that such tunes could be dangerous, Buster knew he could count on support should any backlash arise: 'I have my likkle youth them a Luke Lane ready fi face anything.' Buster says he appeared in the song as an 'Ethiopian' judge in order to stop those who participated in such wickedness despite claiming to be followers of Rastafari. 'A lot of the people who was doing the act was wearing long dread and calling themselves Rasta. The authority to them is Ethiopia, so I had to come as an Ethiopian for them to understand what I was saying.'

Though the rudie feuds were intensifying, soothing love material made up most of the rock steady idiom. Alton Ellis' emotive tenor, backed by the Flames' choral harmonies, proved the perfect vehicle for love songs such as 'Baby I love You', 'Breaking Up', 'Remember That Sunday' and 'I'm Just A Guy', all serious, long-lasting hits. In addition to the captivating harmonies, the high quality of the Supersonics' backing helped these songs retain an individual flair; 'Breaking Up', for instance, has a wonderful flute from Tommy McCook, while 'Remember That Sunday' is marked by Winston Wright's percolating organ licks. McCook and Wright also cut instrumental versions of many rock steady hits for Treasure Isle B-sides.

Whilst Alton Ellis gave Duke Reid some of his biggest rock steady hits, the singer's flawless deliveries ensured that he was in demand to moonlight for the competition: several of the tunes he cut for Reid he cut again for Coxsone Dodd, along with other original material and highly individualized covers of American soul. When Dodd sent Ellis on a UK tour with Jackie Mittoo and the Soul Brothers, it signalled the break-up of the Flames and Alton's departure from Treasure Isle.

Nevertheless Duke Reid stayed at the top of rock steady with a number of other strong harmony groups, including the Paragons, the Jamaicans, the Melodians, the Silvertones and the Techniques.

The Paragons first recorded for Coxsone around 1965. Original group member Keith Anderson, better known to the world as Bob Andy, recounts their formation: 'The group started out with [Tyrone] Evans and myself as a duo, Andy and Ronnie. We went to the same church downtow7n and were members of the same scout troop. '57-'58 is when we really started – we were only about fourteen or so. We actually recorded a song for Duke Reid, 'I'm In Love'. It was so good that it was a dub [plate] – they just kept it for competitive purposes when the sound played out.'

Anderson says the greater success of better-established duos made the pair seek to widen the group. 'We started looking for other guys in the church club that we had, that was just about the time of the dance called the Hully Gully. We changed three or four names and seven or eight guys. Funnily enough, the group that we patterned ourselves after vocally was the Drifters, and somehow our group ended up with a history like theirs, because the guys drifted in and out.' Eventually, the Paragons' line-up became Anderson, Evans and Howard Barrett, with John Holt drafted in as lead singer. 'We had this other guy called Leroy Stamp who we got rid of,' Anderson recalls. 'Someone told us about John Holt and he worked out perfectly. That quartet is actually what went to record with Studio One firstly. Coxsone loved us because we were very organized – we were a neat bunch of guys and knew what we were about. The songs we did for Coxsone were ballads: we did a cover of the Drifters' "Follow Me" and the other three songs were originals. "In Love At Last" was number one on both radio stations.'

**Bob Andy meets the press [David Katz]**

Anderson says some internal friction followed. 'We were having ego problems with John Holt, so we tried Vic Taylor when we were nominated for the first Festival song contest held to commemorate Jamaica's independence in '66. Vic Taylor and myself, we grew up at the same children's home. He was with Lynn Taitt and the Comets, but he started out with a group called the Monarchs. After the Festival, Barrett and Evans quite rightly said that while Vic is a great singer, he wasn't as suited to Paragons as John was, so they were going to bring him back. So I said I will step if John comes back, because he's not going to change. John is still my brethren until this day, but I felt overshadowed in the group.' Anderson went back to Studio One, where he 'did odd jobs around the studio to make a living' before launching a solo career as a singer-songwriter.

After Anderson's departure, Holt continued to model the group after the Drifters. Reaching Treasure Isle in late 1966, the Paragons' blissful harmony was responsible for twelve number one hit singles in a row, including 'Happy Go Lucky Girl', 'Only A Smile', 'On The Beach', 'Wear You To The Ball' and 'The Tide Is High', the last of which would be memorably adapted to achieve chart success by New York new wave group Blondie at the end of the 1970s.

**The post-Andy Paragons [Courtesy of Jamphoto]**

The Jamaicans quartet was led by Tommy Cowan. They hit big in 1967 with the close harmony of 'Things You Say' and 'Ba Ba Boom', the nonsensical winner of the annual Festival song competition.

What set the Melodians apart was that two of their three vocalists sang lead: Brent Dowe's clear, deeper tones were sometimes supplanted by the higher, tremulous voice of founder Tony Brevett, nephew of Skatalites bassist Lloyd. In the back room of Alton Ellis' All Tone record shop in South London, a jittery Brevett tries to explain the evolution of the group. 'Melodians was like more than one group, because we all sing together from Ebenezer School, Darling Street, and [at] the school football team sports club. About 1962, it was me and a guy named George Allison and Bob Marley, we used to sing at the club. Bob say, "Me hear about a white boy on Slipe Road, we have an audition", so we harmonize up some foreign tune, for we have to sound like foreign singer. Another guy named Eddie Fraser, after a while them call him a murderer, but him is the man who always used to give you the key to go into the church so that we a go play the pipe organ. A next man now, him get two gun – it's pure bad man [involved] – but him give me a ukulele, and we start learn that one-finger G, and a one-finger D, and two-finger, three-finger D. We start rehearsing at Back-O-Wall, so we ready to form a group.'

After Bob Marley made his recording debut for Leslie Kong, he tried to help Brevett get into the music business by schooling his evolving group. 'We still gwan a school, me thirteen now, and Bob come for me, say, "Tony, come around Beverley's fi sing one tune." He gwan a studio, so me a beg teacher to let me out. After a while we had a guy named Bradfield Brown in the group, he was the bass man, sing tunes like [Frankie Lymon's ] "Juvenile Delinquent" at Trench Town in the night. Bob said, "I wTant you to sing in your natural tone of voice", so me have to sing a falsetto on top of the harmony now. Me find Trevor McNaughton, go a Greenwich Farm and a man say Brent Dowe is one of him school friends, a brother who can sing.'

'Tony Brevett met me in Greenwich Town in 1962 and we becomes friends,' confirms Brent Dowe at his home in Portmore. 'We started singing in clubs all over the place, sing every Friday night at Kittymat Club.' Known as Porky because he was fat as a child, Dowe was born in Saint James in 1946. His mother, who worked for the Coffee Industry Board, brought him to Greenwich Town in 1953. Formerly the site of Greenwich Farm (as it is still alternatively known), Greenwich Town is a sprawling ghetto west of downtown Kingston, between industrial areas below the Spanish Town Road and just south of Whitfield Town. Like nearby Trench Town, Greenwich Town was a breeding-ground for vocal groups, one of the ghetto areas from which many central figures sprang.

Brevett says the Melodians first recorded as a quartet for Prince Buster, but the material may have been reserved as sound system specials. Bradfield Brown subsequently left the group. Later, some of their best later material was co-written by silent partner Renford Cogle.

The group passed their audition before Bibi Seaton and Ken Boothe at Studio One, and a handful _of_ Melodians discs were issued by Coxsone in 1966. The group then moved to higher wages at Treasure Isle, where they became one of the leading groups of the day through hits like 'You Have Caught Me', 'You Don't Need Me' and 'Expo 67', another song proposing a train journey to a magical place. 'It was a money thing,' says Dowe of their shift of allegiance. 'Who was paying more money. Coxsone was giving _£_ 6 for one shot, down at Duke we got _£_ 10 for one shot.'

The Silvertones made their name at Treasure Isle with adaptations of American hits, led by the baritone of a tall youth named Delroy Denton. 'The group started with me and Keith Coley,' recalls founding member Gilmour Grant. 'After a while we meet Denton, and through he could play the guitar most, he really get to be lead singer. [Duke Reid] used to have auditions on Sunday, so we take a try, but we didn't get through the first time. When we make our first song it was a lucky time for us, because they record eight songs that night and our song was the last. In those days it was only two tracks, one for the music and one for the voice. The musicians was Tommy McCook and the Supersonics – he said to us if we can make one cut he will record, but if you spoil it you don't have another chance. That's the one chance that we get, and we take it. "True Confession", that was the only hit song out of the eight. Then we made [a cover of Wilson Pickett's ] "Midnight Hour". We was around with Duke Reid, and in between that we sing a song named "Guns Fever" with Miss [Sonia] Pottinger.'

**Gilmore Grant [right] and Keith Coley of the Silvertones [David Katz]**

The Techniques, one of the constantly changing street corner set-ups of West Kingston, was another harmony group that helped keep Duke Reid far above the competition. At his record shop on Orange Street, founder Winston Riley says that they formed in late 1964 at a neighbourhood youth club established by Edward Seaga. 'I grow up in West Kingston, in the ghetto,' he explains, 'between Milk Lane and North Street, Tivoli and them place there. I used to sing in contests with Vere Johns and on school concerts – sing on the street and all type of things. While we were singing at school, Edward Seaga form a club on Wellington Street, nearby Tivoli Gardens, and I come and join the band as a singer and bass player, [with] Slim Smith, Frederick Waite, Franklyn White and the Richards Brothers. We were friends, because we used to sing at the same school, Kingston Senior School.'

'None of them could play music,' notes Seaga, 'but I gave them instruments and they practise. A lot of the top artists would come there and sing with the band: Jimmy Cliff, Ken Boothe, Stranger Cole, Marcia Griffiths, Prince Buster, Toots and the Maytals.'

'We go on concerts and back them up,' Riley continues. 'Then our first recording was organized by Mr Edward Seaga at Federal records. Major Lance came to Jamaica, an American singer, and we did the first recording – that song was called "No One". Major Lance record the whole group – we get musicians and we were just the singers. Then Ken Boothe and Stranger Cole carry we to Duke Reid. "Little Did You Know", that was a number one hit.'

The Techniques' original lead singer was Keith 'Slim' Smith, an emotional individual with a powerful tenor-alto range. Fellow singer Jimmy Riley was a close friend of Smith and followed the group's many permutations. Perched on a chair in the back room of Derrick Harriott's shop, a relaxed and friendly Riley tries to make plain the interwoven strands that formed the careers of the Techniques, Uniques and Sensations. 'I used to go [to] Kingston Senior School where a lot of singers used to go: Alton Ellis, Slim Smith, Carl Dawkins – it was just like a singers' school. Slim Smith and myself was in the same class. Me and Dadum [Frederick Waite] used to live at Waterhouse, so we used to ride together on the bus, and he used to tell me about the group they had formed. I wasn't paying him no mind, then one evening I turned the radio on and heard this ska record, "Little Did You Know", an original Duke Reid record. They said, "by the Techniques". I said, "But that's my group in my school! This thing is for real!" So I started hanging – I was like the fifth member of the Techniques. I wanted to be in the group so bad, but all groups was four [members], so I used to carry Slim Smith's clothes [to their performances] to go in for free. I rehearse with them downtown in West Street and teach Winston the harmonies, but I wasn't officially in the group.'

**The sensational Jimmy Riley [Adrian Thomas]**

Jimmy then decided to form his own group with other singers from the neighbourhood. 'I said since I can't get into Techniques, I'm going to form my own group, the Sensations, along with Cornell Campbell and Buster Riley, Winston's brother, and a big guy, Aaron Davis, we call him Bobby [aka 'Dego']. Then the Techniques took us to Duke Reid, right at that point of late ska going into rock steady, and we started recording for Duke Reid – Gladdy auditioned us. King Sporty came there, he [had been] in America and heard this song called "Juvenile Delinquent" by Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers, and he brought it to us and we start rehearsing. That was the first song we recorded as the Sensations, and it was a hit in the dancehall at that time.'

Cornell Campbell adds a few particulars: 'I started to develop myself as a printer and I forget about singing. Then Jimmy Riley, he grow in my neighbourhood, he said, "Cornell, make we form a group." I wasn't interested, but him was demanding and always focus on me to form a group, so him get two other guys, Buster Riley and Dego, and we form the Sensations, but Jimmy Riley had the name Dynamics. I said, "I don't like the name Dynamics, it too silly – you have to name Sensations or something." We do several recordings for Treasure Isle. Earlier, I took Slim Smith to Coxsone Downbeat, but Coxsone never record him, say, "But Keith, you no ready yet", so he went to Treasure Isle and formed the Techniques. Then when I split up the Sensations, my group went with Slim Smith. All of us did form the group together, but I drop out, said, "So much bull can't reign in one pen," because everybody wanted to be leader.'

After his previous collaboration with Roy Shirley and Ken Boothe, Slim Smith recruited Jimmy Riley to form a modified Uniques after the Techniques and Sensations shifted membership. 'I love Slim Smith like my own brother,' Riley states with obvious sincerity. 'Me and him was closer than brothers, because he was close to my age and we used to hang out – not just singing, but with girls at night, we go parties, we go dance, we play cricket... we just had a bond. He and Winston Riley had a falling out over some money, and the original Techniques broke up, so we formed the Uniques, which was a spin-off of the Techniques. I left the Sensations and Jackie Parris came after, and they was again four. Uniques was me, Slim Smith, and then we found Lloyd Charmers, and the first song we record, "Let Me Go Girl", was a number one.'

Backed by the Caribbeats and cut for fresh producer Bunny Lee, 'Let Me Go Girl' was the first of many hits for the reformed Uniques. Their success was seen as a challenge to better-established groups. 'Uniques was the most popular group, the only group that ever give Bob Marley and the Wailers a run for the money. They had a show called the "Battle of the Groups" at Ward Theatre, and Uniques won. Bob Marley draw his knife and create a scene. It was war downtown and our posse said, "Nobody can fight Uniques", so it was just a stand-off Both the Uniques and the re-formed Techniques kept the hits flying, notably with modified covers of Impressions' hits, such as the Uniques' version of 'Gypsy Woman' and the Techniques' 'You Don't Care' and 'Queen Majesty'.

'Curtis Mayfield was a major influence,' says Pat Kelly, whose cool, wounded lead is featured on 'You Don't Care'. 'We grewT up in that era: Curtis Mayfield, the Temptations, Smokey Robinson, Jerry Butler.' Kelly is on the veranda of his home in the lower middle-class Kingston suburb _of_ Patrick City, close to the homes of John Holt and Bunny Lee. Apparently a quiet, unassuming man, he says he was born Horatious Kelly in Kingston in 1944 and raised in the ghetto of Maxfield Avenue by his mother, a housewife, and father, a builder who became a church minister when Pat was seventeen. He became a temporary Techniques member when he returned to Jamaica on vacation while studying electronics in America. 'I had no intention of singing,' he insists. 'I went to school and studied as an electronic engineer. Firstly I went to Kingston Technical, and then I did three years in electronics at the Massachusetts College of Technology. It was during semester in 1967 that I came and did these things. Winston Riley asked me if I could join the group – he saw me first sing when I was at Kingston Technical. The group was Winston Riley, Junior Menz and myself, just the three of us. It took me about three months before we record "You Don't Care For Me At All". Directly it went to number one.'

Kelly returned to the States to continue his studies and was therefore not available to record further hits, but later rejoined the group for other recordings with Duke Reid. 'Junior Menz became leader of "My Girl" and "Queen Majesty" because I left back for college,' he explains. 'Junior Menz left, and then I end up with Winston Riley and Bruce Ruffin – they call him Bruce Ruf-fin, but I know him as Bruce Downer. We did "Day Oh" and "Run Come Celebrate", which was the Festival song.' When Kelly broke away from the group shortly afterwards to pursue a solo career, a modified Techniques remained aligned to Treasure Isle; Bruce Ruffin would later enjoy solo popularity in Britain.

**'No intention of singing': Pat Kelly [David Katz]**

As rock steady continued to rise, other less prominent producers, including Demck Harriott, enjoyed considerable hits. After he acquired his first record shop in 1966, Harriott's biggest production successes came with singer Rudy Mills' 'A Long Story' and Keith and Tex's 'Stop That Train' and 'Tonight', though Keith Rowe of the latter duo suggests that both songs were 'bigger abroad than in Jamaica'. A later hit, 'Don't Look Back', was recorded at the tail end of rock steady, but Rowe's subsequent emigration to New York and Dixon's to Canada cut short the duo's rise.

Ever in tune with the sounds of black America, Derrick Harriott also found success with rock steady adaptations of soul. His sensitive rendition of 'The Loser', arranged by bassist Boris Gardiner and boosted by thrilling drum rolls from Joe Isaacs, had an uncommon piano solo that made it all the more irresistible. 'The piano man, Lloyd Delprat, he was like a concert pianist,' Harriott emphasizes. 'He used to play with Boris' band, but he had that concert touch.' Other hits came with original material written by Junior 'Soul' Murvin, including the sensual 'Solomon'. 'That time you had things like "Baby Be True", the Heptones, "Penny For Your Song", the Federals and my "Solomon",' Harriott recalls.' "Solomon" was going for number one like a nonstop train, but Toots went in jail for a little while and was just coming out with this "54-46". Toots came on so hard that "54-46" went straight to number one.'

I asked Toots if it was true that, as has often been reported, he was busted for ganja in 1967. 'I didn't ,' he insists, 'not for ganja. I get arrested because people wish me bad. I was just bailing a friend who got arrested, and I get arrested for nothing, because it was planned. That's why I sing about it.' Is it true that 54–46 was his actual number while in jail? 'No, I just make it up.' Was the rhythm of this song borrowed from Marcia Griffiths' Coxsone-produced 'Feel Like Jumping', or vice versa? 'They come after me,' Toots grumbles. 'A lot of people in Jamaica copy my rhythm – and all over the world.'

Though Coxsone Dodd's stable was ultimately overshadowed by Duke Reid's in the rock steady period, Studio One had a number of formidable hits by a core of popular artists who included Marcia Griffiths, Ken Boothe, the Gaylads and the Heptones. Griffiths says she started singing professionally 'at the age of thirteen, in 1964'. Her ghetto upbringing was financially poor but spiritually rich. 'I was born and raised in Western Kingston. We were a family full _of_ love and godliness. My father was a carpenter, he made furniture. We had sweet parents: even when we didn't have food to eat, we had love – love was always on our table. I usually sing on the choir at Saint John's Presbyterian church and participate in concerts at school. Philip James of the Blues Busters was the boyfriend of my friend, she lived next door to us, and he heard me singing one night and was overwhelmed. I was twelve, still in school, and he was just knocked out, said he travelled all over the States and he's never heard anybody like me. There was a show planning at the Carib Theatre, Easter Monday morning, with Byron Lee and the Dragonaires. Blues Busters were appearing and he insisted that I appear on the show. I did Carla Thomas' "No Time To Lose", and I can honestly say that I brought the house down. Ronnie Nasrallah, the manager for Byron Lee and the Blues Busters, he immediately offered to manage me and I went on TV and I did two Nancy Wilson songs. From that time, I guess it was green light all the way. Then another friend who worked at RJR radio station, Linford Anderson, took me to Studio One. I didn't even do an audition, because they had already heard that I had performed at the Carib Theatre. Studio One is like Jamaica's Motown: that's where all the great artists pass through, where we all graduate. That's where I do my first recording, in 1964. I was accompanied by my father, 'cause I'm still under-age.'

Griffiths says Coxsone wanted her to be half of a male-female singing duo, but it was not until Bob Andy began writing and arranging her material that her career took off. 'When Mr Dodd found me, he coupled me with almost every male singer, seeking a hit song. Bob Marley and myself did a love song, "Oh My Darling", which I understand he's putting out on an album now – I heard it recently, and it's fresh as ever. Bob Andy and myself did "Really Together", and the late Free-I, Jeff Dixon, we did "Words", a cover version of the Bee Gees. I did a duet with Tony Gregory, "You'r e Mine", and [one with] another brother named Owen Boyce. So I did five duets with five different male singers, and then Bob Andy started writing songs for me: I did "Feel Like Jumping", "Melody Life", "Mark My Word", "Tell Me Now".'

**Love was always on the family table:** **Marcia Griffiths [Horseman]**

It was Bob Andy's sensitive vocal arrangements and visually oriented lyrics that drew the best from Marcia Griffiths' vocal capabilities, and Griffiths says their relationship was blessed by divine properties. 'Bob Andy and myself had an intimate relationship, and I can honestly say that all of this was ordained by the Most High God, 'cause Bob Andy was like a father figure. He was like a big brother – he was my guide, my everything. I met him at a rehearsal at Rockfort with the Paragons. After I went to Studio One, we hook up back, and it wasn't an accident, it was ordained, because he was a man with a lot of experience and wisdom and knowledge, and he was like a guide for me, because I was just a young girl then. For a young female singer in a male-dominated business with men surrounding you, God knows what could have happened, so I think God placed him there. He guided me through all the years, writing songs for me.'

The abstract vocalizing of 'Feel Like Jumping' and romantic optimism of#39;Melody Life' gave Dodd two of his biggest rock steady hits. Both are musically complex, with strong horn arrangements featuring Lester Sterling, Vin Gordon and trumpeter Bobby Ellis. Griffiths says Jackie Mittoo, who also provided backing vocals on the tune, determined the overall shape of 'Feel Like Jumping'.

Though Duke Reid had his greatest rock steady successes with vocal groups, Dodd tended to fare better in this period with solo artists. Perhaps the most successful Studio One vocal groups in rock steady were the Gaylads, who were mainstays for the bulk of the era, and the Heptones, who appeared at rock steady's tail end. The basis of the Gaylads was inspired songwriter Harris 'Bibi' Seaton and his talented singing partner, Winston Delano Stewart; the two first sang together in the Rhythm Aces, a Vineyard Town harmony quartet led by Boris Gardiner. In 1959 Seaton began recording solo for Coxsone, linking back with Stewart in 1962. They joined with Maurice Roberts to form the Gaylads, but disbanded when they failed to hit in ska. Seaton passed through the Carousels on the North Coast and fronted the Astronauts in 1964-5, before the Gaylads finally re-formed and broke through with Seaton's 'Lady In The Red Dress'.

'One night I was visiting a friend who live close to a cemetery,' Seaton explains in the busy offices of Sprint records in London. 'While waiting for him, I sat on a tombstone and this melody came to me, the lyrics and everything. The next day, I saw Winston and Maurice, and we rehearse it and went back to Coxsone.' The near-American feel of 'Lady In The Red Dress' was hugely successful, and the group scored Coxsone a number of further hits. Seaton was also an important member of Coxsone's team in this time, co-writing hit material for other artists and supervising auditions at Studio One through much of the rock steady phase. 'We had about twelve hits in that period, and Gaylads period was when I used to audition artists for Coxsone. I used to get three different salary from Coxsone every week: being a backing singer, being an A & R man and just being a friend.' He recalls with fondness auditioning 'some incredible guys like the Heptones, Melodians, Lloyd Parks who came as the Termites and this guy that came as Fred Locks, he used to sing in a group called the Bassies'. After 'Lady In The Red Dress', the close harmonies of the Gaylads brought Coxsone notable hits such as 'No Good Girl', 'Peculiar Man' (about a chap who would literally knock himself out when encountering local beauties) and 'Love Me With All Your Heart', on which the group played their own instruments.

Moving on to Leslie Kong, the group recorded a number of further hits. 'We did "There's A Fire" – it was number one in Jamaica for a good while. We did "My Love" and an album called _Fire And Rain'_ Seaton also co-wrote some of Ken Boothe's biggest hits for Kong, most notably the self-determined 'Freedom Street'. As part of Sonia Pottinger's growing stable the Gaylads enjoyed some of their biggest hits, but there was internal friction and Delano Stewart left the group in March 1968 to cut a series of strong solo sides before emigrating to America at the start of the 1970s. 'We went to Pottinger and did "Hard To Confess" and "ABC Rock Steady", and I wrote some serious songs for artists in that period like "Say You" and "Lady With The Starlight", by Ken Boothe. Delano left the group and then went to the States; it was Maurice and myself alone that did "ABC Rock Steady".' Seaton says the void left by Delano's departure was never filled satisfactorily; though Seaton continued to lead the Gaylads into the early reggae period, he chose to go solo in the early 1970s. 'We brought in a guy called Kesto Oakley and he did a song with us called "Little Girl". He wasn't totally committed, so we brought in Ricky Grant, a dreadlocks guy who used to hang around Franklyn Town with all of us. He used to do electrician work, and he sang on a song called "God Loves You Soul Sister" that we did at Beverley's . He went away too, and then I got disillusioned with the whole thing because the sound wasn't there any more. Delano Stewart, he's a pedigree. So that's when I went on my own.'

Though the Gaylads' departure from Studio One spelt a notable loss for Coxsone, the Heptones brought considerable gains from the success of the suggestive 'Fattie Fattie'. Leroy Sibbles, Barry Llewellyn and Earl Morgan were blessed with unrivalled harmonic abilities, and though it was Sibbles wTho most often took the lead he was the last to join the group. 'Heptones is not a one-man thing, Heptones is a three-man thing,' emphasizes founding member Earl Morgan. 'From [when] we get together, the three of we is like magic and that's what make we domineer the sixties and seventies.'

Morgan, is seated on the bonnet of a dilapidated Jaguar at his home in Duhaney Park as he recounts the Heptones' formative days. 'The group really started about 1958, but we never start recording until about the end of '66. A whole heap of people always did in there, man come and go. Glen Adams was part of the group at one time.' Like many of Jamaica's classic harmony groups, the Heptones, says Morgan, came together as teenagers on a street corner in West Kingston. 'I was born in 1945 at 12d Benbow Street in Jones Town, and I go by Trench Town when I was about four year old. Early on, I was listening to people on the radiofusion [Rediffusion], and in the evening everyone just go 'pon the corner and hang out and talk – you don't see that nowadays, because in the evening time everybody look 'pon the television. Barry grow up in my area, so me and Barry always rehearse as a duet, and people come and join up. One time Leroy have a group over Newland Town, that is the other side of Trench Town. Him did have a group over there with a girl named Claire and a brother named Winston, so me and Barry go there one day for a street contest and we dethrone them. It's from then on Leroy join our group.'

**Earl Morgan in Duhaney Park [David Katz]**

It was Sydney 'Luddy' Crooks, founder of the Pioneers and aspiring concert promoter, who arranged for the Heptones to audition for Ken Lack in 1966. 'Luddy Pioneers was in Trench Town, he did have a band down Crooks Street. We was rehearsing one evening and he say we must come down tomorrow evening. Them always had this likkle band going round the island, do likkle shows and t'i ng. We go down there and them say Ken Lack going to have a session Monday coming. From that session, Ken Lack released "Gun Man Coming To Town". It was going good on the charts, [until] Delroy Wilson come with [a cover of the Tarns'] "Dancing Mood".'

'After we did those songs, that was the first time we heard ourselves on the radiofusion – the only radio we had back then,' Leroy Sibbles says, swinging in a hammock at his Kingston home. Sibbles has a determined confidence that borders on arrogance; it is easy to picture the tall singer emerging as leader of the group in the Heptones' early days. 'That got our interest really tight on music and I started writing like hell,' he continues. 'Barry was doing mechanics and Earl were doing some _Star_ newspaper selling, so when we got together at night I would always be introducing new songs to them. I was writing like hell, because I had so much inspiration and it was flowing.'

Moving on from Caltone, the group signed a five-year contract at Studio One. 'We check Beverleys, Duke Reid, until we decided fi check Coxsone when all those people like the Wailers, most of them was leaving,' says Earl Morgan. 'We go there one Sunday, and Ken Boothe and BiBi Seaton take audition of "A Change Is Going To Come", "Fattie Fattie" and "Nobody Knows". "Nobody Knows" and "A Change Is Going To Come", people like it in the dancehall, but the big break come when they release "Fattie Fattie". From [when] they release, everybody need it. They ban it on the radio, but it was a number one seller.'

'Fattie Fattie' was built on a tremulous bass line from Wallin Cameron of the Soul Vendors house band; a sparse guitar riff from Hux Brown, who had been playing at Studio One for several years, accentuated the incorrigible rhythm. The continued popularity of 'Fattie Fattie' sparked several instrumental recuts, as would many other Heptones' Studio One creations. The first, Jackie Mittoo's 'Ram Jam', was almost as popular as the original. 'It's "Fattie Fattie" rhythm that really start Jackie Mittoo as a solo artist,' says Earl Morgan, who names Mittoo as the key figure at Studio One. 'When you'r e there in Trench Town and you hear all these artists over the radiofusion, like Bob Andy, the Wailers, Toots and the Maytals, then you'r e at the studio and you see them in person, it was wild. But the icon of all of the musicians who ever go through Coxsone for me is Jackie Mittoo, because he sing, him play organ, him do everything.'

**Lead Heptone Leroy Sibbles [David Katz]**

The Heptones ultimately recorded what can be seen as the most influential hits in rock steady, because the rhythms behind their voices would be returned to time and time again. Songs like 'Love Won't Come Easy', 'Heptones Gonna Fight' and the life-affirming 'Party Time' have become part of the canon of Jamaican pop - surrogate folk songs perpetually recycled over generations. Though Sibbles says 'Party Time' was inspired by 'some song that I heard the Wailers do', songs like 'Heptones Gonna Fight' and 'Equal Rights' came from observing the injustices suffered by black people in America. 'I was always involved in the black movement and in black history on a whole, so I was reading a lot of magazines about the way Blacks were being treated down South. I even tore out pictures from articles and had them in my little room, of black people being tarred and feathered and hung on trees. That's where the lyrics "Don't hang him on a tree, every man have an equal right to live and be free, no matter what colour, class or race he may be" came from: I was bearing my little bit of pain and anger from those things.'

This shift in subject matter was one of the many changes that came to the fore of Jamaican music once rock steady began to wane. The reggae style that followed it may have begun as another sound to fit a dance pattern, but conscious and politically motivated lyrics would increasingly become part of reggae's focus. As with the shift from ska to rock steady, the most immediate differences involved a particular instrumentation and melodic arrangement, with the bass retaining its crucial role.

[Feel the Rhythm:  
Ribald Early Reggae](Davi_solidfou_9781596918269_epub_part6.html#d41151091)

_Ska music, that's where we start. We feel the energy and we start to ska, then we feel the energy change and we start to rock and steady, then the energy change again... we change and say that we want reggae._

Lee Perry

_Reggae music was taken from Poco music and calypso music. Poco was the African man's religion – we never know the European way of life. Their music was these carnival type of thing, and we bring the two in one to establish ourselves with the rest of the world._

Yabby You

AS WITH THE emergence of ska and rock steady, the precise birth of reggae is greatly contested. While some name Larry Marshall and Alvin Leslie's Studio One single 'Nanny Goat' as the first example of the new genre, others say it was the slow groove _of_ the Beltones' 'No More Heartaches', produced by former insurance salesman Harry Johnson. On 'Nanny Goat', Boris Gardiner's tight bass patterns and added rest stops simply made the strolling of rock steady seem passe; also moving the rhythm forward was a choppy organ break and intricate percussive cymbal work. Though somewhat slower and more in tune with traditional rock steady choral and horn arrangements, 'No More Heartaches' had a noticeably pronounced organ rhythm that would come to dominate the reggae form.

Many observers feel that reggae did not arrive properly until the end _of_ 1968, when a handful _of_ smaller producers truly brought the new sound forward. Though 'Nanny Goat' may have been the earliest song to show that rock steady was on the wane, it was the efforts of the upcoming 'ghetto promoters' that brought in the reggae sound with full force. Among the most notable contributors on the production side were Lee 'Scratch' Perry, Clancy Eccles, Bunny Lee and Linford Anderson. Together with Joe Gibbs, Derrick Harriott and a handful of others breaking into the business, like Alvin 'GG' Ranglin and Winston 'Niney' Holness, these close associates formed a series _of_ shifting allegiances and rivalries, in the process steering the music in a new direction. At Studio One, further melodic and technical developments also affected the shape of the new music.

Like its predecessors ska and rock steady, the reggae style had a dance that came with it. The most famous celebration of this dance in song came on the Maytals' 'Do The Reggay', which is often cited as the first to name the genre. 'I'm the inventor for the word reggae,' Toots insists. 'I'm the one who say our music called reggae.' According to Bunny Lee, Clancy Eccles, Niney and others, the name itself derives from 'streggae', a derogatory term connoting a woman of low morals, just as 'rock and roll' is said to have derived from black American slang for the sexual act. 'There's a lot of things me do inna this business,' Lee emphasizes. 'All reggae, our name that again. It was streggae, and the radio station wouldn't play streggae, so we change it to reggae.' The first tune to use the name reggae, according to Bunny, was one recorded by his brother, Don Tony Lee. 'Don used to work at WIRL records and he did radio business. Him and [announcer] Jeff Barnes grow up together. Him do the first reggae song, "Come Do The Reggae Now".'

Regardless of who was the first to name the new style, the faster, dance-oriented sound was often built around a rhythmic, two-chord organ shuffle that almost seemed to echo the word 'reggae' in sound. 'The reggae thing that time have some mad shuffle,' says Bunny Lee. 'The reggae is the organ, so when man talk 'bout reggae, they don't even know how it come in.'

The man known as 'Striker' because so many of his records hit is relaxing at his suburban home in Patrick City. Our first interview was delayed for several hours while he and singer Max Romeo went to fetch Striker's false teeth, which had apparently been left somewhere. He then spent some time repairing one of the many trucks in his yard, while his young children watched a frighteningly violent kung-fu movie. Stretching his rotund bulk over an easy chair, the man born Edward Lee has a bottle of Red Stripe beer clenched in each fist as he recounts how he got into the record business in the early 1960s. 'I was born in Kingston in 1941 – it's Greenwich Town now, but it was Greenwich Farm then. My father was a shoemaker and my mother was an ordinary housewife. Nine children follow me, but only six of us survive. After I leave school, I used to do electrical work, then I went into the parts department at United Motors, then I leave and go to Kingston Industrial Garage. From there, I been in the music business. I used to go round with Derrick Morgan, Max Romeo, Laurel Aitken, Jackie Edwards, Owen Gray and Slim Smith.'

Bunny Lee gained an early reputation as an able dancer of the Mashed Potato. He built up strong contacts in the industry and was known to insist with some force that certain music was regularly played. 'I used to go round Duke Reid a lot, and sometimes up by Coxsone,' he continues. 'Used to plug records for them and Leslie Kong on _Teenage Dance Party_ at the radio station. Sometimes Prince Buster and myself used to be very close too. Then when Roy Shirley come around, Roy Shirley bring Joe Gibbs to me.'

Lee was instrumental in ensuring the success of 'Hold Them', but spent so much time promoting records that he was fired from his garage job in 1967. Given free studio time by Duke Reid, Lee cut his first session with Lynn Taitt and the Jets, hitting with Roy Shirley's surreal 'Music Field' and Lloyd and the Groovers' 'Do It To Me Baby'. He then went to work for WIRL records, replacing Lee 'Scratch' Perry as in-house producer. 'Them fire Scratch because Scratch never make no hit,' Bunny Lee explains. 'It's Scratch cause himself to fire. I doing a session with Slim Smith and Scratch was the producer for WIRL at the time, but he didn't know Mr Rae did give me permission to run the session, and Scratch go and tell the musicians the session shouldn't go on. When them stop, I carry them up from the office and Mr Rae pay them, and so Scratch lose him work. The tune come out and was a big hit – "Let Me Go Girl" with Slim Smith and the Uniques.'

**Ghetto promoter extraordinaire: Bunny Lee [center]with fellow producer Prince Jammy** **[right] and friend**

Scratch then went to work for Joe Gibbs, just as Errol Dunkley was cutting his second big hit, 'Please Stop Your Lying'. He remained with Gibbs for several months, cutting his own witty vocal sides, often with startling sound effects, and arranging hits by groups like the Versatiles, the Overtakers and the Pioneers. He also arranged for Gibbs to handle Stranger Cole and Gladdy Anderson's self-produced 'Just Like A River', which turned out to be a sizeable post-rock steady hit, but eventually he left the partnership after disputes over pay, and his shoes were temporarily filled by Niney. Scratch then went back to WIRL and forged an alliance with engineer Linford Anderson – aka Andy Capp – who was then just entering the production field himself.

Anderson now lives in New York, where he is a sound engineer for the United Nations. When asked how he came to be involved in music production, he responds, 'That's something I can't figure out myself. All I know is we used to have a record player and a little radio attached to it, so I used to imitate things I hear on the radio, play parties with one turntable. From there I was an accountant, and I went to RJR as a log keeper in 1959. They took me back later as a trainee engineer. I worked there for a couple of years, and then Mr Nasrallah asked me if I wanted a job at West Indies Records – Nasrallah took it over and built a new studio.' He learned his mixing craft from WIRL's resident engineer. 'Graeme Goodall was the engineer when they opened, he's the one that taught me most of what I know. It was only a little console they had then, a little portable Ampex two-track.'

Anderson says he founded the Upset label in conjunction with Lee Perry and Barrington Lambert, WIRL's trainee engineer, in 1967, working at first with a female harmony trio called the Gaylets; the group featured a young Judy Mowatt, later one of Bob Marley's backing vocalists. Though such early material failed to gain favour, some of the later Upset creations would truly upset the predominant beat.

Around the same time, Lee Perry was also collaborating with Clancy Eccles, who had recently returned to recording after concentrating on concert promotion following his departure from Studio One. When Eccles moved into record production he retained Lee Perry in an A&R capacity, and converted part of his tailoring premises at 121a Orange Street to handle record sales. Eccles cut the rock steady love song 'What Will Your Mama Say' in conjunction with Perry, using Lynn Taitt's band at WIRL, followed by 'Darling Don't Do That'. The songs from their partnership that made the most impact were Monty Morris' 'Say What You'r e Saying' and Clancy's 'Feel The Rhythm'. Ernest Ranglin, who played guitar and provided arrangements on the session at Treasure Isle that produced both tunes, names these as the first reggae records; both have a bouncing pace and altered instrumentation, with 'Feel The Rhythm' in particular pointing to the style that would soon storm in.

Another monumental record from the same period was Lee Perry's 'People Funny Boy', recorded at WIRL with Eccles' assistance and released on the Upset label. 'I helped Scratch with one by the name of "People Funny Boy",' Eccles explains. 'I was the man who set the music, and I do the ghost vocal in the studio while Scratch was the man on the mixing desk. I set the rhythm for it at West Indies, late '68.' The highly charged intensity of 'People Funny Boy' was Perry's attempt to capture the rhythm of a Pukumina church service that he and Linford Anderson had stumbled upon the night before. With vocals that lashed out against his former employer, Joe Gibbs, and a melody line that parodied the Pioneers' 'Longshot', one of Gibbs' biggest production successes, Scratch recorded the cries of his infant son to drive home the song's message of the frustrations of an underpaid man. 'When Scratch's little boy was a baby, he took him in the studio and give him two spank on his bottom,' remembers singer Watty Burnett, who was in the studio when the song was recorded. 'That was the first sampling.' The song's popularity launched Perry as an independent producer, enabling him to form the Upsetter label and take over Prince Buster's former record shop at 36 Charles Street. It also sparked replies from the Pioneers and Joe Gibbs, including 'People Grudgeful' and 'Pan Yu Machete'.

The Pioneers, then the duo of Sidney 'Luddy' Crooks and Jackie Robinson, gave Gibbs some of his biggest hits in the days when reggae was first becoming established. They would subsequently score even bigger hits for Leslie Kong and then emigrate, but after nearly thirty years in Britain Crooks returned to Kingston in 1996 to become in-house arranger and engineer at Joe Gibbs' studio. Behind the mixing desk Luddy looks relaxed and comfortable, with a neat cornrow hairstyle and shockingly long fingernails. He came to Trench Town from the countryside at the age of seventeen, met (future session player) Earl 'Bagga' Walker and started singing at a neighbourhood roundabout. At Crooks Street in Jones Town, Luddy's group gradually took shape; various members passed through what was initially called the Spectaculars and later the Counts. The first version of the Pioneers to enter a recording studio consisted of Luddy, his brother Derrick (aka Joe) and Winston Hewitt; though self-produced, the material was issued on Ken Lack's Caltone label.

**The Pioneers [Courtesy of Jamphoto]**

'I get a little money from my mom,' Luddy explains, 'so we rented Duke Reid's studio with a band called Al and the Vibrators and made a song called "Good Nanny". We funded it ourselves 'cause we couldn't get recorded. We go to Duke Reid, we go to Coxsone, they push their head out and say, "Boy, time finish, you have to come back again and you have to practise hard." The song started to get one and two little plays on the radio, but it's nothing to speak about. We did "Running Back To You", an American song done over, and that one started showing a little bit better. After that, I started keeping stage shows around the country.

Luddy says that things began to fall into place for the Pioneers after he linked up with Joe Gibbs and re-formed the group with Jackie Robinson, a stranger in the right place at the right time. 'Winston Hewitt went to Canada and my brother went to work with the Alcoa bauxite company, so I was left alone. I met Joe Gibbs, bumped into him on Beeston Street where he have a shop, and I started working for him, carrying out records. I tell him that I want to make a record, so we went to WIRL studio one night with Hux Brown, Jackie Jackson, Gladstone Anderson, Winston Wright – the top of the line – and we made a song called "Give Me Little Loving". Outside the studio I saw a boy, so I said, "Me want you to sing a harmony." Jackie Robinson then became the lead singer of the Pioneers, and me and him started singing for Joe Gibbs: "Longshot", "Jackpot", "Catch The Beat".'

On some of these songs the group's humour really shines. The previously mentioned 'Pan Yu Machete', one of the retaliatory swipes at Lee Perry, called the upstart producer a 'two-edged sword,' with further insults coming in the sounds of a yapping puppy atop a slurring violin. 'Longshot', perhaps their biggest hit for Gibbs, was about a losing racehorse that 'busted' a bet, leaving the punter broke when it failed to break the tape at the finishing post. These and the celebratory 'Catch The Beat' all helped to move Jamaican music into the reggae dimension.

A number of important songs that helped to consolidate the reggae beat in late 1968 were produced by Bunny Lee, who says it was partly his link with the British Pama label that indirectly led to the emergence of the new sound. The Palmer brothers, three Jamaican immigrants who controlled valuable property interests in Northwest London, established Pama in 1967. It was set up as competition to Island's group of labels, the main issuer of Jamaican product in the UK since Chris Blackwell moved the company to London in 1962. Other concerns such as Sonny Roberts' Planetone, Emil Shalit's Melodise and Rita Issels and Benny King's R&B/ Ska Beat were also issuing quantities of Jamaican music. One of Island's subsidiary labels, Trojan, was established in 1967 to handle Duke Reid's product; the following year, it was relaunched to handle reggae from any producer by Lee Gopthal, a Jamaican of Indian descent who was originally the landlord of Island's office space. Gopthal was also the man behind the Muzik City chain of London record shops, and had founded the B&C distribution company. Though Pama initially beat Island in terms of reggae popularity in Britain, Trojan would shortly emerge as the most prominent reggae label in the country.

**Harry Palmer [David Katz]**

In the Pama camp, Harry Palmer was originally the brother most involved in record production. At his real estate office in Mandeville I note a close resemblance to his younger brother Carlisle, present head of the massive Jet Star record label and distribution company in London; both have a hook nose and Semitic features derived from their Jewish grandmother. Harry says that the family lived in Thompson Town, Clarendon, where his father was a Baptist church deacon and Justice _of_ the Peace with links to PNP founder Nonnan Manley. Harry's older brother Geoffrey left Jamaica for London in the mid-1950s, and Harry and Carlisle followed a few years later. 'Young people always looking for adventure,' he explains, 'and underdeveloped Jamaica didn't offer a lot of adventure. Geoffrey went in '55 to Willesden Polytechnic, he did engineering.' When Harry arrived in Willesden, he got a menial job 'in a factory, parcel packing', and eventually received a qualification in business administration. Carlisle came in the early 1960s and studied engineering.

Though Harry's chief line of work was in the insurance field, and though Carlisle would later be engaged in property, the Palmer brothers were involved in the music business as early as 1962. 'After studying I went into insurance, and from insurance we opened our first record shop, called Happy Sounds, at 827 Harrow Road near Scrubs Lane. That record shop was with a partner from the insurance business, but he was an electrician originally, so we stocked electrical fittings as well as records. By then Geoff had opened Club 31, at 31 Harrow Road in Stonebridge Park; it was a basement club, but it was very popular. All the great Tamla-Motown artists used to appear there: Stevie Wonder, the Jackson Five, Diana Ross, Martha and the Vandellas.' In 1968 Geoff opened a larger venue that he still controls today: the London Apollo Club on Willesden High Road.

Harry says that Happy Sounds began stocking rock and pop hits, but later carried Jamaican music, selling a phenomenal quantity of 'My Boy Lollipop' by Millie Small. 'We sold some four thousand copies of "My Boy Lollipop" in that little shop. We put a speaker outside, and it was [on] a bus route, and people would come from all over.'

Around 1966, a fire destroyed Happy Sounds. Geoff continued running his night club, while Harry and Carl set up an estate agency across the road from their former record shop. The brothers also began managing local bands, which led to a few tentative record productions issued by Island in 1967; Harry says the first was 'Do The Teasy' by Joyce Bond, backed by a band of young Jamaicans based in Kensal Rise called the Shadrocks, featuring singer Tim Chandell.

Though the Palmers thought Joyce Bond had commercial potential, they found the major labels had no interest in her style. 'We used to go to Phillips and Pye simply because Chris Blackwell went to them. They did Steve Winwood and the Spencer Davis Group, so we thought we could get in. We started thinking about putting it out ourselves, but then Island agreed to put it out.' As a follow-up to 'Do The Teasy' Island issued 'Tell Me What It's All About', written by Jackie Edwards, and some Shadrocks material such as 'Go Go Special', but then Harry Palmer travelled to Jamaica in search of undiscovered talent and resultant licensing deals saw the foundation of Pama records.

'By this time we had fallen out with Joyce Bond, and I had come down to find a replacement female singer. I stayed for maybe two weeks in Kingston, put an ad in the paper for female singers, and I went back to London with three mailbags full of applications.' He also attracted the attention of Jamaica's leading record producers: 'Coxsone Dodd, Bunny Lee, Scratch, everybody. We got this record by Clancy Eccles, "What Will Your Mama Say", went back with it and nobody wanted to put it out, so we formed Pama records and that was our first tune. We had to pay him a decent advance, maybe a couple of thousand pounds, which was a lot of money then. And we were new into the business, so he got a large percentage - larger than what we learned to pay later on.' Palmer also licensed material from Alton Ellis and brought an unknown singer called Beverley Simmonds to London to record. 'When we took her back to London, Otis Redding died, so we decided to make a tribute album. Same recording session we made an instrumental called "The Champ", based on a US soul thing. Although we put out the album called _Tribute To Otis Redding,_ the instrumental just took off. Atlantic licensed it and it was a hit in America – that was the first release on Cotillion.' Harry reveals that 'Champ', credited to the Mohawks on release in 1968, was played by 'all white guys, session people', with Alan Hawkshaw on organ.

Pama records was formed in a branch of their estate agency in Peterborough Road, Harrow, but moved shortly afterwards to a permanent base at 17 Craven Park Road, Harlesden – a larger building with room for proper offices and space to hold stock for distribution. Harry says the Bunny Lee link forged in the summer of 1968 placed Pama above the competition. 'Christmas '68 was really when it started to happen. Both Island and Trojan conceded that we had the Christmas – we had all the big things through Bunny Lee. In Harrow I had a phone call from Bunny Lee, but he was dealing with Island; he thought he wasn't getting such a good deal, so he wanted a little switch. He had tapes of his own, but we didn't want those, because they were already offered to Island. He asked us to come and see him and played us a tape called "Hold You Jack" by Derrick Morgan, but we knew [Island A&R man David] Betteridge and Blackwell and everybody, so we weren't about to take what they had. We gave him £2400 to come down and make records, and he did extremely well, but Bunny also wanted to outdo Clancy, because he realized that Clancy had a good deal, so he wanted to be in on it as well. Matter of fact, when he went back down to Jamaica I think there was some scuffling between them.'

Lee himself has a different recollection of his meeting with the Palmer brothers in 1968, claiming that his link with the company was forged after a dispute arose involving control of an album by London-based singer Dandy Livingston, who was then enjoying a big hit with an anti-rude boy song featuring Rico, 'A Message To You Rudie'. 'I go England the first time in February 1968, and I used to deal with Island. Dandy Livingston used to work for Rita Issels in Stamford Hill [North London], she used to pay him twenty pound a week as a producer. Me and Dandy meet and we turn good friends. I take Dandy round a Jackie Edwards' house and them start to be good brethren. Pama give Dandy some money to make an LP, but Dandy and me go to Island and me introduce him to Dave Betteridge. Dandy say him have an LP coming named _Dandy Returns,_ so Dave Betteridge then stay 'pon the phone and sell about twenty-five thousand right there and then, 'cause Dandy said him would give it to them. When the three Pama brothers find me over my yard in the East End, they start to talk about the Dandy thing. Them say they don't really want to lock up Dandy for we all are black men... them say Harry Palmer did come to Jamaica and give Clancy and Alton money and it didn't work out neither. Beverley Simmonds was at the Sheraton and him carry her up and do a whole LP with some Otis Redding tunes, but nothing didn't come of it. Them say them down 'pon them face and them no have no money, but he would give me three hundred pounds cash, that's all them can afford. I say, "I will give you some tune, we can work together." I say we have to make a label with a black hand and a white hand shake 'cross a mountain named Unity. I go back to Jamaica and Pama and Bunny Lee now amalgamated.' Unity was the first of several subsidiary labels controlled by Pama, most of which were created specifically to showcase the efforts of one producer.

With the money Lee received from Pama in London he ran a session in October 1968 that resulted in several early reggae hits, the most noteworthy of which were 'Bangarang' by Stranger Cole and Lester Sterling and 'Everybody Needs Love' by Slim Smith. ' "Bangarang" is the first reggae record make in Jamaica,' insists Stranger Cole. 'I was passing by Treasure Isle one day and I was told that Bunny Lee is making records, so I went up to see him because he's a good friend of mine, we go to Denham Town School together. He said, "I have a song here called 'Bongo Chant' [originally by Kenny Graham's Afro Cubist Group]. I would love to put some words to it, could you come up with some words?". I think for five minutes and come up with "Muma no want bangarang", and we went in the studio and it was a hit instantly. The melody came from some American song and I put new words to it. You could say that the melody belongs to somebody else, and the words belong to me.'

Striker Lee agrees that this was the first reggae song, naming the shuffling organ as its defining element. Slim Smith's 'Everybody Needs Love', an adaptation of a Motown soul hit, was also marked by a livid organ shuffle, played on both tunes by Glen Adams, then chiefly known as an auditions assistant and arranger at Treasure Isle.

**Glen Adams [David Katz]**

Adams started out as a singer and came to play organ on the session almost by accident. 'It all started from my mother,' Adams says. 'My mother was a dancer and a singer. She put on a show around 1957 – it was the Jiving Juniors with Derrick Harriott, so I saw them young men singing and it motivate me. I form a group when I was around twelve with some friends and I went to Palace Theatre where I auditioned for _Vere Johns' Opportunity Hour._ They didn't pick our song that time, so I went back by myself and I got selected.' Adams is reminiscing in his unofficial office: the local Dun-kin' Donuts in his corner of New York's Flatbush. Despite a pale and evidently mentally disturbed woman yelling at the top of her lungs about God's punishments from the table behind, he readily digs deep into memories of his early days in music. 'I usually do cabaret, places like Club Havana, Bungalow, Penguin Club. I used to do the show circuit alongside the Blues Busters and the Indian Rubber Boy. Mr Dodd had a talent show and during the rehearsal he heard this original song, "Wonder Thirst", and wanted to record it – it's a love lyric, written by my sister. I did that song for Mr Dodd. It never released, but I was popularly known for that song, because I got the dub and I gave it to a popular sound system [selector], Lord Comic. I just do one song for Studio One, but I was always a fan of Mr Dodd, and I have maximum respect for him for giving me the opportunity. Even until this day, Mr Dodd will remain my best friend.'

As a friend of Ken Boothe's , Adams was present at the recording of Stranger Cole's "Uno Dos Tres", sowing the seeds of a long association with Duke Reid. 'Me and Ken Boothe started practising and we did a couple of songs with Stranger Cole – some harmonies on 'Uno Dos Tres'. Me and Ken used to sing as Ken and Glen. We came second in the first Festival Song Competition in Ward Theatre with "I Remember" [in 1966].' Glen then went to work in tailoring; in his musical life, he passed through the Heptones and joined the Pioneers in time for some of their earliest recordings. 'Heptones was myself, Joseph Forrester, Jackson Jones, Earl Morgan and Barry Llewelyn; Jackson was the guitarist. Then we split up the group, and I go with the Pioneers – that time Winston Hewitt went to Canada, and I fill in for him about a year or so. I did "Shake It Up", "Good Nanny", and a couple more for Joe Gibbs and Ken Lack. Anywhere we travel, the Heptones would travel too. After Pioneers, I took Heptones to Studio One. Ken Boothe was there – he had "The Train Is Coming". And Jackie Mittoo was there, who I knew – I knew most of the guys because my sister Yvonne was a popular singer. I have a nice sister, so naturally the guys want to be my friend!'

Glen says he began playing piano on rehearsals for Duke Reid in the late ska era, and that Reid indirectly instigated his organ playing on 'Bangarang' for Bunny Lee. 'I usually practise down by Duke Reid – I actually rehearse and shape the song "Woman A Come" with Marguerita [Mahfood]. I selected artists for Mr Reid like Joe White, and [Reid] is the one who gave me the incentive to play. After the Pioneers, I was doing a lot of stuff for Bunny Lee, singing "Silent Lover", a song named "She" [aka 'She's Leaving' by Alva Lewis, recorded at Bunny Lee's inaugural session], "Taking Over Orange Street", "Hold Down Miss Winey". I sang harmony with the Uniques with Slim Smith on "Hooray" and "Give Me A Love".' Duke sent him to play piano on Bunny Lee's session, as Gladdy's band refused to play because they were still owed money from a previous session. 'Bunny Lee didn't know I play. I tried to play the piano on "Bangarang" but it didn't work out, so Lester Sterling asked us to switch, make Lester Sterling play the piano and let me play the organ. I'd never played the organ before.' On the same session, Lloyd Charmers gave Glen some pointers for the organ chops he supplied on 'Everybody Needs Love', with Charmers himself providing the exciting lead lines. After the immediate and far-reaching success of 'Bangarang' and 'Everybody Needs Love', Glen Adams has stuck to the organ ever since.

Just as Glen made his organ debut on this session, his singing partner Alva Lewis made his recording debut as a guitarist. Known as Reggie Carter, due to a resemblance to a local comedian of that name, Lewis was born in Manchester in 1949. Sitting in the waiting room at Tuff Gong studio, Lewis nowadays looks decidedly worse for wear. He had a long period of alcohol dependency, and walks with a limp; though still occasionally used on recording sessions, he is often out of work. Like many of his peers, Lewis came into music in the Greenwich Farm community. 'When I was sixteen I left Manchester, come to Kingston and stayed with my brother in West Avenue, Greenwich Farm. They wanted me to get educated, send me to college, but something is inside of me: me want to play music. My bigger brother was in America and he send a semi-acoustic Gibson, an electric Fender guitar and a small amplifier. You have a bar downstairs, but through I no hear the guitar them so much, [my] guitar never properly tuned. Derrick Morgan was living over [by] Bunny Lee, and the Melodians, they come one Sunday and Derrick asked one of the Melodians to tune my guitar. Them play the guitar and me observe them. Bunny Lee and Slim Smith carry me down to Duke Reid's studio one day and the first tunes me lick, "Everybody Needs Love" and "Bangarang", the songs was two number one. The backing band was Reggie, Family Man, Carly, Glen Adams and Lloyd Charmers play the solo with the organ.'

It was this backing band – usually without Lloyd Charmers, and often with lead guitarist Ronny Bop – that became one of the crucial studio combos that developed the reggae sound, first as the Bunny Lee All Stars, later as the Upsetters, and ultimately as backing to the Wailers. An earlier version of the group had been established on the live scene as the Hippy Boys, which Family Man and Carly joined before this pivotal session for Bunny Lee.

Aston 'Family Man' Barrett previously made an impact on record with his solid bass backing of the Uniques. His debut came on a single that adapted two American hits, Buffalo Springfield's 'For What It's Worth' (as 'Watch This Sound') and the Manhattans' 'I'm The One That Love Forgot' (as 'Out Of Love'). The session was arranged by Lloyd Charmers for Winston Lowe, a smaller producer of Chinese descent whose Tramp label was based in Greenwich Farm. Jimmy Riley explains that the refrain 'What's that sound?' from the anti-Vietnam War 'For What It's Worth' was transformed into 'Watch This Sound' because he misunderstood the lyrics when he first heard the song on the radio. 'I was sleeping one night and I heard the phrase "watch this sound". I couldn't make out all the words they was saying, so I just make "watch this sound" as the chorus. That was the first song Family Man played bass on. He was playing with a little band, and then we decided we were going to use him on the session. The drummer was Winston Grennan, Bobby Aitken on guitar, Ansel Collins on piano. We did "Watch This Sound" and "Out Of Love". Both sides hit, but "Watch This Sound" hit first.'

**Aston 'Family Man' Barrett [David Katz]**

Aston Barrett and his younger brother Carlton grew up at 26 Beeston Street, sharing a downtown Kingston yard with saxophonist Val Bennett. Nicknamed 'Family Man' (Fams for short) because of the children he fathered with different partners at an early age, Aston was an unruly teenager, sent to the Jamaica Youth Corps' Cobbla Camp for discipline. There he led a harmony quintet, the Jiving Crackerballs, which influenced his approach to bass. 'I love singing,' he declares in a deep, slow drawl, 'so when I'm playing bass, I always imagine that I am singing. I try to play a kind of melodic bass.' Barrett names Lloyd Brevett, Lloyd Spence and Jackie Jackson as his most immediate influences, stressing that 'one good artist always inspire from another'. The greater prominence _of_ Family Man's beefy bass parts, which often emphasized offbeat cadences through audible rest stops, would greatly elevate the emerging reggae sound. By the time of Family Man's debut session he and Carly were playing in the Hippy Boys, a live band that evolved after the demise of the Gaylads. Web Stewart was the group's lead guitarist when Fams and Carly were drafted in for a regular engagement at the Baby Grand. Their lead vocalist was then Maxwell Livingston Smith, former leader of the Emotions trio and better known to the world as Max Romeo.

In the late 1980s, Romeo was a short-haired Buddhist living with a white woman in New York. Having gone through many serious life changes, he would go through several more after returning to Jamaica and allowing his dreadlocks to grow back. He spent most of the 1990s living on West Avenue in Greenwich Farm, back on the same block where Bunny Lee was based when the new sound was coming together in 1968.

Romeo smiles as he recounts his early days. 'I was born in the parish of Saint Anne in Alexandria, an area about four miles out of Browns Town. My mother had to migrate to England in 1954. I was ten years old then, so I was taken to Kingston to live with my father. Me and my father's wife couldn't get along, so I had to run away from home. After drifting around for years, trying to find myself, when I was about seventeen I followed a friend to a place and saw this man looking at me. He called me over and said, "A brown man like you, brown complexion... ." Those days in Jamaica, high-complexion people were looked upon to live a certain standard, and I was suffering then, one pants all torn, shirt without sleeves, shoes with hole in the sole and the heel leaning. He gave me a piece of paper and a pencil and said, "I want you to write twenty things in life you think you would want to be." I wrote from mechanic, electrician, painter, carpenter, pastor, singer. I gave him the paper and he said, "I want you to narrow it down to two." I was trying to find the easiest of them, so it came down to preacher and singer. He said, "Now I want you to choose one of the two," so I choose singer. He said, "From now on, you'r e a singer. Don't let nobody call you anything other than a singer."

'I left with that in my mind and then I started working with Ken Lack, taking records to the record shop. He heard me singing one day and said, "Hey, give it a try." The first song I did was "A Rainbow", and it went to number two on the charts. I started with two other guys singing harmony – Lloyd Shakespeare, the brother of [bassist] Robbie Shakespeare, and Kenneth Knight – and we called the group Emotions. After a little while, there was disagreements in the group. I decided to work on my own, and I met Bunny Lee then. At that time, he was working as a desk clerk at Kingston Industrial Garage. He wasn't yet really in the [music] business, [but] he used to be around Duke Reid, take the records to the radio station, see to it that they play it by any means necessary. Duke Reid gave him some studio time, and Ken Lack and myself put together some money to buy the tapes. Tommy McCook and the Supersonics played for him and he came up with a hit: Roy Shirley, ' "Music Field". That was the starting point for Bunny Lee, "Striker". He did "Get On The Ball" with Roy Shirley. A set of songs was recorded then, and that launched the whole Bunny Lee era. I was around then, but I wasn't actually singing because I had to find a name.'

**Max Romeo [Adrian Thomas]**

His debut hit as a solo singer, once his determined courtship of a local girl earned him the name Max Romeo, came after Bunny Lee asked him to write a rude song to be sung over the rhythm of Derrick Morgan's 'Hold You Jack', a number already laden with minor innuendo.

'I started moving with Striker,' Max continues. 'That's how "Wet Dream" come into play, the first song with Bunny Lee. He came with this idea about doing this dirty song.' When Romeo had written something suitably suggestive, he found that Slim Smith, Roy Shirley, John Holt and Derrick Morgan all refused to sing it, forcing Romeo to do the honours on a session at Studio One. The resultant song, issued on Unity, stayed in the UK charts a full six months despite a radio ban, and brought Romeo to Britain for live performances. It also led the Palmer brothers to open a record shop in Kingston, above music producer and goods trader H. Robinson's Caribbean Disc company.

'Bunny Lee said we should open a branch of Pama Records in Jamaica, which we did, at 118 Orange Street,' notes Harry Palmer. 'It lasted for a couple of years, then Bunny Lee took it over as Bunny Lee records, because we can't manage Bunny for too long.'

Max Romeo's UK performances were preceded by the Ethiopians, who were brought to Britain in 1968 by a booking agency called Commercial Entertainment, run by former rock musicians Bruce White and Tony Cousins (aka Anthony Bautista). It was the first of many tours for Jamaican artists arranged by the company, and the pair would subsequently be involved in record production and artist management. ' "Train To Skaville" went off in England, was on the chart, and Bruce White and Tony Cousins, who later becomes Rhino Records, they request me up there,' Leonard Dillon recalls. 'We play all over England, three months this year and two months the other year. The audiences were mixed. I worked some places in Kent and in the audience is one black I see.'

Other popular Ethiopians' songs surfaced in this time on Doctor Bird, the label established by Graeme Goodall when he emigrated to Britain. 'Graeme Goodall engineered "The Whip", "Stay Loose Mama" and "Cool It Amigo" at West Indies with Linford Anderson. At that time, Lynn Taitt and the Jets was the star band at the studio, and I always hire the hornsman, like Trommy [Vin Gordon]. Doctor Bird records was the sole distributor [in the UK].'

When the Ethiopians returned from their first UK tour they began recording with 'Sir JJ' Johnson, the producer who drew the best of their abilities in the early reggae style. 'When I got back from the first tour, I met JJ at his record shop at 136 Orange Street. As a artist, you walk through these places, because them time some nice girl used to be in them places, and you have to go nice with them and buy them a lunch. When people come in to buy records, they'l l introduce people to your record, so you have to be around, niceing the people. I went up by JJ – he wasn't really in the business too tough, but he was a great man, my best producer. He just look upon me and say, "Write a song about everything crash." We went in WIRL studio and did it with Bobby Aitken's band, the Caribbeats. At that time, all essential services them in Jamaica was on strike – it's between them and them governmental system where pay is concerned. My politics is Africa, Rasta, and I don't go into them political business. I beat them every time musically, that's all I can do – when I see them doing a likkle thing, I write song at it.'

'Everything Crash' commented on the growing social unrest that reflected increasing dissatisfaction with the party in power. Jamaica had been independent for over five years, yet for the majority of its citizens, little had improved in real terms. The general strike was one of a series of widespread protests to grip the nation that year, and Dillon's song, despite his purported apolitical stance, captured the frustration and indignation with which the public experienced it.

Providing harmony on the song was Melvin Reid, who was featured on subsequent Ethiopians hits for JJ such as 'Hong Kong Flu' and 'Woman A Capture Man'. The former dealt with an outbreak of dengue fever in Jamaica, the latter with romantic situations, apparently written by a schoolgirl whom Dillon heard singing in a park. Both numbers, and further material such as 'Well Red', all feature upfront hand drumming, evidence of Dillon's longstanding awareness of his African origin and a coded signifier of his Rastafari faith.

'I always have drums in my thing,' he explains. 'I never leave the congo drum. I was taught about Africa by my grandmother and grandfather. They taught me the tribe that I'm from, Ashanti, and the name of my ancient African ancestor, the first man that reach to Jamaica: Quao.' He was drawn to the wisdom of Rastafari after attending services in the ghetto. 'It's a in-born thing, but there was a place in Waterhouse called the Ethiopian Reorganization Centre, [run by] two elder Rastas, Nasser King and Daddy King, and that's where we really spring from. We learned a lot from them where Ethiopia is concerned, and that's where we used to be, before I start sing as Ethiopians, but after the Jack Sparrow days.'

Enjoying a strong working relationship, the Ethiopians stayed with Sir JJ until he stopped making records in about 1971. 'He was very reluctant,' Dillon recalls. 'He's not a man who's really into a whole lot of competition and he could not take the fight. The radio station them never used to play the song and you have to let go a lot of money. Everything becomes corrupt after a while and he just ease up out of it and start meditating on his jukeboxes – he was a jukebox agent.'

Dillon notes the producer's wealthy origins, but has only praise for the man regarding his business practices and personality. 'His father is one of the biggest bus company magnates in Jamaica, and his brother had Johnson's drive-in restaurant and club up the top of Maxfield Avenue. He was a conscious black man, [with a] sensible manner, [an] irie man, cool. My best producer, and me wasn't on no contract. He say, "You no have to sign a contract, me live up to my word, you just have to live up to yours." That's what happened, so that's why I sticked with him so long – no producer had me that long.'

Roy Shirley, who recorded a few less successful tunes with the Uniques for JJ, is less flattering in his description of the producer. 'He was always a little guy in the production field. You couldn't put them man against Beverleys, Federal, Coxsone. JJ had a lot of money and his father had some bus company before that, but the guy look so simple – he always dress like them way-out cowboy and walk that way, but him was a money guy, so he could pay his way to promote his tune on the radio.'

**Rupie Edwards [Courtesy of Top Beat]**

The sad postscript to Sir JJ's career is that he was robbed and murdered in his Kingston home in 1973. 'It's just something intending,' Leonard Dillon states gravely, 'because it's three times them shot him, and he was living with shot in him. The fourth time they shot him, and then they cut him throat.'

Another producer based on Orange Street was Rupie Edwards, who opened his Success record shop just as the reggae beat was coming up in 1968. Edwards is a short, light-skinned man who likes to laugh. Early one cold Sunday morning, at the record shop in East London's Ridley Market that he has occupied since the mid-1970s, he and a young niece are gulping shots of vodka from polystyrene cups while gospel music blares at top volume. Rupie says he began his career as a singer and piano player. 'I used to sing in school, started beating drums and make a few little instruments out of bamboo and pumpkin vine, anything I can blow or beat and do a sound. I had a little band from them times. From there, I went on _Vere Johns' Opportunity Knocks._ After I left school at fifteen, I started training as a mechanic. I started recording in 1961 – that was for Hi-Lite, Little Wonder. "Guilty Convict" was the first record I did, and "Just Because" was the other side. I played piano in a night club during the same time: Kittymat, on Maxfield Avenue near Spanish Town Road.'

Edwards says the next recording he made was a sound system special for Count Bells, for which he was paid 'seven quid'. In the mid-sixties he formed a duo called the Ambassadors. 'Me and Junior Menz, who became the leader of the Techniques, we was singing together as the Ambassadors, we made "Amen" [an Impressions tune] and "Mother's Choice" for Harry J and got fifteen quid. Then I just started producing for myself, in 1966 at Coxsone, but I wasn't going to make a living from that. I recorded four songs on that first session, me and Junior as the same Ambassadors, live with the Virtues. Graeme Goodall was the engineer, along with Coxsone himself. I released the first on a little label I called Diamond. Then, by about '68, I toured Canada with the Virtues.'

Edwards says he first met Coxsone and other important music industry contacts while working in downtown Kingston garages. 'I was a motor mechanic and I used to work on his car and Duke's car; I started learning the trade at KIG [Kingston Industrial Garage], but I finished over United Motors – Bunny Lee was there.' While Edwards was working at Studio One, he recorded 'Let Me Love You' and 'If You Can't Beat Them, Join Them', material that Coxsone intended to release but which Rupie himself ended up handling. 'He wasn't releasing them quick enough for me, so he sold them back to me for twenty quid. He actually wanted an album out of me, but then I was also headed in his direction: to run my own company.' Hence the formation of the Success record shop and label, which took time to live up to its name despite a few early discs that made some local impact.

One of Edwards' notable acts was the Concords, a trio led on some numbers by Gregory Isaacs. 'Gregory came to me as lead singer with the Concords. The first song he did was "Don't Let Me Suffer". He was the lead singer in that, then the Concords went back and did "Buttoo" – or it could have been "Buttoo" first, I can't remember.' As Edwards could not recall the details, I went to the African Museum record shop to ask Isaacs himself.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s Gregory Isaacs was probably the best-known reggae singer after Bob Marley and Dennis Brown, but subsequent problems with substance abuse and unlicensed firearms have resulted in an uneven career marked by spells in jail. Gregory's best-known shop was downtown on Chancery Lane, a meeting point for musicians popularly known as the Idler's Rest; his current shop and Poor People's Recording Studio are located on one of the rougher patches of Red Hills Road, an area marred by recent gang violence linked to a turf war over control of the local drug trade. At the crumbling and nearly abandoned complex that houses African Museum a group of particularly intimidating young men are gathered on the staircase, scowling with an obvious contempt that is vaguely threatening. When a distinctly jumpy Isaacs eventually arrives he gives the impression of having a short attention span, but his recollections are fairly frank and highly informative.

'I was born 1950 in Western Kingston, grow in Denham Town,' he begins, 'grown by my mother. From early childhood, my friends used to tell me that I am good, like school concerts and those things. Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, those were my favourites.' His recording debut came in the late sixties. 'I started out single, with a song called "Another Heartache", produced by me and Winston Sinclair, a youth that I grow up with that like the music business too – he sing the next side, and we put it out on a blank. I did one song for Prince Buster, "Dancing Floor". He asked me to do it, because my friend was a close friend of his, Jim Brown.' Is he referring to the Jim Brown who was a political 'enforcer' and notorious gunman for the JLP? 'Yeah, same Jim Brown,' Isaacs replies in a matter-of-fact tone. 'We grew in the same Western Kingston. After "Dancing Floor", I start singing for Rupie Edwards – that's where the Concords come in. We did songs like "Don't Let Me Suffer" – quite a few.' Gregory names the other two members as 'a brethren called Bramwell and one named Pengro, they came from Western Kingston', adding that 'for Rupie Edwards, I did songs like "Each Day" and "Lonely Man".'

**Original rudeboy: Gregory Isaacs [David Katz]**

Though Rupie Edwards first travelled to England in 1969, licensing Concords' material to Trojan's Blue Cat subsidiary and establishing the Escort label with Pama, he did not have a substantial Jamaican hit until 1970, when Dobbie Dobson's sugary ballad 'That Wonderful Sound' reached the charts. Greater fame was achieved later in the decade.

Like Edwards' ironically named Success imprint, Alvin Ranglin's GG label took time to land a major hit. Ranglin's current base is near Kingston's Heroes' Circle, at the recording studio he bought from executive George Benson some years ago. The busy premises also house his pressing plant and offices, and, as Ranglin used to run a bakery from an adjacent building, the whole place smells of sour yeast and buttermilk. He is obviously an astute businessman, as he owns several choice pieces of property around the island and often cruises around town in a crisp utility vehicle, blasting gospel music on a high-powered stereo. He is a short, portly man with little hair left on his head, and he often breaks into a hoarse laugh as he speaks of growing up in the country. 'I was born in 1942 in a small district known as Eden – it's in the middle of Jamaica in Clarendon. In that area, most people does farming and cattle-rearing, and raising chicks has always been good for feeding people. Myself, I had to go and milk the cows in the morning. I leave from there to May Pen at age thirteen, because there was a better school in the higher part of the city.' It was as a teenager that Ranglin began performing, though his introduction to music came far earlier. 'In 1958 I started to sing on concerts, sometimes they throw up a penny for you, but from age three or four I was sent by my mother to a lady a few blocks from me that always play piano and organ for the church. I was brought up in the Adventist church, so from age four or five I sing in the choir.'

**Alvin 'GG' Ranglin [David Katz]**

When Ranglin came of age, he worked in a number of unsatisfying trades before venturing into music. 'I wanted to learn carpenter, then I started to get fed up, because the teaching from the elder gentleman was not up to date. Then I remove to mason, but I wanted to do something else again, because I believed I could do better. My mother put me into welding, and I get eye flash [an injury], and I decided again not to go back. Those times, people from here usually migrate to London. My mother said she's going to send me there, but I decided that I don't want to go. I decided that I would be an electrician, then I start learning at Yarmouth Estate in the South Coast of Clarendon, attend different schools and took course from National Technology, and I work as a radio and television technician. I used to build tube amplifiers, the KT88. Those used to get the music more to the people, so I always try to own a discotheque for myself, called GG. GG was a business name coming from family members, like Gloria and her sister, and another cousin "Girlfriend", so we just formulate it like that.'

Having a sound system meant it was an easy step to enter record production, especially as Ranglin was also involved in the jukebox industry. 'We start with the Maytones and we had Trevor Brown from Linstead. He used to sing some Christmas songs like "Every Day Is A Holiday". I usually sing with another gentleman, Emmanuel Flowers, as Flowers and Alvin: "Howdy & Tenky", it was a number one for many months. That was some part of the starting] point, but I went into so much business, because the jukebox business at that time was big, so that helped me to promote the songs them. Everybody didn't have a radio, only the middle class or the wealthy could buy that, but the poor persons could go and play with the shilling and ten cents into those jukebox, so I bought a few jukebox by the help of my mother. Then I was in the game machine business as well.' By this point Ranglin had already opened his first record store in May Pen, as well as a TV repair shop. His first Kingston store was at 45 Slipe Road, and he eventually opened shops in Half Way Tree and Old Harbour and abroad in Brooklyn and London.

GG produced the first recordings by the Maytones duo in late 1968 or early 1969; as both lead singer Vernon Buckley and his partner Gladstone Grant are natives of May Pen, their style is infused with provincial elements. 'I grow up with my grandmother, and I was compelled to go to a Seventh Day Adventist church every Saturday,' says Buckley at home in Montreal. 'I never really active in choir, but I used to do a lot of observation. A block down the road, there was a Church of God. Sundays, they would clap hands, so sometimes you get some good vibes. I used to do the bookwork for my dad – he was a government contractor. Gladstone Grant was driving a mini-bus. The town that I live in is May Pen, so we just give the group the name Mighty Maytones. Someone tell us about GG in our early days and we went down for [an] audition [at] his shop in May Pen. My first song never been released – we went into town, recording at Studio One, did "A Little Bit Of This" and "Land Of Music". A few months [later] we went to Dynamic, did "Loving Reggae" – wow, that was a hit. The next big hit was "Funny Man". We go in the studio more regular and songs keep coming, like "Bowee Wowee", "Serious Love".' The Maytones continued to supply Ranglin with hits until Buckley moved to Canada in 1980; he also assisted with the running of Ranglin's May Pen shop from 1971.

Another notable record label formed in 1968 was Techniques, set up by Winston Riley at his home on West Street as a vehicle for the Techniques group; he began licensing material to Pama in 1969. Riley's first hit production was 'Warrior' by Johnny Osbourne and the Sensations, a song decrying the nation's growing polarity. 'That was the early time when this Jamaican political uprising was in its baby stage, and the people just starting to have political warfare,' Osbourne says, relaxing at a Boston hotel the day after a well-attended performance. Unlike the clear tenor that graces most of his records, his speaking voice is a low, raspy growl. 'Guns wasn't so prevalent, but the people were taking sides politically, and then it becomes a two-sided thing.'

Osbourne says time spent at Alpha set him on a musical path. 'I were born in 1947, grew up all over Kingston, but in the latter years it was more Western Kingston. I went to Alpha boys' school in my teens. I even join the Alpha band, learning to play the trumpet four or five years. Alpha was always teaching you all kinds of things: we have school choir, church choir, and the music teacher, Mrs Hall, always motivated us. I get to understand music some more, and I was really interested in music from then.'

Osbourne subsequently began to record after mingling with local street-corner groups. 'There was a band called the Wildcats I used to sing with – Earl "Bagga" Walker used to be around that band. We used to come together in the evening time, practise these American songs and learn the harmony. The first tune that I recorded was "All I Have Is Love". That was for the band, but I guess the manager figure that he was just an independent producer, so seeing how it was done at Studio One, he gave it back to Mr Dodd and it [was] released on Studio One.'

Osbourne subsequently began recording for Winston Riley with the Sensations, then composed of Jackie Parris, Buster Riley and Bobby Davis. 'Me and the Sensations, Techniques, Noel "Bunny" Brown, Tinga Stewart, we always run into each other somewhere, or somebody may say "Come here, sing this harmony", and then you just get involved. The Sensations was going on, so if they'r e making a record and I would be around, if I can sing a particular harmony, I might just chip in and sing that harmony, and if I'm recording a song, they do that. In 1968-9 I recorded "Come Back Darling" for Winston Riley, "See And Blind", "Warrior", "Fish Mouth", and by the summer of 1969 he compiled the first album, called _Come Back Darling.'_

All these songs were highly popular, the album's title track being a particularly big hit. ' "Come Back Darling" was about one of my little girlfriend when I was young,' Osbourne laughs. 'She moved to another area, I couldn't see her for a time, so I sit down with my guitar and the words just came up. But I happened to migrate to Canada right in that same month that I did the album, so I never even see that girl again.'

Despite the departure _of_ this rising star, Winston Riley continued to gain prestige as a producer. In 1970, Trojan launched a UK branch of the Techniques label after the incredible success of Dave and Ansel Collins' 'Double Barrel'; though the song itself was never popular in Jamaica, its success gave Riley the opportunity to open a record shop on Orange Street.

Whilst the smaller, ghetto-based promoters made their entry-level smashes in reggae, changes at Studio One were also bringing important elements to the new style. The most notable involved Leroy Sibbles' mastery _of_ the bass guitar and engineer Sylvan Morris' special effects, many born from budgetary restraints.

The Heptones' early work at Studio One featured the bass of various session players. Wally Cameron played on several, and Boris Gardiner, a veteran of big live bands such as Kes Chin's Souvenirs and Carlos Malcolm's Afro-Jamaicans, played on noteworthy hits such as 'Party Time'. But when Jackie Mittoo introduced Leroy Sibbles to the bass guitar, the course _of_ reggae history was radically altered.

'Jackie said he wanted to put a trio together to do a weekend gig at the Tit For Tat club on Red Hills Road,' Sibbles explains. 'He said he had the drummer Billy Wade, but he didn't have the bass man and he wanted me to play bass. I said, "Me? I never play bass!" He said, "Grab the bass guitar there", because the studio had a Fender jazz bass, and he hummed the line of one of the songs that he had out, and I find the line and start playing it. We start practising, played the gig and tore the goddam place up for weeks in and weeks out.'

Sibbles came up with memorable and lasting bass parts at Studio One, creating several of the best-loved and most-covered bass lines in the history of Jamaican popular music. 'The first song that I recorded, [the Cables'] "Baby Why", and the next side too, "What Kind Of World", those are two of the biggest bass lines ever recorded in Jamaica – "What Kind Of World", they just revived that rhythm for [Morgan Heritage's international smash hit] "Down By The River". I realized from that time on, the most-revived bass lines in Jamaica is the ones that I play.'

The bass of ska was an acoustic stand-up, frantically pumping to the beat; rock steady was an electric sound, with more audible and typically melodic strolling lines. As the early reggae bass is even more to the fore, its melodic features take a heightened emphasis, particularly at Studio One where augmented equipment boosted bass frequencies. In the hands of Leroy Sibbles the bass took on a quality of gravity; instead of the bright bounce of 'Nanny Goat', the patterns of songs like 'What Kind Of World' and 'Baby Why' seem emotionally laden, the sense of movement contrasted by subtle moments of rest.

Cornell Campbell notes that Sibbles played bass on 'Stars' and 'Queen Of The Minstrel', two landmark early reggae hits featuring Campbell's chilling falsetto, cut while he was leading a group called the Eternals. According to Campbell, the tunes were originally earmarked for a smaller producer, but changed shape when he brought them to Studio One. 'I formed Eternals with Ken Price and Errol Wisdom as a rival to the Uniques and the Sensations. "Queen Of The Minstrel", "Stars" and "Just Can't Find Loving" were three songs which I wrote. I went to Phil Pratt on Orange Street, but I tired out all the while. When I come to him for the recording, it's like he wasn't prepared – "Come back next week". So I went to Sir Coxsone Downbeat again. The session was going to cancel, because a brother named [Eric] Frater who was supposed to play guitar, him never turn up. [Pianist and arranger] Richard Ace said, "But Cornell Campbell can play guitar – play the guitar now, man", so I grab the guitar and show the man them what to play. I write them to sing as a soul-beat music, a foreign music thing, but Richard Ace say, "Why don't we do it in a rock steady?" and the Eternals say, "Cornell, rock it now, man." So when we rock it in a rock steady, everybody jump up in the studio.'

**Sylvan Morris [Tero Kaski]**

'Queen Of The Minstrel' was given a kind of dreamy quality through the application of an echo effect devised by engineer Sylvan Morris. 'Echo wasn't that prevalent as now,' Morris explains, seated behind the mixing desk at Dynamics, the studio originally known as WIRL. 'Being a technician, I take the playback head and feed it back into the record head, feed it into a track on the board, so you had this echo on the voices.'

A gifted engineer from Trench Town, Morris had been interested in electronics since his boyhood. After formal training at a telecommunications firm and technical school, he came to WIRL in the ska era at the age of seventeen. 'A gentleman by the name of Abrahams was working here – they wanted a technician to help with the installation of a three-track. Graeme Goodall, a very good engineer, was here and wanted an assistant, so they bring me in. He taught me the practical work of mastering and the sense of the board. We did work on some of them tunes with Linford Anderson, but I didn't stay that long. Once I was in the studio and Byron Lee came in and push up some controls, trouble the monitors and everything, and when him hear the sound, him say, "What kind of noise is that?" Being young at the time, I said, "If you don't know what you'r e doing, don't touch it", so I was fired! Within about two days they sent back for me, but I was down by Duke Reid. Byron Smith was the main man at that time. Because of my knowledge of electronics, the word that Duke used was that he needed somebody like me to really boost the thing. I didn't really do a lot down there, stayed about five months, but I remember "Ba Ba Boom", the Festival tune by the Jamaicans. Smithy had mixed some of the versions but didn't like it, so I did the final mix. Once I was making a suggestion to Duke, and he said, "Whenever you see me doing anything, you don't have nothing to say." I don't think it's appropriate, so I told him a few wxeks after that I'm leaving. I went to Coxsone immediately and Duke wanted me to come back, call me twice a week for years after that, never stop calling me until he died!'

Morris applied his electronics expertise and musical intuition to get the best from Coxsone's low-fidelity set-up, joining the establishment just before Syd Bucknor, Coxsone's cousin, moved on. 'He had Ampex two tracks and a Lang board,' Morris recalls. 'I sort of revolutionized the sound, because whenever a session is being done I never used to sit down at the board. I used to stand up, because I have to dance while I feel the music. If the musicians see me don't dance, they stop play, say, "What's wrong, man?" I say, "I don't like the bass line". They change it. I noticed that from the back of a speaker you usually get a very heavy bass sound – it is a lot louder in the back than at the front. So I created a box where I left two holes and put the mike at the back. Then there was an Electrovoice mike that Coxsone had which create a lot of those bass sounds. It was a ribbon mike and the ribbon had broken, but the two-track tapes used to have a silver piece at the beginning and I created a ribbon out of it, but because this ribbon is not created for the mike all it did was pick up a certain range of frequency – mostly bass – so you got a more rounder bass penetrating. A lot of Coxsone's mikes was selective because they'v e dropped them – you find that they'r e not picking up the right frequencies, so I have to try to equalize it.'

Morris says that Leroy Sibbles became the key musician at Studio One after his arrival. 'When I went there Jackie Mittoo was there, a very professional individual. He did a lot of the work, but he left shortly after to Canada, so myself and Leroy Sibbles, we did most of the producing. Coxsone used to do auditions, sometimes Leroy Sibbles, Enid from Keith and Enid, also Larry Marshall. They select the individuals they want and we had sessions like three times per week. After Jackie Mittoo left, Leroy Sibbles was one of the main man.'

Al Campbell, who then led the Thrillers vocal group, notes that a female bassist also played on select sessions for Coxsone. 'A girl from Trinidad, she was playing bass as well. I don't remember her name, but she play a portion of tune and went back to Trinidad.'

**Natural born thriller: Al Campbell [David Katz]**

Campbell's Studio One debut came when he was thirteen, after a youth of sacred songs in a West Kingston church. 'My father was a preacher in the Church of God at Oakland Road, between Three Mile and Two Mile,' he explains, sitting at the counter of the West London restaurant he sometimes uses for business meetings. 'I used to sing at rallies, collecting money to build the church fund, and at school we used to have concerts every Friday and I would go up and sing. With my friend Michael Black, a youth named Sweet Pea and one named Buzzer, we form a group called Al Campbell and the Thrillers and audition for JJ on Orange Street. He say we could record, but he didn't have his own studio, so we go to Coxsone and record "Heart For Sale", "Don't Run Away" and "The Last Dance Is Over" – I think it's '67. The group split up after and Mr Dodd said I could sing solo.' Campbell remained at Studio One until 1973 as part of the Freedom Singers and Underground Vegetable harmony groups, backing luminaries such as Alton Ellis, Freddy McGregor, Horace Andy, Burning Spear and Dennis Brown. He was also present for the creation of 'Nanny Goat', and recalls that the rhythm was originally laid for an unrelated song by the pre-pubescent Jacob Miller. 'I took Jacob Miller to Mr Dodd,' Campbell emphasizes. 'It's me who take him from school and say, "Come sing." We record "Love Is A Message" and the original "Nanny Goat" – the original tune is "My Girl Has Left Me".'

'Coxsone came around and said he don't like the song,' adds Boris Gardiner at his Kingston home. 'He call in brother Marshall and say, "Sing a tune on this rhythm, make we hear what it sound like," and it fit it perfect. That's how that tune really got on the market.'

Preparing a family barbecue at his home in Miami, a chuckling Larry Marshall says Coxsone was reluctant to issue the version that he and Alvin sang. 'When me do all tune named "Nanny Goat", Downbeat said, "This don't sound like it could go out, Larry, because this sound empty." I said to him, "No, man - empty? The people await 'pon this," and me just take a dub from him and go to a sound man in Barbican named Duke Anjo. The man want to buy away the dub from me. Alvin Leslie, him play a little set named King Victor at Stanley Park [in the East Kingston neighbourhood of Papine], and it's there "Nanny Goat" bust out of- all roads lead to Papine off of "Nanny Goat". Fi five months him crash every set, and then people start to ask all about – Duke Reid and everyone – where they can get it. When you look at Tommy's Lawn inna Papine Square, they'r e so ram with people, yet me cook up in a one corner with one little piece of boot 'pon me foot, all the bottom broke, and Alvin and me have number-one tune named "Nanny Goat".'

**Boris Gardiner [David Katz]**

Having hit tunes pulling in the crowds at dancehalls but no money in his pocket was a situation with which Larry Marshall was all too familiar. Born Fitzroy Marshall in the district of Lawrence Hall, Saint Anne in 1941, he spent part of his childhood with his father in downtown Kingston. In 1957 Marshall joined a cousin in Graham Heights, near the northern Kingston neighbourhood of Barbican, where he worked as a gardener. He made his performing debut at the Ward Theatre in 1960, backed by the Rhythm Aces, and won five shillings. Word of his skills spread to other local singers, who brought Marshall to the attention of local entrepreneur Philip Yap in 1962. 'Two cousins in Barbican, Ferdie Nelson and Joe Henry, we becomes friends, and when they heard me they encourage me, and the word go to Philip Yap. Down by Federal studio, that's where we do our first recording, a song named "Too Young To Love". It have a Ben E. King background [based on the melody of his "Stand By Me"]. The people just go wild, and the guy sell it to some people in Trinidad.'

In 1963, Marshall passed an audition at Studio One and scored a minor hit with the original 'Please Stay'. He returned to Yap's stable in November 1964 to record a duet with Ferdie Nelson, 'A Promise Is A Comfort To A Fool'. Larry's first big hit came with a cover of the popular American tune 'Snake In The Grass', issued by Top Deck in 1965. He also recorded a duet with Jackie Opel for the company, but left the label for good after being disappointed financially.

Around 1967 Coxsone Dodd tried to place Marshall in the line-up of the Checkmates group, but the singer was unhappy with the situation and began to record for Prince Buster instead. 'I'v e Got Another Girl' was his most successful number, and Marshall also contributed harmony to several of Buster's own works. But Marshall says that money was a problem with Buster too, causing him to record a handful of tunes with Clancy Eccles, including a recut of 'Please Stay'. 'I owe rent inna Barbican them times – you rent a place, and the people them sit down in the doorway and wait for you to pass, so you can't pass inna your house where you live, you can't sleep in, and sometimes me have to walk from downtown Kingston go a Barbican... so Clancy pick me round one corner.'

He then settled into a long period of engagement at Studio One, where his recorded material, harmony vocals and assistant engineering helped to consolidate the emerging genre that came to be called reggae. Marshall and Alvin Leslie followed the popularity of 'Nanny Goat' with further outstanding singles in 1968-9, including the intensely emotional 'Mean Girl' and 'Your Love', whilst the rhythm of the equally proverbial 'Throw Me Corn' proved as individual and infectious as that of 'Nanny Goat'.

**A little piece of boot with the bottom broke: Larry Marshall [right] with Alvin Leslie [Beth Lesser]**

Marshall also had a hand in shaping 'Hello Carol', the first hit by harmony trio the Gladiators and one of Coxsone's biggest in the early reggae style. Standing in the hallway of Tuff Gong studio, a serious and thoughtful Albert Griffiths scowls as he details the Gladiators' history. 'I was born in Saint Elizabeth in '46, grow from Kingston 11 to Trench Town. My mother die, so I was raised by me father and myself, because father didn't have anything them times. Me is a mason and me used to grow 'mongst the Ethiopians, because they used to do the same mason work. My boss named Leebert Robinson book a session and me do "You Are The Girl", the flipside of the Ethiopians' "Train To Skaville". After that, me start the Gladiators when me sing "Train Is Coming Back" for the same Leebert Robinson. The first Gladiators was me, David Webber and Errol Grandison – we were all in the neighbourhood at Kingston 11. David Webber used to sing with his sisters named the Webber Sisters, but he's a guy who kind of go and come – we call him "madman". We go to Treasure Isle where we do "Sweet Soul Music" [later miscredited to the Techniques], Hopeton Lewis give it some background vocals, and another one named "Live Wire". Then we go a Studio One and do "Free Reggae" and "Soul Music" [aka "Mr Sweet"], but Coxsone didn't really release those songs.'

Their breakthrough came in December 1968. 'Me and Nicky Thomas go to Studio One to sing this song named "Hello My Love", and Coxsone run him out of the studio with it. He was doing the lead vocals and I was doing the background. Larry Marshall say, "Gladiators, why you don't just call an individual name?" Jacob Miller say, "You could say, Sonia, Sandra, or..." and Larry Marshall say, "You could even say Carol." Me just say, "True, people would think it's a Christmas carol if it named 'Hello Carol'," and it get a number one!'

**Albert Griffiths [David Katz]**

'"Hello Carol" was my first number one,' says session keyboardist Robbie Lyn, who played on several of the principal early reggae numbers at Studio One. Though largely a self-taught musician, Lyn was given early coaching by his mother, a popular pianist during his youth. He came to Studio One at the suggestion of drummer Filberto Callender, a neighbourhood friend with whom he would later form the In Crowd band. 'Fil Callender, his father is Panamanian,' Lyn notes. 'He was the drummer for the Virtues, and Studio One drummer at the same time. Jackie Mittoo was the musical director for Studio One, but he migrated, so Studio One basically locked down production on a whole, but there was a cigarette about to come on the market called Embassy, and the company wanted to take a live band around Jamaica, so they ended up going to Coxsone for assistance and Fil recommended me. At Studio One I play on a lot of Alton Ellis, like [Tyrone Davis'] "Can I Change My Mind", a lot of Ken Boothe songs and some Ken Parker stuff. Richard Ace was the lead keyboard player – he would be playing mostly organ and I'd be playing piano. If he came late or didn't come at all I'd move to the organ, which is how I ended up doing "Full Up". While we were getting the idea together, he came and played the piano on the song. The organ was more important at that time – that kind of dominated the reggae sound for the shuffling. Plus Eric Frater played a very heavy strum on his guitar, so sometimes you would miss the piano.'

With such ace session players and a keen engineer in his own recording studio, Coxsone Dodd had something of a self-contained hit factory in the early reggae period. Outside of Studio One the most significant recording facility was Randy's four-track studio, upstairs from the landmark record shop at 17 North Parade; the studio was operational from late 1968 or early 1969, just as reggae came into being.

**Randy's [Paul Coote]**

Though it would take a while to establish itself, Randy's became the studio of choice for reggae in the early 1970s; its sparse, clean sound was particularly fitting for the rebellious lyrics and organ breaks that reggae would embody, and its downtown location made it popular with the upcoming producers based nearby. Vincent Chin's eldest son Clive describes the gradual process that led to its foundation, starting at the time when his father worked for the Issa family. 'The job that my father had was to go and clear the money from jukeboxes around the island every fortnight and apply fresh music for the boxes, and he started to collect all these old records. Rather than disposing of them, he would stock them up in his garage, and that's how he started Randy's record store down on East Street – he obtained the name through a radio programme that was sponsored by Randy's of Tennessee. The first was just a tiny store he obtained from a friend, but he wanted to expand and moved in the early sixties to 17 North Parade – it was an ice cream parlour run by a Chinese immigrant, and my father rented just a small section, probably about eight by ten feet. A few years after running that little space within that store, he was offered to purchase 17 North Parade. He continued to run the ice cream parlour until around '66-'67 [when Clive was thirteen]. Before that time, he was also doing recordings with the Skatalites, Lord Creator, John Holt, Alton Ellis, Ken Boothe. Desmond Dekker and Jimmy Cliff used to pass through.'

Randy's biggest early hits were by Lord Creator, including the under-age romance 'Don't Stay Out Late' and the sentimental 'Evening News', but when the Trinidadian singer ran into trouble with the law Vincent Chin turned his attention to building an upstairs studio. 'The foundation of the studio started during the rock steady era - that's one of the reasons you never come across any rock steady tunes on the Randy's label,' Clive explains, sipping a large mug of tea at a friend's apartment on the Lower East Side of New York City. 'One of my father's main recording artists, Lord Creator, was arrested for ganja during that period, so he went to prison for about a year-and-a-half. Upon his release in '68, the studio was about finished.'

The studio was set up by Bill Garnett, WIRL's technical engineer, who had worked at Federal during Graeme Goodall's tenure. Garnett speeded up the completion of the studio in order to house the Wailers, who had been recording at WIRL for Johnny Nash's label, JAD. He then moved to New York to work at Harry Belafonte's Impact studio, the name of which was subsequently adopted as one of Randy's labels. 'Bill Garnett brought in Johnny Nash's people, who brought in Bob and Peter and Bunny. They had booked the studio solid, but we would use time in between for our own purposes, and that's how Peter started collaborating and doing some work like "You Can't Fool Me Again", projects funded by my father.' Recorded in the spring of 1969, 'You Can't Fool Me Again' had an overtly anti-authoritarian message that railed against the myths of Christianity – one of the first reggae songs with such a directly rebellious message, and one that prefigured the hard-hitting material of the 1970s.

Among the first songs with a Rasta theme to reach number one on the Jamaican charts was the Little Roys' 'Bongo Nyah', recorded with the Hippy Boys for Lloyd 'Matador' Daley in May 1969. The group was led by Earl Lowe, otherwise known as Little Roy, with his schoolmate, Donovan Carless, on harmonies. The gently lilting song, which cloaked Rasta sentiment in an adapted nursery rhyme, pointed the way towards the direct expression of Rasta beliefs. 'I was just starting to get conscious towards Rastafari,' the singer explains, 'although at that time I wasn't really seeing Emperor Haile Selassie I as the First.' Lowe scored further solo hits for Matador, including the forlorn 'Without My Love' and determined 'Hard Fighter', before breaking away to form the Tafari label. He started out recording for Coxsone and Prince Buster in rock steady. 'Buster was the one who gave me the name Little Roy, as I grow up with a small structure. Then I move on to Matador.'

**Hard Fighter: Little Roy [David Katz]**

Lloyd Daley was then in his most successful period as a producer, following the dismantling of his sound system after hostile police action in 1966. 'It was partially destroyed at Center on Shortwood Road,' Daley laments. 'Some malicious reason why they did it. I sold my sound system that same year. It was so large, I had to sell it in three different lots.'

In 1968, Daley moved his radio and television repair service and record shop to 43 Waltham Park Road, 'one of the most outstanding dancehalls' in the area; his wife Deanna, daughter of noted band leader Eric Deans, ran a beauty parlour upstairs. 'Dark Of The Sun' by Jackie Mittoo was his first significant hit; Daley says it was the only song he recorded at Studio One. 'Ugly Man', sung by the Scorchers duo in October that year, was even bigger. 'They came to my shop, singing a kind of sentimental tune,' Daley recalls, 'and we realized that people didn't like those music, so we gave them a few words. The next day, in the studio, they were the last set of guys we dealt with, and it was the only hit we made that day.'

The Matador says the biggest hits he ever produced were 'Bongo Nyah' and Alton Ellis' 'Lord Deliver Us', released in 1970. The 1969 session that yielded 'Bongo Nyah' also resulted in Lloyd Charmers' 'Zylon', an instrumental counterpart to Lloyd Robinson's 'Death A Come'; though conceived of as a filler, the organ piece actually topped the Jamaican charts. 'We were counting on "Death A Come" to be the A-side,' Daley explains, 'but we had to flick it because the people liked "Zylon" more. It became the number one hit.'

That 'Zylon' would be issued as a number one A-side, instead of an incidental B-side, showed a notable shift in style: in 1969 instrumentals, usually led by an aggressive organ, were enjoying a popularity seldom seen since the days of the Skatalites. The Upsetters' 'Clint Eastwood', the Hippy Boys' 'Dr No Go', issued by Sonia Pottinger, and Harry J All Stars' 'Liquidator' were particularly popular in Jamaica. What made these different from most ska instrumentals was that each was an altered version of a previously issued song with the vocal removed, and all but 'Eastwood' had an organ overdubbed on the rhythm. It was partly the success of these abstract instrumentals, and of others such as the Upsetters' 'Return Of Django' and 'Man From MIS', that would enable Jamaican music to enjoy an unprecedented popularity in Britain, once white working-class youth had adopted the rude boy style.

That year, 1969, was when reggae really broke in the UK. Towards the end of 1967, Desmond Dekker's late rock steady hit '007' (aka 'Shanty Town') was highly popular. Then, after the success _of_ the Ethiopians' first tour, Commercial Entertainment brought Dekker to Britain in December 1968, just as his Leslie Kong-produced 'Israelites' was to reach a number one chart position. His follow-up, 'A It Mek', entered the charts in April 1969. Pat Kelly's 'How Long Will It Take' (produced by Bunny Lee with Lee Perry's involvement) hit by July, largely supported by airplay from off-shore station Radio Caroline; its popularity brought the singer to London for his first overseas performances. Prince Buster made another British tour in August, and at the end of September the first Caribbean Music Festival was held at the Empire Pool in Wembley; it featured Max Romeo, Desmond Dekker and Johnny Nash. By the following month the charts were full of reggae tunes, with the Upsetters' instrumental recasting of Chris Kenner's 'Sick And Tired' as 'Return of Django' beginning its ascent, followed quickly by the Harry J All Stars' 'Liquidator', an instrumental cut of a love song by obscure singer Tony Scott with lead organ by Winston Wright.

In November 1969 Lee Perry and the Upsetters came to Britain with the Pioneers, who were then in the charts with 'Longshot Kick The Bucket'. By this time the Pioneers had shifted their allegiance from Joe Gibbs to Leslie Kong, after disputes had arisen. 'The Pioneers was getting real popular,' Luddy Crooks explains. 'Then me and Joe Gibbs had a little argument, so we decided that we'r egoing to leave. We was walking up Orange Street the following day and I saw Leslie Kong and his brother Fats. He said, "Wha'p pen, Pioneer? Whey you a do?" I said, "I ain't doing nothing now I leave Joe Gibbs." He said, "Come sing some songs for us now." The first song we did for Kong was "Samfie Man" and that went to number one straightaway – we 'were an instant success with Kong. Then we did "Easy Come Easy Go", which was another hit.' It was while working for Leslie Kong that the group drafted in Desmond Dekker's brother George Agard as a third member, despite initial resistance from their producer. 'While we were at Beverley's George Dekker used to be there, singing harmonies with Desmond Dekker and the Aces. He even sang [with] Derrick Morgan; his alias at that time was Johnny Melody. He joined us when we got to Beverley's because we wanted to strengthen the group, but Leslie Kong only want the two of us that was the Pioneers originally. Straightaway we had a number one with him leading it, because the country folks love his kind of singing.'

Their biggest hit, and the one that brought them to England, was 'Longshot Kick The Bucket', a continuation of the 'Longshot' number cut after the dud racehorse bit the dust. 'One morning we were sitting out at Beverley's , and Mr Kong came in and said, "Why are you guys sitting out here? You don't hear that the horse Longshot dead? Go around the back and make a tune!" There was a piano round the back where Derrick Morgan, Desmond Dekker, all the guys clown around and rehearse. At that time, Derrick Morgan used to control Beverley's – whatever he says would go. We went round the back and about an hour after that we said, "Boss, we finished the song." He listened to the song and said, "I have to go to England, so Luddy, you go to the studio and do the song." I don't want to take nothing from Kong, because he is a good guy, one of the best guys I'v e met in the business, but he wasn't there when that song was produced. We did the song and when I bring it up to let Fats hear it, he say, "Let's release it straightaway", and it was an instant success in Jamaica. We get popular now, so the kids want us to come and play at their schools. Desmond Dekker was to appear on a show with the singer Joe Simon, but Desmond had to go to England because "Israelites" was in the charts, and Mr Kong went down to see Byron Lee to put us on the show in Desmond's place – as Chinese to Chinese they work it out together. We did fourteen shows with Joe Simon, and Bruce White and Tony Cousins saw us and went to Kong and said they want us to go to England, and there comes the call from England that "Longshot [Kick The Bucket]" was number fourteen in the charts. At the end of that tour we came back to Jamaica, but our minds were set on going back to England.' They did indeed leave Jamaica shortly afterwards, joining Desmond Dekker for what would be a long-term residence abroad.

In addition to Derrick Morgan, band leader Roland Alphonso played a key role in the arrangement of Leslie Kong's product; he ensured that the hits kept rolling by drafting in the core of the rival Supersonics band as the Beverley's All Stars. As Jackie Jackson recalls, 'Roland Alphonso was the musical arranger for Beverley's records. When there was going to be a session, he went and found all the musicians and said, "We have a session this morning at West Indies Records. You can do it?" I said, "Yeah!" He said, "You sure Tommy won't vex?" I think that first session could have been "Poor Me Israelites" – that was the first session for Beverley Kong. Them days it was Desmond Dekker and the Aces, Maytals and the Pioneers.'

This same core of musicians played on most of the biggest hits of the era issued by other producers – including those that broke big in England. As Jackson explains, 'Jamaican producers, they are so traditional – all of them. If a set of musicians plays a song and it becomes a hit, everybody wants to use that set of musicians. From Leslie Kong it went Tip Top, Mrs Pottinger, then Clancy Eccles, then Derrick Harriott, then everybody else. When Scratch formed his Upsetter label, we did all of his recordings and all of Joe Gibbs' stuff. Gladdy was always on the piano, but after a while, sometimes it was Gladdy and sometimes it would be Snapping [Theophilus Beckford]. Organ was always Winston Wnght. On guitar was different people: Ronny Bop, Douggie Bryan, Lynn Taitt and Hux Brown. There were many drummers: Paul Douglas, Hugh Malcolm, Drumbago.'

According to Derrick Harriott, it was Wright's organ playing that often gave a reggae tune its defining character. 'Winston Wright was a man that I rate very big. When you leave him out of a session, it's like something is missing.' Alvin Ranglin, who made use of Wright's talents on an instrumental recut of 'Oh Carolina' called 'Man From Carolina', also sang Wright's praises. 'He taught me a lot and I respect that, 'cause in the early stage he was there on bandstand. Me and him is from the same area in Clarendon, so we live quite good.' Credited to the GG's All Stars, 'Man From Carolina' was the first of Ranglin's productions to sell widely in the UK.

Ansel Collins was another organist responsible for early reggae instrumentals that were major hits in the UK. At his home in Garvey Mead, Collins says he started his musical career as a singer. 'I was born in Kingston in 1948, raised in Maxfield Avenue. In 1960 I was singing with Sonny Bradshaw, do "A Star Is Born" at Carib Theatre, _Vere Johns' Opportunity Hour._ My first recording was with Coxsone, "I Tried", with Bobby Aitken, backed up by Jackie Mittoo. I was a vocalist in Bobby Aitken's band with Winston Grennan.' Collins confirms that Grennan taught him to play drums. 'Drums, I play on a couple of Delroy Wilson songs, like "This Old Heart of Mine".' Eventually he learned to play the piano. 'I was doing nothing in the days, so Bobby Aitken said, "Why don't you practise the piano?", because Conroy Cooper, he could play so good but he didn't have the time to play in Bobby Aitken's little band, so I just becomes self-taught. The first session I play on is a Bunny Lee session with Max Romeo, Roy Shirley and Slim Smith, ' "Never Let Go" and "Blessed Are The Poor" [aka "The Beatitude"]. That's where I learn from, right in the Bunny Lee stable.'

**Winston Wright**

The first record to feature Collins' organ skills was 'Night Doctor', a song produced by Collins himself at Randy's in 1968, but issued by Lee Perry as an Upsetters' single in 1969. Collins was then leading the RHT Invincibles, a club band based at the Rainbow Healing Temple bakery run by a Rasta on Spanish Town Road; the band featured bassist and former Termites vocalist Lloyd Parks, guitarist Bertram 'Ranchie' McLean and drummer Lowell 'Sly' Dunbar. 'The first recording, I did four songs,' Collins recalls. 'Lloyd Parks sing one for me and another one I gave to Coxsone. Sly was on drums. It was his first session, but I took him to the studio to sing a song called "Diplomat". In those days, I could only record and wait for somebody else to do the releasing. You have to have money to deal with those things. For one year I had "Night Doctor" on dub plate, and I give it to Scratch to listen to and somebody took it away from Scratch. When Scratch found it back, he get back to me and I give him the tape, and it went in the British chart, sell like hot bread.' Perry subsequently scored another melodic Collins organ hit with 'Man From MI5'. Collins says the massive 'Double Barrel', issued by Winston Riley in 1970, began as another freelance project. ' "Double Barrel" was really arranged by me and Sly Dunbar. I make it and give it to Winston Riley to release. It was his idea to put on Dave Barker.'

Barker, born David Crooks in Vineyard Town, now lives on the sprawling Saint Raphael's Estate in Northwest London. He says he started singing in street corner groups before teaming up with Glen Brown in the late 1960s. 'I first met Glen Brown on Cable Street in Franklyn Town. We were rehearsing in this yard, and I didn't know Glen Brown visit next door. Him say he would like to team up together as Glen and Dave. We approached Harry J with "Lucky Boy", which played a lot on the airwaves.' Brown introduced Crooks to Lee Perry, who renamed him Dave Barker after he delivered a James Brown-styled vocal for Perry's 'Prisoner Of Love', a big hit in both Jamaica and the UK in 1969. Scratch also had Barker shout a wild introduction to 'Shocks _Of_ Mighty', the first of many such numbers that Barker voiced in the style of an American radio announcer. 'The whole buzz about me is that I am an American star,' Dave laughs. 'We would go to bars where you have jukeboxes – people would punch "Prisoner Of Love" or "Shocks Of Mighty" and my fellow Jamaican I-dren [brothers] them say, "Bwoi, is who sing that tune there?" And a next one say, "A some Yankee bwoi."'

**Double Barrel: Dave and Ansel Collins**

It was this Yankee-styled disc jockey talk that Winston Riley asked Dave to voice on 'Double Barrel' at Joe Gibbs' studio on Burns Avenue in Duhaney Park. The studio, initially two-track, was set up by Bill Garnett, who was then regularly travelling between New York and Jamaica. 'Winston came by me at an earlier time and asked me to join Techniques, because Pat Kelly had left and they wanted a lead singer. I did two tracks: it was me, Bruce Ruffin and Winston Riley. Also, I used to rehearse with the Sensations. One day I was home with my baby-mother [the mother of his children] and kids, Winston came and said that he has got this particular track that he would like me to try a thing on. At that time, I must say that I was skint. I went to Joe Gibbs' recording studio – him and his brother, Buster Riley, played this track and I could not really get into that track. Buster Riley was encouraging me to try and find a vibe: "Make it sound like something big, like them James Bond movie thing, 0–0– 7." Once I start, the flow automatically comes: "I am the magnificent, I'm back with a shock of a soul boss, the most thundering, storming, sounds of soul! I am double 0–0– 0... " When I finish, Winston gave me twenty dollars to do that track. I left that place, not thinking of that track any more, because I must deal with my family, and the next thing I know is that it is raising Cain here.'

After 'Double Barrel' entered the UK charts, Dave and Ansel Collins toured the UK for three months and appeared on _Top of the Pops._ Unfortunately, conditions on the tour were less than satisfactory, according to the artists. 'I must say,' Barker emphasizes, 'the plenty clothes, the heap of money and the nice place we didn't really get.' Their follow-up, 'Monkey Spanner', was also highly popular in the UK, and after they went back for more performances Dave remained in Britain. Collins returned to Jamaica to craft further inspired organ instrumentals for Riley and other producers.

Though it was the raw sound of organ-based reggae that shook up Britain to a great extent in 1969-70, the music was rapidly evolving back home in Jamaica and the new decade would see all kinds of further changes. In the increasingly turbulent 1970s reggae would undergo shifts in tempo, pace, subject matter and composition, and its creators would come up with a further series of innovations to keep their music perpetually unique.

_Soul Syndicate was my band because they understand everything about me._

Niney the Observer

_Studio One was good elementary, high school, college, university: that's where I learn everything._

Horace Andy

THE SIXTIES ENDED with reggae still trying to find its feet. It had arrived as a startling burst of energy, but by mid-1970 the music had slowed again. The new style that began to dominate was generally slower, heavier, thicker and more complex – a meditative and naturalistic sound equally suitable for ballads or songs of social protest. Several important developments were brought to Jamaican music in the early 1970s, altering and strengthening the foundations laid in the preceding decade; as before, some of the most significant changes came from the ghettos of Western Kingston.

As the sixties came to a close the former Supersonics musicians, now known as the All Stars, were the most in-demand session band; their fruitful association with the Beverley's label was ended only by the untimely death of Leslie Kong from heart failure in August 1971, and they continued to back numerous hits for other producers. However, at the start of the 1970s there were challenges from other quarters, notably the former Hippy Boys, now typically identified as the Upsetters, and a number of smaller outfits initially based at night clubs. Perhaps the most significant new band to emerge in the early reggae period was the Soul Syndicate, a group of talented young musicians from the Greenwich Farm ghetto that had a way of conjuring a sparse, eerie sound.

Most of the group have lived in California since the early 1980s, and are currently performing as the Fully Fullwood Band. Before taking the stage at an open-air event in the Oakland hills, bassist George (Fully) Fullwood and rhythm guitarist Tony Chin recount the band's genesis. 'I was raised in Rae Town, then when I was about five or six [in 1956] we moved to Greenwich Farm,' Fully begins. 'My parents was very supportive of me in terms of music. I used to make a lot of sardine-can guitars, and then my father get involved when he realized that I was very serious about music. He was a sheet-metal worker at the Public Works Industrial Terrace, beside Tivoli Gardens, and he brought a friend to teach me to play guitar. Tony was living on Spanish Town Road, but I was one of the only youth around that time that could play guitar. I started showing Tony a couple notes, and then he call me one day when someone was looking for a bass player, but I didn't play bass – I use the guitar to play bass with the E-string.'

**The Soul Syndicate [Courtesy of Jamphoto]**

'Soul Syndicate formed when I was living in Spanish Town, near to Greenwich Farm, about '67 or '68 – a club band playing around Jamaica,' Tony Chin adds. His face seems to reflect the Jamaican motto 'Out of Many, One People': 'My father is half-Chinese, half-black, my mother is half-Indian, half-black, so I get that mixture,' he explains. 'Greenwich Farm is where I grew up, but I spent some time in Trench Town too, maybe about two years. Then when I was about nine [in 1957], I grew up with my grandmother in Westmoreland, Saint Andrew and Negril. My father was working as a salesman, ride bike and sell school books, and he was a fisherman, and my mom was a domestic worker, wash clothes and iron.'

Tony says he came to know Fully in the mid-1960s through a mutual friend. 'My father bought an acoustic guitar from a drunkard and I start practise. A friend of mine show me a few chords, he and Fully was schoolmates. We heard that this shoemaker named Meggy up Maxfield Avenue have some guitars and a drum set and wanted to put a band together. When the band did form, it named Rhythm Raiders: me, Fully, Meggy – he was the leader, he played guitar – and a drummer named Elgin. That's how the band start, and then Fully's father took the band.'

Tony says the band kept this line-up for 'about a year', and says they were already backing artists on live shows at this time, though Fully feels they did not perform live until later. 'We play a club named VIP Lounge,' Tony insists, 'and we play on one and two stage shows, back up Roy Shirley and Stranger Cole in May Pen and Spanish Town. Them was the rock steady days. After that, the band get different members.'

Fully says the membership changed because the group's other two founders were amateurs who were unable to match Tony and himself. 'Elgin and Meggy live around the area, come from the country and they couldn't play that well. Those guys was older and they couldn't really keep up with us, so a next guy came in, Cleon Douglas. He used to play guitar and sing, and he was in the same area of the ghetto in Kingston. Then [drummer] Leroy "Horsemouth" [Wallace], he used to be around us because he was from Alpha Boys School – he was a poor bad boy in the ghetto and he used to live at my house. My mother and father like him very much and he used to sleep on my couch – he was like a half-brother to me. That's how the band started as Rhythm Raiders. Later on, we started adding keyboards.'

'Then you have a next drummer,' Tony adds, 'a brother named Max Edwards, he did play with us too. We go through some different drummers, but Santa [Carlton Davis] was the last drummer.'

'Santa used to be in the area still,' Fully continues, 'because Santa's father and my father used to work at the same place, and I used to kind of baby-sit Santa. He was playing in a little boys' club – he used to play those little marching club stuff

'That was late 1969,' Santa confirms by telephone in Los Angeles. 'It was Tony, Fully, Cleon Douglas and the keyboard player – his last name was Scott.' Santa's nickname dates from childhood. 'It was close to Christmas, and I used to be on the street, make skates and run around. There was a tar patch I used to ride through, and this day the sun was so hot, the tar patch melted, and I fell off the skates and scrape my face up bad. At the clinic they use iodine, so my face was red and blue. This guy said "Carlton, how you look like Santa Claus?" and it just stuck.'

Santa first played drums in a church group. 'I grew up in the ska era, just before it start to turn into rock steady. I used to hear a lot of that and a lot of American music like the Impressions, the Platters, Brook Benton. When I was a kid I was fascinated with the military, and I used to like to see these guys march around the place, so I think that was one of my main influences. At eleven years old, I used to leave school every evening and pass a church at Saint Joseph's Road and Waltham Park Road. I hear music playing, and it sounds good. One day they were recruiting for the Junior group, and I was so into the thing that I was recruited into the Senior group – I had that interest to learn fast. I was playing snare drums, and then I became an all-rounder, so I started excelling. I stayed with those guys for about five years. Bobby Aitken was giving a couple of the guys guitar lessons, so he was passing by the band room one day while I was inside trying to play a rock steady beat, and you know those guys [the Caribbeats] were the kings of rock steady. He said, "Make the bass drum and snare drum drop together, and then you play a eight beat on the high hat." He was the first man who gave me some kind of instruction - basically I was self-taught, learning things off my own head.

'I left the group when I was about fourteen... one thing lead to another, and I run into this guy Kofi, he used to live in the New York area – Jamaican, but got through – and those guys were into jazz, the Coltrane kind of stuff. He came back to Jamaica and started a band, Kofi Kali and the Graduates, so that is how I met Ken Boothe, Joe Higgs, Alton Ellis, Hortense Ellis. We used to play rock steady, ska, calypso, play different clubs like the Blue Mist on Slipe Road, and we did gigs on the North Coast. We used to do functions in the ghetto, but back then the ghetto was sweet – it wasn't like now, when you'r e afraid to go some place. In the early seventies you could go to Trench Town any hours of the night or day, and you wouldn't have to worry about "Oh, they'r e going to shoot you." Those were the days when ghetto was the place all the singers used to hang out.'

Santa says he surprised Fully's camp at his audition. 'One day somebody told me that Fully want a drummer – he was asking about me. Then I used to play in the Drum Corps, and Fully's father said, "Oh, you just play marching drums, you don't know how to play drums." At audition time I played, and everybody's mouth went open wide.'

'These guys were very talented, and he learned pretty fast,' says Fully. 'I change the name to the Soul Syndicate, then we brought in Chinna [lead guitarist Earl Smith]. Chinna used to come as a young boy from school, watching us and said he could sing. Then Tony start show him some stuff on his guitar.'

**Guitar fascination:**

**Earl 'Chinna' Smith [David Katz]**

At his Kingston home, where a guitar is never far from hand, Chinna confirms that Greenwich Town or Greenwich Farm, Kingston 13, attracted singers and ghetto toughs from the neighbouring district of Trench Town, Kingston 12, and beyond. 'I was born at a place named Moore Street in 1955. I grew up with my godfather and godmother in Greenwich Town, place named Kingston 13, but Moore Street is right round a Trench Town, so it's like 12 and 13. Everyone 'fraid of the number, but 13 carry the vibe because 13 have the beach, so all of them 12 man would have to come down Greenwich Town to get red snapper and doctor fish and all of them substance there to keep them voice and everything bubbling – and the herb too, because we used to have one of greatest herbsman in the world, a man named George Croucher, a coolie boy [meaning of Indian descent] whe pass some years ago. People from all over the island come to buy herb down there on East Avenue, because him sell herb the cheapest and him always have the wickedest herb.'

Chinna says it was through family sound system connections that he first became interested in guitar. 'My old man, a roofing specialist, used to have a sound named Smith's , and Bunny Lee used to operate my old man's sound. In other words, Bunny hold me as a likkle baby. Bunny's mother and my mother was close, so it's a whole family thing. My godfather was a fudge man [he sold chocolate fudge] who just love music, and my godfather have a sound, which was Down South the President. Prince Buster and Snapping used to come sell him soft wax inna them days, £14 for all seven wax, what the man them now call dub plates. My old man used to love music so much that he just had the wickedest sound. He didn't care about whe him play, used to string up every day and play music and just dance to it. I remember a deejay them time there, the early sixties, come by the house with a guitar and it's the most fascinating thing. Me just see this thing and it haunt me, but as a youth you'r e never allowed to touch things due to respect, so me just look 'pon this thing and me never see nothing that fascinate me so much. Me try to make something look like it out of sardine can and use fish line, nylon strings – through we inna the fisherman area, Greenwich Town, we get fishing line easy. We realize we'r e not getting that kind of melodic sound, but at least we'r e getting the feel _of_ the instrument.'

It was also because of the sound system that Chinna received his nickname, derived from a form of stereo amplifier commonly known as a tuner. 'Through my father have a sound, as a little youth I always have my little toy sound make out of broken records, and through it's patois, rather than "Tuner" it's "Chuner", and then I guess it come out more popular as Chinna.'

Chinna explains that as a neighbourhood music fan he was often around Soul Syndicate, and officially came into the group around the time that Cleon Douglas was preparing to emigrate to America (where he would eventually lead the group Jah Malla with Noel Alphonso, one of Roland's sons). 'Greenwich Town was an area where 'nuff musicians used to hang out. We have the Melodians, Slim Smith, Wailers them used to pass through and Gaylads, and then you have Bunny Lee as a man who in the business and him live next door to me. Sunday him used to have auditions and him used to have Glen Adams as a man who audition the artists them. I remember the first time I hear Jacob Miller, him come with a group named Schoolboys.

'I lived on East Avenue and I hear a band up Ninth Street named Soul Syndicate, the man there a rehearse every night, so we used to go up there, hear some wicked music. The man them used to play like top-ten thing, reggae and certain other things, so it's just fun to go up there and hear the music a play – a full band with horns and drum and bass and keyboard.

'Me and a next youth named Earl Zero start singing and we have a little group with my brethren named Rush-It. There was a brethren who used to work over the saw mill named Eastman. He was a cabinetmaker and he just love the vibes, so he buy a guitar, but him no really so much into playing it, so me and Earl, it was like a rat race to see who could get that instrument. We don't know no chord or nothing, just have this instrument out of tune, so we go for this rehearsal and watch the guy them playing, every rehearsal night, and we kind of start looking on the shape. When them finish all the song and you strum the same thing, it don't sound like how him one sound, and you say, "Something wrong", so I asked the guitarist, Cleon Douglas – wicked singer and guitarist – "How's it my guitar don't sound like yours?" and him take the guitar and say, "No man! This no tune", so me figure out the tuning, and me go up there every night again, and me know all the song them, because me understand the shape and the position, so when the song done I realize it sound like his own.

'Cleon did have to leave and go to the States, so the band need a guitarist now, so Fully's father say, "We have to try that little big-eyed boy – it look like him can do a thing." Me know all the song because me don't miss no rehearsal. It's fun now to get a real guitar – an electric guitar – and start play.'

Before Cleon Douglas emigrated the band had already cut their teeth in the studio; as Chinna was still at school, he missed several of these early recording sessions. 'The first guy who brought us into the studio to do recording was Bunny Lee,' recalls Fully. 'I think it was Slim Smith, but I can't remember the exact tune.'

'Bunny bring wre into the studio when we down Greenwich Farm with Glen Adams and thing,' Tony Chin vaguely assents. 'I don't remember what song, but Bunny is a man who don't go to the studio and do one song – he do many songs, many many rhythms, over and over. He's the one that bring us to the studio to do recording first. I think Slim Smith was one of the first, with the Uniques them.'

'We were brought to the studio by Bunny Lee,' confirms Santa, who names the Twinkle Brothers as a vocal group featured on the session. 'He came and hired the band, took us to the studio and work our ass for 200 dollars, but we didn't know the difference. We treated it like it was a gig – 200 dollars was a lot of money, but not for the type of work we were doing.' Santa says these early sessions quickly established their name on the recording circuit. 'Back then it was Jackie Jackson, Hux Brown, Gladstone Anderson ruling the studio. We were just young kids who started playing, and we used to rehearse every day, week after week, just for the love of it. Then there was a couple of others for Phil Pratt and Niney, and Keith Hudson – we used to do a lot of stuff for him. It's cool when guys come together from different directions. We were a band that had a very tight sound, so people got attracted to that.'

'Bunny Lee was from the same area, Greenwich Town,' adds Fully, 'and he used to come by and hear us playing. After Bunny Lee, then all these promoters came by. Everybody wants us because we were putting out a lot of hit songs for different artists.'

'Soul Syndicate, me and Bunny Lee take them from day one,' says the man known as Phil Pratt. 'We are the first people them record for. They was young and have fresh, nice ideas, so when you go a studio it's easier to get a hit record from them than the older heads, 'cause the older heads would tend to repeat themselves.'

Pratt is an elusive character who tries to avoid interviews. At the Jamaican takeaway restaurant he operates in Northwest London he nearly throws me out of the place when I ask his date of birth, but eventually he explains how7 he got involved in the music business. 'My name is George Phillips,' he begins – though a recent compilation lists his given name as George Chukoe. 'That's a musical name, Phil Pratt. I was born in Milk Lane, left Milk Lane when I was about seventeen, came to England in 1960 to join my dad, but I didn't know my dad until 1959, so it never work out, we couldn't get on. I came into music when I go back home, that was 1965. I start to sing for Coxsone, but the tune never came out." I start to do my own thing in '66. Ken Lack, that's where I was first, at 15 Mark Lane. We was partner: I did have John Tom label, he have Wiggle Spoon and Caltone. I did "Reach Out", a wicked tune, and "Sweet Song For My Baby", that was pirated in England.'

Pratt says his failure to hit as a singer made him move into production, but his early efforts were blocked by the bigger producers. 'There's a song by Ken Boothe called "The One I Love". It's a magnificent song, but at the time, why it didn't sell, I was having problem with Coxsone and Beverley's . The other people who have song for him, they boycott me, because I was a new man coming in the business and I wasn't as strong as them – they was stronger 'pon the radio station and everything, so I have to take my beating until people came to know me.'

His link with Soul Syndicate around 1970 brought forth 'My Heart Is Gone', John Holt's first big hit as a solo artist and one of the year's defining numbers. The partnership hit again in 1971 with Holt's emotive 'Strange Things', a forlorn love song that showed the emotive brilliance the Syndicate was capable of generating – though the song was overshadowed by Holt's version of Shane Sheppard and the Limelights' 'Stick By Me', named by producer Bunny Lee as 'the longest-selling number one' in Jamaica. Pratt and Soul Syndicate also scored with Pat Kelly's 'Talk About Love', an adaptation of the Mam Ingredient's thoughtful 'Brotherly Love', on which Kelly's delivery was ably supported by the group's musical abilities and vocal harmonies.

By the end of 1970, Soul Syndicate was already so hot that Lee Perry wanted to use their talents. He had spent the latter half of 1970 reshaping the sound of the Wailers with his Upsetters crew, creating what many feel are the best recordings of their entire career, as heard on songs like 'Soul Rebel', '400 Years' and 'Don't Rock My Boat'. Working with Soul Syndicate, Perry crafted the further Wailers classics 'Sun Is Shining' and 'Mr Brown'.

Soul Syndicate's languorous backing was just what 'Sun Is Shining' needed, and it was an immediate success. Tony Chin also pointed out that the Wailers and Soul Syndicate had deeper links, partly because Wailers' backing musicians Glen Adams and Alva 'Reggie' Lewis were for a time part of the Syndicate. 'Glen Adams used to make our uniform – we used to wear some red coats. When Cleon Douglas migrated to America, Reggie came in, and then Wailers them and Bob Marley did come around with us. We used to back them up at different clubs, like the Psychedelic Lounge in Greenwich Farm and VIP Club, and we did play the King's Theatre in Harbour View – that's the first time I saw Ziggy Marley and his brother [Stephen], little boys dancing on stage.'

Despite such well-forged links, Lee Perry was unhappy with the results when he tried to fashion Marley's boastful 'Duppy Conqueror' with Soul Syndicate. It was ultimately re-recorded by the Upsetters, leaving the original Syndicate rhythm to be transformed into 'Mr Brown', a song relating the widely reported sighting of a three-wheeled coffin driven around the island by buzzards. 'The "Mr Brown" rhythm track is actually the first rhythm track we did for "Duppy Conqueror",' confimis Glen Adams. 'We [the Upsetters] had a money problem. We wanted money, so Scratch get upset and went for a group that we were training named the Soul Syndicate – I was the singer at that time for the group, 'cause I was training them, so I would just go around andjive with them. I would practise Chinna, tune him guitar and give him the rhythm. Scratch went for them and do this track, so when Bob heard the track, he never like it. It was a really good track, but it's just the stigma to say we [the Upsetters] didn't do it. We know the song, because we already had rehearsed it as well, so Scratch come back and get us and we went back and do it.'

As Tony Chin recalls, 'We record "Duppy Conqueror", but I don't think Scratch did like the rhythm, so he get Family Man them and re-record "Duppy Conqueror", but then Glen Adams write lyrics and put them on that song and call it "Mr Brown".'

'I wrote "Mr Brown",' Glen Adams confirms. 'I was about to sing that song, and Scratch asked me to let Bob do it, because he think he was the best for the song. Matter of fact, I'm glad he did it.'

'I tried to get them to play "Duppy Conqueror" and they couldn't do it neither,' Lee Perry asserts. 'Bunny Lee's band couldn't do it. Me have to take them to the studio to start together, but they couldn't perform, that's why me have to use Family Man them to do it. Bob did realize that those band could not do it, and if Fams them could do it, then this is the band!'

Marley was so taken with the skills of Family Man and Carly that he stole them away from the Upsetters when the Wailers broke free from Scratch in late 1971, drafting them in as his permanent rhythm section. The Wailers then shocked the charts with 'Trench Town Rock', their self-produced debut that proclaimed how far-reaching and influential reggae music would become, rising from the ghetto of Kingston 12 to conquer the world. Lee 'Scratch' Perry describes the song as 'prophecy'.

Another problematic situation involving Soul Syndicate and the Wailers arose from Niney the Observer's 'Blood And Fire', released to great commotion on Christmas Eve 1970. The apocalyptic song, featuring Hux Brown and Chinna Smith on guitar, with vocal backing by Lloyd Charmers and organ from Cleon Douglas, had a keyboard line which Marley and company felt resembled one of the tunes they had crafted earlier. Niney got into a fracas with Glen Adams, who drew blood from the aspiring producer and vocalist. 'A likkle terror go down between brethren and brethren,' Niney says at Bunny's Lee small and rather dilapidated studio in Duhaney Park – the Burns Avenue premises originally established by Joe Gibbs. 'Me and Bob have a little problem, me and Glen Adams have a little problem, like a fighting. My blood come up, a lot of shit go down – I have to end up in the hospital, and it's like the song become a prophecy. People never want to buy the song, because they say the song is dreadful and they don't know what it's all about. Charlie Babcock, the top announcer at RJR, he get lay off to play the song.'

Despite such rocky beginnings, 'Blood And Fire' came to be regarded as a true classic. Named as 'song _of_ the year' in 1971, it launched Niney as one of Jamaica's most individual producers and marked the start of a long and fruitful relationship with Soul Syndicate. 'I always use Soul Syndicate,' he confirms. 'They was my band because they understand everything about me and I used to give them a lot of inspiration.'

**Niney the Observer [David Katz]**

Niney was bom George Boswell in Montego Bay in 1944, but was raised as Winston Holness when his parents split up. An industrial accident severed one of his thumbs, hence his enduring nickname. Niney says he was a record plugger and salesman for many leading producers and entered the production field after a long freelance period. 'I grow between Montego Bay and Kingston, my auntie live in the suburb part of town. When I come of age, I decide that I'm going to stay with my family in town. I start to move with guys like Derrick Morgan and Monty Morris, then me and Bunny Lee hook up, and me and Lee Perry. Andy Capp is a man who I get a lot of experience from – he was the greatest engineer at those times, and he was a genius in the business. Night 'pon nights I used to be around Andy. We sleep at the studio and he make songs, and I'm the salesman for them. I work with him on a lot like "Pop A Top", "Fat Man" by Derrick Morgan [issued as "Top The Pop"], and [the Race Fans'] "Bookie Man". I work with every single producer in the business: Beverley's , Coxsone. I used to go to studio with them and used to sell songs for them. I record a lot of songs at Coxsone like "Music Police" and "Cocaine" [issued as "Cocaine Doctor"], all those rhythms with Family Man and Carly those days before they played with Bob Marley. After I work for Bunny Lee, at night-time I do freelance. I just go and make rhythms and any guy want a cut, I just sell him a cut. Joe Gibbs does like my rhythms, but he never really want me to sell, he want me to be with him, 'cause I used to make a lot of songs and give him, like Ken Parker, "Only Yesterday".'

Niney says the circumstances _of_ Max Romeo's 'Macabee Version' convinced him to issue his own product. The song was a Rasta refutation of the King James version of the Bible, and one of the first tunes with a conscious theme recorded by the singer, but as Romeo licensed it to producer Willie Francis he failed to reap when the song took off. 'I was still working for Bunny, and me and Maxie Romeo live together in one house,' Niney explains. 'We used to work together. Whatever hit, we share. He make a song named "Macabee". I don't know if he never think the song was going to hit, but he sell it and the song hit. I decide I'm going to leave everything and do my own shit, so I just break off everything, cut everybody loose, come with "Blood And Fire" and open up the road.'

Though the Soul Syndicate was greatly changing the dominant sound by working with producers based in their vicinity, numerous other hits were created without their involvement. For instance Carl Dawkins, an emotional vocalist who drew from the style of Otis Redding, topped the charts in 1970 with the determined 'Satisfaction', recorded with the All Stars for Sir JJ, the producer who first recorded him in rock steady. At Tuff Gong studio Dawkins displays a restless, agitated energy as he briefly describes his career.

'I was born in 1948 in Spanish Town, grew up in East Kingston, Allman Town. I come from a musical family. My daddy, Joe Dawkins, was one of the first drummers in this country – he used to drum with Sonny Bradshaw and Baba Motta. Myself, Slim Smith and Jimmy Riley used to go to school together, and me and the Techniques were rehearsing. We was coming from the beach one day – matter of fact, we was going to smoke some herb behind Steel's Vehicle [garage] – go up Greenwich Farm and come up Orange Street, whole heap of crowd in this shop doorway at Orange Street and North Street, JJ Records. I go in and sing the two tunes, "Baby I Love You" and "Hard Times". Both sides hit, but them time money never pay, but me go through anyway, 'cause me love pretty clothes and 'nuff girls. After that, I stopped for a little while, because police them hold me up a camp for herb. When me come back, it's like the music a gwan all over the place, but me have some idea with the sound – me call it the heartbeat – so this song "Satisfaction" came about with the heartbeat. It was the shortest song in Jamaica, two and a half minutes. Jackie Jackson a play the bass, earth-shaking. Ken Boothe was on the road with "Freedom Street" and me bumped him off and take the whole thing over. I do "Get Together", it take off too. All the while me no have no money, but me still singing,'

**Val Douglas [David Katz]**

Derrick Harriott, too, reached number one in 1970 with the wah-wah-laden 'Psychedelic Train', featuring vocal quartet the Chosen Fewand backed by an emerging set of musicians called the Now Generation. 'We used to do all the Derrick Harriott stuff,' bassist Val Douglas says in his adopted home of New York. A tall, light-skinned, courteous man, Douglas says the group was formed in the late 1960s while its members were still at school. A number of musicians drifted in and out, including Augustus Pablo on keyboards, Ernest Wilson on guitar, singers William 'Bunny Rugs' Clarke and Keith and Tex, and drummer Lloyd Tin Legs' Adams. 'Before Tin Legs left, he was the first person who took me into the studio, about late '69. Ernest was still playing too. I don't remember the name of the singer, but I know it was a redo of a Lloyd Price tune called "Just Because".' At this time the group was resident at a club called the Stables on Kingston's bustling Red Hills Road.

The group eventually centred on Douglas and guitarist Mikey Chung, with Mikey's brother Geoffrey handling arrangements and some keyboard parts; Earl 'Wire' Lindo was often on organ. 'Now Gen was another part of the Jamaica legacy,' says Robbie Lyn, who moonlighted with the group in the studio while he was a member of rival club act In Crowd, 'because Now Gen had a unique sound in reggae music, made a lot of hit songs. The funny thing about the Now Generation arrangement was that their drummer, who played in the night-times, had a day job he didn't want to give up, so for the recordings they used Mikey Boo, who was In Crowd's drummer. Myself and Mikey Boo would be In Crowd, but we were with Now Gen in the studio.'

Now Generation's calm yet confident studio sound, centring on Douglas' solid bass lines, Richards' understated drumming and Mikey Chung's rock-inspired guitar, graced many of Derrick Harriott's biggest hits in the early 1970s, including the Chosen Few's take _of_ Isaac Hayes' 'Shaft'. They were also responsible for some of the most noteworthy numbers produced by Joe Gibbs, Lee Perry and Harry J. In 1972 they backed Dennis Brown's smash 'Baby Don't Do It' and the popular 'Things In Life' for Lloyd Daley, but because of disputes they were dismissed as the 'John Crow Generation' on one of Daley's instrumentals.

**Moonlighter: Mikey 'Boo' Richards [David Katz]**

Dennis Brown began his recording career in the late 1960s; Derrick Harriott was grooming the young singer for stardom, but Brown came to prominence at Studio One. 'I'm the first one who recorded Dennis Brown,' Harriott states with pride. 'The song was "Lips Of Wine", but it was called "Obsession" before. Around the same time he did "Changing Times" for me, the original was Roman Stewart and Dave Robinson. Dennis used to rehearse at the back of my shop at King Street with Junior Murvin and sometimes Horace Andy - he was one of my artists, too, with "Lonely Woman". I brought back [the Van Dykes'] "No Man Is An Island" from America, teach Dennis Brown the words and everything, but I left to America for a little while and when I came back he went and did it for Coxsone.' The hit was backed by the Soul Defenders, a group from the country town of Linstead that recorded sporadically at Studio One; their leader, a guitarist known as 'Jah Privy', imparted a country feel to their sound through a particular picking style.

Dennis Brown and Horace Andy were two of the most significant artists to arrive at Studio One in the early 1970s. Brown was another child star following in the footsteps of Delroy Wilson and Errol Dunkley; his father, Arthur, was a popular actor of some social standing, but Dennis was raised by his mother in the ghetto. In 1966, at the age of ten, he appeared at the West Kingston Charity Ball at the National Arena, and supported Miriam Makeba and Adam Wade shortly afterwards; he also appeared at the 'Smashville 68' concert with King Curtis, Johnny Nash and the Sweet Inspirations. Brown passed through the Falcons before fronting Soul Syndicate on live performances around the time of his debut single for Studio One. As George Fullwood remembers, 'Falcons was a group with Dennis Brown, Cynthia Richards, Noel Brown and Pat Satchmo. They call me to play bass for them, and Leroy Horsemouth was the drummer.'

'Dennis Brown was our main vocalist,' Tony Chin adds. 'The first vocalist we did have in Syndicate was Cleon Douglas, then he left and we have a brother named Donovan Carless as the lead vocalist and a guy named Ferris, two lead vocalists to go round the clubs and do cover songs. Donovan Carless used to sing in a group called the Little Roys. We'd say he was an uptown guy. Donovan fall out after about two or three years. Dennis Brown was just a little youth, he did have this song named "No Man Is An Island" out, then Dennis Brown came as a lead vocalist.'

**Crown Prince Dennis Brown [Beth Lesser]**

Despite his youth, Brown had an incredibly rich vocal tone. At Studio One he recorded mostly cover versions and love songs, but began to cut socially conscious material after returning to work with Derrick Harriott in 1972. Songs like 'Concentration,' 'He Can't Spell' and 'Changing Times' from the _Super Reggae And Soul Hits_ album are evidence of a new maturity.

Horace Andy has a very individual vocal style, a quavering soprano that, once heard, can never be forgotten. He was born Horace Hinds, but renamed Andy by Coxsone in deference to Bob Andy. At the offices of his management in London Horace says he was raised mostly by his mother, a store clerk, in the East Kingston community of Allman Town, but notes that he also spent time with his father, a carpenter, in Jones Town. His debut recording, 'Black Man's Country', was cut for Phil Pratt around 1966. Horace says a friend named Ever, who wrote the song, heard him singing on the street, liked his voice and took him to Pratt, who recalls that the pair first tried to sing it as a duet.

Though Pratt says the song 'had a little impact at the time', Horace felt he needed to improve his skills. 'I couldn't sing,' he says modestly, 'so I had to start to learn to play the guitar and start to learn to sing. I practise for four years, then I decided to go to Studio One in 1970, because Studio One was the best. I record my first two songs, "Got To Be Sure" and "Something On My Mind". Leroy Sibbles was the head musician.'

The song that established Horace as a major star was 'Skylarking', a condemnation of the begging practised by Jamaica's youth. 'Living as a Rastafarian, you'r e going to be doing political songs all the time,' says Horace. 'Being a young man and being a Rastafarian, looking at the surroundings and what's happening, that's why I sing that song.' He first became conscious of Rastafari in his teens. 'From before I start sing, from I was eighteen years [old], I'm a Rastafarian. I used to go over Jones Town [where] you have Charter Fifteen of the Ethiopian World Federation, so from a young age I start to learn about consciousness, about the Father.'

Horace had significant hits for other producers in the early 1970s, including 'I'm Alright' for Keith Hudson, 'Lonely Woman' for Derrick Harriott and 'You Are My Angel' for Bunny Lee, but spent most _of_ his time at Studio One where he gained his most valuable experience. 'The time was good,' he consents readily. 'I learn a lot. I say Studio One was good elementary, high school, college, university: that's where I learn everything.'

One group that cut outstanding spiritual and social material at Studio One in the late sixties and early seventies was the Abyssmians, a trio who favoured minor key arrangements. Lead singer Bernard Collins returned to Kingston some years ago after a long period abroad; he was raised in the capital, but as a young man spent six years in Saint Catherine while his mother was working in London. Collins formed the Abyssinians in 1968 with Donald Manning, adding Donald's brother Lynford shortly afterwards; Lynford was then a member of Carlton and the Shoes, a popular Studio One act led by his older brother Carlton. Collins says he hooked up with Donald through the encouragement of a mutual friend and mentor. 'Lloyd Thompson, he's more than just a friend, he's like a brother and sometimes even a father. He knew Donald Manning's involvement in the music as a guy who always wanted to sing and strum his guitar. He introduce me to Donald, and I and Donald started to learn together. We sit together at nights and try to create something, until "Satta Massa Ganna" came out. Lynford already sing before with Carlton and the Shoes on songs like "Love Me Forever", and Lynford came in and sang the harmony of "Satta Massa Ganna" and decided he would sing with us from there on. But the whole vibes of the Abyssinians was really between me and Donald.'

**The Abyssinians [urbanimage.tv/Adrian Boot]**

'Satta Massa Ganna' was a momentous debut recording, cut at Studio One in 1969 with plenty of Rasta burru drumming from Bongo Herman and Bongo Les. Thematically related to a Carlton and the Shoes number called 'Happy Land' (the B-side of hit ballad 'Love Me Forever'), 'Satta Massa Ganna' spoke of a Utopian resting-place for the black faithful and used Amharic salutations to the Almighty to drive home its Rastafarian ideals. 'In those days we used to be closely involved with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church,' Collins explains. 'My brethren Donald was a foundation man of the Church, he used to communicate with Ethiopia and actually get books from Ethiopia with Amharic language and interpretation back into English. The whole concept is from the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, coming up in caves, climbing up on rocks, to go there and worship and pray.'

The tune's original issue as 'Far Far Away' was not particularly successful, but when the song was recut as 'Satta Massa Ganna' in 1971 on the group's Clinch label it began to pick up steam. It has since become one of the most-versioned songs ever recorded in Jamaica, and an all-time Rasta anthem. That same year Coxsone issued the anthem-like 'Declaration Of Rights,' which called for self-determination in the black populace; another oft-versioned number with a great Sibbles bass line, for which Collins says they were paid 'seventeen bucks for the tune'. Determined to concentrate on their own productions, but typically short of finance, the Abyssinians continued sporadically cutting spiritual and cultural sides in the early reggae period; 'Yin Mas Gan', done for Lloyd Daley in late 1972, was a notable example.

Another significant Studio One act of the period was the Wailing Souls, one of West Kingston's finest harmony groups. Though the act was known by different names and its membership fluctuated at several key moments, the partnership of Winston 'Pipe' Matthews and Lloyd 'Bread' McDonald remained at the core.

'Growing up in the ghetto of Trench Town, there was so much music round us,' says Pipe at home in Los Angeles. 'I born in Trench Town, 1949, grew up at 6 First Street. My grandmother was a office maid at the Ministry of Supplies and my uncles were port workers. As a youth I used to do a lot of singing – like in the evening the older guys would have a talent parade in the yard, and I would win the dollar every evening. Them time I was around eight, nine, ten. I used to sing foreign songs mostly, like "Mexican Divorce". This guy said, "You'r e really the Pied Piper, 'cause people have to listen to you when they hear your voice", so from that they call I Pipe.'

'Growing up in Trench Town, you can't get away from music,' confirms Bread. 'I was born in Trench Town inna the early fifties. When I was about three years old my parents migrated, so I was raised by my grandmother and some uncles and aunts. My grandmother came from Westmoreland, so she had her skills – she would make starch and sell it. At a very early age I fell in love with music – couldn't sleep unless I was hearing music. Sometimes I even used to go and wash my face so I could listen to the top ten. My grandfather used to have a mento band in those days, and they used to play at bars and likkle public functions. As far back as I can remember, a guitar was always in the home. Listening to the music on the radio, I start mimicking singers like the Temptations, the Impressions, Sam Cooke. You also used to get Elvis Presley and even country and western.' How did he come by his nickname? Bread explains: ''Cause we inna the ghetto, we change everything around – you have a English saying, it's like "a piece of cake", so if something is easy we say it's "a piece of bread". So that's how I really get the name Bread.'

**Pipe and Bread [Rick Ribble]**

As a singer with an easily identified high C tenor, Pipe made a natural leader for the budding group. He was also the first to gain concrete experience, having made his recording debut before reaching adolescence. ' "Little Dilly", that was my first song,' he says in a raspy tone far lower than his singing voice. 'At the age of ten-and-a-half to eleven, I did that as the Schoolboys with another Trench Town youth, Colin Johnson. I wrote the song and used to sing in class every Friday. A friend was living downtown, and he said, "You supposed to can record that song - I know a man where I can carry you go to." So one evening me and him went down by Prince Buster's record shop, and two days after, we did the song at Federal. We did a couple more tunes with him, but after ["Little Dilly"] get popular, my partner's father said that he had other things for him to do. We had done a couple shows together in the city, but in Montego Bay at the Palladium Theatre I did that show by myself and that was when I really proved myself. Jimmy Cliff, the Blues Busters, a lot of the top guys were on the bill and they all congratulated me afterwards. After my partner fell out I wasn't doing any singing - I was just dealing with school. But at evening time, we would sit down amongst the rest of the guys and practise. Then we form the group.'

'Trench Town is a place that is really known for singers,' Bread continues at an animated pace, 'and in those days you had people like Joe Higgs, Alton Ellis, Lascelles Perkins, and then you also had young groups coming up, like the Wailers. Coming from school in the evening, we naturally go play cricket and soccer 'cause we had a park right by where we live on First Street. And most of the time, Ken Boothe and most of the other professional singers in the area who were coming up, they would gather right in front _of_ the park, so when we finish playing soccer or cricket we younger guys used to just [go] right into the government yard, into the kitchen where those guys would be rehearsing, and pretty soon we start join in the background, like a choir. Trench Town is a place like that: when somebody start sing, pretty soon you see all ten people gather round and start singing too, provide background vocal for an established singer. So we started doing that – me, Pipe, George "Buddy" Haye, and a next brethren called "Saboo", who is Oswald Downer, and "Fats", he is Norman Davis, he sing in a group before he came to us called the Tennors, and then you have Vision Walker, a cousin of Rita Marley who in and out of the Wailers – it's just like one big family. People start to recognize us, and then it got to the point wherein people couldn't even tell when the professional guys were there from when we were there.'

Bread says it was unexpected session work that sparked the group's first official incarnation around 1965. 'Ainsley Folder, one of these elder guys that always hear us singing, he worked at Federal records as an accountant. They know he's from Trench Town, and that's where the singers are from, so if they need any background vocals for any of their artists they usually contact him. Federal was the biggest recording studio in the Caribbean at that time, had all the latest equipment. It so happens that this Englishwoman called Pam Blythe, in those days she was one of Jamaica's top female vocalists. She was doing some songs and she wanted some singers, but at that time wre never even had a name. Ainsley came and say, "Guys, I got a job for you." We went and did two songs with her – one was "Somewhere My Love", I think that was the title song from the movie _Doctor Zhivago._ It was me, Pipe, Buddy and a brethren called Rupert Edwards – he wasn't a professional singer, but he lived in Trench Town. We did those songs in the morning, and by the next day the song was on the radio because Federal was so big. It was a number one song, so they said, "You guys need a name." We consider ourselves rebels, so we came up with the name the Renegades. Right after that, Ainsley came and say, "Ernest Ranglin's doing an album and they want you guys to do the background vocals", so we went as the Renegades, but this time it was just myself, Pipe and Buddy. That was how we, as a group, really get started.'

The group then cut a handful of sides for Federal. 'Because they were so impressed with us we did a little recording contract, but there wasn't no lawyer or nothing involved. Not even our parents were there, and all of us was under-age – that's how it was in those days.' Most of the resultant material, like 'Lost Love', 'Why Make Me Cry' and 'Too Young To Fall In Love', consisted of ballads of young romance and heartache, delivered in an R&B style; 'Hot Hops' was a depiction of the street toughs' preference for warm beer.

Generally wary of the music business, the Renegades disbanded when other commitments became more important to them. 'We grow up under all those artists and we sit down and listen to their horror stories, so we say we nah go make any producer exploit we. About the same time Buddy started going to art school – that was one of the main reason also why we take a break. He said he's not going to have too much time for rehearsal and he want to penetrate him art. Then I was a great cricketer, play for the Jamaica schoolboy all-schools cricket team, and that used to take up a lot of my time.'

However, as the 1970s approached and the reggae sound began to consolidate, Pipe and Bread felt an urge to re-form their group. 'Me and Pipe wanted to find a third singer to make up for Buddy's spot,' Bread recalls, 'so we actually was using Delroy Wilson's younger brother Errol – everybody call him Batman. He was a great singer and songwriter, and he could play drums. Bob [Marley] was even thinking of him being his drummer before Bob had his musicians together. We started rehearsing as a trio, but in Trench Town you have a lot of bad – you have a lot of gun play and it's a thin line...' Such unsavoury ways led to Batman being ejected from the group; shortly afterwards he immortalized himself in song on the Slickers' 'Johnny Too Bad', the ultimate rude boy homage.

Soon the group expanded into a quartet, and a renewed closeness with the Wailers was reflected in its being christened the Wailing Souls. 'When we find that it wasn't happening with Batman, we get Saboo and Fats, and that's how the original Wailing Souls were really born. Fats sing almost a baritone, Saboo the falsetto harmony. We were always close friends with Bob and Peter and Bunny, we were like their younger brothers, so you find we a move with them real tight. Spiritually we check the Bible, and we like the character John the Baptist, who they say was the soul crying in the wilderness. Then when we see that the Wailers was there and the Soulettes, we were thinking of just one family, so we figure say the Wailing Souls. We went to the Matador, because him was a sound man, come from the ghetto, like some roots man – a young guy too, and he start to do some nice shots, like "Bongo Nyah".'

Their debut for Matador was 'Gold Digger', which caused controversy due to its street-slang reference to women's private parts. 'It was banned in Jamaica,' laughs Bread, 'because we use a term, "nusnay". We only end up doing one song for Lloyd, 'cause the other song was "Back Out With It", but them days we say "Back Out Wicked", and every word come like them so dangerous: "You say you love, when you know say your heart is like a poison dart, back out wicked, your days are numbered", so he figure it too heavy.'

'His wife didn't like the words,' clarifies Pipe, 'so I change it and we went to Mr Dodd. Mr Dodd was the most current producer, put out shots after shots, so we did an audition and Mr Dodd wanted us to come record. We went back and did "Row Fisherman Row", "Back Out With It" and "Mr Fire Coal Man", those three songs first.' All were significant hits in Jamaica which did much to establish the group's reputation; in particular, 'Mr Fire Coal Man' was noted for its original lyrics and unique sound effects.

'The first song that I really sing lead on was "Mr Fire Coal Man",' notes Bread. 'Growing up in Trench Town, there's always a lot of emergency vehicles going by, fire truck and ambulance, 'cause things always happening bad and fire always a burn. Inna them days, we a deal with consciousness of black people. From an early age we know about Rasta, we know about black solidarity and oppression and righteousness, so we always try and make songs to reflect them type of things. We always look 'pon things in a certain way, 'cause them say Jesus Christ speak in parables, and I and I [we] make songs whe you have to read between the lines, 'cause [in] "Mr Fire Coal Man" we a talk about black man, 'cause we figure say the black man rise up and come and do him work, 'cause fire coal is black. Although you hear the sound of a siren, a fire engine type of thing, if you check the lyrics it's not [about] that.' Bread further notes that responsibility for the siren sound lay with Errol Dunkley, who pressed the session guitarist's effects pedal at specific intervals; he also says Jackie Mittoo was featured on much of their Studio One material. 'He was in Canada, but Jackie used to come to Jamaica regular still.'

In their brief period at Studio One the Wailing Souls cut dozens of original songs, typically credited to the Classics on release. Pipe has also spoken of cover tunes that Dodd asked him to record, including his sensitive rendition of the Wailers' 'Sun Is Shining'. Though Pipe's voice held certain echoes of Bob Marley's style, the cover also hinted at the intense closeness between the two groups in this era. When the Wailers and their manager, noted footballer Alan 'Skill' Cole, established the independent Tuff Gong in 1971, the Wailing Souls were part of it; their songs 'Harbour Shark' and 'Back Biter', which both attacked self-centred greed, were issued on the label, credited to Pipe and the Pipers. As Bread notes, 'The first two records that come on Tuff Gong was "Trench Town Rock" and "Harbour Shark" – that was the same session at Dynamics. We let go Studio One now, and then we and Bob start record and start really get tighter than we were before. Saboo got one of the government houses, right there on First Street in Trench Town, and that became the rehearsal house, and that's the house that "Trench Town Rock" was made in. We sung on the song in the studio and "Back Biter" was done at the same session. Bob later did "Baby We'v e Got A Date" on the same rhythm. Me and Pipe do background vocals for Bob [on] a lot of them tune there, like "Redder Than Red" and "Lick Samba", along with Peter and Bunny them. Peter Tosh used to did some separate works with Joe Gibbs, like "Here Comes The Judge" – that's me and Peter and Pipe and Vision. In Saboo's house Bob them started getting instruments, but police raid the house one day and w7e run, and they took out the equipment and we never got them back. Sometimes police raid, because we smoke weed, and Peter lose a lot of guitar like that – we have to throw the guitar over the wall and the neck break. Whole heap of things we have to go through them days.'

Though their music was somewhat out of step with the love songs that were still dominating the charts, the rise _of_ groups like the Abyssinians, Wailing Souls and Burning Spear pointed the wTay towards the spiritual and political focus of the approaching roots reggae period. Winston Rodney, the man who became Jamaica's Burning Spear after adopting the popular name of Kenyan freedom fighter Jomo Kenyatta, wrote some of the era's most outstanding material. His unblemished career has lasted to the present day, when he is enjoying a growing international popularity based on an impressive body of recorded work and arresting live performances.

Rodney was born in the small coastal town of Saint Anne's Bay in 1948. 'My mother was in the food business,' he explains at his present base in Queens, New York. 'She was doing food for people on construction [jobs], and my father was a man who believe in his little farming, raising chickens.' Rodney had a variety of unsatisfying jobs before being directed to Studio One by Bob Marley in 1969. 'At one time I was learning mechanic trade, another time I was cleaning clothes,' he recalls. 'I happened to meet Bob In Saint Anne's , 'cause Bob is from Saint Anne's too, and he told I I should check Studio One. I went there and sing my song – I think Heptones did involve in the audition. The following day we start to record.'

**Burning Spear [Dave Hendley]**

The fiery 'Door Peep', Burning Spear's debut, created an immediate impact through its melodic individuality, with shifts from major to minor keys adding an ominous feel. 'I think "Door Peep" create a newness musically in Studio One,' Rodney emphasizes. 'When I went there and do my thing, the music wasn't in that flavour or arrangement, so I think I bring a newness at that time.'

Rodney says he was joined on 'Door Peep' and a handful of other early works by the deep harmony of Rupert Willington, an aspiring singer who accompanied him to the Studio One audition. 'He was a young man who grow up in the same town where I'm coming from,' Rodney explains. 'We never used to associate until after [I was] singing, and sometimes he's going by and he involve in what I was doing, and I happens to like his tone, so we did those few singles together for Studio One, and that was about it with me and him.'

First as part of this initial duo, and later as a solo artist, in the early 1970s, Burning Spear recorded a series of stupendous singles for Studio One, mostly with historical and religious themes; two excellent albums, _Burning Spear_ and _Rocking Time,_ were also issued before he left the label in late 1974. Spear's Studio One material is rightly regarded as classic, and its individuality is highly inspiring. For instance, the single 'New Civilization', with its military snare rolls, bubbling organ and jazzy vocal arrangements, sounds definitely different from the style of his contemporaries. Rodney describes its lyrics as prophetic: 'Sometimes you feel the things what going to take place before it even take place,' he explains, 'sometimes you see things ahead of time. So what I was singing about, that is exactly what is taking place now: a new civilization.'

_Of_ equal importance were the songs that worked to heighten the profile of the Rastafari faith in Jamaican music, such as the chugging 'Ethiopians Live It Out' and the prayer-like 'Zion Higher'. As Rodney reasons, 'We all born as Rasta, and it was a good experience, knowing that I could identify myself within the roots and culture and the history and the livity [the Rastafarian way of life]. You hear it in the music: all of us was free to express that, and I wasn't the only one expressing that. After a while, everyone was expressing Rastafari within the music and through the music, and that became a strong part of Jamaica's music also – nobody didn't present no form of opposition to that.'

Providing the beat behind such work was Leroy 'Horsemouth' Wallace, then the resident drummer at Studio _One._ He currently lives in an odd property development on the outskirts of Spanish Town; though described as a 'gated' community with twenty-four-hour security, the contractors never completed the gate, so the security is non-existent. Horsemouth's dwelling has no visible number, but the sound of Burning Spear blasting from a row of speaker boxes advertises his presence. He says his playing style was greatly influenced by African-Jamaican folk rhythms. 'I was born in Three Mile in 1947. My grandmother lived down in Trench Town at 7 White Street, which is walking distance. She was a healer, sees inside of your soul. Where I'm from, we'v e got a lot of culture, like Junkanoo, Pocomania, and I was already playing Pocomania drums for my grandmother when I was very young. Drumming was a very deeply inflicted thing in me.'

Leroy says he joined the Alpha school band at the age of six. 'My mother sell fish on the street. She was very poor and she couldn't afford me, and my father wasn't interested. Alpha Boys' School, it was different. Coming from a poor family in the ghetto, you move to this big dormitory of six hundred kids. They give you a white people's God and you see statues of Mary. I go out with Alpha band in the space of two weeks.' But he ran into trouble with the disciplinarian regime and was expelled. 'I leave Alpha when I was maybe fourteen. Sister run me out of the school because I was not getting conformed to the system. Sister give me a recommendation to go into the army, but I left straight down to where I'm from, 'cause I was tired of conforming] with colonization. My mother live at 202 Spanish Town Road, right beside Excelsior biscuit factory, but it was very hard for me the first two years I leave Alpha. I didn't know how to cope with the outside world after spending almost twelve years in a institution. My mother chase me out right away, so I used to stay at the Silver Dollar club, where they gamble twenty-four hours. That's on East Queen Street past the Central Police Station, and there's a whorehouse there at High Holborn Street.'

Horsemouth reveals that he found his way into recording studios because of his printing skills rather than his musical talent. 'I learn three trade at Alpha: printing, music and tile making. I used to work at West Indies Records before it become Dynamic Sounds to print labels, leave and go to Coxsone and do printing. They didn't know I'm a drummer.' Fil Callender was still Studio One's resident drummer then. 'He's from Cayman Islands,' Horsemouth says, 'and he had a good Latin beat. He plays on some of the songs on _Heptones On Top,_ but there was a lot of good drummers like Bunny Williams and Joe Isaacs – he was there before Fil. One day Fil didn't turn up and it was a blessing for me. I went in the drum booth and Sylvan Morris, the engineer, didn't see me go inside. I start to play and it sound so good, everybody think Fil is there. When I come out, "Horsemouth, you was playing drums?" Coxsone comes in the evening and the engineer tell him, "Horsemouth play drums on those songs – the printer play better than Fil", so he make Fil play guitar and I becomes the resident drummer from that day, play on Wailing Souls, Larry Marshall, and I'm the one who take Dennis Brown to the studio. All this Burning Spear, three persons play: Fil [guitar], Bagga [bass] and Horsemouth play the drums.'

**Pocomaniac: Leroy 'Horsemouth' Wallace at home [David Katz]**

Horsemouth was also building a reputation on the live scene, though his tendency to get involved in conflict sometimes got in the way. For instance, after he joined Soul Syndicate he was jailed for protesting against the Shearer government's banning of Walter Rodney, a lecturer at the University of the West Indies' Mona campus. Rodney, a Guyanese Marxist who stressed the potential of Rastafari to aid the struggle against imperialism in the Caribbean, was deemed a security threat and was therefore refused entry to Jamaica on his way back from a black writers' conference in Montreal. 'On 28 October 1968, there was a big riot in Kingston,' Horsemouth recalls. 'Dr Rodney and [the boxer] Mohammed Ali was supposed to come to Jamaica and they banned him at the airport, and everybody make a protest. It was a black demonstration, and they start to burn Kingston. I get charged for stone throwing, and Mr Fullwood come bail me – I really appreciate that.

'Santa went with Mr Fullwood's band and I went to the Mighty Vikings', he continues, 'but those jobs were like ten dollars a night. I was travelling with Byron Lee's band one time, Kes Chin and them was talking about "blacks from the ghetto", and I didn't like that. I figure I didn't fit in and I wait 'til they reach Ocho Rios, just opt out, give them back their shirts for the band uniform, and I sit down at Jack Ruby's and smoke a draw, eat fish and went back to Kingston.'

Ruby, aka Lawrence Lindo, then operated a highly popular sound system. 'He was real roots,' Horsemouth states. 'He would play in the ghetto for roots people, bringing up Jamaican music. He used to live in Greenwich Farm first, with Jack Ruby's Hi Fi, but after the mid-sixties Greenwich Farm, Jones Town and all those areas get real violent. People start to come from country and the environment start to get spoiled. It got broken down by bad people from evil areas – that goes on from the city all over the world.'

**David Madden [David Katz]**

Part of what made Burning Spear's 'Door Peep' so striking was its spectacular horn riff provided by saxophonist Cedric Brooks and trumpeter David Madden, the duo otherwise known as Im and David. Previously, the Studio One horn section had featured saxophonist Glen DaCosta and trombonist Vin 'Don Drummond Junior' Gordon. All but Brooks would eventually be active in the experimental jazz-reggae group Zap Pow, and all four were ex-Alpha boys. 'I was raised in Gordon Town,' says David Madden at his home in a quiet uptown cul-de-sac. 'There was a storm in 1951 and my mother couldn't manage things – she sent me to Alpha Boys. Me and Im went to Alpha together. He went to the military band, [I] came in after. When he left the military band, he went down to [a] hotel [on the] North Coast, and then he went to the States and started to go into jazz. During that time I left the army, played in several bands. In 1969 I was playing at this little place in New Kingston with Nancy Wilson. Jesse Ferguson and the Outer Limits, a group from the States – they had one song on the charts, "Putting It On, Taking It Off, one of them American Gospel spiritual things – they came to Jamaica and heard me playing. Their trumpet player would be drafted into the army, so they invited me to Las Vegas for four months. Reggae was just about budding now, and Cedric came home. I hear everybody talking about Cedric Brooks, so we got linked up and started to go down to Coxsone, because Glen [DaCosta] and Trommy [Vin Gordon] had left – that regular thing with Coxsone had broken up. Coxsone started to give us some tracks to play on: we play on Burning Spear's first time, with Ernest Ranglin playing guitar.'

In addition to backing other Studio One stars like the Heptones, Brooks and Madden cut several inspired instrumentals for Coxsone; they included the vibrant 'Money Maker', which rose high in the Jamaican charts in 1970. Shortly afterwards Brooks joined the ranks of Count Ossie's Mystic Revelation of Rastafari and Madden formed the first incarnation of Zap Pow. 'Me and Cedric put a group together called the Mystics. The group was going on fine, but Cedric was going off on his religious thing. He had gone to a couple of groundations [a Niyabinghi ceremony] with Count Ossie, playing saxophone. [Drummer] Danny Mowatt decided to come with me, and that was the birth of Zap Pow. We found [bassist] Mikey [Williams] and [guitarist] Dwight [Pinkney], starting this little piece of group together. There was one song that me and Cedric were introducing to Coxsone which was "Mystic Mood" [apparently based on an obscure French ballad set on an imaginary tropical island]. Coxsone had wanted to record it, but not the way that we had it. I think Mikey had had an experience with Coxsone that he didn't like, so we just went to Joe Gibbs' little house studio in Duhaney Park. The song became a hit: that is what catapult the group Zap Powr into anything.'

Like David Madden, Albert Griffiths of the Gladiators also remembers playing on some _of_ Burning Spear's Studio One material. 'I play with Burning Spear, back up Stranger Cole,' he notes proudly. 'Bagga was the bass man at Studio One, me was the rhythm guitarist. You have a brother there called David Brian, he went mad and dead. Benbow was the drummer and Pablove Black [aka Paul Dixon] was the keyboard player them time.' In the early 1970s the Gladiators were in a state of flux. By 1972 David Webber had been replaced by Clinton Fearon, a tall young man with a deep voice who wrote convincing religious material; he had previously been singing in an amateur trio that failed to pass an audition. 'I was playin' my guitar on my veranda one day, and Errol Grandison passed by and heard me playin' and singin',' Fearon states by e-mail from Seattle. 'We sing a few songs together and he informed me that they had lost a member and he think I would be perfect for the slot. A few days later he brought Albert by, and musically it was magical. The first song I recorded with the group was "Freedom Train" and "Rockaman Soul" for Lloyd Daley. At that time it was Albert Griffiths, Errol Grandison and myself.'

Errol Grandison was next to leave the group. 'Errol tell me that I was doing foolishness,' Griffiths recalls, 'because inna those days you sing and you'r e not getting any money, and he have him woman and pickney [children] to mind. Me and Clinton get it going with "Sonia" and all them songs there.' 'We did a song named "Sonia" for Coxsone,' Fearon picks up. 'It was Albert, myself and this girl. I seem to remember her name was Beverley, and we did maybe one or two more songs [together].'

**Clinton Fearon [Inye Wokoma]**

'After, it was me and Clinton Fearon,' continues Griffiths, 'but we decide that two of us kind of unbalanced. Gal-limore Sutherland was with me all the time doing building work, so we bring in Galli-more to be the third man.' Sutherland's command of the upper register completed the picture, giving the trio a warm, harmonic whole.

Griffiths and Fearon were regular Studio One session musicians in the early 1970s. Fearon began on guitar, but turned out to be a great bass player. 'Gladiators did employ as the backing band for Studio One artists,' Griffiths notes. 'We go to Studio One to record a song named "Selassie Bandsman" by a group named the Manchesters. I was playing the bass and Clinton Fearon was playing the lead guitar, but he couldn't manage it, so I give him the bass, and from that day he begin to play him bass.' The group remained solidly at Studio One as vocalists and backing musicians until late 1974, when they branched off to work for other producers.

Though the Gladiators had an unseen hand in shaping the form of the music emanating from Brentford Road, their greatest contribution in the early 1970s, like that of their peers Burning Spear and the Abyssinians, was aiding the shift of focus at Studio One. On songs that spoke of spiritual devotion blossoming in a land plagued by social injustice these artists helped to usher in the format later designated as 'roots', whilst Soul Syndicate and Now Generation were responsible for the dominant musical backing utilized by other producers. In the same era, a number of significant changes to the reggae form arose from experimentation in the camp of Coxsone's traditional rival on Bond Street.

**CHAPTER SIX**

[Merry Up: Deejay, Dub   
and Other Innovations](Davi_solidfou_9781596918269_epub_part6.html#d41151211)

_A deejay is just a person who talks over the mike, puts records on and reads the invitation where the next dance is going to keep. Who could ever tell that this thing would ever reach like this, people having number one on the chart!_

U Roy

_The bass and drum is the key to any music, and the rest of the stuff is just spice._

Fully Fullwood

DUKE REID MAY have ruled the rock steady era, but with reggae material he was largely in Coxsone's shadow. Left behind by the changes that swept through Jamaican music, he was somehow unable to get his head around the new reggae style that had arrived in 1968 and, as the form evolved, Duke gradually lost touch with his audience. The mutation _of_ the Supersonics to the All Stars made matters worse, and Reid had to borrow the talents of other producers to find a hit. Lee Perry assisted him with 'Lockjaw', a 1969 organ instrumental with a shouted introduction by Dave Barker, but Perry says that, symbolically, Reid was already in decline.

A major reversal of Duke's downturn came at the start of the 1970s, after he achieved an unexpected and unprecedented success with U Roy's amazing deejay discs. U Roy at Treasure Isle simply redefined the role of the deejay, with major consequences. Not only did the deejay's increased status inordinately change the shape of Jamaican popular music, but the revolution started by the innovations that U Roy voiced at Treasure Isle would ultimately help spawn rap in America – and rap, of course, is now one of the most popular music genres all over the world.

U Roy was not, however, the first Jamaican deejay to appear on records. There had been a few instances of deejays briefly breaking the monotony of a ska instrumental with exciting, Africanized whelps and peculiar vocal interjections, most notably Count Sticky on the Skatalites' 'Guns _Of_ Navarone' and 'Ball _Of_ Fire'. In 1967 Sir Lord Comic went one step further with slowly drawling toasts on 'Ska-ing West' and 'The Great Wuga Wuga'; but, though these highly popular songs were pioneering attempts to extend a deejay's chatter throughout an entire rhythm, in truth Comic sounds awkward and out of time, his delivery little more than a series of proverbs and gimmicky quotations carelessly thrown together.

More substantial deejay hits came with the arrival of reggae in 1968, though the vocal input was always fairly limited. The first to gain popularity was King Stitt's wild 'Fire Corner' for Clancy Eccles; 'Herbman Shuffle', recorded for Linford Anderson, also had a shouted introduction and plenty of vocal sound effects to emphasize the song's pro-ganja message. I was the one who put King Stitt on "Herbman Shuffle",' Anderson proudly recalls. 'If you listen to the record, I'm also talking on there – you can hear my voice along with King Stitt.' The wacky 'Pop A Top', voiced by Anderson under the alias Andy Capp, was another early quirky deejay disc. On this one Anderson attempted to mimic the bubbling sound featured on an advertisement for Canada Dry ginger ale over an adaptation of a popular New Orleans rhythm and blues number. 'I did "Pop A Top", the first talking record in Jamaica – you can put that in any book. I heard the commercial – the guy said "Pop A Top". Then I had this rhythm, "South Parkway Mambo", a very old song by Dave Bartholomew. The instrumental version I was trying to re-create didn't work, so we didn't touch that tape for years. One day I got it out, Lloyd Charmers started playing "pup pup pup, pup pup pup" [on the organ], so I said, "Oh, Pop A Top!" That's how that song came about. The tune became a big hit, so eventually we had about thirteen different versions of it.'

These discs all hinted at the broader potential of toasting as deejays gradually made longer appearances on record, but the true limits of the form were not realized on disc until Daddy U Roy stepped up to the microphone at Treasure Isle. In 1970, U Roy achieved the seemingly impossible hat-trick of scoring the top three records on both Jamaican radio charts; all of them featured his fluid, continuous toasting over Duke Reid's rock steady rhythms. The deejay daddy, who remains entirely humble despite his great achievements, was keen to point out that no one was more surprised by the success of the discs than himself: 'I didn't think that something like this would ever happen, and that it would still be going on until now. At the time it was like a joke! A deejay is just a person who comes to a dance, he talks over the mike and puts records on and reads the invitation where the next dance is going to keep. Who could ever tell that this thing would ever reach like this, people having number one on the chart!'

U Roy's love of music hit him hard at an early age. He relates that, by the time he was eleven, he was already a regular fixture at Kingston's sound system events. In the mid-sixties he began chatting on Sir Dickie's Dynamic, later switching to Sir George the Atomic and eventually settling by 1968 on the famed King Tubby's Home Town Hi-Fi set, operated by electronics technician and sometime Treasure Isle mastering engineer Osbourne Ruddock in the Penwood area of the Water-house ghetto in Western Kingston.

Ruddock's nickname stemmed from Tubman, his mother's maiden name. He founded his sound system in 1958 at the age of seventeen, and was crowned 'King of the Dancehall' at an event in Penwood in the early 1960s, but Niney suggests that his set was initially a small concern affiliated to uptown venues. 'King Tubby used to have a likkle hi-fi that he played up Red Hills, play all about. There is certain little people follow him, not the rebel people those days, 'cause he have a hi-fi. Tubby used to tape songs off the radio, like certain time a night he plug in the radio station and play it back into his sound. I used to go when he's playing at Rockall – he have a crown on his head and his amplifier was a little baby amplifier.'

**U Roy the Originator [Beth Lesser]**

Fellow deejay Dennis Alcapone notes that U Roy's presence on Tubby's sound greatly established the toaster's reputation, partly because of the impact of the King's custom-built effects. 'King Tubby's was definitely the greatest sound ever to come out of Jamaica. You wouldn't listen to the other sounds, because they was just bringing out normal voices with normal bass. Duke Reid and Coxsone, their bass was heavy, but Tubby's bass was just so solid, and then he brought in reverb, which wasn't introduced to the public before – it was mind-blowing.'

Lloyd the Matador adds some details of Tubby's sound system reverb. 'Number 3 Tiverton Road was one of the most popular dancehalls in East Kingston. It was owned by Brown's Funeral Parlour - the owner would build and store coffins there and rent it out for dances. Some time in 1960, when my sound system was playing at 3 Tiverton Road, King Tubby came to the dance as an admirer of my sound. He asked if I could give him a circuit diagram for the reverb my sound was using, so I sat on one of the coffins that was in the yard, draw the circuit and gave Tubbys. That was the reverb that Tubbs built from my circuit diagram and used on his sound system for a long time.'

Bunny Lee says hearing U Roy live on King Tubby's sound was astounding because he toasted over exclusive mixes of hit songs with the vocals removed; Lee names this as the start of the 'version' phenomenon in which remixed instrumental B-sides began to appear in the late 1960s. He credits Rudolph 'Ruddy' Redwood, the financially solvent owner of sound system Supreme Ruler of Sound, as the developer of this form. Lee likes to say that Ruddy's development was a 'mistake', but the way he describes it the experimentation seems to have been quite deliberate.

'The first man who really start version by mistake is a man from Spanish Town named Ruddy, another wealthy man who can help himself. Him inna racehorses and have him record shop and a big club 'cross Fort Henderson, so when him come a Duke Reid and Coxsone, them give him any tape him want. One evening them a cut dub plate – soft wax they used to call it. When them cut, it's difficult to put in the voice, and Smithy [Treasure Isle engineer Byron Smith] a go stop it and Ruddy say, "No, make it run." When it done, him say it art, and me and Tubbys stand up right there so, me look 'pon Tubbys and Tubbys look 'pon me.

'Saturday night him drop the singing cut first and the deejay name Wassy said, "I'm going to play part two!" and the whole dancehall start to sing the song pon the pure rhythm – him have to play it about ten, fifteen times because it's something new. I say, "Boy Tubbs, you see the mistake whe Smithy make? A serious thing!. The people a Spanish Town love it! You have to start do something like that."

'Tubby's just a bang on to U Roy. U Roy come in and say, "Part two, another version" on "Too Proud To Beg" with Slim Smith, a so the name version come in. When it start, you hear Slim Smith start to sing and then you hear the voice gone! Then you hear him come in again, and you hear U Roy talk, "Love the life you live and live the life you love, here come the brother Slim Smith again, tell them", and a man say, "Boy, Tubbys have amplifier that can take out the voice and play pure rhythm." Little did them know that's how the dub make out. There goes version now, and everybody wants it 'pon them record.'

**The immortal King Tubby**

It is worth pointing out that rhythm tracks had already been used for more than one purpose before Ruddy and Tubby's experiments. At Studio One in 1965, for instance, Roland Alphonso blew sax on a song called 'Pdnky Dink', using the rhythm of Lee Perry and the Dynamites' 'Hold Down' with the vocals removed. However, the standard practice of 'version' B-sides being constructed from customized rhythm tracks clearly follows from the legendary 1968 Treasure Isle soft wax session described above. The rise of version would ultimately pave the way for the experimental contours of dub, in which previously recorded songs would be remixed to emphasize drum and bass, and would also make greater space for deejays to appear on record, particularly after U Roy showed what could be done with the form.

By the end of the 1960s U Roy's verbal prowess saw him lured to the studio by dental technician and aspiring producer Keith Hudson, who was then on the verge of success with Ken Boothe's broken-hearted love song 'Old Fashioned Way'. The producer cut U Roy over this rhythm, but test pressings bewildered radio station personnel and their negative reaction caused Hudson to leave the song unissued for a long time. U Roy's next recording, 'Rightful Ruler', cut under Lee 'Scratch' Perry's direction, was a highly radical religious toast that celebrated Roy's belief in the Rastafari faith. Set to Niyabinghi hand drumming by Count Ossie, with the toaster's grave chanting of Psalm One spurred on by fervent shouts from Peter Tosh, the disc failed to capture the public's imagination at its time of issue. These tunes, says U Roy, 'didn't get very far', selling only 'a couple hundred' on release.

Success was finally achieved when Duke Reid placed the toaster over older material, resulting in new mutations of much-loved hits from the rock steady period. 'When I started working for Duke, my first songs were 'Wake The Town And Tell The People", "Rule The Nation" and "Wear You To The Ball". From "Wear You To The Ball" it just broke the place right up,' the toaster beams. 'I had number one, two and three on the chart, on two radio stations for six weeks, and I had one tune at number one for twelve weeks. I just couldn't believe it.'

'Wake The Town' and 'Rule The Nation' were little more than invitations from U Roy for dancers to strut their stuff, with the previous vocal tracks removed to make way for the toaster's reverb-laden chat. But 'Wear You To The Ball' set a precedent by retaining fragments of the Paragons' vocal; this allowed U Roy to frame his toast around the message of the original hit, drawing deeper recognition from those who loved the ordinary vocal cut. This was the format that wrould be most lasting in Jamaica, and would find greater resonance in the construction of American rap music towards the end of the 1970s.

Despite Duke's blanket ban on lyrics expressing Rasta sentiment U Roy stayed within the Treasure Isle stable for the next couple of years, building up a strong working relationship that culminated in the voicing of nearly three dozen tracks, the best _of_ which were eventually compiled as album releases. Roy continues to speak highly of the Duke: 'He was giving me some money all right at that time and we have an agreement that, when everything is kind of crapping up, I'm going to want a little house out of my royalty. And he did do that. I used to go to him for any money I want during the weekend for running my house. I never really have no problem getting some money from him, but I still used to know that I wasn't getting what I really supposed to get. When you'r e just young in this, you don't understand. It's just fun for you to know that you'v e been in the limelight and things been good for you... but the vibes was really with Duke Reid, definitely. Duke was a man who used to deal with me all right.'

One of the earliest hits U Roy scored away from Duke was 'Scandal' for Lloyd Daley. 'After the incident with the police damaging my sound system,' Daley recalls, 'my wife wrote a tune, "Born To Lose", meaning that we always lose a lot of money. She teamed up with Lloyd Robinson and sang it in 1968 at Federal. It came out on blank label pre-release and didn't go very far, so we went back into the studio with some horn men, including Tommy McCook, and U Roy, and made it into "Scandal", a big hit.'

The way U Roy shifted the status of the deejay from that of a peripheral fixture to a recording star whose microphone rhymes were as important as any singer's lyrics earned him the apt title _of_ 'The Originator', and it was only natural that younger toasters would try to emulate his unprecedented success. The next to excel at the form was Dennis Alcapone, star toaster with the small but popular El Paso sound system, based in the Waltham Park area. Alcapone, born Dennis Smith in the rural district of Culloden in 1946, says that, like U Roy, he was attracted to the sound system at an early age. 'When I went to Kingston I was living _on_ Waltham Park Road, where there was a dancehall very close by at number 28. That's where all the big sounds come: Duke Reid, Coxsone, King Edwards the Giant, Sir Percy, Count Bells the President and Thunderstorm. There was also a place quite close by in Oakland Crescent – Lord Comic would be around there playing.'

After spinning records at a few parties, Dennis decided to form a set of his own with two friends. 'We started borrowing speakers from people in the area, playing in the yard. We play one and two places until we started to establish ourselves, buy our own speakers and a 72 steel amp, and start buying dub plates from Duke Reid. Our first had [the Melodians'] "Everybody Bawling", John Holt's "Ali Baba" and the Techniques' "Travelling Man" – it cost about ten dollars. We didn't actually have a name at that time. There was a sound in the neighbourhood that was very good: El Toro, down by Greenwich Farm, run by Vivian Blake. His deejay was Cry Cry7 [later known as Prince Fari] and this guy named Bunny Remus, who was more or less his upfront deejay, because Cry Cry used to go to prison. El Toro had a tune that we used to love listening to, [Marty Robbins'] "El Paso", so that's how the name born.'

Alcapone says a deejay called Pompadoo inspired him. 'I was not great then - more or less them times we used to just introduce the songs. When I really get fascinated about deejay is when a sound named Kentone came to Waltham Avenue to play at a dance. Pompadoo was the deejay and he said, "My name is Kentone. I come from the other side of town." He was a very stylish deejay. Those days playing sound was not like now, when you have a selector and all kind of different people operating the sound. In those days it was just the deejay that do every damn thing, including lifting up the box and setting up the sound! When Pompadoo was deejaying, he was so stylish that I was just fascinated by him. Then we decided to take it a bit further lyrically.'

**Dennis Alcapone [right] with Alton Ellis [Tero Kaski]**

As with U Roy's recording debut, it was the imaginative producer Keith Hudson who first brought Alcapone into the studio. 'In those days, El Paso was carrying the swing. Everybody used to come and listen to El Paso: producers, singers, rude boys. Everybody used to come for one reason: that was to hear me. Obviously the word go around that I'm expeditious, so Keith Hudson came to me and said he want me to do the "El Paso" song for him. But the rhythm that he had wasn't the rhythm that I did "El Paso" on for the sound system. I used to work on the Techniques' song "You Don't Care", but he had a different rhythm that just didn't fit.'

Despite this uncertain start, Alcapone is full of praise for the young producer's attitude. 'Hudson was a "soul man" with a big Afro. He was a handsome guy and he give me good encouragement – like, for instance, he open up my first bank account and get stage gear.' It was difficult for either of them to break into the big time. 'When we did "El Paso" I did several other songs for him, including "Spanish Amigo", which went into the charts, but people wasn't accustomed to deejay music in those days so it didn't make that amount of impact until later. Keith Hudson was more or less what you'd call a new man in the business – he didn't have influence to get radio promotion. Duke Reid was more established at the time, so whatever Duke Reid does, the public hears, because he had a half-hour programme each week on RJR.'

'Spanish Amigo', an alternative cut of Ken Boothe's 'Old Fashioned Way', was also ahead of its time because it had Alcapone toasting through a false start at the beginning of the tune. 'That was Keith Hudson's idea, because Keith Hudson is a man who's always trying something new. When I did the intro he made Errol Thompson, the engineer at Randy's , splice back the intro so it would repeat.'

Though Alcapone drew much inspiration from U Roy, adapting a higher shriek of 'Yeah yeah yeah!' as a trademark, he tended to make use of more rhymes than the Originator and was not averse to adapting proverbs or children's nursery rhymes into his raps. With a few popular tunes under his belt and continued appearances on the hot El Paso sound demand for Alcapone grew rapidly, and he soon began scoring hits for the better-established producers. 'U Roy was at Duke Reid. I decided that Coxsone has some prime rhythms, so I'l l just go to Studio One. I went and did "Nanny Version" [over Larry and Alvin's "Nanny Goat"]. And when I was recording for Keith Hudson I was recording under my right name, Dennis Smith, so to make it sound a bit more interesting I tell Coxsone, "Put Dennis Alcapone." After "Nanny Version" hit, I did "Home Version" over Ken Boothe's song "Home". One day Duke Reid send for me and said, "That tune that you did, 'Nanny Goat', didn't U Roy help you on the tune?" I said, "No, it's just me did it." Then Byron Smith asked me to do "Mosquito One", and he called me "El Paso" because at the time I was with Coxsone.'

When Duke Reid finally caught up with Alcapone, the result was another series of hits. 'I think Duke Reid was impressed by the whole thing, and though I went back to Coxsone and did a few other songs, one day Duke Reid call me again and say he wanted me to do a song for him. I went down and did "Teach The Children", which was a hit song, though I didn't think for a minute that tune would be so big. We did "Wake Up Jamaica" after that and "Number One Station", and then I bnng in Lizzy for "Big Beat".'

The duet deejay discs created by Alcapone and Lizzy – again typically over the Duke's rock steady rhythms – scored hits like 'Big Beat' and the nonsensical 'Ba Ba Ri Ba Skank'. The team established a combination formula that prefaced not only internationally popular Jamaican acts of the 1980s and 1990s, such as Michigan and Smiley and Chakademus and Pliers, but, perhaps more importantly, the superstar US rap combo groups of the late 1970s such as Run DMC, Dr Jeckyl and Mr Hyde, and Double Trouble. 'I and Lizzy was the first combination deejay. A lot of people don't know that – they believe that the first deejay combination was Michigan and Smiley or somebody else – but me and him did that first.' Lizzy was then the star deejay on Prince Jammy's sound system, a set established in Water-house by Lloyd James in 1962; after 1969 the set was out of action because James went to Canada. Though Lizzy was popular when recording with Alcapone he failed to maintain the momentum with solo material, and his own eventual emigration to Canada marked a permanent departure from the music scene.

In contrast Alcapone continued to churn out hits, distinguishing himself by unusual vocal elements such as his imitation of a cockerel on numbers like 'Wake Up Jamaica', 'Power Version' and 'Rasta Dub', a cut of Bob Marley's 'Keep On Moving' recorded for Lee Perry. 'In Jamaica, when you wake up in the morning there's a lot of cock crowing,' the toaster explains. 'It's a sound that you hear early in the morning and sometimes in the night when the little bastard them dropping off the roof. Cock crowdng is always a thing that we live with day by day, and when you'r e making a tune you try to make an impact, so you think of everything that will attract attention.' As a result of such efforts he was awarded the first-ever deejay cup, presented by Rupie Edwards' _Record Retailer_ magazine for 1971-2.

While the deejays continued to climb the musical ladder, Jamaica was set for a major political change. In the 1972 general election Michael Manley defeated the JLP incumbent Hugh Shearer, striding into office on a platform of elevating the poor, and it was partly reggae music and symbolic, Rasta-sympathetic rhetoric that got him there. Delroy Wilson's determined 'Better Must Come' topped the charts in 1971; Manley co-opted the tune as his campaign song. He made public appearances with a staff he said had been given to him by Haile Selassie – it was dubbed the Rod of Correction by his followers, who saw Manley as 'Joshua' and Shearer as 'Pharaoh' - and got Clancy Eccles to organize political bandwagons featuring the Wailers and other artists performing around the island in his support. 'I have a belief in socialism,' Clancy explains, 'because capitalism, one set get rich while one set go poor, and if it was equally divided, half would be rich and half would be poor. But you'r e going find that 2 per cent get rich and 90 per cent live under the poverty line, and there is 8 per cent that we would say lives off the cream of the rich. That part, I feel it's not proper. I believe that the distribution of the wealth of the world should be given to everyone equally for their amount ofwork.' Though never officially part of the PNP government, Eccles says he and his peers were given a chance to express their feelings once Manley was in office. 'We were the non-paid advisers to Manley. We could call him any time and say, "Hey, we feel that that no right." '

**Michael Manley, aka Joshua [Beth Lesser]**

Bunny Lee says Jamaica clearly needed a concrete change in political outlook. 'Things really tough in Jamaica them times,' he says, speaking of food shortages and other difficulties that affected the poor most of all.

**Junior Byles [Robert Schoenfeld]**

Manley did implement a number of policies aimed at improving conditions for the poor majority, but most of the promised changes were slow to arrive and artists who had supported his campaign were soon voicing dissent. Junior Byles recorded 'Pharaoh Hiding' in praise of Manley in 1972, but the following year cut 'When Will Better Come' in scathing reference to the sentiment expressed in the party's campaign song. Both were recorded by Lee Perry, the producer who drew the best results from the sensitive singer and scored one of the biggest hits of 1972 with Byles' defiant 'Beat Down Babylon', perhaps his best-known work. 'You know why most people can't record Byles?' Perry asks, with a rumbling gravity in his voice. 'He's really a confusing artist if you don't know how to get with it. He's one of the best artists to come, he has a sweet voice, but he's not easy to control. He had good thoughts, very good ideas, but you have to have patience. Junior Byles is something different, very different – something special.'

It was the Now Generation who provided the musical backing for the hit, and Val Douglas says the link was again down to Tin Legs. 'Tin Legs used to record for Scratch and Bunny Lee. Bunny Lee used to use Family Man strictly. I did one and two little things, like "Beat Down Babylon". At that time Mikey Chung and Wire was in the band.'

The Now Generation hit big in 1971 with Peter Tosh's drawling 'Maga Dog', produced by Joe Gibbs – it far exceeded the popularity of the original Wailers' ska recording for Coxsone. In 1972 Now Gen was working at Harry J's sixteen-track studio on Roosevelt Avenue, near the National Stadium; like Joe Gibbs' Duhaney Park facility, the studio was set up by Bill Garnett on one of his weekend visits to Jamaica. It was at Harry J that the band backed their biggest international hit: Lorna Bennett's rendition of Jeanette Washington's 'Breakfast In Bed', now centred on Val Douglas' bouncing bass notes and released abroad on Island's Blue Mountain subsidiary. ' "Breakfast In Bed" is probably my best bass line,' Val Douglas says. 'I never forget what happened after I played that line. Geoffrey [Chung] was producing and arranging at Harry J. We had done a redo of Cat Stevens' "Morning Has Broken", and the next song we did was "Breakfast In Bed". Harry J came in and said, "Boy, I don't like this rhythm." Right then, he had a hit out there with Joe Higgs, "The Whole World Is Upside Down". Jackie Jackson there 'pon it. That was the other session group that was happening: Jackie Jackson and Hux Brown, Winston Wright. Harry J said, "Give me a bass line something like that." I was like, "Boss, this is the line for the tune."'

Zap Pow achieved their first overseas hit at Harry J around the same time, their breakthrough partly assisted by Chris Blackwell's intervention. 'Zap Pow was known for "Mystic Mood",' David Madden recalls. 'Then we found ourselves with a second hit, "Scandal Corner", which was more a sort of comedy side. Harry J wanted to have the group record an album – he gave us studio time to do some more songs. Mikey got this idea one rehearsal evening, which was "This Is Reggae Music". Harry J had a contact with Chris Blackwell. It sounded to him like the record wasn't finished, because Mikey didn't really sing the words, so Chris call Jim Capaldi [of the group Traffic] to ask him to finish writing the words. He brought it back down, Mikey do whatsoever we was supposed to do and send it back up to Chris [who] put strings on to it.' Blackwell was so taken with the end result that he subsequently titled Island's reggae compilation series _This Is Reggae Music._

**This is reggae music: Mikey Williams of Zap Pow [Adrian Thomas]**

In 1973, Soul Syndicate was back on top in Jamaica with Niney's sterling production of Ken Boothe's 'Silver Words' (originally by Detroit soul artist Rodriquez) and Dennis Brown's 'Westbound Train' – the first of many hits created by the electrifying combination of Niney, Dennis and Soul Syndicate. Niney says this was the point when he became a fully fledged producer. 'I was singing and wasn't so interested in [other] singers. I just use my own rhythms that I make, never used to give people them because I find a new trend, so I just hold them and sing on them myself. The only people who would share it was Maxie Romeo in those days. [Lloyd] Charmers told me he love my type of rhythms and asked me to make some rhythms like that for him too, although he was a great keyboardist and a great arranger himself. I decide to shift, because a lot of singers like Ken Boothe, they always come to me and say, "I like your rhythms, I would like some rhythms like that." So I decide to cool off with the singing and just go into producing. When I was working with Bunny Lee, me and Slim Smith used to write songs at this yard up Orange Street, the same place Dennis Brown born, and we meet Dennis as a likkle youth who want to sing, but Dennis was so likkle that we couldn't bring him in the camp. Slim Smith take him down to Derrick Harriott and he make a headway, then I think Alton Ellis take him up to Coxsone. After I do "Silver Words" my name start to call differently – I in a different league. I meet Dennis Brown and we say we want to work, then me and him start to move so close that the two of we live together in one house up Pembroke Hall. Me and Dennis start to go to party and dances, and we drive uptown one night to New Kingston and I hear a song play, Al Green's "Love And Happiness". After I drop him home, it was four o'c lock in the morning and I never go and sleep. I just go to Chinna and Fully, wake them up and say, "I'm going to run a session tomorrow", because they play for Joe Gibbs every Sunday, and me operate Joe Gibbs' session every Sunday – I was still helping out with Joe Gibbs. As they come, I lick the song first. Joe Gibbs was the engineer – a very good engineer in those days.'

'I invent that "flyers" guitar on "Westbound Train",' adds Tony Chin. 'We were doing some songs for Niney up at Joe Gibbs' studio, and Niney said he wanted one more rhythm. That time Dennis Brown wasn't even in the studio. I said, "Let's do the Al Green song as an instrumental", and Chinna started to play it. A month after, I hear a vocal on the rhythm, call it "Westbound Train".'

'I did bring Dennis round there to do an album for Joe Gibbs,' Niney continues, talking about the disc ironically issued as _The Best Of Dennis Brown._ 'Joe Gibbs said, "I want a cut of this song to put on the album", so from there me and Dennis very tight. It's all a new vibe, because this is the first me and Dennis working. Before the first song come out, I know it was a hit. One day we go to the beach and we drive in town, on Orange Street and North Street, and it's right at that corner he born and grow, so he decide to take a prip at his home. He have a likkle cough, and he said, "Come here, Skipper, I cough and spit blood." I take him to a chest clinic and they say I must take him to the hospital – a lungs problem. He in the hospital for four or five months, and meanwhile the song becomes number one. We need the follow-up, so I take him out [of] the hospital one night, take him to Randy's , and we do "Cassandra" at four o'c lock [in] the morning. From there, we have that relationship coming down.'

Niney notes that King Tubby was responsible for breaking most of this hit material. 'When we make a song, we take it to him and when he mix off the song, he keep that cut for his sound system, and then he make different cuts and sell dubs to other sounds. He promoted the song so that when the song come to street, it hit. Tubbys was Jamaica's dancehall radio station: wherever he play the sound, people talk about what Tubbys play the next morning, so that be a demand on the street. We would give Tubby a song and he play it like two or three months, and whenever the song reach a demands we release it. We go to him and he says, "Don't release it yet, release it two weeks' time", and then he makes U Roy boost that song. The word go round, so when it release it's a hit.' Niney also points out that Bernard 'Touter' Harvey, later the main keyboardist with Inner Circle, brought a particular sound to much of this material. 'Sometimes we bring in certain guys like Ossie Hibbert, Ansel Collins, but Touter was the most important piano man, the one that play the great part of Dennis Brown's career.'

Ultimately, it was Soul Syndicate's exquisite backing that gave this music its unique definition; Niney says he was always keenly aware of the group's abilities. 'I have Soul Syndicate working from them time when nobody know them. People laughed after me, say all these guys play is pure shash-chord note, they can't read, 'til I shame them when I drop the Ken Boothe "Silver Words". Then everybody want part of them.'

While Soul Syndicate, the All Stars and Now Generation were fighting to maintain session dominance, a handful of creative producers and engineers were shifting instrumentals into the realm of dub. In the late 1960s one of the most prolific creators of instrumental versions was Lee Perry, but once he had hooked up with Bob Marley, he concentrated more on vocal material. When the Wailers left his stable to branch out on their own in late 1971, Perry celebrated the rupture by issuing an entirely instrumental version of their _Soul Revolution_ album as _Soul Revolution II._ Stripped of the Wailers' voices, these songs were transformed to emphasize different elements _of_ their musical composition: 'Kaya' focussed on a lively acoustic guitar melody; 'Duppy Conqueror Version 4' highlighted the song's choppy organ chords; 'Keep On Moving', 'Put It On' and others placed greatest emphasis on drum and bass, foreshadowing standard dub practices.

Herman Chin-Loy was also stretching the contours of the instrumental in 1971, often using rhythms played by the core of the Upsetters, through work credited to Augustus Pablo. At his home in Miami, Chin-Loy describes his mixed heritage. 'I was born in Duncans, Trelawney, then I move up to Clarendon. My father, who died when I was a babe, had a shop there – he was strictly Chinese, and my mother is half-Chinese, and the other part of me is black. My great-grandparents, I don't think they came as indentured labour, maybe they came as merchants, but certainly the black part of me would have been in slavery, which is where I need to expound on more precisely. I have come to find out that these people taken to the Caribbean as slaves are actually Israelites. If you read the Bible, it say Abraham's seed shall be in a strange land for four hundred years of affliction, and that is the trans-Atlantic slave trade.'

After arriving in Kingston at the age often in 1958, Chin-Loy gradually got into the retail record business. 'I went to live at Princess Street and that address was Kong, Beverley's Records. We are related, maybe through my mother's side. I just stopped there for a while in passing through to go and live with my half-brother up by Waltham Park Road. Then I went back to my mother, she was living downtown at Hanover Street, working as a clerk at one of those stores in King Street. Then I move to Spanish Town, [to] the blacker side of my family, for about three or four years. One of my aunts, her boyfriend used to be one of the Chinese people at Spotlight, a family-owned business. They fix radios, sell tubes and amplifiers, and they had a recognized sound system in Spanish Town, so I was around the music there. Then my brother came by one day and I went to live with him again.'

So much moving around meant that Herman got a poor education and ended up at a reformatory institution. 'Me and people like Family Man used to go to Samt Aloysius,' he recalls, 'but I used to skulk more than go to school. My last time in school I came last, that was in the sixth grade, the reason being that I was going back and forth and I wasn't focussing. Matter of fact, the people who were teaching me, they needed to be taught.' It was perhaps experiences such as these that would later inspire him to record a song called 'Dunce Cap', with himself credited as Teacher.

After leaving school, Herman started to run a downtown record shop. 'When I was going to school I used to work with Beverley's , like Christmas holidays. My older brother Keith was working there. He used to live with the Kongs, and I would go there because I really loved the music. When my brother came for me in Spanish Town he saw me selling records in the Spotlight shop, so he knew that I loved music. He and another friend found a shop for me down on King Street at the corner of Beeston Street: One Stop Record Shop, they finance it, but the shop really belong to me. That was the early sixties'. Herman says his chief supplier wras Neville Chow-Fong at KG, a record shop and commercial distribution service. 'We used to get all the American music from KG,' he recalls, 'I used to buy most of my stock from him. He opened a shop up by Half Way Tree, then I used to work there too. I left my shop downtown, gave it to Derrick Harriott, because [KG] had a club around the back called Lotus A Go-Go, that was the first stationary discotheque in Jamaica. So I would deejay the disco in the night and work around the record shop in the day. While working there, I went up to Northside Plaza to the Tunnel club. Inner Circle used to play there, and I used to MC the band and do a little singing, as they used to come to KG's to buy – that was the place to come, so that's where I met everybody.'

Around 1969, Herman left the employment of Mr Chow-Fong at KG to set up the Aquarius record shop and label in Half Way Tree. He also controlled a related imprint called Scorpio, using both to put forward material crediting the imaginary Augustus Pablo. 'It was the "Age of Aquarius" when I opened the store,' Herman laughs. 'That was the time when the movie _Hair_ came out, so a friend of mine said it would be a good thing. I was just using the Zodiac, but was born in July and that would be Cancer – nobody would want to come to a place that have cancer! By that time I had produced "Shang I", "African Zulu" and "Black Coffee" by Augustus Pablo. Those songs were actually done by Lloyd Charmers at Dynamic Sounds, maybe with Val Douglas, Mikey Chung, Wire Lindo and Ranny Bop. The name Augustus Pablo, I just thought of something that would sound mysterious. Movies was a lot of influence to us: sometimes we would watch Clint Eastwood movies and I would watch the Bible stories, and in my mind Augustus sounds like a big name. I realize later on that the name Pablo means Paul, but neither one of them has nothing to do with nothing.'

Other material to bear the name Augustus Pablo came about through collaboration with aspiring producer Pete Weston, again with Lloyd Charmers on organ. 'They would bring their music,' says Herman. 'That's how I get to meet Lee Perry, Bunny Lee, Clancy Eccles, Lloyd Charmers and Pete Weston. Weston was working in the insurance industry, and then he wanted to produce, so I just afforded him a place for what he could do. "Jug Head" was done by Pete Weston - that again was Lloyd Charmers, to set the record straight. Alton Ellis' "Rise Blackman" was done by Pete Weston, but I actually got a cut of the rhythm, a dub which I name "62636", the telephone number for my shop. "Invasion" [a ghoulish instrumental cut of the rhythm, led by a horror soundtrack organ line] is my production with Lloyd Charmers.'

To confuse matters further, other songs credited to Augustus Pablo came on rhythms built by the core of the Upsetters, with organ duties handled by Glen Adams. 'Family Man, Glen Adams and Reggie would bring a rhythm for me to buy,' Herman explains. ' "Reggae In The Fields" [an instrumental recut _of_ the Ethiopians' 'Everything Crash'] was one of those rhythms, but I put the piano on it with Lloyd Charmers.'

It was on one such rhythm that the mantle of Augustus Pablo was assumed by Horace Swaby, a resident of the lower middle-class Havendale district whose father, a man of Indian descent, was an accountant. Horace and his brother established the Rockers sound system in Havendale in the late 1960s, and Horace often bought records at Aquarius. One fateful day in 1971 he went there with a melodica, and the producer had enough curiosity about the instrument to take him into the studio. In so doing, Herman launched the career of a highly talented individual with a unique take on instrumental sound whose work would bring great changes to the reggae form.

'It all started when someone lent me a melodica,' Swaby explained shortly before his death from a rare nerve disorder, 'a sister, I can't really remember her name. Her father was a big important lawyer and her brother is a lawyer – the whole lawyer family. She went to a girls' school and they used the instrument in the school, and I didn't have any, so she lent me her instrument and I used to practise it every day. I went down to Herman Chin-Loy to buy some records for my sound, Rockers. He asked me if I could play that instrument, I say, "Yeah", and he carried me to the studio.'

**Melodica master Augustus Pablo [Beth Lesser]**

This first session yielded 'Iggy Iggy', an oblique, chord-strewn instrumental loosely based on the Heptones' broken-hearted 'Why Did You Leave'. 'That was another cut of Glen Adams and Family Man,' Herman notes. 'I do the talking, which was youthful exuberance, more like an MC than a deejay.' More invigorating instrumentally was the original 'East Of The River Nile', on which Swaby blew an inspired melody over the song's jazzy beat, relying mostly on the black keys and hinting at the 'Far East' sound he was later to develop. 'I was looking for a new sound, Herman insists. I didn't want to produce everything that everybody else is producing. When he came, he wanted to play piano. The story goes that I saw him with this melodica and I said, "That's exactly what I want", so we went into the studio – I didn't even know if he could play very well. We got this rhythm, "East Of The River Nile" – Family Man, Glen Adams and Reggie are responsible for that – so he went on it and I said, "That's exactly the sound that I want", because to me it had a Middle East sound. That's why the name "East Of The River Nile" came.'

On his final visit to London, a frail and nearly bed-ridden Swaby was in the general care of Rastafarian herbalist Dr Owen 'Bagga' Forrester. Swaby only agreed to be interviewed on the condition that Bagga was interviewed first, and the ensuing discussion was a surreal exchange about the herbalist's methods of treating lymphatic disorders. Afterwards, the man known the world over as Augustus Pablo revealed that it was Glen Adams' departure from Jamaica that transferred the alias permanently. 'Glen Adams did "Aquarius One" for Herman as Augustus Pablo. A lot of people think it's me, but it's not, because Herman is the one that created that name. Anyone could name Augustus Pablo – he just take it out to use gimmicks to rule the people. Glen played that organ on "River Nile" with me too, but he went to America the next day.'

Adams' emigration to Brooklyn had direct consequences on the Kingston music scene: the Wailers had no regular keyboardist and would eventually draft Tyrone Downey into their ranks, and the Upsetters and the Treasure Isle house band were also out of an organist. Horace Swaby was able to partially fill the gap as Augustus Pablo, working as a session keyboardist for some of the better-established producers after Herman Chin-Loy spent a period abroad. 'I used to play studio musician for Treasure Isle, Bunny Lee and a few other producers. I play back-up music because they didn't have an organist any more, and Family Man used to help me a lot. I passed through Now Generation – wasn't really in the band, but I played studio musician with them through Herman.'

Whilst Augustus Pablo's early melodica efforts breathed new life into the reggae instrumental, in 1972 engineers such as King Tubby and Errol Thompson took things one step further. Dub version B-sides, and the odd instrumental A-side, began to elevate drum and bass to the fore, with heavily modulated rhythms transformed through the application of effects such as reverb and echo, applied either to instruments or to snatches of vocals that drifted in and out of the mix.

'The drum and bass part now, Tubbys strike out,' says Bunny Lee. 'One of the first drum and bass tunes that come out was "Merry Up" with Glen Brown. That reverb, watery sound, that a one of the first.' Credited to the God Sons, 'Merry Up' is a most peculiar record. The song opens with a heavily reverberating noise, courtesy of Tubby, which gives way to a plodding, bass-heavy rhythm over which the singer Joe White blows a minimal melodica line, accentuated by saxophone and trombone notes. Mid-way through, the music cuts and a voice proclaims, 'Hold it Mr T! This daughter can't keep up to this rhythm. Ask me questions, I tell you no lie; ask me no questions, I play music' Then the plodding beat starts up again. An unlikely combination for a hit, perhaps, but 'Merry Up' none the less scored big in the Jamaica charts.

**Merry up: visionary jazz man Glen Brown [Dave Hendley]**

Glen Brown is another reggae enigma, a man who sometimes dislikes having his photograph taken and prefers to engage in 'reasoning' as opposed to formal interviews. At Don One studio, in the depths of Brooklyn's East Flatbush, he seems more frazzled than on previous London meetings, but his comments are still full of insight. He points out that 'Merry Up' began as a totally different entity. 'In Jamaica, there's some songs that didn't properly done. "Merry Up" was the spoiled cut, and it hit the same way. "Merry Up" is a song made vocally, which I wrote, named "Welcome To My Land", singed by me, Bibi Seaton and Ken Boothe. We voice it at the bottom studio at Dynamic – Karl Pitterson was the engineer. When I ready and pay for my studio time, I can't find the tape. Byron Lee was in the studio and Bunny Lee and other producers, so I can't blame no one [in particular], but somebody snatched my tape – they stole the vocal cut. So I said, "Anybody thief this music here can't put it out." I went home and go for my melodica and I blow the melody [of] "Merry Up". Joe White had the same instrument, like Augustus Pablo – it's the three of us blow it. I keep showing Joe White for about one whole day, because I have to pay for studio time. Every minute Joe White blowing 'til he get close to it. I still have the rhythm, and Merritone did have a two-track studio in Half Way Tree, so we record [there]. I put the instrumental out, and it take Ernie Smith's "Pitta Patta" _off_ the charts. "Pitta Patta" be the number two for six months, can't reach number one because of "Merry Up". God just make the instrumental turn out to be a hit song, kill everybody tune.'

As a young producer in the early 1970s, Glen was often low on finance but high on ideas. His product, issued in small quantity on short-lived labels such as South East Music, Pantomine and Dwyer, was usually driven by a full brass section and marked by an individual quality informed by jazz; Glen says his musicality was sparked by Jamaica's finest horn players. 'I was born in downtown Kingston at 14 Wildman Street, 1944, and I moved throughout the community. I always spend a little time listening to Tommy McCook, Roland [Alphonso] and various musicians, so it put me in the vibes of trying to be part of it.'

In the mid-1960s Glen formed his first singing duo with Lloyd Robinson while doing casual work at a department store. 'I had a guitar given to me by a gentleman who fix TV – Mr Wong at Wong Brothers, one of the big stores at Cross Roads. I always go by Mr Wong and play my guitar and he accept me, even though he's a Chiney man, so sometimes he had me behind the counter, selling. Sometimes I go downtown and Lloyd Robinson play the piano, off Spanish Town Road, behind the theatre. Tony Brevett live down that street. If Lloydie get the piano before Tony, Lloydie play for the whole day. When me and Lloydie sing, we make a harmony that people say wTe sound like Sam and Dave. We went by Duke Reid's studio, about '66, started doing a few songs like "Oh Little Girl". We change the Sam Cooke lyrically, use his melody with our lyrics. We do a few tracks for Mr Pottinger and everybody start accept our harmony. At the Ward Theatre, sometime we perform with Byron Lee as guest artists. We do some tracks for Derrick Harriott also, like "That Girl", "The Loser" – me and Lloyd Robinson do [backing vocals on] that. Then I started to sing with a band at Sheraton Hotel Ballroom.'

After Glen became lead singer with the Cecil Lloyd Quintet, then the island's leading hotel jazz band, he and Lloyd Robinson went their separate ways. Glen subsequently sang with the Sonny Bradshaw Seven and formed duos with Hopeton Lewis and Dave Barker in 1968-9, cutting a number of solo sides before finding a way into the production field. 'As Cecil Lloyd take a holiday, I join Sonny Bradshaw Seven at Sheraton. Jackie Jackson was the bass player, but he leave and start to play with Winston Wright and Gladdy, so it move to be a street band. Me and Hopeton Lewis met at Wong Brothers and we do a few songs like "Girl You Cold", that produced by Mr Wong.'

Another entrepreneur who assisted Glen was M.G. Mahtani, proprietor of a downtown jewellery shop called Shalimar, near Derrick Harriott's shop on King Street. 'Shalimar [Mahtani] have a likkle shop, he's a nice Indian guy, talk Amharic and various languages, so being a nice person he accept me. I was in Derrick Harriott's shop, and Shalimar have artists like Gladdy and Stranger Cole, so we do some songs for Shalimar. I always be in the shop and sell my product, even though they selling gold there.'

When Glen finally got into production, a shop _of_ his own contributed to his success. 'I have a label, I up and down, and going to Mr Wong Brothers and say I'd like to get a shop, so him say, "Why don't you try to get a shop across the street, beside Carib?" I build a shop and put it right round the Post Office side of Cross Roads, Caledonia Place. You have the Abyssmians' record shop right across the street. Immediately as I build the shop, I come with this song named "Mr Harry Skank".'

One of the first hits to bring deejay Prince Jazzbo wider recognition, 'Mr Harry Skank' was voiced on the instrumental 'Dirty Harry', led by the veteran Tommy McCook and featuring young tenor saxophonist named Richard Hall. In addition to being an immortal rhythm that has retained its popularity over decades, it established Hall's reputation and gave him a lasting persona. Its original vocal piece, 'Realise', was voiced by Glen with Ritchie MacDonald from the Chosen Few.

Glen says that most _of_ his rhythms, including popular pieces like Roman Stewart's debut 'Never Too Young To Learn', were shaped by his time in the jazz band. 'Being in the jazz, it makes I more musically, so "Never Too Young To Learn", that's jazz, and that's what I write. I make Roman Stewart voice it and everybody say it's Dennis Brown. The song played by Now Generation Band, we record that at Harry J's studio. The lyrics inspired through singing with a jazz band:

_When we gather around_

_We meditate a way of life_

_The more we go_

_Is the more we learn_

_We'r e never too young to learn_

_Even an old man gets his turn..._

When running such sessions, Glen often allowed his collaborators to cut their own creations in his studio time. 'I been helping singers coming up along the way, recording Lloyd Parks with the song "Slaving Everyday". I'm one of the [backing] vocal, and he did "Officially" for himself on the session. Prince jazzbo, when I record him, I pay for a song and let him record a song for himself, 'cause I love to see artists survive. I would pay for the band and pay the studio time, but him would just deal with it.'

Another popular rhythm, known as 'Tubbys At The Control', made reference to the prominent role King Tubby played in mixing nearly all of Glen's material. 'King Tubbys was from the South, just in my same area. He was right at High Holborn Street in the early days, and I below Barrow Street on High Holborn Street. King Tubbys always build some little speaker, he always have a little bike, so King Tubbys build a little thing on the bike. Sometimes you'r e talking to him and he'l l record you. I love music going up, so I always go to Tubbys. If I have a music, the first person hear it is Tubbys and the first person I would leave my tape with is Tubbys. After me and Tubbys link up, a lot of producers and singers start going by Tubbys'. At that time, I leave Tubbys and gone 'pon the North Coast, sing back [with] Cecil Lloyd. Every six months I come in with a nice money, run another recording session.'

Like most of Glen Brown's productions, 'Tubbys At The Control' was mixed by King Tubby at his home studio at 18 Dromilly Avenue, Waterhouse. The tiny space was not a recording studio in the conventional sense, nor wTas Tubby an actual producer until the late 1980s. His bedroom studio was never large enough for rhythms to be created in full, but the space was gradually converted into a sound manipulation unit complete with a machine to cut acetates.

'Tubbs is an innovator,' says 'Prince' Philip Smart, engineer at the studio for much of the mid-1970s. 'He didn't buy his first console, he built it – built the chassis and everything, put all the components together. That's what he used to use first, until he bought the MCI console from Dynamics, their studio B. It was just that room he had at first. You have a carport, and then the carport is a bedroom and a bathroom, so him turn the bathroom into the voice room and the bedroom into the control room, and he had his repair shop in another little house in the back. His main income was building amplifiers and winding transformers, because he had contracts for hotels that needed transformers for stabilizing the current. The music was an addition, because he had the sound and he always wanted to make his own dubs, so that's how he started: he bought the dub machine to cut his own dubs.'

'The home amplifier like Pioneer, Marantz, it's them amplifier him started with,' says singer and producer Roy Cousins. 'He did have about three of them transistor amplifier, one of them old cutter, and them likkle two-track reel-to-reel that come in a suitcase, him did have one like that him used to put on a stool. Then when Byron Lee decided him going cut stamper, him decided to sell [the equipment in] studio two, which was four-track. It's through Bunny Lee [that Tubby] get [the mixing desk]: Byron wanted cash and everybody just want to leave a deposit, but Tubbys go down there with the whole of it.' Cousins supplied further information about Tubby's domestic set-up: 'His house was owned by Miss Sissy – that's Tubbs' mother. The studio was him bedroom, and him used to have a board thing at the back where him used to make him amps. Tubbys had two four-track machine and a two-track. That time he didn't even have a car yet – he used to ride one of them Honda, big M50. It's three brothers. Stagga, that's the biggest brother, him is a better engineer than Tubbys – Stagga build the sound. Lloyd Ruddock, Tubby's younger brother [a sometime vocalist also known as Scuner] was a tailor, but him and Tubbys never get on.'

After Tubby had installed the equipment purchased from Dynamics he held rudimentary voicing and mixing sessions, partly at the instigation of Bunny Lee. An early engineering assistant was the singer Pat Kelly, hired for his knowledge _of_ electronics. 'I started engineering from '69 at King Tubby's ,' he recalls. 'We used to do mixing and voicing, as early as that, with a two-track machine. When I first recorded with Bunny Lee I used to go there and voice, and it was King Tubbys himself who was operating the board.'

In the early 1970s the most creative Kingston producers were beating a path to Tubby's door, with Roy Cousins among the first to make use of Dynamic's former mixing desk. Sitting in a South London restaurant, the short, stout Cousins says he was born in downtown Kingston in 1949. He formed his first harmony group in 1962 to attend the Junior Festival competition, and by 1965 was part of the first incarnation _of_ the Royals as the Tempests, along with neighbourhood friends Bertram 'Harry' Johnson and Errol 'Tralla' Green. 'We did quite a few tunes for Duke,' Cousins recalls. 'I remember we did a track on the session with the first song Melodians do for Treasure Isle. We did about five tunes for Duke Reid, but none of them release. Errol Green then left the group – he was the one that sing lead on all them tracks.' It was Cousins who now took the lead, writing the group's material and coaching other members in harmony. Green was replaced by Errol Wilson, whom Cousins came to know through his job at the Post Office, and the group moved on to work with Lloyd Daley. In 1967 Coxsone selected the group, then still known as the Tempests, to record 'Pick Up The Pieces', an electrifying number that highlighted their harmonic excellence. But somehow Coxsone held back the disc, so Cousins recut it himself in 1971 with fellow postal worker and future Jays member Lloyd Forrest temporarily taking Errol Wilson's place. The success of the new number, issued on Cousins' Uhuru label, prompted Coxsone to release the original and led Cousins to have premier deejay I Roy voice 'Monkey Fashion' on the new rhythm at Tubby's studio. 'It's in King Tubby's we voice it, 'cause I used to live down the road from Tubbys,' Cousins explains, adding that songs like the Royals' 'Ghetto Man' and 'Sufferer In The Ghetto' were also voiced and mixed there.

'We start voice tune up a Tubbys,' continues Bunny Lee. 'The first set of tune, we go for Scratch again. Scratch do "Bathroom Skank" and all them tunes. We do the rhythm at Dynamic and voice it at Tubbys.' The sound-effects clutter of 'Bathroom Skank', a rude duet that Perry voiced with his common-law wife Pauline Morisson, was one of a series of heavily modified discs that Perry cut at Tubby's studio in 1972-3. Other notable examples include 'Black IP A', on which the horn parts were subjected to extreme phasing, and 'Flashing Echo', a drum-and-bass cut of Leo Graham's 'News Flash' given heavy doses of delay. Other producers drew equally exciting results: Derrick Harriott used Tubby's studio to transform the Ethiopians' 'No Baptism' into the spooky sounds of 'Dracula'; Keith Hudson, Glen Brown and upcoming producer Carlton Patterson all mixed the bulk of their dubs there.

**Picking up the pieces:**

**Roy Cousins [Dave Hendley]**

Tubby's studio was also a magnet for those from the very poorest levels of society who were seeking to break into the music business. A notable example was Vivian Jackson, a malnourished youth who was then scraping a living by giving betting tips at the racetrack. Jackson is obviously a deeply religious man, his conversation littered with references to the Bible; though his dreadlocks are long and matted, his rejection of Selassie as divine and his veneration of Jesus make him doubly ostracized, resulting in his title of Jesus Dread. Jackson says he was so poor in 1971, when he founded the Prophets group and record label, that he had to convince musicians to lay a few rhythm tracks for free; thus, 'The original Prophets was Chinna, Family Man, Horsemouth and myself Horsemouth says the studio fees were partly funded by friends whom Jackson sometimes lived and worked with. 'There was a big Rastaman on the gully bank in Waterhouse: Solomon Wolfe, he was the first man that lead the Rasta delegation with Mortimer Planno. These Rastas, Alric and Cleo, they have a furnace, gather aluminum from all over the streets, melt it and make pots. On the weekend they go to Ocho Rios, Montego Bay, and sell pots to make the sessions. [Karl] Pitterson was the engineer, a very roots guy, even though he was uptown. He knows we are from the ghetto, respects me and Family Man as good musicians, and just give us extra time.'

The following year, King Tubby gave Jackson free studio time when he was ready to voice the material with his harmony group. 'It was in 1972,' Jackson confirms. 'Alric Forbes and a brother who come sing as Bobby Melody carry harmony with me.' Tubby gave Jackson his peculiar stage name of Yabby You, stemming from the onomatopoeic chorus of his debut 'Conquering Lion'. 'When me start doing [music], I say me a go do it privately, and if it flop, me just take me losses and nobody won't know. I never know it would sell. I said I would just go around all of the Rastaman and beg them to buy one. When it did start to sell, here comes one of Tubbs' number one dubs. Me tell them it's Tubbys me sell the record for, so them always wonder who this group is. Then me do a song name "Love Of Jah", and it came up the same way. When me do "Warn The Nation", Tubbs tell them a me – him used to tell them the group is an American group named Yabby You.'

By 1974 Tubby's mixing artistry was officially acknowledged on version B-sides, notably on material cut for Carlton Patterson's Black and White label by artists such as Larry Marshall and Lizzy. Upcoming producer 'Prince' Tony Robinson also name-checked the sound man and mixer on an early disc called 'Tubby's In Full Swing', credited to Lloyd and Kerry (toasters Lloyd Young and Carey 'Wild-man' Johnson). The song was a bizarre cut-up blending the opening bars of the Staple Singers' 'I'l l Take You There' with a trombone instrumental.

Another important element in the development of dub is the partnership formed by Clive Chin and Errol Thompson at Randy's . 'Them time there, Tubby try and experiment more fi dub, but me and Errol start dub music,' says Clive. 'When I say start it, I'm not saying we going to take credit for any other man that put out a dub album, but we really experiment, because we had the time and the facility to do it. Another man like Phil Pratt or Niney, time was so important that you have to run in and run out – that's how studio used to run.'

**Jesus Dread: religious visionary Yabby You [Courtesy of Yabby You]**

As the son of the burgeoning studio's proprietor Clive Chin naturally spent a great deal of time in the premises at 17 North Parade, becoming more actively involved in record production at Randy's by the end of the 1960s. 'My first personal self-production was a tune called "Young Love", but I always had disappointments with vocal tunes in the early beginnings, because the artists never seem like they could sing. "Young Love" was cut with a schoolmate of mine, Douglas Boothe – I think he just took that name because him always trying to come off Ken's styling. Him just couldn't cut it, so we did it as an instrumental with Soul Syndicate – that was around '69.1 was basically brought in as an auditioner, because my uncle Keith was more in charge of production, but me used to do some wickeder tune than him, and them time him used to take credit fiit and me never used to like that. A whole heap of tune, my uncle Victor press them up and put "produced by Keith Chin", and it's really me do it!'

Among the tunes for which Keith Chin initially took credit was the wonderful Augustus Pablo instrumental 'Java', produced by Clive with Errol Thompson at the mixing desk in 1971. 'My uncle take credit for "Java" up here, and put the Chosen Few as the artist – it was called "East Of The Rio Cobre" by the Chosen Few on the New York Impact label. That really did get Pablo upset: Pablo didn't even get credit on that, and Chosen Few only said the intro and did the likkle chorus, but at the time Chosen Few had a name and nobody don't know Pablo.'

**Spicing the music: Clive Chin [David Katz]**

Clive reveals that 'Java' was originally intended as a vocal tune, but when the vocalist could not supply what Clive had in mind he got Pablo to reach for his melodica, providing the talented musician with his first big hit as a solo artist. It even received the accolade of Best Instrumental in 1972. 'The rhythm was a vocal tune that was not successful. The artist was another schoolmate of mine called Dennis Wright. It was some little love song, but him just couldn't cut it. Pablo was around, so I get Errol to cut a dub plate and he carry it home and work on it, come up with two melody lines – one for the version and one for the A-side.' Clive states that he decided to add the Chosen Few to counteract the novelty of Pablo's melodica playing. 'It was a new instrument on the scene, so I have to build around it and make it attractive, make people interested in it. I get the idea to throw in the Chosen Few because I had a tune with the Impressions called "East Of Java", and I wanted that song to be on a reggae rhythm. So I just have them come in saying, "From the East of the Rio Cobre to the West of the Rio Cobre hails the hottest Java". The Rio Cobre is a river in Jamaica where there are bamboo rafters. Again I just throw that in, just a spice, like when you'r e cooking food and you want to flavour it up a little bit.'

The song's tremendous success naturally spawned further versions, including 'Jaro', a Tommy McCook saxophone version, Dennis Alcapone's toasting cut 'Mava' and I Roy's surreal 'Hospital Trolley'. It also saw Pablo, Clive and Errol Thompson spending many a Sunday at Studio 17 with Family Man and Tin Legs, creating what would be issued in 1973 as _This Is Augustus Pablo,_ a stunning debut album for the young melodica master. 'The album was really something that me and Pablo sit down and talk about, 'cause doing work as a musician and doing work as an artist is two different things. Weeks we'v e been there mixing. There wasn't even a Sunday that I had to go out and mingle with my friends or check my girlfriend. We decided to dedicate to this mix, because I wanted it to sound so good.'

Two of the album's tracks, 'Lover's Mood' and the popular 'Pablo In Dub', were actually produced by Leonard 'Santic' Chin, a former singer with the Graduates. It was the sound of 'Java' that convinced Santic to seek out Pablo, and the fresh producer would often use his keyboard and arranging skills on future works, usually cut with Errol Thompson behind the mixing desk at Randy's .

Thompson was an old school friend of Clive Chin, and he became the chief engineer at 17 North Parade after completing a brief apprenticeship at Studio One. 'We had Bill Garnett, and then we had this other engineer from one of the radio stations – I think his name was Neville. A man named Mr Galbraith used to come to our studio to fix the organ – he w7as very good at the amplification and electronic part. He brought Errol down as an apprentice, because my father told him he was seeking an engineer. Errol came in when he had just come out of Studio One, but I knew him before that from Choir School out by South Camp Road and North Street. I had a good relationship with Errol, a very innovative relationship where we wouldn't just idle talk about things on the street or girlfriend business. We would talk more like how we could further the music, how we can do a different kind of fixture to it, spice it, rather than have the same old pattern of just Tommy [McCook] blowing a horn, Bobby [Aitken] playing a guitar, Winston [Wright] playing an organ.'

_Java Java Java Java_ was one of the first dub albums, issued in a limited pressing of one thousand copies in 1973. Thompson keeps the bass at the top of the mix for the whole of the disc, shuffling in reverb-treated keyboards, guitar, horns and the odd snatch of vocals or melodica. The final track, a version of Lloyd Parks' 'Ordinary Man' retitled 'Forward The Bass', incorporates a hilarious argument between studio personnel and an aspiring session musician in which the song's individual musical elements are highlighted. The album's concentration on drum and bass was a radical departure, and underlines not only the strength of the Randy's session musicians but, more importantly, the creative interaction between Clive Chin and Errol Thompson at the mixing desk. 'It was works done between me and Errol,' Clive emphasizes, 'and it was something new at the time. There wasn't an album out there that wasn't a mento, a calypso, or one of them uptown reggae albums by man like Byron Lee or Tomorrow's Children, so we wanted to do something different and say, "Boy, we a go give them a wicked dub album." We didn't commercialize it, we do it more like a dub plate special, so the market at that time wasn't great enough to keep the dub flow. People was just starting to listen to this new music, so we didn't consider it was going to be a big hit.'

A few other dub albums appeared around the same time, all vying for the title of'f irst dub LP'. Lee Perry's ground-breaking _Upsetters 14 Dub Blackboard Jungle_ (aka _Blackboard Jungle Dub)_ was mixed in true stereo with channel separation; Scratch often kept the drums and percussion upfront, and made greater use of reverb, echo and tape effects at King Tubby's studio. Prince Buster's epoch-making _The Message,_ mixed by Carlton Lee at Dynamics, kept horns and organ – processed through reverb – rolling over driving drum and bass; Joe Gibbs' _Dub Serial_ highlighted the strength of its minimal rhythms, as did Herman Chin-Loy's _Aquarius Dub,_ a set that mixed cuts of Chin-Loy's strongest productions (including Pablo's 'East Of The River Nile' and 'Cassava Piece') with a number of raw rhythms rapidly laid by the Now Generation. 'That was the first dub album, as far as I know,' insists Herman. 'Anybody that has a set always wanted a dub plate, and the dub plates those days were more or less just rhythm. Then the deejay would play the rhythm and talk on it, so I get Val Douglas, Michael Richards and Mikey Chung, about three or four musicians there, and about half an hour it take to do that in Dynamics' second studio. "Drum Song" and a couple others, "Home" by Ken Boothe, they were done there immediately. Whatever [rhythms] I had, like the Alton Ellis thing ["Alton's Official Daughter"], I just put on that too. Carlton Lee mixed the album – that's half an hour too.'

Another innovation from that period was displayed in Rupie Edwards' _Yamaha Skank,_ the first album entirely composed of different cuts of the same rhythm. In 1973 Rupie used a cut of the Uniques' 'My Conversation' to score two big chart successes with Shorty the President, a deejay who was born Derrick Thompson in the rural town of Trelawney in 1949. Shorty now lives in New Jersey, where he works as a telecommunications engineer; passing through London on business, now shorn of his locks, he explains how he came to record for Edwards.

'In the country where I come from is like plenty of farming: yam, bananas, Irish potatoes, cow, goat, so we always have something to eat. I leave the country and go to Kingston when I was nineteen. I was doing mechanic trade, but I didn't like too much of the mechanic work, because it's so dirty. I moved to New Haven when Duhaney Park was just built up. I was there with my sister, but I didn't too like the vibes of my sister, because she was living with a policeman – throw down his gun everywhere. I find a friend name Bongo George, he did have a small sound named Conquering Lion, so I always go down there and stay with him and make a little voice business live on the set. Rupie living over Duhaney Park, near the border, so he always come around. He is a rebel, he did have a girlfriend that live right beside us, so he hear me deejaying on the little set. One day we was under a tree, chanting, knocking some little pans, smoking a draw. They call me Stumpy them times, I didn't name Shorty [yet]. He just come up and say, "Stumpy, I'm going to record you today." '

This debut recording related the circumstances of a recent sound clash. 'How I get the lyrics "President A Mash Up The Resident", about three days before, we went to a dance with the sound named President, and that dance was crazy. The President a mash up the other sound, Stereo from Spanish Town – the front of the amplifier was like a jukebox, so they called it Stereo – and every man was talking about it. Rupie did carry U Roy Junior to studio to voice that track, but he couldn't manage it, so he have on the track "Here comes the pick of the past and this one's going to be the cream of the heart". After I hear that, I just come in and say, "Lit oh, you know, the President a mash up the resident, you rock so you come so you move so you go so... ." The lyrics was off of sound. You did have Bmgy Bunny and Bongo Herman in the studio. Rupie said, "What you could do, whistle something in there", so after I do it everybody go in for the second cut. After "President" it was "Yamaha Skank". Those two tune, it's the same rhythm, and I make it a number one, two of them in the one year. Me is the first deejay to do that.'

The popularity of Shorty's song of praise to the Japanese motorcycle made Rupie assemble the _Yamaha Skank_ album the following year, treating listeners to an endless succession of deejay, instrumental and dub cuts. The disc highlighted the infinite versatility of a good rhythm, and showed how any song has the potential to be endlessly transformed. 'He start to make a lot of version with the harmonica sound blowing, dubbing on,' Shorty recalls. 'Everybody always like to laugh after him, "You version too much, you do too much version!" But some of those version sell just like the original tune, because those times every sound man need version.'

Edwards himself says that it was easy then to get a cut of a rhythm produced by someone else, and notes that a popular rhythm could have a prolonged shelf-life when it was reshaped by various hands. 'Jimmy Riley sold me the "My Conversation" backing track, and then I did "Yamaha Skank" on that backing track. Then Bunny Lee come in and say he is the owner of the rhythm, and then I understand that Phil Pratt produced it, then I understand that Lloyd Charmers produced it... Bunny Lee sold me "Bangarang", then he sold me "Everybody Needs Love" and "Out Of Love" and some others, then I just do the versions. But that didn't stop Bunny Lee from using them afterwards.'

The appearance of dub and version albums greatly elevated the status of these Jamaican innovations, and they have both remained a constant feature of the island's popular music. As with the deejay innovations that were so closely allied to dub, in time the techniques of dub mixers were eventually adapted by producers in other countries, greatly influencing various dance music genres including house, garage, trip hop, trance and ambient. Dub's fruition, though almost incidental at the time, would prove to be one of the most significant of reggae's early 1970s' innovations, and the version phenomenon would help usher the music into other territories as the decade progressed.

Deejay's Choice: The Further Ascent of the Toaster

_You have other people that run the sound that don't want to give you the privilege 'cause them see that you have the power, but we bad boy of a the road so you have to demand._

Big Youth

_Working with Tubbys was a pleasure._

Prince Jazzbo.

AS JAMAICAN POP continued to wind its peculiar course, the status of the deejay was elevated further by a series of hit singles and album releases in 1973–4. Leading the way was Dennis Alcapone, who had recorded so much material for so many different producers by the end of 1972 that a glut of Alcapone albums hit the market at the same time.

'While I was at Duke Reid, me and Bunny Lee was friends, because Bunny Lee is not that serious a producer like Duke Reid and Coxsone, who is just business. Bunny would give you all two gal too – he is a man about town, if you understand,' the toaster reminisces. 'Me and Bunny get together and did the "Ripe Cherry" song off Eric Donaldson's "Cherry Oh Baby", "Alcapone Guns Don't Argue" and "It Must Come", a version of "Better Must Come". Bunny said Byron Lee was interested in an album, because Dynamic Sounds put out the "Ripe Cherry" and "Guns Don't Argue" singles. Word got around that I was working on that album, so Duke Reid wanted me to do an album, then Coxsone hear [about] it and wanted his own as well, and everybody was in a competition to get the first album out. I think Coxsone was the first of the whole of them with the _Forever Version_ album, then Dynamics with _Guns Don't Argue,_ then Duke put out _Soul To Soul, Deejay's Choice -_ in fact, when I came up to England on my first tour in 1973 Duke Reid actually gave me the tape to carry to Trojan records.'

'Deejay's Choice' was the first of many numbers to celebrate the unexpected rise to prominence of the deejay, and on this song Alcapone duly saluted contemporaries such as Big Youth, I Roy, Lizzy and U Roy by relating their distinguishing vocal traits. When asked about the song's inspiration, he was quick to admit that its theme originated from a rival deejay. 'When our sound system wasn't playing we used to go to Spanish Town to listen to Ruddy's , because Ruddy could afford whatever dub plates he wants. When Ruddy comes to Studio One or Treasure Isle, he would just tell them, "Put on plate what you made today." Ruddy's used to have a deejay named Mango, and Mango used to have that "Deejay's Choice" kind of thing going on the "Sidewalk Doctor" rhythm, so that's where I get the idea from.'

_Soul To Soul, Deejay's Choice_ has plenty of rapping momentum, with Alcapone and his spar Lizzy alternating places on the mike. In contrast, _King Of The Track,_ a further album that Dennis cut in this period for Bunny Lee, was voiced too hastily to be of much significance. 'When I was leaving Jamaica in 1973 Bunny Lee said, "Dennis, as you'r e going to England, I think you should walk with some material so that you can make some money. We'l l go by Tubby's tomorrow and make an album." He just run the track down and keep on running. When I said to him, "Striker, that's just a run down [practice run]", he said, "That tune there done, man. Next tune." '

**Drifter at the microphone:**

**I Roy the great [Beth Lesser]**

By the time of Alcapone's arrival in Britain, I Roy was firmly in ascendancy back home. Born Roy Samuel Reid in Saint Thomas in 1944,1 Roy operated a set called Soul Bunnies in the rock steady era, playing Friday nights at Rose Lane in downtown Kingston. A civil servant working at Customs and Excise, Reid had more ready cash than some of his peers and made a point of always being immaculately dressed. His microphone talents enabled him to move in 1968 to Son's Junior, a sound system with an extensive selection of Studio One dub plates based at the New Yorker club in Spanish Town. At the end of the sixties, when Son's proprietor moved abroad, I Roy became the star deejay of Ruddy Redwood's Supreme Ruler of Sound. When U Roy hit with 'Wake The Town', I Roy moved to the rival Spanish Town set called Stereo. His verbal skills drew the attention of producer Harry Mudie, who cut the toaster's debut disc, 'Hearts Don't Leap', towards the end of 1970. I Roy voiced further songs for Mudie, including a version of Dennis Walks' chilling 'Drifter', and helped distribute Mudie's product on a Honda motorcycle. As he started to branch out and record for other producers, the quick-witted toaster began chatting on the Clarendon sound V-Rocket, and ended up temporarily filling U Roy's shoes on King Tubby's Hi Fi in 1972. It was in the same year that I Roy voiced the arresting 'Sidewalk Killer' for Ruddy, making optimum use of Tommy McCook's sax-and-flute reworking of Phyllis Dillon's haunting cover of Marlena Shaw's soul hit 'Woman Of The Ghetto'; the disc was so popular that Roy voiced an alternative version, the atmospheric 'Dr Phibbs.'

**Puppy on the scene: Gussie Clarke [Courtesy of Gussie Clarke/Motion]**

I Roy's debut album, _Presenting I Roy,_ captured the deejay at his height of competence. The album was compiled by Gussie Clarke, a record importer and aspiring producer who was then so young that he was known on the scene as Puppy. Augustus Clarke is now a very busy man who presides over Anchor, the biggest recording studio on the island, complete with CD duplication and numerous other facilities. As with many of his peers, he came to record production through involvement with sound systems. 'I grew up downtown, Beeston Street and Church Street, with an adoptive mother, she usually work with the government – just an ordinary poor lady, nothing unique about her except her heart. Music was one of those things that was within you, and I just love music. In those days an amplifier was made by buying parts, so I usually buy parts for the amplifiers – save it from lunch money. I was kind of a born entrepreneur: I used to have a bicycle and sell rides to the school gates to get parts, and I usually ask for foreign records from the States and sell them to all the sound systems. I graduated from Kingston College in '71, so I was actually involved in having the sound system King Gussie's Hi Fi prior to '71. After that I had this dub cutting machine – I think we bought it from Treasure Isle. Get it working downtown at a home studio in a wooden building upstairs at 79½ Church Street – that's where we started the first productions, cutting dubs for all these sound systems. I swapped an old amplifier to Errol Dunkley for the use of a rhythm and we used the rhythm to voice U Roy's "The Higher The Mountain", that was the first thing.'

It was the close links he formed supplying exclusives to sound system operators and cutting dub plates for upcoming producers that enabled Gussie to hand-pick the choice rhythms used for I Roy's debut LP. Touching on a range of subjects, from the Rastafari-praising 'Red Gold And Green' to the social realism of 'Pusher Man' and 'Peace', Roy kept the pace consistently relaxed. Even when proffering a lyrical deluge as in his forceful castigation of freeloaders on 'Black Man Time', a witty reworking of Lloyd Parks' 'Slaving', the toaster made it seem effortless. It was this same laid-back confidence that characterized the follow-up _Hell And Sorrow set,_ which compiled work cut for various smaller producers. Thematically, Roy demonstrated on songs like 'Black And Proud' the influence of American black power movements, and on 'Buck And The Preacher' an enduring love of popular films. A distinguishing musical feature of the album is its generally increased use of echo and delay, much of which came courtesy of King Tubby.

The popularity of these albums in Britain encouraged I Roy to follow Dennis Alcapone to London in late 1973, where he remained for the better part of a year. He made several live appearances backed by rising local band Matumbi, and became a star feature of Lloydie Coxsone's sound system residency at the Roaring Twenties club in the West End.

I Roy's composure was matched by that of a tall, lanky dread with a deeper voice; known as Big Youth, he became something of a sensation through recordings cut in 1972–3. Manley Augustus Buchanan was born in the Southeast Kingston ghetto of Rae Town in 1949, and regards his religious upbringing as having been particularly formative. 'My mother is a Revivalist preacher and my mother was my father also, because she have to take care of everything, including my three sisters and one brother. I was born at la Water Street in Rae Town, and I move to 132 Matches Lane in the heart of the city, because my mother always have to be moving to get somewhere she can keep her church and preach. That wasn't the road I take, but that teach me Rastafari, because I was so biblical that the love was already in me. But I wasn't ready for Christianity and the condition of Christ.'

Before launching himself on a musical career, Big Youth repaired and maintained machines around Kingston. 'I was a mechanic at Harvey's Cab Company in Rae Town, that's where I learn trade. Then when the Kinston Sheraton was building, I used to do diesel mechanic work on the site. That was the last time I work.'

Though Big Youth had deejay aspirations from the time of U Roy's success, he found sound system operatives reluctant to allow him a chance to prove himself, and had to use intimidating tactics to find his way to the mike around 1971. 'You have other people that run the sound that don't want to give you the privilege 'cause them see that you have the power,' he explains backstage at London's millennial Peace and Love festival, 'but we a bad boy offa the road, so you have to demand. One night you have a sound named [Down South] the President [featuring I Roy]. Errol Scorcher and my brethren keep the dance and them say it's me going to have to go mash it. I go to the dance and just use the one song "Satta Massa Ganna": "A wiggle wiggle wiggle wonna, you no on-ya but you born-ya", and mash up the whole place the night. We nice it up, and it was a new star born.'

Big Youth came to the limelight through working on Lord Tippertone, a downtown set initially called Finger Tone that was based at Princess Street; his popularity enabled him to supersede fellow neighbourhood tough Jah Stitch as regular boss of the microphone. Big Youth says he consciously strove to bring the uplifting spirituality of Rastafari into his microphone chants, a direct reaction to the apolitical lyrics set as standard by U Roy at Treasure Isle. 'It just happened that I start to run the Tipper thing a spiritual way, and tell people must make love and not war, because war ugly and love lovely, 'cause me have a whole heap of brethren that me see just dead. Babylon or them friend or a next gang kill them through differences where they can't agree, so all those things teach me knowledge, and Jah himself. We used to hear about "Hit me back" and "Chick a bow, chick a bow, chick a bow wow wow", but I wasn't into the "Hit me back" and "bow" thing. I see where we need to say, "Live it up Jah", "Hit me front and never hit me back", 'cause we'r e moving forward. We'r e not into no bend down – we'r e getting up.'

Big Youth says it was West Kingston producer Ivan Radway – known as 'One Foot Jimmy' because he had lost a leg in his youth in the infamous Kendal train crash – who first approached him to record in early 1972 after he had a success with Errol Dunkley's 'Black Cinderella'. But Gregory Isaacs beat Radway to the draw and captured the toaster's talent first, placing Big Youth over Dunkley's cut of the oft-versioned 'Movie Star'. 'Jimmy Radway wanted me to come and toast on "Black Cinderella", but he was joking, and Gregory Isaacs already hear me working the sound, so Gregory just jump the gun, and that's where I do "Movie Man": "If you'r e coming from far in a bus or a car, man I'm begging you make love and not war, I'm so sad to say that when you deal with war you have to stay far. Makes things right to do things right in the middle of the night, and promise me you would do that." The same day I did the "Black Cinderella", and it goes on for a couple of weeks.'

Gregory says he came to produce Big Youth's first recording because _of_ 'the vibes of how I circulate in the ghetto. I see Big Youth as a youth with a lot of talent. Him come and blast off differently, seen? Everyone start take on to him – he's a very great deejay. We were friends, because him used to cook food for me.'

Errol Dunkley says the cut of 'Movie Star' that he recorded with Gregory Isaacs marked the formation of the African Museum label. 'I was at Coxsone – me, Dennis Brown, Horace Andy – until Wailing Souls started recording for Coxsone. I feel down all the time, because nothing ain't happening. Me and Dennis, sometimes we deh-deh and have no money, eat no food. I decide to move on after Coxsone and I fall out over something – I left Studio One with tears in my eyes, even asked Dennis if he's coming with me. Gregoiy Isaacs was singing for Rupie Edwards. Nothing wasn't really happening for him – he never really had a hit song. Gregory took me to Rupie Edwards and I did a medley of all my hit songs, because at the time it was a medley thing happening, but it was only a few that really hit, and mine was a hit. Then Gregory and I start working together. We form this African Museum label and we did three songs: wTe did over [Freddy McKay's ] "Picture On The Wall" rhythm and Winston Wright do a little keyboard. We did that instrumental song, then I did "Movie Star", then Gregory did "Look Before You Leap". We wrere working like half and half: we rent the studio and hire the musicians, and any amount of money that will come we split it down the middle. We did another session, and I did "Darling Ooh" and Gregory did "My Only Lover". After I did "Movie Star" I did "Black Cinderella" for Jimmy Radway, a good writer. He born and grow in the west of the city, same like us. He was a businessman, but he write songs like "Mother Liza" that Leroy Smart sing. I was supposed to sing that song, and another song called "Hell And Sorrow", [recorded by] Hortense Ellis.'

As Dunkley had licensed 'Darling Ooh' to Rupie Edwards, Edwards reaped the lion's share of proceeds when the song hit. 'Me sell it to Rupie Edwards and regretted it, because the song was number one for fourteen weeks in Jamaica, and it sell a lot on export. But I used to sell Sonia Pottinger "Movie Star" – that's how she get to know me. She said, "Let's do a thing" – that's how I did my first album.'

The LP, _Presenting Errol Dunkley,_ had the first cut of 'A Little Way Different', one of Dunkley's most popular tunes; Errol says the song was inspired by his rivalry with Dennis Brown. 'Delroy Wilson was the first kid in Jamaica doing recording, then I was the second kid. I was like Delroy's rival, then Dennis come, and Dennis was like my rival. They used to compare us together. Sometimes they say me and Dennis sound alike, and this is how this song come up. If you sing the song I sing, you can still hear the difference.'

Such work, and its proceeds, signalled the end of Dunkley's involvement in African Museum. 'Gregory and I split at the time, because we had an office in Orange Street, but them time Gregory were really short-tempered. Him and the landlord couldn't get on, so we had to pack the office up, and I get so downhearted with him I form my own label called Silver Ring. I had a store at the time in Honour Town and I had a couple of jukeboxes, 'cause [what] I wanted were to _go_ into the jukebox business. All my equipment was from money made from that album.'

Gregory continued his self-productions on African Museum, but the song that brought him widespread fame in Jamaica was 'All I Have Is Love', one of the first hits recorded at Channel One, a studio opened by local entrepreneur Joseph Hoo-Kim in the heart of the Maxfield Park ghetto. 'Joe Hoo-Kim call me one day and said, "The studio just done. Come and test out the studio – you are free,"' producer Phil Pratt recalls. 'So I brought my musicians with me and Gregory Isaacs. He arranged the horn section and the bass line and wrote the song as well. "All I Have Is Love", that was Gregory Isaacs' first number one.'

'We gave everybody a free try,' Joseph Hoo-Kim confirms at the pressing plant he operates today in Brooklyn, 'because I didn't understand anything about running a session and I want to get experience. So any producer that was in the business, it was a day we usually give them, just to let them experience it and maybe get their business.'

Joseph was the oldest of four brothers, all of whom would eventually be involved in running the studio. 'I was born in 1942,' he relates. 'Paul comes after me, then Kenneth and Ernie.' The Hoo-Kims are typically described as Chinese, but like most Jamaicans turn out to have a mixed heritage. 'My father is from China. He was going to Panama in '26, and he stopped off in Jamaica and never go to Panama. My mother, born in Jamaica, was half-Jew and half- Chinese – her [sur] name was Solomon. They were running a ice cream parlour and a rum bar at the corner of Maxfield Avenue and Spanish Town Road, and then we moved to 29 Maxfield Avenue in '66. It was a ice cream parlour and a wholesale liquor store, and the property belongs to us. My brother- in-law usually work with a company that operate iukebox, which was Issa's, and sometimes when he's going to the country he usually pick me up. Then Issa begin to sell out the boxes and I acquired some, and that is where I started from. I think the jukebox business started about I960.'

**Ernest Hoo-Kim [Beth Lesser]**

It was a fateful visit to Dynamic Sound that inspired Joseph to build Channel One. 'John Holt and I grew up together – we know each other from we was small. He takes me to Dynamic one day and I was fascinated with the sound in the studio – the sound just hold me right there, and I said, "This is what I want to be in." Bill Garnett is the one that select the equipment. I paid 38,000 dollars for a API console, one of the most expensive on the market, maybe 60,000 US dollars for the console and the two tape machines. The studio opened 1972, with just four tracks. Bunny Lee run the first session: it was "Can I Change My Mind" with Delroy Wilson, the musicians were Soul Syndicate – that was a trial session really. I started the studio myself, but Ernest came into it after we had a engineer problem – he usually fix jukeboxes and operate one-armed bandits. The original engineer was Syd Bucknor, he was there for about a year. During the period when we start up, Bunny Lee said, "The studio doesn't sound good", and I have in the most expensive console. I did an LP with Alton Ellis that I couldn't release. The bass was tied with the drum – it wasn't record[ed] properly. Then we make session[s] and they were all flops, and I decided to lay back and see what we are doing wrong. But the main thing was about the sound. After Syd Bucknor, we decided to go into the studio ourselves. The first record that we put out was "Don't Give Up The Fight", Gladdy and Stranger Cole. Then we came out with hits: [Delroy Wilson's ] "It's A Shame", "Call On Me", [Horace Andy's ] "Girl I Love You".'

While Channel One was in the process of establishing itself, Big Youth was gaining popularity on vinyl. His second recording, 'Tell It Black', voiced on the emotive rendition of Peter Green's 'Black Magic Woman' recorded by Dennis Brown and Soul Syndicate for Phil Pratt, was the first of many Big Youth discs to make an impact. ' "Tell It Black" and "Phil Pratt Thing", those start to create a little heat,' the toaster recalls. 'Then the other producers want me – they all start coming. People have to wake me up out of my bed and we took a bike in the studio. We did "S 90 Skank" the same day we did "Chi Chi Run". The two of them went up to number one. I did things for Glen Brown too that - same day some great things happen on that Friday.'

It was 'S 90 Skank' that really drew the best of Big Youth's abilities on record, again aided by perceptive production from Keith Hudson. Youth says it was personal experience he spoke of on the record, warning about the consequences _of_ excessive speed. 'Me was riding a bike and crash at 12.20 in the afternoon, wake up at about 7.30 in the night.' He pauses momentarily to point out some cranial scarring. 'While they pronounce me dead, I was there visioning how I'm singing and Jah tell me me must go round the world and sing "Jah". So I say, "If you ride like lightning, you will crash like thunder" – I get some bad crash. I used to ride wild, you know.'

The success of that disc in particular, and of the Prince Buster-produced 'Chi Chi Run', made Big Youth in high demand on the Kingston scene. 'Everybody hearing this "Jah Jah Jah, Jah wah wah rock", so everybody want a piece, 'cause it's the science [magic or sorcery] that – is that open the key to reggae music. Then Joe Gibbs want me, Miss Pottinger and Derrick Harriott, and I had seven tunes in the chart at the same time, with five in the two top tens.' For Gibbs, Youth scored high with the boxing commentary 'Foreman Versus Frazier'; 'Cool Breeze' was a popular cut of Keith and Tex's 'Stop That Train', cut for Derrick Harriott; even the Wailers got in on the act, asking Youth to voice a deejay cut of their self-produced 'Craven Choke Puppy'. 'Them time Bob Marley them a do bad,' the toaster recalls. 'Them never have nothing! Me do "Craven A Go Choke Puppy" so Rita [Marley] can go buy some food, but them no treat me good.'

After such a steady stream of successful singles, a strong album consolidated his popularity both at home and abroad. As with I Roy's debut set, Big Youth's _Screaming Target_ was put out by Gussie Clarke in 1973. Youth makes full use of the disc's impeccably chosen rhythms, perpetuating the dejected message of Leroy Smart's 'Shame And Ambition' on 'Pride And Joy Rock', continuing the mournful determination of Gregory Isaacs' 'One One Cocoa' on 'One Of These Fine Days', and subverting KC White's recut of the oft-versioned 'No No No' for both the ghetto description of 'Concrete Jungle' and the more famous gangster-movie commentary 'Screaming Target'. 'This guy was firing his gun wilder than Clint Eastwood, so I said this one was ranker than Dirty Harry,' explains Youth of the cryptic introduction to the title track.

It was inevitable that such an individually minded artist would go into self-production to acquire greater financial reward and artistic control, so Big Youth launched the Negusa Negast and Augustus Buchanan labels. He later supplemented by imprints such as Tanasha and Nichola Delita, the latter named after one of his daughters. In 1974 he issued the double album _Reggae Phenomenon_ on, a portion _of_ which the toaster controversially branched out into the singing arena.

'That is when me get good,' he recounts, 'get conscious and start defend the African daughter them. Me take War's "The World Is A Ghetto" and turn it round and call it "Streets In Africa" with D. Brown – it give me much strength. Me do "Love Me Forever", "Hot Stock", "Downtown Kingston Pollution", "Hell Is For Heroes", "African Daughter" and [the Temptations'] "Papa Was A Rolling Stone", so that is when I start get versatile, but some of the fool them say me can't sing. That was the better part where I was achieving and seeing my career looking progressive.' And why, exactly, was Big Youth inspired to sing? 'Because in a lot of audiences, it's not everyone could understand the "dee dee dah dah dee dee dey", so you have to show them that Big Youth have something inna him – me can sing, so me a go touch some big song all of them know. When me come with [Dionne Warwick's ] "Touch Me In The Morning", God cry. Seeing the women them love me more, me have to start hide from girl. Me show them me versatility because me creative, me have a force to generate.'

Though Big Youth's singing technique seems largely inspired by the jazz tradition, he reveals that he takes his greatest inspiration from female soul vocalists. 'Me practise off of the woman them, like Diana Ross, and Dionne Warwick was my favourite, from early until now. Lady D now have the edge, because she take some wider notes.'

Another deejay to rise from live appearances on Tippertone was Doctor Alimantado, initially known as Winston Cool or Prince Winston. Born Winston Thompson in the early 1950s, Tado is a good-natured Rasta with a sharp sense of humour. Widely travelled, he is currently based in West Africa.

Tado says he ran away from his downtown Kingston home at the age of eight to live with rough people in the slums. His early experiences of hardship caused him to gravita towards Rastafari and brought about some conflict with his parents. His main deejay inspiration was Sir George the Atomic's Prince Rough, a toaster who always drew large crowds before he died in the early seventies; U Roy was another role model. One of Thompson's earliest recorded efforts was 'No Go On So' for small producer H. 'Bussa' Marston, but it was work for Lee Perry in 1971–2 that brought Winston wider recognition in Jamaica.

'I was on Tippertone, the sound that made Big Youth famous,' he boasts, 'and the Upsetter came to one of the dance and said I should come and do some songs for him. Jah Stitch used to be around my sound, and Jah Stitch used to play Upsetter's sound, so that's how it really came about. I did songs like "Macabee The Third", "Piece Of My Heart", "Tip Of My Tongue".'

Though his smooth embellishments of 'Piece Of My Heart' gave hints of the style he was to develop a few years later, it was in combination with Junior Byles that Winston's artistry first shone. Not only did he mutter ominous Rasta proclamations on 'Ital Version', the flip side of Junior's anthem-like 'Beat Down Babylon', but the thoughtful meditation on his African homeland delivered on a cut of Byles' heartfelt 'Place Called Africa' fully captured the reverence that alienated Rastafari accorded their ancestral continent. The toaster has also spoken of trying to voice a tune as a singer for Scratch, but a laughing Upsetter told Winston he should stick to toasting and as a result it would be several years before he dared to voice a singing disc.

In 1973 Winston founded the Vital Food label, renaming himself Doctor Alimantado 'The Ital Surgeon', with the self-produced 'Just The Other Day', a woeful comment on the crippling inflation that was then gripping Jamaica, voiced at King Tubby's studio over a cut of the Flames' great 'Zion' rhythm obtained from Lee Perry. From his base at 40 Beeston Street, Alimantado issued further stunners, sometimes on the Ital Sounds label, including the half-sung, optimistic plea for unity called 'Ride On'. Setting up his own label was partly a reaction to the negative attitude of larger entrepreneurs; though the bulk of his subsequent work was self-produced, he occasionally voiced material for smaller producers.

**Dr Alimantado: The Ital Surgeon [David Katz]**

It was the constantly echoing voice bouncing through 'Best Dressed Chicken In Town' that caused a storm on its release in 1974, sparking interest in the toaster in the UK; the song's cryptic lyrics referred to an advertisement for a supermarket poultry brand. According to Alimantado, the rhythm track for 'Best Dressed Chicken' was the result of a jam session at Dynamics funded by Lenroy Moffatt and a number of other individuals; though spontaneously created, the chord structure was later found to be similar to Bill Withers' 'Ain't No Sunshine', previously covered in reggae by Ken Boothe. Many cuts of Lenroy Moffatt's rhythm would be altered by a number of artists, and Tado himself used the rhythm for alternative cuts such as the religious 'Plead I Cause', the topical 'Oil Crisis' and the nonsensical 'She Wreng Up', but 'Best Dressed Chicken' is definitely the most inspiring. Tado explains that it was his close work with Lee Perry at the Black Ark that determined the shape of the tune. 'I'v e got an innovative mind where music is concerned, and so has Mr Perry. Put the two of us together and the result is "Best Dressed Chicken". It was an innovation I had in Randy's studio, but if you go to Mr Perry with an idea he doesn't just handle it as though he's an engineer, he handles it as though it's his thing – he puts his initiative behind it.'

**The Best Dressed Chicken [Bernard Warin]**

By the time Doctor Alimantado recorded 'Best Dressed Chicken In Town' Dennis Alcapone was already spending most of his time in Britain, though he returned to Jamaica for sporadic recordings; since 1979 he has been permanently based on the eastern edge of London. The toaster expresses some ambiguity when reflecting on his first trips abroad. When I came to London in 1973, I met up with the Pioneers. Luddy Crooks used to take me to the Q Club in Praed Street, Paddington quite regularly, because at that time Q Club was swinging. Pioneers and Nicky Thomas was living the high life, because they had tunes in the charts, so it was more or less the jet set that would go to that club. They used to take me down there and introduce me to some top-class whores. When I go back to Jamaica Harry J just built up his studio, so Luddy and I went to Harry J and did the album _Belch It Off._ I don't have fond memories of that album. It is a strange album, because that wasn't something that was planned.'

Dennis explains that his permanent emigration to the UK stemmed from various complications in his personal life. 'After my first trip to London I went back home and had a terrible bike accident, and it's like I lose something out of that accident. I lose two of my front teeth, because my head went inna this van, and I had a girl on the back of the bike and she drop inna the middle of the road. After I get better, I come back up to England with the Jamaica Showcase, which was Dennis Brown, Toots and the Maytals, Cynthia Richards and Skin Flesh and Bones with Al Brown. That's when I didn't have roots any more in Jamaica, 'cause from '74 I overstayed my time here. My father died, and I couldn't go back to Jamaica because my papers wasn't sorted, and the government said if I leave the country I wouldn't be able to come back in. So I got married, and that's how I really get caught up in the England thing. In Jamaica the violence was going on and the dance was being shot down, a whole heap of shooting going on. The runnings was quite different here – it was a cool operation compared to down there. Dance couldn't go on, because if the police didn't shoot it down the rude boy did, so that's one _of_ the reasons I guess that swing me a bit.'

Since he was away from Jamaica for such extended periods, Dennis Alcapone's influence naturally dropped at home. But before leaving the island he passed the deejay baton to Lester Bullocks, a protege who would gain greater fame as Dillinger. Born in 1953, he was raised by his grandmother on the edge of greater Kingston in Saint Andrew. 'My mother was living in America, so I was living with my grandma. She used to sell in the market on Friday,' he says, leaning against an oil drum outside Tuff Gong studio. 'Down the years I'v e been inspired by U Roy, Alcapone, King Stitt – deejays before my time.'

Alcapone distinctly remembers the thin young man's early enthusiasm. 'Dillinger was living just across the way, so whenever the sound is playing he always come right beside the amplifier. One night him ask me fi give him a talk over the mike.

He wasn't brilliant, but you could hear that there was something. Him used to come more often when I'm playing and work himself in.'

Dillinger subsequently became the leading deejay on a sound called Smith the Weapon, based on Payne Avenue off Spanish Town Road. Anxious to record, he began doing the rounds of Kingston studios: however, he encountered little interest and much resistance until Lee Perry decided to give him a chance at Dynamics in 1973. 'I remember Scratch voice him for about two days straight,' Alcapone recalls, 'because inna them days, when them man there get hold of a man, them make sure them get as much as them can, just in case the man bust out. But really and truly Dillinger wasn't in his peak yet, so those tracks didn't make an impact.'

As he was something of an apprentice to Dennis Alcapone, Lester Bullocks originally called himself Alcapone Junior, but Lee Perry deemed the name Dillinger more suitable and it has stuck with the toaster ever since. Though singles such as the topical 'Middle East Rock' and rebel-praising 'Headquarters' were taken from his initial session, much of the material was left unissued. This was perhaps due to Dillinger's uncertain delivery resulting from his lack of recording experience.

His first big hit, 'Platt Skank', was for upcoming producer Phil Pratt; the song decried the vanity of men who plait their hair. Dillinger then cut a few discs for spiritual melodica player and visionary producer Augustus Pablo, including the hard-to-fathom 'Brace A Boy', recorded in combination with a certain Clive; apparently the song refers to the braces that hold up little boys' short pants. He continued to record on a freelance basis, cutting several memorable singles along the way: 'I was campaigning, I was like a freelancer. I do a couple songs for Abyssinians, a version of "Satta Massa Ganna" [called "I Saw E Saw"] and "Crashie Project", and a couple for independent producers like Bunny Lee and GG records.' Dillinger also recorded extensively for Coxsone Dodd, who eventually issued the compelling _Ready Natty Dreadie_ album.

**Deejay for hire: Dillinger [Adrian Thomas]**

Another deejay to reach the Jamaican charts in 1973 was Prince Jazzbo, a toaster whose deep voice bordered on the menacing. Born Linval Carter around 1950, Jazzbo had a rough urban upbringing: he describes himself as a 'street boy' whose parents were engaged in 'badness'. Meeting the heavily built, domineering toaster face to face at Kingston's Countryside Club, it is easy to believe; he has several prominent facial scars and behaves in a manner that can only be described as intimidating. In his largely unsupervised youth Jazzbo naturally gravitated to the downtown Kingston music scene, gaining valuable contacts among artists and others in the industry. 'Me know Scratch, Lee Perry, from boy days, and Bob Marley and the Upsetters.' Jazzbo's deejay apprenticeship came on the Whip sound system in Spanish Town. In 1972 he talked his way into Studio One, where his first take of 'Crab Walking', voiced on Horace Andy's 'Skylarking', resulted in a major hit; Jazzbo's wild cut mixed dance-craze motivation with snatches of proverbs and Rastafari intonation, all delivered in a highly charged, low growl.

Other intense Studio One singles followed, including the stern 'Crime Don't Pay' and the devoted 'Imperial I' (over Burning Spear's 'Door Peep'), but Coxsone held back the bulk of his material. His debut album, _Choice Of Version,_ was not issued until 1990, eighteen years after it was voiced. Coxsone's hesitancy led Jazzbo to cut discs for the competition by the end of 1972, first on sides such as 'Mr Harry Skank', 'Meaning Of One' and 'Mr Want All' for Glen Brown. 'Inna the seventies, Glen Brown is the man who give me a lot of encouragement,' the toaster confirms. 'He get me to be self-reliant.' Despite Coxsone's reluctance to promote the greater portion of his work, Jazzbo insists he holds no grudge against him today. 'Coxsone is a nice producer and I respect him very much. Coxsone Downbeat's the best producer inna the whole reggae industry. Me never have nothing bad fi say about Coxsone, because Coxsone make me popular and make the music industry get so established that millions of people are eating food out of it.'

After hooking up with Glen Brown, Jazzbo made his first crude attempts at self-production by cutting further versions of Brown's 'At The Cross Roads' rhythm: 'Plum Plum' had sexually suggestive imagery, incongruously introduced by a religious phrase, whilst 'Crankibine' decried the negative tendencies of loose females, its instrumental B-side utilizing peculiar, out-of-time instrumentation. 'The off-beat piano is me,' Jazzbo consented, 'and I'm playing a melodica on it as well. It's just a natural mystic: music is a thing where you just see it before you even make it – you just put it together and put it out.' These versions were voiced at the studio of King Tubby, with whom Jazzbo often collaborated. 'Working with Tubbys was a pleasure. I work with Tubbys from 1972.'

**From street boy to star deejay:**

**Prince Jazzbo [Beth Lesser]**

After releasing sporadic singles on the Count 123, Mr Funny and Brisco labels, Jazzbo voiced his first single for Lee Perry at the producer's recently inaugurated Black Ark studio at the start of 1974. 'Penny Reel' had a cool stream of proverbs related by the deejay, and 'Good Things' warned of the dangers of truancy before Jazzbo lost his train of thought, rendering much of the song an instrumental. Later that year and into the next, Jazzbo's international fame spread as a result of his infamous feud with I Roy, charted on a series of clashing discs instigated by the owner of a record shop in Toronto with the assistance of Bunny Lee. As I Roy explained to radio disc jockey David Rodigan, 'It all started when George from Monica Records at 1553 Eglington Avenue West in Toronto came to Jamaica. He's a producer and he runs one of the biggest black record shops in Canada and he wanted some singles, one from me and one from Jazzbo, so we go round by King Tubby's studio and Bunny Lee, as the producer whe have the rhythms them now, he make Jazzbo go into the studio first fi do him track. Well, Jazzbo in the studio about an hour-and-a-half, just everybody a laugh, like we down a wharf. A murder me a tell you, him couldn't get the lyrics right! Him couldn't get the feel, so Striker Lee say, "What happen, Jazzbo. Come out of the studio, make I Roy go do him tune now, man." I go into the studio and say, "Tubby, roll the tape!" through I-man nah shape and them t'i ng there, and I just open my mouth and say, well, "Prince Jazzbo, if you was a juke box, I wouldn't put a dime in your slot. Move out of the way!" That was the first take. This tune lame him up bad, pure dub wounds to him head top, have him under tight wraps them time there. The whole thing was a joke, but it becomes a reality. About a week after, the record come out and start bubbling at the record shops all over the place. Bunny Lee take Jazzbo and say, "You no hear the one I Roy make? You know the man a take liberty with you? Come we go a studio, make a tune about I Roy!" and Jazzbo go straight to me head.'

The pair's first sorties were built around insults: on 'Straight To Jazzbo's Head' Roy accused Jazzbo of ugliness, whilst on 'Straight To I Roy's Head' Jazzbo claimed I Roy was an imitator of U Roy. The next round contained more serious allegations: in 'Jazzbo Have Fe Run', I Roy made reference to an incident said to have taken place near a downtown drugstore, in which Jazzbo was attacked by music promoter Trevor 'Leggo Beast' Douglas for plagiarizing the lyrics of another deejay. 'Big Youth a do a tune, "Wise Shepherd", and Jazzbo go in the studio and a listen Big Youth's tune. Before Jah Youth's tune come out a street, Jazzbo make a tune now, "Wise Shepherd", with the same lyrics as Jah Youth's own. So him no come a town now, because at that time, him live out in Cockburn Pen in a likkle pig pen. When him come town to North Parade, and him profile and come inna Randy's with him basket with him record them, and Leggo Beast go see him – that time Leggo Beast 'mongst Jah Youth – one lick with a bottle, and Jazzbo drop flat under a moving van! Head bust up and all them thing, and when the people see that, and the van a run over him head and Jazzbo get up... it's like a racehorse, when them move off and jump a hurdle. Him run past the drug store whe name Kincaid, and me just make a tune say, "Him run past Kincaid, him couldn't get no first aid, him get lick with a hand grenade." '

**The survivor: Jah Stitch [Beth Lesser]**

Jazzbo's retort in 'Gal Boy I Roy' had bite, but was ultimately weaker; his insistence that 'If deejay was your trade, you wouldn't talk about Kincaid' only emphasized the conflict with Big Youth's associate, and his claim that 'If I wasn't ugly, you couldn't call my name in your record to get promotion' was hardly an assertion of superiority. When I Roy struck back with 'Padlock' Jazzbo dropped out of the contest, and Bunny Lee had to convince singer Derrick Morgan to aim a volley at I Roy with 'I Roy The Chiney Come Round'; but Roy swiftly eliminated the competition entirely with the gloating 'Straight To Der-Morgan's Head'.

The feud between Prince Jazzbo and I Roy recalls the earlier vinyl battle waged by Derrick Morgan and Prince Buster; though their recorded attacks had a nasty edge, privately the parties remained on friendly terms, and I Roy would later record a series of tunes with Jazzbo in the producer's chair. These battles prefaced other recorded jousts in the US hip hop scene, such as that waged by LL Cool J against Kool Moe Dee and Roxanne Shante versus UTFO, as well as later Jamaican deejay battles between Beenie Man and Bounty Killer; a coffin was even paraded on stage when those two toasters clashed in the late 1990s. But such rivalry wras not always a matter of fun and games or symbolic conflict. In 1975 Jah Stitch was wrongly blamed for the death of one of the key members of Tippertone sound, as Stitch had left Tippertone to work for a new set called Black Harmony; since the two sounds were scheduled to clash, some people felt Stitch must have been responsible for orchestrating his rival's death. Stitch was subsequently shot in the face at point-blank range in the shop next door to the Wailers' record shack, but miraculously survived after being taken to hospital by I Roy and percussionist Sky High.

The deejay experimentation recounted in this chapter was among the most important elements of the evolving reggae continuum. The album successes of U Roy, Big Youth and I Roy showed that the art of toasting had reached a new high in the mid-1970s; since then the status of the deejay has never slipped.

None Shall Escape The Judgement: The Flyers and Rockers Styles

_He pioneered the 'deejay' records through Hugh Roy, then brought in the 'version' flipside styling. His own unique engineering skills produced the almighty 'dub', which has now evolved into the very latest – the now sound – 'styling symbols' or simply flyers'... Tubby will always be at the roots of Jamaican sounds._

AS THE DEEJAYS were bringing more rants and chants into the vinyl arena, the dominant sound was shifting again as a result of rhythmic innovations from the Aggrovators, a Soul Syndicate spin-off utilized by Bunny Lee. Just as Lee had made Soul Syndicate the premier backing band at the start of the decade, so did his command of the Aggrovators bring about momentous change.

Bunny says the name Aggrovators came from an expression used by Eddy Grant, the Guyanese singer who was then leading mixed crossover group the Equals in London. 'Me used to have the Bunny Lee All Star, 'til you hear Joe Gibbs come with the Joe Gibbs All Star, and it never fair to the musicians neither, because me or Joe Gibbs can't play a note 'pon a guitar. Me and Eddy Grant start spar from inna the sixties, and every time you say something, Eddy say, "That's aggro, man! You'r e causing me aggro!", because you'r e aggravating him. Me start call my musicians the Aggrovators, and the Aggrovators tear up some music inna the seventies right back to inna the eighties.'

The Aggrovators had a loose line-up, typically featuring Chinna and Tony Chin on guitar and Bernard 'Touter' Harvey on organ. Santa was the mainstay on drums, but Carlton Barrett and 'Benbow' Creary sometimes took his place. On bass Family Man gave way to George Fullwood, occasionally supplanted by Earl 'Bagga' Walker, who in turn was replaced by Robbie Shakespeare, a young protege of Family Man from an East Kingston ghetto who had something of a tough reputation. Shakespeare's heavy bass lines gave the Aggrovators' material its solid anchorage, and he eventually became the band leader.

'Growing up from school, what I really like was drums,' Shakespeare says, leaning back in a chair on the balcony at Sonic Sounds studio. 'I used to have drumsticks and play on a bench, and then guitar got my attention – rock and roll lead guitar. When [I] hear the bass, the bass sound powerful and it make a difference. Jackie Jackson had an album where he stand up with a bass, and it always fascinate me – he was one of my greatest inspirations. Coming from school, I used to hear Jackie Jackson on [John Holt's ] "Ali Baba", every one of them Treasure Isle stuff. My older brother Lloyd, that time he had a group named the Emotions. In the group he have an acoustic guitar, and I used to trouble it. My first real encounter with a bass guitar was [when] Hippy Boys was doing some rehearsal – Family Man was playing. At that time, I didn't know it was really bass. Family Man started showing me the songs, so when Family Man left Hippy Boys I was the lad to come in. They didn't like to pay money, but I didn't care about the money then.'

The rhythmic style most associated with the Aggrovators was a 1974 innovation called 'flyers'. This was the 'flying cymbal' sound built on a mechanized high-hat adapted from the 'Philly Bump' soul beat developed by Philadelphia studio ensemble MFSB, whose song 'The Sound Of Philadelphia' (aka 'TSOP') was the theme of the popular American television show _Soul Train._ According to Santa Davis, the beat was first used on a song called 'None Shall Escape The Judgement'. 'MFSB, with "The Sound Of Philadelphia", they use a lot of that. The drummer was a favourite drummer of mine, and I said, "Damn, let's try that in a reggae sound." "None Shall Escape The Judgement" came up, and I started the song with that. Bunny Lee wanted that in every song. He was the one who name it "flying cymbal", which is an open-and-closed high-hat. Then the whole thing started ballooning.'

**Robbie Shakespeare [Beth Lesser]**

'None Shall Escape The Judgement' was written by Earl Zero, who voiced the song first for Bunny Lee with Chinna Smith, a couple of other Greenwich Farm amateurs and Johnny Clarke sitting in on harmony. 'Chinna was one of my best friends,' Zero says at his home in Santa Cruz, California. 'Chinna lived a couple blocks from me. His dad had a sound system, so every day we meet, play some songs and lick chalice [smoke marijuana in a water pipe]. Bunny Lee have a bar right there at Fifth Street and the empty lot, we used to round there and sing. Bunny Lee come and hear us all the time and say, "Me want to take you to studio to do something." 'Though the singer was bom Earl Anthony Johnson on East Avenue in 1953, Striker dubbed him Earl Zero at this session to avoid confusion with Earl 'Chinna' Smith. 'My dad is a fisherman,' Earl explains. 'He always dock him boat at a wharf called Zero Wharf, so them call him Fisherman Zero. When me and Chinna do the song, Bunny Lee just use the name Earl Zero.' Unfortunately for Zero, this recording was something of a false start. 'Me do "None Shall Escape", but maybe he never like my version, so he go in the studio with Johnny Clarke.'

**Earl Zero [David Katz]**

'None Shall Escape The Judgement' gave Clarke the major hit he had long been hoping for. 'Singing started from school days,' the tall, burly singer says in the lobby of a London hotel; he is a philosophical person who expresses himself without haste. 'I was born in Kingston in 1955, grow up in Waltham Park Road and I was in Trench Town for many years. I get a scholarship to Jamaica College. With Ibo Cooper from Third World, and Roger and Ian Lewis from Inner Circle, _we_ had a school band [to gether].'

While still at school, Clarke nearly became a Studio One artist. 'Me and Jacob Miller were close friends, and we used to go to Studio One and buy drinks for Leroy Sibbles and them man, through we want to stay inside. Bob Andy was supposed to write some songs for me, because Downbeat loved my voice, but because my parents wanted me to concentrate more on school, I never had the time like Jacob to go to the studio regularly. After school I started taking it more serious, trying to get some recording done. But it wasn't happening, so I started doing some talent shows with artists like Barry Brown, Mighty Diamonds and Sugar Minott who had the African Brothers, but we were young and nobody had any name yet.'

Clarke began recording in 1973, but his Federal debut was not released and an early effort for Clancy Eccles was not promoted sufficiently; 'Everyday Wondering', produced by Rupie Edwards, was the first single to make an impact. 'I was at the bus stop, wondering from which angle something's going to happen, so me just bring forth the song,' Clarke explains. 'It's all about me wanting to be successful. It was a hit in the dance, but it wasn't popularized country-wise among the population. That was my first time in King Tubby's studio – Rupie took me round there to voice. I made the rhythm at Channel One with Jackie Jackson and Hux Brown.'

'Wondering' eventually became relatively popular in London and New York, but Rupie's recasting of the rhythm as the abstract 'Skanga', in which the producer imitated the sound of instruments with his voice, turned out to be such a big hit in Britain that Edwards appeared on _Top Of The Pops_ in 1974 and became a permanent UK resident by 1977. Though 'Wondering' never brought Clarke that level of fame, it attracted the attention of other downtown promoters including K. 'Stamma' Hobson, an associate of Keith Hudson for whom Clarke cut the unusual 'Golden Snake'. 'He was more like a bad man? laughs Clarke, 'the first kind or man there who have them knife and ratchet. That's the reason he was around Hudson, because he was there like a protector.'

**Moving out of Babylon:**

**Johnny Clarke [David Katz]**

After covering Smokey Robinson's 'You Really Got A Hold On Me' for Glen Brown, Clarke finally broke through by linking with Bunny Lee. 'Striker was on the corner at Chancery Lane, right beside Salvation Army, where we all used to hang out: me, Gregory Isaacs, Stamma, Dirty Harry. Bunny Lee usually go a lot to England those days, so one day he came around and just create an excitement: "I hear a tune you do for Rupie in England, mash up the dance up there!" He wanted me to do a cover, "My Desire", one of those old type of Shirley and Lee songs, so I went to Treasure Isle studio, [where the engineer was] Errol Brown. Earl Zero and some other guys from down [Greenwich] Farm came there with this song, "None Shall Escape The Judgement". Bunny now want me to go with the group, because he had different ideas. When there was a session about to get underway, the musicians would have a little workout. So there was Santa just playing the cymbal, and Bunny came in and heard it – "Oh boy! That's what we want" – so he translate the little workout straight on to the real thing. Normally Santa was just doing it as a joke. It was a new sound, because that is the thing that really tip me now. We went to voice "My Desire" at Tubby's , and [Lee] said I should try to do back ["None Shall Escape"] in my way different than Earl Zero. I develop the vibes and run down the place, because it was all about that new sound and a new youth. From that it was strictly Bunny Lee right along, because Bunny Lee had the sound and everybody wanted to go to Duke Reid's studio now. Gregory Isaacs and _GG_ went there after to do "Love Is Overdue".'

Johnny Clarke stuck solidly with Striker for the next few years, 'through the cymbal, because that was the hit way, that was what the people needed'. The sound proved the perfect platform for Clarke's vocal style, which he punctuated with undulating slurs. Along with singers such as Al Campbell, Clarke was one _of_ the first to record the forerunner of what would later emerge as the dancehall style; his lyrics alternated between love songs and 'reality7' themes, and he was equally adept at cover tunes.

Clarke says his strongest influences were sound system culture and Rastafari. 'I grow up with a sound system next door to me, Veejay the Dub Master, that was at 31c Waltham Park Road. He's the type of soundman that get up at four o'c lock in the morning, and those days we have some steel horns up in the trees and you hear some wicked Alton Ellis – it usually wake me up to go to school. Veejay focus 'pon Rasta. We'r e really from the ghetto, and Rasta a focus from them time. My mom was a Christian, but I grow up with my bigger brother "Obadiah", James Clarke, a Rastaman, so after a while me start focussing on Rastafari.'

Obadiah founded the short-lived Clarke's label and produced some unsuccessful sides with Johnny after 'None Shall Escape'; another brother, well-known drummer Eric 'Fish' Clarke, also helped direct Johnny to music early on. 'He has a lot to do with my career too, but he never grow up with us. He ended up at Maxfield Park [Children's Home], then he move on to Alpha Boys' School. When he usually come [home] for holidays, he always deal with music, so I was more clingfing] to that.'

Johnny Clarke's partnership with Striker Lee brought the singer into the big time, and their association was responsible for some of the biggest hits of the mid-1970s. Like 'None Shall Escape The Judgement', 'Move Out Of Babylon Rastaman', 'Peace And Love In The Ghetto' and 'Rock With Me Baby' were substantial Clarke hits built on the flyers sound.

Cornell Campbell, who had moved to Bunny Lee's stable by 1972, emerged as Clarke's most consistent rival from the success of 'Natty Dread In Greenwich Town'. 'I became frustrated', Campbell says of his final departure from Studio One, 'when I went to Randy's record shop and hear songs like [the Bassies'] "Things A Come Up To Bump". The music a sell, and all the time my good tune them nah sell. I write "Natty Dread In A Greenwich Farm" [aka 'Natty Dread In A Greenwich Town'], because me say, "Let me sing pure reality tune, pure tune whe the people on the street them like." I went to Bunny Lee with that song, because I had a band named Don Cornell and the Eternals. Robert Shakespeare used to play with a band named Big Relation, and they used to play in my band with Carly [Barrett], so Bunny Lee came one night to hear the band play at Greenwich Town – that's the first time I know Bunny Lee, and him love how me sing. Him came to Robert Shakespeare and ask if him can play on sessions. I never like the idea, because if Robert Shakespeare leave, the band going go down. Robert Shakespeare left the band and go to Bunny Lee, so I use one of my singer partners, Ken Price, to play bass, but the band never up to the prestige of how we did have it. After a while me automatically start to sing for Bunny Lee, back-up artists with guitar and piano, and I play the bass with artists like Derrick Morgan. I said to Bunny Lee, "What you think about 'Natty Dread In A Greenwich Farm', you think it going to do anything?" Him said, "Yes, man, that is a bad tune." King Tubbys tell me, "Boy Cornell, I went a East [Kingston] the other night and hear the song a play, and somebody tell me police want to raid the place and shoot up the sound, because the way the song bad, whole heap of man get mad up there" – every time a song going to hit, some disaster happen. "Natty Dread In A Greenwich Farm" start to run the place big time.'

Cornell explains how his rivalry with Johnny took root. 'Johnny Clarke came before with a song named "None Shall Escape The Judgement". A brother named Earl write the song, and Bunny Lee give me the song to sing first, but through Bunny Lee owe me some money, me draw away a little bit, and Bunny Lee give it to Johnny Clarke to sing. That was him first big record. When me come back a town, Bunny Lee say, "You see if you sing the tune what would happen? Johnny Clarke sing it over and it gone." The tune start sell, so that's why I sing another version of it named "Gun Court Law".'

That song referred to Michael Manley's drastic response to Jamaica's escalating firearms problem. Opened in April 1974 at Camp Road, the barbed wire-encased fortress serves as a court of law and detention centre for those caught with illegal guns. Trials are conducted without juries, and with no opportunity for bail or appeals; the maximum sentence was initially indefinite detention, later changed to mandatory life imprisonment, and guilt could be established even by the possession of a single bullet shell. Though generally welcomed at its inception, the Gun Court was a surprisingly repressive creation from a man elected on a largely idealized platform of human rights.

Johnny Clarke addressed similar themes to 'Gun Court Law' on 'Joshua's Word', which also mentioned the call for citizens to 'bring in the guns' anonymously, without fear of being charged. The rivalry between Clarke and Campbell was now in full swing. 'It become a competition,' Cornell observes. 'Every man feel him bad, so I go write a song named "The Gorgon", and then Johnny Clarke come with "Move Out Of Babylon", and me come with "Dance In A Greenwich Farm", and Johnny Clarke come with [Barbara Lynn's ] "You'l l Lose A Good Thing", and me come with [Gene Chandler's ] "Duke Of Earl".'

Much of this material was given its final mix-down by Philip Smart, who was then resident engineer at King Tubby's . At HC&F, the studio he currently runs in Long Island, it is evident that Smart has something in common with most other sound engineers: his belly attests to untold hours seated at a mixing desk. 'The Bunny Lee era, that's when I came in the picture,' the chubby mixer says. 'All the Johnny Clarke, like "None Shall Escape The Judgement" – I convinced Bunny to put out Johnny's version. Bunny wasn't really too hot on the tune, but after Johnny sing it I tell him, "That tune there hot", and he say, "If you feel it, mix it," – just like that.'

**Prince Philip Smart [David Katz]**

Smart says he came to work with Tubby through the sound system circuit, and recalls his early studio experience in the company of Errol Thompson and Augustus Pablo. 'My mother says I was born with some turntable in me hand,' he laughs. 'I was always into music and collect records as a youth, used to play at birthday parties, keep coming up until [I] play at dances and clubs. I used to live at Harbour View, and Errol was living in Harbour View with his relative named Goff, an electronic engineer who usually repair and build amplifiers. He had a set named El Don, and all who was interested in electronics used to hang out over there. At that time, Errol was working at Studio One, used to bring home exclusives like "Nanny Goat". When him leave Studio One and go to Randy's , that's when I start going to Randy's after school to watch him work.'

It was in this period that Smart moved to Havendale and became friendly with Augustus Pablo. 'Myself and Augustus Pablo put together lunch money, book a studio session, and recorded some tracks with a band that we brought in, Reckless Breed, like six rhythm tracks to a two-track tape. Pablo was playing piano. Those tracks weren't hardcore enough, so we went back and did "Skanking Easy" [a melodica recut of the Soul Brothers' "Swing Easy", based on the theme _of Fiddler On The Roof\\._ Myself, Pablo and another friend put our money together and produced that record, pressed it and put it out on the Hot Stuff label. I was still in high school, but we use the top musicians at that time: Family Man, Carly, Tyrone Downey and Reggie. We did that on four-track at Randy's – that was like my first real production. I had my own sound, it was called Sound of Distinction, just a little neighbourhood set. We used to go to King Tubby's and cut dubs, that's how I first met him, with rhythms that Pablo would record – like Pablo and myself did "Cassava Piece" originally at Dynamics. I always was at Tubbs' and Tubbs was more receptive, he let me hang out there every night, until one day he just say, "Jackson, go and take that voice", probably about a year and a half from I was first going there.'

The flyers sound that sprang up in this era, with its uncanny high-hat emphasis, provided King Tubby with ample opportunity for exciting dub experimentation, as heard on the classic album sets _Dub From The Roots_ and _The Roots Of Dub._ On certain single B-sides mixed at Tubby's studio, Philip Smart came up with dub invention by subjecting the tape machine test-tone to short bursts of repeated delay. 'I put it on John Holt's "The Clock",' Smart explains. 'When it starts, you hear "beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep..." You had to find stuff to be innovative – people always looking out for something new.'

Stereo mixing was another 1974 innovation. 'Those days, everything was mono. Pablo did [a melodica version of Ken Boothe's ] "When I Fall In Love" [issued as "Forever Love" on Brad Osborne's Clocktower label in New York], that was done in stereo, and "Black Is Our Colour", Wayne Wade – that was Yabby You's production, recorded at Lee Perry's studio.' The overseas popularity of such experiments saw Smart mixing his first dub album. 'England was very hot on some of the mixes I was doing, so after Bunny go to England, him say, "Philip, you are the man!" That's how me get to do the LP _Creation Dub,_ the one with Bunny Lee's picture on the front, but them no want to tell Tubbs that I did a dub LP, because they think that Tubbs will feel a way.'

Smart also notes that Tubby pioneered other innovations on his sound system in this period, despite police raids that would ultimately close it down. He mentions in particular an exciting event that took place in late 1973 or early 1974, after Tubby's sound had already been destroyed once by the police at a dance. 'It was twice them have it,' says Smart. 'The first time them shot up him sound, they had mash up the amp and he decided he wasn't going to play any more, he was just going to do engineering, the studio thing. But everybody said, "Tubbs, you have to bring back the sound", and him rebuild. The first dance that play was at Up Park Camp where they have the Gun Court right now, but Gun Court didn't exist then. Around midnight, U Roy ride in on him bike and tune up the sound. Nobody know that Tubbs put a secret thing in the amp: when they put on the mike, U Roy say, "You'r e now entertained by the number one sound in the land-land-land-land land-land", the first time people hear echo, "King Tubby's Hi-Fi-fi-fi-fi-fi... " A man lick a shot inside Camp, fire a shot inside the dance, the way that it sweet them! That was the first time him unveil echo in an amp and you can't see it, because he have it incorporated inside the amplifier.'

Not only was this the first time that echo was unleashed on the nation at a dance, it also marked the debut airing of the classic Ansel Collins rhythm track known as 'Stalag', created for producer Winston Riley; the song's forceful bass and vibrant horns have remained consistently popular, and the original rhythm continues to be used for new creations. 'Riley brought "Stalag" and give it to Tubby,' Smart recalls. 'That was the first time it played and that was the first tune that play that night, play for about a half an hour.'

In the mid-seventies Philip Smart went to New York to further his training in electronics: 'I left in late '74 or early '75, went to school, did broadcasting and engineering.' After Smart's departure, Tubby's sound was again destroyed by the police. 'The second one was some politics dance,' Smart details. 'Them shoot up the amps. Police spray the amps [with bullets] and took away the amps. Tubby was suing the police because them mash up his sound, shoot up the dub plates and a whole heap of thing. Him was very upset.'

With Smart out _of_ the country and Tubby in need of an assistant engineer, Pat Kelly returned for another stint at the Waterhouse studio. 'I work in Tubby's in three different sessions – left and come back,' he explains. 'I did about three years of mixing at various studios, like Tubby's , Dynamic, Joe Gibbs, Randy's .' Some months later, when Prince Jammy returned from Canada in January 1976, he took over most of the engineering duties, becoming a highly valued member of Tubby's team.

While King Tubby and his crew continued their dub explorations, Sly Dunbar dissipated the dominance of the flying cymbal with a new style called 'rockers', developed at Channel One with his house band, the Revolutionaries. Rockers revolved around the improved Channel One drum sound, which obtained a better depth of clarity once the studio upgraded to sixteen tracks in 1975; Sly made the most of its capabilities through a number of new beats. Often, his precision timing marked a 'militant' time on the snare; sometimes he doubled the rhythm to make better use of the bass drum and tom-toms. 'Sly would play for a whole day when we were just trying [things] out,' says Joseph Hoo-Kim. 'He was very helpful in that way. You wouldn't get another drummer who would want to do that.'

Often, though not always, the Revolutionaries made something new out of an old standard by recutting what had previously been a Studio One hit, giving favourite rhythms a thoroughly contemporary make-over, driven by Sly's modern rhythms and augmented by up-to-date keyboard, guitar and horn sounds. I Roy's residency at the studio, along with others such as keyboardist and arranger Ossie Hibbert, also assured a heavy measure of sonic excellence. 'He usually play sound,' says Joseph Hoo-Kim of I Roy, 'and we wanted somebody that have a sound knowledge. We figure that he knows the most popular rhythm that is being played in the dancehall.'

Sly Dunbar explains that the Revolutionaries evolved from various club bands of the early to mid-1970s. 'Ansel Collins was the first one who really taught me to do floorshows,' he recalls. 'He was playing in the RHT Invincibles and I was playing in the Yard-brooms. Ansel ask me to come on "Night Doctor", and he called me again to do "Double Barrel". I start doing some sessions, and then I was a member of RHT Invincibles, playing out at Tit For Tat, and then we play with Tommy McCook, Supersonics, for a little while. Ranchie used to play in Volcanoes, with Al Brown. They were seeking a new drummer, and that was a steady job: every Wednesday I play with the band, because Tommy was like every weekend.'

**Sly Dunbar [Beth Lesser]**

Though most people knew him as Charlie then, Dunbar says it was while he was in the Volcanoes that he received his nickname Sly. 'The owner of the band was a man called Mr Harvey. Every time he see me I'm talking about Sly, because I was a great fanatic of Sly and the Family Stone. Mr Harvey look at me and say, "Everything you say is Sly", and if I do something he would say, "Just like Sly", so the name just stuck.'

Eventually, the Volcanoes mutated into Skin Flesh and Bones. 'We used to play in Discovery Bay at Calypso Colony hotel. The hotel went under receivership and we came back in town. Ranchie and myself went back to Tit For Tat and spoke to Dickie Wong, the owner of the club, about getting back the band. We were trying to do a name like Earth Wind and Fire, then we call it Skin Flesh and Bone. We played the club for like five weeks, and we record Al Brown's version of Al Green ["Here I Am Baby"], and then a lot of recordings start coming in. We used to play at the club every Wednesday to Saturday. We had a weekly salary, so we never really have to depend on sessions, but we love to play on sessions, so Ranchie or Ansel or Lloyd Parks, when they get sessions they would call – that's how I think I end up playing on Tubby's "Psalms Of Dub", through Ansel for Black and White.'

By 1975, the bulk of Skin Flesh and Bones had become the Revolutionaries. As usual, the membership fluctuated. Keyboardists Ossie Hibbert and Robbie Lyn were sometimes featured. The horn section usually included Tommy McCook on tenor saxophone, Herman Marquis on alto and Vin Gordon on trombone. Robbie Shakespeare played bass on some of the later material. But the staple core members were normally Sly, Ansel Collins, Ranchie and Lloyd Parks. When Joe Gibbs, with engineer Errol Thompson, opened a new studio that year at 24 Retirement Crescent, in an industrial area near Cross Roads, it was this same core of musicians who most often provided backing, though Maurice 'Blacka Morwell' Wellington and Eric 'Bingy Bunny' Lamont of the Morwells also had prominent positions there, and members of Soul Syndicate and other musicians sometimes held court. Lloyd Parks eventually became the resident bassist at Gibbs' studio, after Robbie Shakespeare became a more prominent member of the Revolutionaries.

'When Skin Flesh and Bone start playing Tit For Tat again, Robbie was playing at a club next door,' says Sly. 'So when we get a break, we would go and check every band and they would go check us.' 'First time I see Sly was on Red Hills Road,' Robbie confirms, 'where there was clubjs] named Tit For Tat, Stables and Evil People. At Evil People Fab Five used to be their resident band, but Fab Five had some overseas engagement. The band I was playing with at the time was Big Relation from Spanish Town. Benbow was playing drums and the keyboard player left, which was Tyrone Downey. Touter Harvey, who later play with Inner Circle – originally Touter was a singer with Hippy Boys, and Touter only knew two chords, but we say him better play keyboards. He said he's going to check this band with Sly and Ranchie and a girl who sing named [Cynthia] Richards. Sly's band named Skin Flesh and Bones. I go over there and see Sly, and the way him sit down 'pon the drums, the drum set was way out here and it sound wicked. At that time, we was doing a lot of recording. We just finished Burning Spear's _Marcus Garvey,_ and Johnny Clarke and Slim Smith [material], and I was one of the main Peter Tosh bass players at that time, because I finish "Concrete Jungle" and "Stir It Up" for Wailers – I play on those tracks. I was one of the main man with Aggrovators, so me say, "All right, Bunny Lee, blood clot, see this little drummer here wicked? We have to do a session with him", so Bunny just call in Sly and we build a lot of tracks.'

**Joe Gibbs' studio, Retirement Crescent [Adrian Thomas]**

'I always like Robbie's bass,' Sly continues, 'because when we start meet in sessions down by Randy's , we talk and ask questions. In those time, every musician used to respect each and every one, so we go and check one another, sit down and work out some music, design a few chords and things. That was then in Jamaica – it doesn't exist no more. After I hooked up with Robbie we started some sessions for Bunny Lee, but a little before that Robbie and me was playing in the Revolutionaries, 'cause the first song he played on, he played piano on "MPLA" [an instrumental remake of "Freedom Blues" cut at Channel One]. He play a lot of guitars too, 'cause Ranchie was playing bass when Robbie came in. Because Lloyd Parks didn't turn up for a session Ranchie would play bass, but when Robbie came in and played a few guitars they change over: Ranchie play guitar and Robbie play bass.'

**Real Revolutionary: Lloyd Parks [Adrian Thomas]**

'The real Revolutionaries was me,' Lloyd Parks says on the veranda of his home in New Kingston, 'because that was part of Skin Flesh and Bones – we moved to Channel One and they call it Revolutionaries. After that, Robbie came in as the bass player, but we started it: me, Sly and Ansel Collins at Channel One.'

Parks started his career as a vocalist in the Termites during rock steady. 'Wentworth Vernon, he had a band in Waterhouse called the Termites. Bobby Kalphat plays keyboards. I never really like the name, but I wanted to record so I join him. Termites lasted about three years – we made this album called _Do The Rock Steady_ for Studio One. Then I join RHT Invincibles – it was a Rastaman who get it together for us, his organization was called Rainbow Healing Temple. That's where I really get my goal where I can go on an instrument and play as a guitar player. At that point, I played on a million-seller song for Ansel Collins called "Double Barrel".

'About a year after, I switch to bass. I was playing in a band called the Thoroughbreds" at the Stables. The bass player didn't show up one night and I tell Bobby Aitken, the band leader, "I can play that, you know." That night, first time I-man play a bass on a stage, a lot of people crowd around me, like you have the Go-Go dancers that used to be there, everybody crowd and say, "Hey hey hey! It's a new thing." From that night, I never stop playing bass. Because of the sound I had, I play a tune like "Nebucadneezer", Junior Byles [recorded in 1972], and the man say, "Boy, what's making that sound? It's just something different." In other words, when a Lloyd Parks song is playing you can tell it's Lloyd Parks on bass.' In those days, Parks used to break up his low bass patterns with cascading spirals of rapidly plucked high notes, pointing to his proficiency on guitar.

Parks became the in-house bassist at Randy's in this period, playing with the core of the future Revolutionaries. 'I used to do songs for Randy's Impact label, like a studio band. Whenever anybody recording, they call me, Ansel Collins, Sly and so on.' He also began cutting self-produced vocal work, including the moving 'Slaving', which Parks says was autobiographical. 'As a youth growing up, my parents migrate to England when I was thirteen, so I end up with my aunt in the country, Port Antonio, and I had a hard time. When I come back to town I just get that inspiration, "I'm slaving every day for my living", because I was really trying to make it. Tyrone Downey played on "Slaving" – he was a little schoolboy in khaki uniform, used to leave school and go to the studio, he was so young. Even today, when I listen to what he played, I can't believe it.'

Parks then joined Skin Flesh and Bones. 'We were in the same neighbourhood, Waterhouse,' he recalls. 'They produce a song with Al Brown, [who] sang over an Al Green song. It was a massive hit and I get a lot of raises for that bass line – even UB40 did a version using the same bass line.'

At Channel One, Skin Flesh and Bones became the Revolutionaries. With their new rockers sound, the group backed the bulk of the biggest hits of the mid-to-late seventies by artists such as the Mighty Diamonds with 'I Need A Roof, Leroy Smart with 'Ballistic Affair' and the Meditations with 'Woman Is Like A Shadow'.

The Mighty Diamonds' strong vocal harmony was equally suited to politically relevant lyrics and romantic material; whether voicing reverence of Marcus Garvey, singing of heartache or covering soul tunes, the Diamonds' soaring harmonies created a lasting impression. Their different tones are exciting when intermingling in unison, and lead singer Donald 'Tabby' Shaw's clear tenor is given pride of place when answered by call-and-response choruses from Fitzroy 'Bunny' Simpson and Lloyd 'Judge' Ferguson. Judge is the group's main lyricist, and his Garveyite upbringing ensures plenty of references to the Jamaican hero; his falsetto has also been put to good use on numbers such as 'Go Seek Your Rights'.

On a brief visit to London, where he always makes sure to visit his dentist, Tabby describes how the group came together in the late sixties when its members were doing welding and carpentry jobs and while Bunny ran a small sound called Soul Pack. 'We start out late 1969, come together in a full-force trinity in mid-December. When Bunny Diamond was a youth he used to sing with Jah Lloyd's group named Meditators, and them times he used to check me still, 'cause we used to live in the same street. We say we want a next man, search and search, and it takes about two years. We buck up on some different youths, but they weren't ready yet, until December '69 we buck up on Judge and the vibes start. Me know Judge from long time, but me never did see the music between me and him, because we used to go to the same school but different age group. The first song we recorded as a group was "Girl You'r e Too Young" for Rupie Edwards.'

After moving on to cut 'Oh No Baby' for Stranger Cole, they issued the self-produced 'Got To Live Some Life' and a cover of the Stylistics' 'Betcha By Golly Wow', before landing at Lee Perry's Black Ark, where they recorded 'Talk About It' and provided harmony on Susan Cadogan's 'Hurt So Good' – a chart hit in England but not particularly popular in Jamaica. 'Jah Jah Bless The Dreadlocks' and 'Carefree Girl' followed for Bunny Lee, but their true breakthrough came from their association with Jah Lloyd, a singer and deejay who had worked as a record salesman for Rupie Edwards and Lee Perry.

**Tabby, Bunny and Judge: the Mighty Diamonds [Beth Lesser]**

About a year before his death I met the man born Patrick Lloyd Francis at his regular hangout, one of the rougher street corners in the Kingston suburb of Washington Gardens; his matted beard reached his grimy T-shirt, and a miasma of stale rum surrounded him. Lloyd was proud of the role he had played in bringing the group to prominence. 'I was born in 1947 in Saint Catherine, a place named Point Hill. My dad used to love farming. At the age of twelve, I left school and come to town, because my mum die and I have to grow with a [step-mother], which was not so very smooth. I meet up on man like Theophilus Beckford, Eric "Monty" Morris, Toots and the Maytals, and trod on to a record business place named Success Records where I do a song like "Look Who A Bust Style" as Meditators, Paul Aston Jennings and myself- we all meet in Trench Town. I was a salesman for Rupie Edwards, selling tunes like "This Wonderful Sound" with Dobby Dobson, "Burning Fire" with Joe Higgs and the Gaylads' "My Jamaican Girl". Me and the youth them rehearse together, people like Ansel [Cridland of the Meditations] and Roland Burrell, and along Diamonds come. They was very good, and I take them to Coxsone, but Downbeat say them not ready: "Two months' time." Come to Rupie Edwards, they do "Girl You Are Too Young", I select that song there.'

**Shame and pride: Jah Lloyd [Adrian Thomas]**

Francis scored his first notable hit as a deejay at the Black Ark in 1974 with the self-produced 'Soldier Round The Corner', a song describing the tense feelings in the street brought on by emergency curfews; its success allowed him to bring the Diamonds back into the studio. 'I go back for them and do "Shame And Pride": Robbie Shakespeare on bass, Horsemouth on drum, Reggie that play with Upsetter on guitar and Errol Thompson, the engineer. That is the song that give them the go. After doing that, I take them to Channel One, telling Joe Hoo-Kim that he should record them. I couldn't manage them much more, because I was getting penalized by selling the record: people buying three or six copies, sabotaging, victimizing and jeo- pardizing. So this is when I have to carry them to Joe Joe, who tell them it's time fi do them album.'

'My best experience right now was Channel One,' Tabby emphasizes, 'because it's the first cut, the foundation. Channel One have a time when it used to run things.' They started at Channel One in 1975 with two more Stylistics covers, 'Hey Girl' and 'Country Living', the latter eventually hitting in Britain; causing a bigger impact was 'Right Time', a symbolic number relating Garvey's prophetic vision as a signal for black retribution. Other strong singles followed, including 'Back Weh', 'I Need A Roof, using a recut of Larry and Alvin's 'Mean Girl', and 'Have Mercy', using a recut of the Cables' 'Baby Why'. The group was among the first reggae acts signed to Virgin records, who issued their acclaimed debut album _Right Time_ in a gatefold sleeve.

The Meditations were another of the classic harmony trios to rise to prominence in this period. In the depths of Flatbush at Sir Tommy's studio, leader Ansel Cridland and fellow member Winston Watson are adding harmony to a Glen Washington track; the friendly Ansel describes the early hardships that led to his chosen career. 'Them say I man were born in '51 in Westmoreland, a little place they call Lambeth Pen. My father leave Jamaica when I was seven years [old] and my mother was in Kingston, so it 'was just me and my gran at that time. After my father leave, it was a [step-mother] that took me to a country [town] named Darliston, and they was mistreating me. Some lady next door see that and take I back to my people, and then my uncle take me to my mother in the Mountain View area. My father was a horse trainer and he had to live on the premises, this place named Red Hills. I want to be a jockey, but I used to listen [to] Delroy Wilson, and the man who really inspirate I at the time was the guy that used to fix the tractors. I hear those guys singing one day, that t'i ng amaze I so much, I say, "No, I'm going to sing." One of our brethren, horse kill him. From there, t'i ngs never look bright, so I told my friend, "We'r e going back to town – I'm gonna sing, you know." Back in the Kingston 11 area, as a young youth, I say I want to be a mechanic, I want to be a barber. But that wasn't the way, for all I wanted to do was sing.'

Cridland made his first recordings at the end of the sixties as part of harmony group the Linkers; by 1972 he was collaborating with Danny Clarke, with whom he would subsequently form the Meditations. 'I do "Sitting On The Sidewalk" that was when I just met Danny. I produced that song, I sing it and Danny blowing the melodica on it. I give it to JJ to put out and him send it to Creole [for UK release]. Danny was with the Righteous Flames, doing back-up harmony at the time.'

At home in Arizona, Danny Clarke picks up the tale. 'I was born in Trench Town in '53. My mom went to England in 1960 and I went to stay with my step-dad in Clarendon. At about eleven, I went back to Trench Town with my biological dad, in Fifth Street. I start sing with Winston Jarrett, had the pleasure of singing with Alton Ellis in Alton and the Flames. After they stop singing with Alton, I was one of the Righteous Flames. The first session I did was with Coxsone Downbeat, "Free Angela Davis" and "Working Time", but I don't know if it come out. Then I did two songs for Scratch: "Zion" and "You Can Run", Things wasn't going too right, so I leave the Righteous Flames and start out for myself. The first song I recorded was "Great Messiah" for GG, that was [as] Danny Clarke and the Meditations. Then I live in Madison Gardens [a West Kingston ghetto known as Baktu]. I met Ansel down there in 72, and Ansel teach me a few guitar chords. Me and him started to become good friends, so we started trying a thing together. Like when I'm rehearsing, Ansel would come around and help me out harmony-wise, and when he's rehearsing I would go around and help him. We used to hang in a group called the Hombres, one of the first groups in Madison Gardens.'

**Winston, Danny, and Ansel: The Meditations [Courtes** **y** of Robert **Schoenfeld/Nighthawk]**

'Winston Heywood and the Hombres, they asked me to follow them for an audition to play guitar,' recalls Ansel. 'They was doing this song "Never Fall In Love". They were singing it into a ska and I change it to the one drop – I actually do the harmony in it also. I do a song named "Bongo Man" on the session, but my group never maintaining the harmony.'

'We wanted to form our own little group,' Danny explains. 'Winston was a good singer, he's got a good voice, but he couldn't control it. Whenever I would go check Lloyd Forrest, I would bring him with me. We were going to use him, but Lloyd couldn't wait – he was going to go with the Jays. So me and Winston start walk together, teach him more and more. We come back up by Ansel, so all of we just sing. We start to rehearse together, not as a group, but if Winston find somebody who wanted to record him, he can rely on me and Ansel to give him harmony, and if Ansel wanted to record, me and Winston would do backing vocals.'

Winston Watson's soprano provided a strong contrast to the deeper tones of Cridland and Clarke; he says his inspiration came largely from soul singers of both sexes. 'I was born in Trench Town in '54; mostly grow in Kingston 11. My daddy was a writer and performer and I think I get the inspiration from him – he used to perform magic, turn newspaper into an ice cream. Along that journey I used to go to _Opportunity Knocks_ and win, not even near my mind being in a group. Ansel was a "face-boy", bell-foot pants and soul hair and t'i ng. I guess I was about the same. I hear a lot of singers and everything I heard I sing – female singers too, like Diana Ross.'

'I see the potential in him,' Ansel continues. 'Him say him want to be a singer, so when we sing the Impressions' harmony it sound good. At the time, I was about to do "Woman Is Like A Shadow". This brethren named Calvin was to come and sing the harmony for us – we waiting on him and he didn't come. So Winston come along and say, "I will sing that tune." When I hear Winston come with the harmony, I say, "Winston remind me of Bunny Wailer's harmony, and this is the harmony we want."'

The group recorded the song in late 1974, but Joseph Hoo-Kim did not release it for well over a year. When he finally chose to do so, the song was a major hit. 'I went to see if I could get somebody to do it good,' Danny explains, 'so I went to Channel One. Ossie [Hibbert] used to be up there taking auditions, and I know him from way back with the Righteous Flames days. I said, "Ossie, we have some tunes", and sing a couple of songs. He said, "Come back Friday", and when I went back I carry Ansel. As he opened his mouth, Ossie said, "Don't sing no more. Come back Monday!" After we did that, Joe Joe said he didn't like the lyrics, so we had to change it about three times and he still didn't put it out.'

'I didn't like the lyrics,' confirms Joseph Hoo-Kim, 'I didn't like "A woman is like a shadow and a man is like an arrow" – it never sound practical to me. We sell a lot of it on dub, but I didn't like the song.'

'I was on Marcus Garvey Drive at Federal and met Dobby Dobson,' Ansel continues. 'I know him from long time in Flames days. He said he's the one taking the auditions over there. I went there and the first song I sing he likes it, second song he likes it. I saw Winston coming down the road, so I said, "This guy have some good songs too. I want you to listen to him." Dobby say we have to come back, so we went to Dobby Dobson and it was "Babylon Trap Them", "Longest Liver" and Winston did "Man Piabba, Woman Piabba", and Dobby loved those songs. After he released those songs, he said he wanted to do an album. "Longest Liver" was the first song that came out as Meditations. After that, Joe Joe released "Woman Is Like A Shadow", and that was the song that really break the name Meditations.' It was also _one_ of the biggest songs to boost the Channel One rockers sound.

Though the advent of rockers stole the fire from Bunny Lee's flying cymbal, the Revolutionaries' habit of adapting Studio One rhythms naturally caused most offence at Brentford Road, particularly after many of Coxsone's artists defected to Channel One. Coxsone's greatest weapon in the war of styles turned out to be Sugar Min-ott, a man with his ear constantly on the pulse of Jamaica's dancehall scene. 'It was a living war with Channel One,' laughs Minott. 'They used to call me "Coxsone's Boy". When they made "I Need A Roof for Channel One, I immediately know what it was, because I'm an expert in music and rhythm from [when] I was a kid. So I went to Coxsone and said, "Look, it's "Mean Girl". We went to buy a flask of rum, so I was hyped up, did over "I Need A Roof. Me and Tabby them was friends, but I didn't care because I was like "Channel One? I hate Chinese." That was my thing in them times – I was young that way: "I'm not singing for no Chinese." There was a next one called "Woman Is Like A Shadow". Coxsone called me and said, "I want you to sing this music, listen that tune," so I thought it was an old song from some old group that never came out and he wanted me to do it over, but I didn't know it was a Meditations song that never even came out yet. I did over "Woman Is Like A Shadow" and it came out before the original, because the original used to play on the sound. When my version drop in, the whole of Baktu was looking for me – it was a war with Channel One. Every time they try to do a Coxsone song I go and tell him, so they came and fling bottle and stone to mash Coxsone's studio up. They had the force – everybody was following the Chinese. Somehow Coxsone and Joe Joe got in some fight and that was that.' Perhaps unsurprisingly, Joseph Hoo-Kim contests Sugar's version of events.

**Studio One warrior:**

**Sugar Minott [Beth Lesser]**

As Minott grew up next door to one of Kingston's most popular dancehalls, music has been a central element of his life. 'My house was right beside the dancehall, Champagnie Lawn, at 82 Chisholm Avenue, run by a man called Champagnie. We get to know the music from them days, like Delroy Wilson, Derrick Morgan, and you used to see man like King Stitch. As small kids we couldn't go in this dancehall legally, so we have to make holes in the fence. And we used to imitate the dance, keep our own dance afterwards, with cardboard box and condensed [milk] can. I grow up with my mom, four brothers and three sisters. My father was a man that sells meat, like salt beef, in the ghetto on the street, but he had a rough time. He couldn't take the pressure, so he went back to the country where his family was and start to do some farming.'

Lincoln Minott has a sweet voice, but his nickname Sugar stems from another source. 'Chisholm Avenue was a rough ghetto, 'nuff bad things was happening, so my mother was trying to take us to a better life. She save up a little money and rent this house in this middle-class area, Waltham Gardens. That's where I got the name Sugar, from my friends as a little boy in the street. I was kind of a fat kid, porky, so they always say, "You must have eaten all your mother's sugar, Sugar Belly!" After a while they just say, "Sugar."'

Like most of his peers, Minott got his start in a local amateur group. 'While I was in Waltham Gardens there was two big girls, Beverley and Trudy, and we try to form a group with some likkle boys, named Telstar. That wasn't working out so good, so these two big girls, they said they wanted to sing with me, but they didn't know harmony, and I didn't know nothing about that myself. We were trying to be in the Festival competition, but it was rubbish! We didn't even pass the first level.

'My mother was struggling. She used to sell at the market, go with all these big loads on her head, so she had it rough with eight kids. Then she had to move from that area, because we couldn't afford the rent no more and the landlord didn't like us so much, because we were people from the ghetto trying to live in some kind of posh area. So we end up back in Kingston 11, where we came from, and that was a good thing because that's where I met Tony Tuff [aka Winston Morris] and Derrick Howard [sometimes referred to as Eric Bubbles].

'At Delamere Avenue, there was a big yard where all of us used to meet and burn herb, learning to build a spliff as a little kid, in time to go to school. That's where we meet Tony Tuff, a likkle man on an old car, playing a guitar – he's our godfather. He was singing around with people like Bop and the Beltones, trying to carry two harmonies, around 1969-70. I was like fourteen, going to first form in school, and we meet a youth called Derrick Howard from the country. He say his group was the African Brothers, say he want us to join in it. He took us to Rupie Edwards and Micron Music, but it was Dessie Young, Tony Tuff and that youth first, because I was just a little kid in beanies. They did one song, "Behold I Live" – I think that was for Micron Music – and somehow it wasn't happening. Dessie Young wanted to sing by himself, so I was in the group officially.

'We enter the Festival at the Ward Theatre, and in the second run we dropped off. Tony Tuff did write the song, saying we'r e not going to follow the English no more, so I guess that was too heavy. We started recording for people like One Foot Jimmy. The group did "Lead Us Father" – this came on our own label called Ital through Micron Music. We did a couple songs for Rupie Edwards, like "Mysterious Nature" and "Party Night", and I did a song called "Youths Of Today", the first song I get to lead, and "Righteous Kingdom" for Micron Music. We used to hang out at Randy's records – that's how I get to know Clive Chin, Gussie Clarke, Leonard Chin, they were the king of the road for selling records. For Clive we did "Hold Tight", and we do "Torturing" for some man on our street named Duke Thelwell, but he never gave us no money. That was one of the first songs that made an impression for us.'

Sugar says the group passed through much tribulation before it split and he aligned himself with Coxsone. 'First of all, Derrick Howard was the leader for the group. We was going to stage shows and people boo, because this guy couldn't lead. Tony Tuff start to lead, so the songs start to get better. Then he was giving problems in the harmonies, but all of it was experience. Ronnie Burke and Mike Johnson, they were Micron Music. They had Pete Weston working there, they had Merritone, and Merritone them didn't like my music. We were singing Rasta, we sound like the Abyssinians, that's our kind of sound – real cultural roots, and they didn't like it. It was American [style] music they was promoting, like Beres Hammond, Cynthia Schloss, Rudy Thomas, and they was all singing Stylistics. They always say our music was no good, and then the company somehow wasn't working right, so [Mike Johnson] just gave us back our tapes, and Merritone went to do Turntable club, Ronnie Burke went to do Sunsplash, Pete Weston went to Canada.

'On Delamere Avenue, in the rough ghetto where we used to meet, there was a big bar in a back yard, play sound system. Coxsone used to pass there and take a drink. One time the group round the back and he came and listened to us and say, "Yeah, it sound good." We did a song at Studio One, "No Cup No Broke", but them say, "Coxsone's thieving". I'm saying, "Don't you hear the music, man? That's where I want to be. I don't care if I get no money, because that's the music I want to sing to." We decided this group's not working out, 'cause we kinda make an impression but the music not going anywhere.'

Heavily involved in sound systems, Sugar Minott knew exactly what Studio One rhythms he wanted to sing on and approached Coxsone with the idea of updating the label's earlier hits. 'I used to be a selector, play sound from [when] I was likkle – that was my first job. First sound I played was my brother-in-law's sound, and in Maxfield Park there was Sounds of Silence and Keytone. I used to play those sounds. I end up having a sound called Jah Live, and then from Jah Live to Black Roots, and from Black Roots to Youth Promotion, so it was always sound – I was a sound system man. Many people say, "I start singing at the church," but I start singing in the dance. I was born in the dance, never been singing in the church – I was raggamuffin style, so sound system was my beginning. I was playing sound system, so that's how we got to be singing on the Studio One records, because we only had to play the version from a Studio One record and make up our own song. That's how it started, and nobody was doing that before us.

'When I went to Coxsone, I already know what I wanted to sing because I taped off "Love Me Girl" with Leroy and Rocky, and I taped off "Going Home" with Bob Andy, and I made my own song to it, because I figured these rhythms are so bad I don't need to make new rhythms. I could make a song to this, and if I go to Coxsone and do it quick he doesn't need to get no musicians. I went to this audition – it was a long line of people, and I was the last. It was Coxsone himself, say, "Man, what you used to do before?" "I was just in the country, planting some food." "I think you should go back there... You, come back next year." I say, "Look, sir, I know you'v e got this rhythm already, I can make a song for it." When he heard he don't have to go and make no music, he took me round there same time. He said, "Come back tomorrow", and that was it. I signed a contract to be at Studio One for one year, and I was there for six years without no contract, voicing every day, doing back-up, shaking tambourines and whatever.'

Together with fellow singers Johnny Osbourne and Freddy McGregor, Minott played an influential role in shifting Studio One towards the evolving genre which by the end of the decade would be known as dancehall. In the election year of 1976, however, Studio One had to fight hard to counter the exciting developments coming from Channel One and Joe Gibbs. It was at these studio locations, especially the Maxfield Avenue hotspot of Channel One, that musicians and vocalists were best able to translate the feeling of ghetto suffering into music.

Natty Dread Taking Over: The Ultimate Rise of Roots Reggae

_If you listen to reggae music, you don't need to buy the paper. Reggae music tell you everything wha' happen in Jamaica._

Roy Cousins

_I eat, sing, sleep, drink, live, red green and gold music._

Joseph Hill

THE LATE 1970S were a particularly turbulent time in Jamaican politics as the nation became ensnared in the opposing ideology and rampant demagoguery of the Cold War. Michael Manley embarked on a series _of_ ambitious projects to better the lives _of_ the underprivileged, but ultimately these weakened the Jamaican economy, ironically most hurting those whom he sought to help and alienating middle-class supporters into the bargain. He was also vociferously attacking neo-colonialism and imperialism, sentiments that were noted with dismay by the conservative United States government.

In September 1974 Manley announced a dramatic shift in policy, steering the nation further left with a new era of 'Democratic Socialism'. Though the concept seems to be an ill-defined marriage of the free market to Marxist values, much of Manley's new campaign was clearly against capitalism. He nationalized most _of_ the bauxite industry, which was central to the island's economy, and proposed an international alliance by which the industry's electricity would be generated by Mexico and Venezuela. Most importantly, in May that year he had changed the way that fees were paid by the multinational corporations which purchased Jamaica's bauxite. By replacing the low fixed rate with a percentage levy, he aimed to ensure that these fees would be in keeping with the actual price of the mineral. The result, unfortunately, was that the multinationals turned to other Third World nations for a cheaper supply, greatly reducing Jamaica's annual income.

Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State in the right-wing government Gerald Ford inherited from Richard Nixon, was displeased by the new bauxite levy; more troubling were Manley's growing links with Cuba and his backing of the presence in Angola of thousands of Cuban soldiers, who were helping the Marxist MPLA government fight off an invading South African army backed by the CIA. Kissinger came to Jamaica in December 1975 to pressurize the leader into silence, threatening to cancel a billion-dollar trade agreement if Manley voiced support for the Cuban intervention; as a prominent member of the Non-Aligned Nations group, Manley refused to be dissuaded and the trade deal evaporated.

Naturally Kissinger found an ally in Edward Seaga, who had assumed leadership of the JLP in November 1974. In February 1975 Seaga began an offensive against Democratic Socialism by requesting a State of Emergency; the number of politically motivated murders had increased in recent months, and Seaga aimed to show that Manley was not in control of the situation. Unsurprisingly, the request was denied, and the violence continued to escalate. The following month one of Manley's bodyguards, PNP heavy Winston 'Bury7 Boy' Blake, was killed; during his ostentatious state funeral, eight people were injured by sniper fire as the coffin passed the JLP stronghold of Tivoli Gardens.

By the start of 1976 the violence had significantly worsened: in January JLP gangs started a gunfight in Trench Town, which culminated in the fire-bombing of twenty homes. The following day a PNP picket of an International Monetary Fund convention in New Kingston was infiltrated by JLP saboteurs who started a riot; dozens were killed, including four policemen, and shops were looted and burned. In May further politically motivated violence resulted in dozens of deaths, notably when a JLP gang fire-bombed a West Kingston slum yard. Apart from the dead, over five hundred people were left homeless.

By June there had been 163 known murders, including those of nineteen policemen. Manley had no choice but to call a State of Emergency, the first since the one implemented by the JLP in 1966; this time the nation was so unstable and the levels of violence so high, with automatic weapons and fire-bombs being used with increasing frequency, that the Emergency would be in place for a full ten months. Mindful of the way the progressive Allende government in Chile had been obliterated by a military coup in 1973, with scores of human rights abuses and terrorist activities orchestrated by the CIA, Manley feared a destabilization campaign had been initiated in Jamaica with the aim of toppling his leadership. Such ideas were given credence by ex-CIA officer Philip Agee, who visited Jamaica in September 1976 to speak out about the Agency's destructive presence and its overall control of the region.

When asked about what role the CIA played in the political power struggles of this era, Edward Seaga gives an ambiguous response. 'It's much of a myth to say that the CIA played any great role,' he insists. 'I think they may have done certain things in the background, but out front we never saw them. If they were here, they surely never introduced themselves to me, and I can't tell you of anybody that we knew who was even invited abroad to be trained in anything. Maybe people were here who were agents who I have been introduced to, but not as operatives. I just don't know where they would have participated. Certainly we wouldn't have needed their help anyway, because people were reacting in an extraordinary way. They just didn't want to have anything of Manley's concept of Jamaica being socialistic. [The PNP] were doing a wonderful job stumbling over themselves, telling people they are not wanted in Jamaica – "There are flights leaving every day for Miami", that sort of thing. [Manley] did everything that was wrong to do, destabilizing himself.

Though Seaga is unwilling to identify any concrete training or CIA assistance given to the JLP or its supporters, he suggests that Manley's 1975 _brigadista_ programme of sending unemployed Jamaicans to Cuba for a year's training in construction techniques had sinister undertones. 'Manley was having Jamaicans trained in Cuba as _brigadistas,_ and they were very active in making the country far more militant,' he stresses. 'Dress militant, act militant, so they put the country on almost a wartime footing.' Additionally, senior Jamaican police officers were training in Cuba and PNP ministers were having meetings with the Castro government. Cubans also came to Jamaica to build the Jose Marti Technical School in Spanish Town, opened shortly before the general election of December 1976.

The election campaign was resolutely violent: in October, gunmen sheltering in a local PNP office fired at Edward Seaga and former Prime Minister Shearer in the settlement of York Town. After a lengthy gunfight, in which ten people were shot, the office was burned to the ground. Then, twelve days before the elections were due to be held, an attempt was made on Bob Marley's life.

By then, of course, Marley was an international star, and though certainly not the most popular singer at home he was definitely the best-known Jamaican artist world-wide, and one seen as wielding significant financial and political power. After signing with Island for the _Catch A Fire_ album in 1972, the Wailers underwent massive changes. They were marketed as a Jamaican rock band led by Marley, whose 'rebel' image was further cultivated; their material was subjected to overdubs by Island's rock musicians and remixed for foreign audiences. Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer left the group after the 1973 set _Burnin_ to pursue solo careers; they were replaced by the I-Threes (Rita Marley, Marcia Griffiths and Judy Mowatt) for the acclaimed _Natty Dread_ album, cut with Sylvan Morris at Harry J. Then Marley recruited American guitarists Al Anderson and Donald Kinsey to broaden the group's overall sound. Despite such personnel changes, Marley's message was still rooted in the rebelliousness of Rastafari; when it was reported that Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia had met his physical death in August 1975, Marley refuted the notion with 'Jah Live', a song expressing eternal devotion.

Though the Wailers often toured abroad and based their Tuff Gong organization in Chris Blackwell's large former home at 56 Hope Road, close by the Governor General's residence, they had not lost touch with their Jamaican audience nor the ghetto communities they came from. In October 1976 the group was asked to headline a concert for the people, due to take place in December; called 'Smile Jamaica', it was a government-sponsored event. The group agreed, but found themselves pawns in a political game: Manley set the election date for a few days after the concert, linking the two events in people's minds and insinuating that the group were tacitly endorsing the PNP. 'That was a crazy time,' remembers Family Man. 'They was going around with the campaigning for who wanna be in position, and who's going to be opposition, and not everybody was really into that change, but that's how our country is run still. We were getting a lot of rumours that things were happening, both sides at the war path, a lot of gun smoke... Shortly after we get our date, the campaign was set for the same time, so people looking at the thing differently. In the middle of one of the rehearsal[s], it was ambush in the night!'

The band had received telephone threats not to appear at the event, but Marley insisted. An armed group of PNP supporters, known as the 'Echo Squad', were despatched to guard 56 Hope Road around the clock. Marcia Griffiths wisely chose not to stick around, using the pretext of a non-existent concert engagement to retreat to her sister's home in New York. 'I told him that I didn't get the vibes to stay back and do it,' she recalls, 'because I was just so sure that something was going to happen and because sister Judy had a vision plain-plain. I told him, "Please don't do it – something terrible is going to happen." I begged him. The same day that I left Jamaica, they had the shooting.'

**Eternal: Bob Marley**

Seven gunmen, supposedly from one of the downtown ghetto strongholds stormed 56 Hope Road on the night of 3 December. Amazingly no one died in the attack, although Marley's manager, Don Taylor, took several bullets and had to be airlifted to Miami for emergency surgery. A bullet grazed Marley's chest and ended up in his arm; another penetrated Rita's head. Despite their wounds the Marleys and most of their band, supported by members of Third World, went through with the performance, sending a message of defiance to whoever was behind the attack.

Various theories have been put forward as to who organized the shooting. The most widely held belief is that the orders came straight from the top of the JLP, though others have suggested PNP involvement (because of Marley's links with major JLP enforcers); some say it was not connected to politics at all but due to a racetrack scam gone wrong, or a mishandled drug deal carried out by people who based themselves in Bob's camp. 'Nobody has ever found out who the gunmen were,' remarks Edward Seaga. 'We don't really know. People at the Bob Marley level would always have a string of hangers-on who are close to them. In that sort _of_ mix any souring of relationship may take place, causing that kind of reaction.' If the JLP was indeed behind the attack they miscalculated badly, as Manley won a second term of office and his PNP acquired a comfortable majority when the election finally took place on 16 December.

The events that culminated in the 1976 general election were widely commented on in music: Pablo Moses sang 'We Should Be In Angola', the Meditations cut 'Running From Jamaica', Max Romeo sang of 'War In A Babylon'. Even the instrumentals of the day, typically led by a vibrant horn section, spoke of Cold War politics: alto saxophonist Herman Marquis and trombonist Vin 'Trommie' Gordon created 'IMF'; Ossie Hibbert arranged 'Kissinger' at Channel One, where an instrumental remake of 'Freedom Blues' was titled 'MPLA'; over at Joe Gibbs' the Professionals house band, led by Lloyd Parks and Sly, cut an album called _State Of Emergency._

A headline declaring the imposition of the 1976 State of Emergency was used for the front cover of the Gladiators' debut album, _Trench Town Mix Up,_ produced by Prince Tony Robinson and released internationally by Virgin. 'Them time was when we were going to give up,' remembers Albert Griffiths. '[Producer] Enos McLeod get me in to play on a session, but he didn't have any money to pay us, so I lay a little rhythm that I didn't even finish plan, and when things split up I go to Ossie at Channel One and say, "Beg you a little time", and we voice it [as] the song "Know Yourself Mankind". When we go down there Prince Tony say, "Who really write for the Gladiators? It's a long time me wrant to find the man." I said, "What you mean? A me named Albert Griffiths", but him say him no believe me, because he look to see man who look more fussy. That's how me and Prince Tony get linked up. We signed to Virgin, do _Trench Town Mix Up,_ then _Proverbial Reggae.'_

Recorded at Joe Gibbs' with Lloyd Parks, Sly and Sticky, _Trench Town Mix Up_ was a stunning debut. Though the title track had originally been cut at Studio One as 'Bongo Red', the Prince Tony version had a palpable tension mirroring that which engulfed the Kingston slums as Natty Dread made an increasingly visible stance against 'Babylon'. Aside from a couple of gratuitous Wailers' covers, cut to make the most of any vocal similarity between Griffiths and Marley, the rest of the disc, and virtually all the Gladiators' subsequent work, used proverbs and folk sayings to describe the everyday reality of ghetto life. 'They used to call me the parable man,' Griffiths explains. 'Me sing these songs that really teach you to be wise and clever. Me have a thing that says, "Looks Is Deceiving", because you don't judge a book by the cover. It was all that kind of thing that me sing: songs that say don't under-rate people, mind what you talk, don't talk too much and chat bad things about people. Me no really sing no song yet that doesn't have a meaning.'

When asked about the line 'Cow never know the use of him tail 'til the butcher cut it off in 'Looks Is Deceiving', a slight smile passes Griffiths' lips. 'The cow use him tail to swat flies, mosquito, anything that will bite him,' he explains. 'When him lose it, mosquito and flies start to bite him and him no have nothing more to fight it. Him have to sit down in a ground and rub them off, so him never realize his tail was so important. I have another one where I say, "A sailor-man never know the value of his piece of knife 'til it break." Those things teach you to be wise and think twice. That is mainly what we grew up on, old-time proverbs, things whe your grandparents teach you.'

While the Gladiators' Virgin releases drew critical acclaim in Britain, Griffiths and Clinton Fearon continued backing Yabby You, notably singing harmony on his third album, _Deliver Me From My Enemies,_ issued in the UK on singer and promoter King Sounds' label, Grove Music. 'A whole heap of songs me have with Yabby You,' Griffiths confirms. 'King Sounds set up Yabby for money to produce and we used to play most of them songs.'

The dominant overseas labels were now Island and Virgin, battling to control the best of Jamaica's new music. It was Island, of course, that spearheaded the international marketing of reggae through their widespread success with Bob Marley. Third World signed with Island in 1975, and eventually became the second most successful reggae act on the label. The original Inner Circle group, active since the late 1960s, included key members who would later form the core of Third World: guitarist Stephen 'Cat' Coore, keyboardist Michael 'Ibo' Cooper, vocalist Milton 'Prilly' Hamilton and percussionist Irvin 'Carrot' Jarrett. William 'Bunny Rugs' Clark, who has been Third World's lead singer and figurehead since 1976, says he first performed with these musicians in Inner Circle when he returned to Jamaica from the USA towards the end of 1969.

**Third World [urbanimage.tv/Adrian Boot]**

'I went to New York for about a year,' an exhausted Rugs explains after an appearance at an outdoor festival. 'My mother and father had moved there before me.' Clark grew up in the harsh streets that make up the heart of downtown Kingston, but came across Inner Circle closer to their base in a more genteel area uptown. 'I went to this night club, the Tunnel – that was off Hope Road above Matilda's Corner, you have some Chinese restaurants there. I heard this band and told them that I wanted to do a number with them. Their singer was Bruce Ruffin, and Bruce Ruffin went to England, so I took his place.' Clark stayed with Inner Circle until 1971 when he returned for a longer stint in New York, where he worked with expatriate bands Hugh Hendricks and the Buccaneers and the Bluegrass Experience.

Meanwhile, Inner Circle continued to evolve. Cat Coore had joined the group in 1967 at the tender age of twelve. In 1973 exam pressures forced him to leave, and in July of that year he formed the first incarnation of Third World with bassist Colin Leslie, who would later be the group's business manager. Inner Circle was now being fronted by Jacob Miller, whose stammering vocals brought a contract with Capitol.

**Bunny Rugs [urbanimage.tv/Adrian Boot]**

Cat Coore has said his group's original name was Sons of the Third World, and that its underlying concept was directly related to Michael Manley's programme of Democratic Socialism – perhaps an unsurprising sentiment from a musician whose father was then party chairman and Minister of Finance in Manley's government. Though Coore took the role of musical director from Third World's inception, members drifted in and out of the group in the early years.

Like Cat, Ibo, Prilly and Carrot found their way into Third World from Inner Circle. Drummer Carl Barovier, also ex-Inner Circle, was briefly a Third World member, with former Tomorrow's Children and future Zap Pow drummer Cornel Marshall filling his shoes for a period. Bassist Richard Daley also joined after the disbanding of Tomorrow's Children. Like Inner Circle, this group was associated with the uptown section of Kingston society, but was competent enough to back Toots and the Maytals on their 1972 North American tour. At the start of the 1970s Daley was a member of the Hell's Angels night club band with multi- instrumentalist and future producer Clive 'Lizard' Hunt, plus Wayne Armond and Allah, who would later found the group Chalice. Before that, Daley played in the Astronauts with keyboardist Earl 'Wire' Lindo and drummer Mikey 'Boo' Richards; his recording debut came on Ken Boothe material in the late 1960s.

In 1975, a stabilized Third World played some gigs in England. They caught the attention of Chris Blackwell and signed to Island records for their self-titled debut album, a strong collection of roots material flavoured with rock, jazz and soul elements. The following year William Clark came into the Third World fold. The singer received his first taste of the Jamaican recording scene as a solo artist in 1974–5, after being brought to Lee Perry's Black Ark studio by Glen Adams. Clark subsequently returned to New York, hoping to land a contract with Atlantic; instead, he unexpectedly joined his old Inner Circle band mates in a truly professional Third World that had already supported Bob Marley at the famed Lyceum concert in London. 'I knew this Jamaican who was working for the Vice President of Atlantic records, and I spoke with her several times,' Clark explains. 'Then I went to New York and started to write songs, trying to put together a demo tape to present to Atlantic. Third World was on their first United States tour – that was 1976. They were already signed to Island and they were playing in the [Greenwich] Village [at] the Bottom Line. I went to the concert, and I'v e been with them from that day until now.'

With Clark as lead vocalist, the group's sound grew markedly stronger. Joining the band at the same time was Willie 'Roots' Stewart, a solid drummer tutored by Winston Grennan. Third World's resultant second album, _96 Degrees In The Shade,_ is considered by many to be their best. Songs like the emotive 'Human Market Place' showed their awareness of social injustice; 'Jah Glory' was evidence of a deeply felt spirituality; '1865' (better known as the title track) was a slice of Jamaican history that was a major hit abroad. 'That is strictly about Paul Bogle, who was hanged in Jamaica for leading a revolution against the English for equal rights and justice for his people,' says Clark. 'That was a true story, and the year for that was 1865. Paul Bogle is one of Jamaica's national heroes, so the same way Burning Spear sings about Marcus Garvey, we sing about Paul Bogle.' The band would remain with Island to the end of the decade, scoring their biggest hit in 1978 with a funky cover of the O'Jays' 'Now That We Found Love'.

Once Winston Rodney teamed up with Jack Ruby in 1975, a contract with Island brought Burning Spear to the attention of overseas audiences with the release of _Marcus Garvey_ the following year. 'Jack heard about me, and he happen to check me out,' Rodney recalls. 'We were talking musically, but Jack was more like a sound system man – he never get involved in recording business before. His argument did sounding strong and constructive to me at that time, so he decided to get involved in the recording business and we did two albums, _Marcus Garvey_ and _Man In The Hills.'_ For these recordings, Burning Spear took the form of a trio. 'When dealing with Jack Ruby, I need some harmonies,' Rodney explains, 'so I draw for Delroy Hines and happens to give back [Rupert] Willington some work, use both of them to do background vocals.'

It was in this phase that Rodney began the veneration of Marcus Garvey that has marked the bulk _of_ his work. 'Marcus Garvey is from the town where I-man is from,' Rodney explains. 'There were elderly people wTho knew a lot about Marcus Garvey, but not so much of the young people. [I] go around, listen to various people saying different things about Garvey, and each person know something different. Then I start to run a research, musically, to see if anyone were there singing about Marcus Garvey, but no one was really hitting that point musically, so I decided to get into that. I think the message from Garvey really stands out, not only for me, but for a lot of other people. I think Garvey did have a strong plan, and if more people did pay attention to Garvey and his work it's possible things would be more easier for folks like we today. More people has forgotten Marcus and his philosophy and his doctrine, 'cause people get carried awray.'

Equally moving were songs that examined the legacies of slavery, such as 'The Invasion', 'Tradition' and 'Slavery7 Days'. As Rodney sees it, 'Those songs was part of my history, part of my heritage, the struggling of my people. Knowing that I am an African descendant, an African-Jamaican, those songs based upon the struggling of black people overall – not only [in] Africa. Those songs carrying a different concept, sending a different message.'

Similar ideals, though with more overtly religious overtones, were explored on _Blackheart Man,_ Bunny Waller's debut solo set; also issued by Island in 1976, the album was an artistic triumph, though less successful in terms of sales. It was also partly through the Marley/Wailers connection that Chris Blackwell made a licensing agreement with Lee Perry, issuing in 1976-7 a series of adventurous albums, most of which rapidly achieved cult status. Perry was in the midst of what many feel was his most creative phase, and the new equipment that Island's funding enabled him to install allowed him to expand his sonic horizons, particularly on his superb 1976 creation _Super Ape,_ a disc perhaps rivalled only by Augustus Pablo's _King Tubbys Meets Rockers Uptoivn_ for sheer brilliance in the realm of dub.

Richard Branson's Virgin company entered the reggae arena at a particularly opportune time. When Virgin began to sign artists connected to Channel One, Trojan records was experiencing severe financial problems which ultimately resulted in voluntary liquidation. Smaller labels such as Klik and Vulcan spun off from Trojan's demise. Klik's first release, the highly successful _Dread Docks Dread,_ was a Big Youth set put together by Prince Tony in 1975, but Virgin eventually took control of the disc after Klik failed to maintain momentum. The album's outstanding tracks include 'Marcus Garvey Dread', a powerful recasting of Burning Spear's monumental 'Marcus Garvey' that highlighted certain prophecies attributed to the Jamaican hero of black self-determination

The Pama group, too, ceased producing in 1975, within a year of Harry Palmer's return to Jamaica to begin farming and preaching to a congregation in Mandeville. 'It was a blood-and-sweat business,' Palmer says of the music scene. 'I think I suffered a lot dealing with the artists.' He recalls being physically attacked by singers and producers he was dealing with in Jamaica: 'One broke a bottle and said that he's going to cut me up with it. He just want money – his royalties not enough. Then one of them got me and bucked me with his head. They made up their minds that the records sold millions, and you know nothing didn't go like that. He too wanted a cheque, so when they were finished I said, "I'm going to give you guys this, but I don't want anything more to do with you." I wrote out a cheque, but the bank said, "We can't change it", because I had called. I wasn't going to give them that money. They came back and threatened me, said Mr Seaga told him they'l l take it up. I said, "I don't have to be afraid of anybody, because I'm straight."'

Palmer also reaffirmed his religious commitment at this time. 'My wife being a devout church lady, I had to keep dropping her [at church] and picking her up back, so one day they persuaded me to come in. I thought, "Gosh, I'm driving a Rolls Royce", and I sat where I could see the car. Then something came to me: "Why are you worshipping a bit of tin? Don't ever look out there again! Change your seat and listen to what the preacher is saying. These material things won't get you anywhere." I went to Nottingham and got baptised, and that's when I went into agriculture. The reggae thing was conflicting with my religious thing, because by then the records were getting really rude.'

Pama had typically aimed their releases at Britain's black population, while Trojan targeted the white working class; instead of reaching for either group, Virgin followed Island's lead by going for university students and the hipper end of the rock audience. The Channel One connection brought Virgin highly successful albums by the Diamonds and I Roy, plus dub works featuring the Revolutionaries; with Prince Tony, Virgin scored the Gladiators and U Roy. HowTever, some have suggested that Virgin had a tendency to place too much emphasis on appearances and reputation in this era.

'I heard that Virgin never sign us because I never carried a Rasta image,' says Vernon Buckley of the Maytones, whose finest and most spiritually oriented work was handled outside Jamaica by Burning Sounds, a smaller independent. 'Those days we used to sell a lot, but we never really saying "Rastafari".' In contrast, Keith Hudson had the right look when signed to Virgin in 1976, but the poor response to the soul mode of _Too Expensive_ caused his contract to be terminated early, forcing Hudson to issue the excellent dub set _Brand_ on his Joint label in New York; its vocal companion, _Rasta Communication,_ was released by UK independent Green-sleeves. Virgin fared better with Peter Tosh's 1976 solo landmark _Eegalize It_ – acquired from CBS, who apparently picked it up from Island – and its strong follow-up, _Equal Rights,_ but Tosh was later lured to Rolling Stones records by Mick Jagger, whose attempt to bring pop stardom to the reggae firebrand drew predictably inconsistent results.

Though aspects of such companies' involvement in reggae has sometimes been viewed with scepticism in retrospect, certain acts clearly drew artistic benefit from the patronage of major labels. Sly Dunbar says the live tours that Virgin organized brought dub into the performance arena, as heard on a U Roy twelve-inch recorded in London in August 1976. 'The Lyceum ballroom with the Diamonds and U Roy, I think this was the breaking point that the drum [became] such a dominant figure within reggae music,' Dunbar explains. 'They said that dub wise couldn't be played live, they said it was the engineer doing all these tricks, so when we went to drum and bass and work it the people said, "No, I can't believe they'r e really playing it!" We go to bass and drum and go to rhythm, and one time there was a cue that somebody miss and I was playing the drum alone, and I start rolling the tom-toms around and the band came in. It was really a miscue, but we work it out and the place went in a frenzy.'

The Channel One sound was a perfect platform for deejays, and the one to hit the biggest on rhythms cut there by Sly and company was Dillinger. 'I come to Channel One where I do "Ragnumpiza", "CB 200", "Buckingham Palace" and "Cokane In My Brain",' the toaster boasts.

'Ragnumpiza' utilized the bare rhythm of a hard Channel One recut of Bob Andy's 'Set Me Free', with Sly Dunbar's militant drumming style and vibrant horn breaks providing a solid backdrop for Dillinger's jargon-filled lyrics and lengthy rolling r's ; he explains that the song is about ghetto sufferers, as 'Ragnumpiza come like ragamuffin'. 'CB 200' was a major hit that shifted Gregory Isaacs' uplifting cut of Bob Andy's 'Sunshine For Me' into a tale of dreadlocked motorcycle bravado. The atmospheric 'Caymanas Park' (aka 'Race Day') was a further success that captured the excitement of an afternoon at Kingston's racetrack. 'That was about two of Jamaica's champion race jockey, Emilio Rodriguez and George Ho-Sang,' the toaster explains. 'They was two great jockey that used to win a lot of races – they was so popular that you'v e got to put them in a song.'

It was the Yankee-styled tale of substance abuse 'Cokane In My Brain' that launched Dillinger to international stardom. 'I used to be on the North Coast at the Playboy Hotel in Saint Mary where a lot of hippies used to hang out, and we used to jam in the moonlight,' he recalls. 'I used to watch them get high, and they sing, "I'v e got cocaine in my brain", so I get the inspiration from there.'

The rhythm track of 'Cokane' was adapted from American funk hit 'Do It 'Til You'r e Satisfied' by BT Express, its bouncing grooves allowing Dillinger to explore better his concept of what life was like on the streets of New York City. His half-sung delivery and clever, rhyming lyrics brought the greatest success a deejay had ever achieved when the record was chosen for overseas promotion by Island records; the song was a smash not only in the UK and USA, but also in Germany, Holland, France and elsewhere.

The rising popularity of 'Cokane' and the _CB 200_ album in 1976 somewhat overshadowed another creative deejay work released by Island – the densely textured and esoteric _Colombia Collie_ by Jah Lion, the toaster better known as Jah Lloyd. It was the first Island-issued album to be produced by Lee Perry, with whom Jah Lloyd worked solidly for much of the mid-1970s, but financial disagreements led to a rupture by 1977 and the toaster subsequently signed to Virgin. 'I move away because there was a dispute between me and him,' Jah Lloyd explained. '[Perry] wanted to take me _on_ a tour after we done _Colombia Collie -_ never get much happiness from it. We start another album, do quite a lot of songs, but I left and do _Humble One_ for Morwell as Jah Lloyd the Black Lion, and I do _Black Moses_ for myself

Perry had better success writh the vocal material that Island released, first with Max Romeo's _War Ina Babylon_ album and then with Junior Murvin's _Police And Thieves._ Murvin is a singer with a wide vocal range, but is best known for a searing falsetto largely patterned on Curtis Mayfield. In person he is a distinctly humble man, still living in the modestly furnished home of his youth in Port Antonio.

'I was born in Swift River,' he explains, 'and my mother took me up here to my great-grandmother when I was one week old, so I grew up in this same house. From six years old I usually imitate Billy Eckstine, Wilfred Edwards, Nat King Cole, Louis Armstrong, Sam Cooke. I sing in every voice, but I mostly use the treble voice they call falsetto. When I was thirteen my great-grandmother died and I went to live with my grandmother in Montego Bay, pursuing a career in mechanics. After I left school, my auntie sent me a guitar from the States. The first band I sang with was the Hippy Boys – that time I usually sing as Junior Soul. About three times I sang with the band. After I left Hippy Boys, I went to sing with Derrick Harriott and Miss Pottinger. The first song I wrote was "Solomon" – it was a hit for Derrick Harriott.

While living in Trench Town, Murvin cut further material for Harriott and Sonia Pottinger before Noel BrowTn _of_ the Chosen Few brought him into the Falcons. Frustrated by a lack of concrete success, Murvin spent a few years back in Portland in the mid-seventies. 'I was singing in a band named Young Experience in Port Antonio,' he recalls. 'Bobby Ellis was the arranger. We went to Cuba, play right round Jamaica, play at National Arena for the Prime Minister's wife's birthday, Beverley Manley. When the band went defunct, I wrote "Police And Thieves".'

**Proverbs: Junior Murvin and friend** **[urbanimage.tv/Adrian Boot]**

'Police And Thieves' captured the tense feeling of a Kingston riven by political and social differences; the song translated perfectly well to London, where black citizens were experiencing untold levels of police brutality. The song stayed at the top of the British reggae charts for nearly six months and was named 'Reggae Single of the Year' by _Melody Maker_ and _Black Echoes._ 'Police And Thieves' was eventually covered by the Clash – a direct expression of the way the British punk movement was enthralled and influenced by the rebellious spirit and musical individuality of reggae.

Junior Murvin's acclaimed _Police And Thieves_ album was issued by Island in April 1977; much of the disc, and other recordings like 'Cool Out Son', a 1979 single cut for Joe Gibbs, made use of folk wisdom and parables. 'I never know that I was singing in proverbs until [disc jockey] Winston Barnes from RJR started calling me "Proverbs",' laughs the singer. 'That mean I'm spiritually oriented, along with the line of David.'

Although the British record companies were spreading reggae's liberating message, there was sometimes an artistic price to be paid. For instance, Virgin executives tried to steer the Mighty Diamonds into crossover territory, cutting the bland _Ice On Fire_ with Allen Toussant and American session players in New Orleans in 1977, followed by the marginally less commercial _Planet Earth._ As Tabby Diamond recalls, 'Virgin records, we sign up with them in 1975 with an album named _Right Time. Right Time_ was a four-track album, and them say them need a twenty-four-track recording now, and through we sign with the company we no have no option, so we went to Nassau, Compass Point studio. It finish decorating and fix up, but we were the first to start record in that studio, and we did an album named _Planet Earth. Planet Earth_ come in a different kind of vibes, 'nuff things a gwan with it through Virgin that we never bargain for. We have the blame, but the whole album was like a test. The company want a crossover thing, so there was a little bit of contrast with this album, but it was a good album too.'

Similarly, after the long gap caused by Leroy Sibbles' emigration to Canada the Heptones sprang back into action with the _Night Food_ album, released by Island in early 1976. The disc coupled classic singles from 1973-4 with recut Studio One material and other new songs, all cut at Harry J and assembled under the direction of Island staff member and music columnist Danny Holloway. Unfortunately the album was altered overseas, with cheesy overdubs and entirely gratuitous strings added to certain tracks. Though such elements were theoretically included to bolster mass-market appeal, the end result was something of a throwback to the late 1960s, when pop-oriented reggae had been given a philharmonic sprinkling in the hope of being played on _Top Of The Pops._ 'We have some good songs on that,' says Sibbles, 'but I don't like the production – it too watered-down. But I was willing to do whatever necessary to get a breakthrough. I was hoping that these guys know what they were doing and were capable of getting the right sound – I was hoping that they know what it took to break. But I was wrong again.' Their follow-up, _Party Time,_ was artistically more successful, created without foreign input in the rootsier confines of Lee Perry's Black Ark. However, its issue marked Sibbles' return to Canada and his ultimate departure from the group.

Some of the more challenging productions in this period were created by Geoffrey Chung for Tropical Sound Tracks, often in conjunction with Clive Hunt. Taking a break from a Tuff Gong session with Ivorian reggae star Alpha Blondy, Hunt says that the company had high-ranking connections. 'It was a communications office where they do advertisement for the government,' he explains, 'and they involved with the government. They hired people like Geoffrey Chung, Bob Andy and some of the guys from Corporation of Love – these were talented people who were university graduates on the edge of the music business. Geoffrey Chung tell them, "You need Clive Hunt", because me and Geoffrey Chung were always a team: in our day we used to be Psyche and Trim, Bonnie and Clyde.'

Like many of Jamaica's great horn players, Hunt first learned music in reform school. 'I born in 1952 in Linstead. My father was a cane farmer and herb farmer – he was a Rastaman. I have eighteen brothers and sisters, and I'm the oldest one. I was a real bad boy at school: they took me to family court and I end up going to Stony Hill Approved School, a reformatory. Everyone had to do a trade: I was a tailor, and I was at the top at thirteen. They said they was going to send me home for Christmas, but I felt really bad going back to the community 'cause you made your parents feel like you were a disgrace to the family, so I didn't feel good enough going home with the surprise of being the first in tailoring. With the music class I wasn't involved, but I stay outside and watched through the windows. One day I went inside to join. The teacher, Joe Moore, one of the man who involved with putting together the national anthem, he say, "Today is the day they are taking the test", so I start tell him all the notes, the bass and the treble clef, and the position of the trombone, fingering on the trumpet – I learn all of that from outside. We went and did the test, and I came first – went home with both prizes. When I came back, he decided that I wouldn't do anything else – no more tailoring, just music – and it's been like that from that day.'

When Hunt graduated from Story Hill, a lack of employment opportunities brought him to the army, and it was while he was a soldier that Hunt began recording. 'My first session, I was a trumpeter – Fabulous Five asked me to do something. The first real session I did was Lorna Bennett, that album she had, _Breakfast In Bed_ at Harry J Studio. I remember I thief some time and go over the fence, [as] the studio is next door to the military [camp], and Geoffrey Chung was [camp], and Geoffrey Chung was the one who asked me to come to play. I remember I was sitting and reading, I wasn't really interested – I didn't know that these were the top musicians in Jamaica. I was helping out the musicians, so they discovered that I knew a lot about music and asked me to come back the next day.'

Hunt's partnership with Chung shaped the most notable Sound Tracks material, including Max Romeo's challenging concept album _Revelation Time_ and the Abyssinians' debut album _Forward On To Zion;_ Hunt also arranged prime material for other producers. 'Whenever Geoffrey Chung would sign some project, I would get to do that,' he recalls. 'When I was working on Abyssinians, I was doing overdubs at Joe Gibbs' and it sounded so good that I just started to work a thing with Joe Gibbs. I said, "I work on your stuff and then you give me studio time." 'At the same time, Hunt was cutting solo work credited to Lizard, Azul or occasionally the In Crowd. 'Me is the first man in the studio making things by meself with no other musicians,' he boasts. 'Me did "Satta I", do everything almost, and "Milk And Honey Bees", me did all of that. The original credited In Crowd band, but it wasn't In Crowd band, it was just me.'

Hunt has a keen sense of musical arrangement as heard on the _Legendary Skatalites_ album (later reissued as _African Roots),_ a 1975 reunion set of Niyabinghi instrumentals instigated by Lloyd Brevett. 'I did work with an Australian group,' Brevett explains. 'Somebody send for them to work between the Glass Bucket Club and Myrtle Bank Hotel. Then I start a group with Ras Michael on vocals, but he take the tune there that we write, go behind our back and start to sell them, so I just back out and start my own thing. Then I make an LP out of that named _African Roots_ [with] Brother Jack, Sidney Wolfe, I Marts. I use them for the Rasta drum and it end up with Skatalites play on it: [Lester] Sterling, Tommy [McCook], Ernest Ranglin.' The album was cut between Lee Perry's Black Ark and Herman ChinLoy's recently opened twenty-four-track Aquarius studio in Half Way Tree.

Some of the most politically relevant music to benefit from the Geoffrey Chung/ Clive Hunt association came from Pablo Moses, a highly inspired singer with a wide range and very individual approach. 'From [when] I was a kid, singing was a thing that was in me,' he says after an enthusiastic Sunsplash performance. 'I was born [in] a little district in Manchester named Culloden in 1948. My mom was a singer in the church choir and I went to church choir too. My mom usually have a shop, and when I was five they put me on the counter to sing for everybody that come in. It just happened that from [when] I was a kid I can sing falsetto in a certain way, and I can sing natural baritone, so I usually practise along with Ray Charles and Sam Cooke. My mom migrated and I was raised by my aunt, and then my mom brought us out to Vineyard Town. I went to Excelsior High School on Mountain View Avenue, then I went to Jamaica School of Music for two and a half years, did guitar and theory of music'

After an unsatisfactory period in singing groups, Pablo broke out as a solo artist with 'I Man A Grasshopper', an unusual number relating the conflict the singer experienced when smoking herb. 'Most of the guys I formed a group with, they don't want to stick to being original. Maybe they would make a quicker money [copying others], but I was telling them it's not just the money, you have to establish a foundation. All the groups got broken up, so I became a soloist. The name that them give me is Pablito Henry and you know that not an African name, so it couldn't be my name – it's a slave-master name, so that's why I call myself Pablo Moses.

'In 1975 I did my first song, "I Man A Grasshopper", at the Black Ark studio, with Lee Perry as the engineer and Geoffrey Chung as the producer. In Vineyard Town I met up with Geoffrey Chung's brother Mikey, he was the first one that introduce me to some chords on guitar. We usually hang out together and he was an accomplished musician, so being around him was like an honour. Seeing him playing, and listening to the music and observing how they do things, I just adopt those principles. Then I get introduced to Geoffrey Chung, we start to move together and he liked the song. He said, "This is something new, it's unique." Mikey Chung played rhythm guitar, Michael Murray from In Crowd played the lead guitar, Clive Hunt played bass, Robbie Lyn and Geoffrey Chung was on the keyboards. We had synthesizer, organ and piano. Everyone had a jam session – they all enjoy that type of chord change in that song, so immediately in the studio it was a buzz.'

The song made an impact on both sides of the Atlantic and led to the recording of further material. His exquisite debut album has a very particular sound, marked by rock guitar and synth lines and with echoes of jazz in its horns. 'Sound Tracks wanted an album, so I started to write songs. Every set of new chords that I learn I write new lyrics, and that's how the album _Revolutionary Dream_ came about. "We Should Be In Angola" was done at Aquarius studio, [and] we did the rest of the songs, "Give I Fe I Name" and "Blood Money", at Joe Gibbs' studio.'

Though such material was well received overseas, it was rockers and the sound of Channel One that really ruled Jamaica in the mid-seventies, reigning largely unchallenged in 1975 and early 1976. Unfortunately, a violent incident caused Channel One to lose its dominance temporarily. 'What really get us down is when my brother Paul got killed, that's '77,' says Joseph Hoo-Kim remorsefully. 'He usually sell motorcycles and parts from the same premises, and the Channel One sound system, he get involved with it. Kenneth, the next brother, he was involved in the motorcycle thing too. We was playing domino, three o'c lock in the morning, on the beach in Greenwich Town. It was a robbery – they rob him for his gun. I get a bit down when Paul got killed – we weren't doing anything for a long little while. That was the main thing why I came abroad, went to Brooklyn and opened a record store: J and L, at Utica Avenue, with a fellow by the name of Lowell.'

Back in Kingston, the next to lead the field was Joe Gibbs' sixteen-track studio in Retirement Crescent; Gibbs followed Channel One's lead by revamping Studio One and Treasure Isle rock steady rhythms for hits with a pool of singers and deejays and a series of sublime dub albums. Different sets of musicians, typically composed of members _of_ the Morwells and Soul Syndicate groups, built rhythms for Gibbs; similarities to Channel One were achieved by regulars such as Sly Dunbar and Ossie Hibbert, plus horn players such as Vin Gordon, Herman Marquis, Tommy McCook and Richard 'Dirty Harry' Hall. By late 1976 the Professionals were the in-house band, featuring Lloyd Parks on bass; on keyboards, Franklyn 'Bubbler' Waul diversified the sound with bubbling clavinet and synthesizer licks, augmented by players such as Errol 'Tarzan' Nelson. Gibbs' product was given international issue from 1977 on Lightning, a subsidiary of the Warner-Electric-Atlantic group; later material surfaced on Laser, another sub-label of WEA. Gibbs' dub albums, expertly mixed by Errol Thompson, were also highly popular in the UK. The Professionals' _African Dub Chapter Three_ was particularly successful: the first two chapters in the series were fairly sedate Soul Syndicate dubs, but the third had ringing doorbells, banging gongs and myriad other '3-D' effects.

The most exciting new vocal group to get their break at Joe Gibbs' was Culture, a trio that favoured religious material. Joseph Hill, the group's leader and composer of most of their material, uses his distinct soprano to shape lyrics in the vernacular of the countryside, the songs made fuller by the able harmony of the other two members. At a London hotel, following an inspirational performance, Hill has a refreshing enthusiasm, though one red, gold and green false tooth and a lazy left eye are visibly peculiar. Joseph says he got his start at Studio One. 'Myself was part of the band Soul Defenders,' he stresses, 'and in the early days of Freddy McKay I helped arrange a lot of his harmony, like "Picture On The Wall". I did a lot of percussion in Coxsone's studio as well, and I did my first song, "Behold". That was back in 1972, upwards to about '73. Three years went by, then I start doing my own thing.'

He formed Culture, originally known as the African Disciples, with his cousin, Albert Walker, and Kenneth Paley [aka Lloyd Dayes] in 1976. 'It was during the season of Easter,' Hill recalls. 'I used to play instruments in other bands on the North Coast, and I came home to catch a little rest. I was at my uncle's house and I saw Albert appear. He proposed, "Let us do something in the studio." That same Friday, we saw the politicians came with a band. I ask one of the [band] members what's happening in town, so I say, "I'm going to the studio on Monday morning." We went there and a lot of adventurous things take place, visible or invisible, wherever we went. It was a joy to be there, because we gain acceptance.'

**Joseph Hill of Culture [David Katz]**

Before the group's successful audition at Joe Gibbs', Hill was given a helping hand by Jach LloyedI buck up on people like Joseph Hill of Culture,' Lloyd proudly related. 'Him carry me way down in the bush and say, "Hear this, Jah Lloyd. Me can sing, you know." Him come a town for me to record him a couple times, at Chancery Lane corner where Gregory Isaac's shop is, and I financially embarrassed, couldn't afford to produce them, because the business taking up more cash. [Blacka] Morwell was up at Joe Gibbs' doing a thing for Gibbo, so I said, "Go to Morwell, and tell him Jah Lloyd sent you." When them go there, they wasn't named Culture, they was named something like the Israelites – it was four of them. When we select them, we lay the rhythms like "Jah Jah See Them A Come" on "State Of Emergency".'

The song to bring the group widespread attention – particularly among a punk audience when issued in Britain – was the apocalyptic "Two Sevens Clash", a song recounting Garvey's many prophecies. 'It was a Saturday morning,' Hill explains, 'when lightning and thunder, which is a natural disaster, chopped down a cotton tree right before the police station at Ferry. That was a bad sign, but they take no heed of brutality. Marcus Garvey was imprisoned at Spanish Town by the Jamaican government, and on his way out of the prison, when the sentence was over, he prophesised and said, "That gate that I walk through, no other one shall use it again." It has been paste up, locked, and if they wished to speak the truth about cell number eighteen in that prison, for a number of years it could not be locked, because that was the one that Marcus Garvey was in.'

Hill says he was inspired to sing about Garvey because the leader's message remains relevant. 'When they see their back is going up against the wall, that was the time we reminded them to remember what Marcus Garvey say,' he continues. 'That was the time they start getting awake. If I and Burning Spear and even Mighty Diamonds did not start making suggestion of Marcus Garvey, and keep making suggestion of Marcus Garvey, they would be there still sittin' on their same butts, making their same mistakes all over again.'

Along with Dennis Brown, Culture was one of the key acts that boosted the popularity of Joe Gibbs' stable; and although a number of other hits followed, such as the triumphant 'Natty Dread Taking Over' and faithful 'Zion Gate', their time with the producer was brief. By 1978 they had begun a relationship with Sonia Pottinger, who took over Treasure Isle on Duke Reid's death in September 1976 following a long battle with cancer. The resultant material, including songs first recorded at Joe Gibbs' and cut afresh at Treasure Isle, was issued abroad on Front Line, Virgin's reggae subsidiary.

**Lead Twinkle Norman Grant [David Katz]**

Much of the Front Line roster was chosen by Johnny 'Rotten' Lydon, who flew to Kingston in February 1978 after leaving the Sex Pistols. One of the most important acts to sign to the lable before Lydon's involvement was the Twinkle Brothers, a group from the dusty country town of Falmouth east of Montego Bay. The group began as a vocal duo in the ska years. 'My brother Ralston and myself, from '62, we actually got the name,' says lead singer Norman Grant, taking a break from rehearsals at a dingy South London studio. 'We make our instrument out of cans and fishing line, and people always gather around and listen, so one night a Rastaman named So-Mi-Say say, "I'm going to give you guys a name – the Twinkle Brothers." It was in the evening, so I guess he see the stars. When Jamaica got independence, they came with this pop and mento Festival song contest, so we enter at our parish level and won every year from '62 to '68.'

'We are from the ghetto area of Falmouth,' adds the soft-spoken Ralston, the harmony specialist of the group, 'and we started very young: Norman was about six, I was about eight. Inna them early days, we tune into the American music on the radio like Otis Redding, James Brown, Aretha Franklin. We get a little from the R&B, blend it with a spiritual, gospel thing.'

'We usually took part in church concerts,' continues Norman, who has something of a cockney accent after twenty-five years in London. 'We used to go to the Anglican and other churches. You had the Pocomania church in the week where they play drums.'

**Ralston Grant:**

**Twinkles harmony specialist [David Katz]**

From 1960, when he was ten, Norman was performing in North Coast hotel bands such as Schubert and the Miracles and the Cardinals; he cut his debut single in 1964. 'My aunt was in Kingston, close to the university hospital. She said, "You guys are talented, come to Kingston and go to the studios." But it wasn't easy, 'cause it's far. Me and my brother were going to Prince Buster, Treasure Isle, JJ, when we get school holidays. The day we went to Coxsone they were just packing up – they said, "Youth, if you guys came earlier, we would a record you." Then my brother went away to a camp where they teach you skills, so I went to Kingston on my own and made my first record at fourteen for Leslie Kong, "Somebody Please Help me".'

'My mother is a higgler [market trador or street vendor],' adds Ralston, 'so that day, Norman went to Kingston to buy some stuff for her to sell and went to Beverley's , and Roland Alphonso tell Beverley's , "This youth have a nice tune." Then we bring in another guy that live in the same yard with us, Eric Bernard, and go on for a while. Eric went to Montego Bay, and we bring in my brother-in-law, Karl Hyatt, then we do the first group song on the Treasure Isle label with Duke Reid.' The song, 'Matthew Mark', made reference to the apostles.

'From [when] I was sixteen, I was putting on stage shows,' Norman adds, 'bringing down all the top guys from Kingston: Desmond Dekker and the Aces, John Holt, Ken Boothe.' Both Norman and Ralston gained further live experience working in the North Coast hotel scene.

In the same period, the Twinkle Brothers were augmented by the various additions of Karl Hyatt, Eric Bernard and Derrick Brown. 'When one guy wasn't around, we'd use another,' Norman notes, 'so it was from two to three, then to four.' Meanwhile, the group progressed to higher levels of the Festival contest. 'In '68 we won a gold medal in the group section, and I won a gold medal as a solo artist. In '69 we won again, and 1970 we took part in the professional side and came third, got a bronze medal, with "You Can Do It Too". Being in the Festival, we were getting more exposed, so we met up with Bunny Lee. He recorded the Festival song and "It's Not Who You Know", "Miss Labba Labba", "Sweet Young Thing", "Miss World", "Too Late". Soul Syndicate, the first session they played on as a band, it was Twinkle Brothers they backed. We also do some songs for Phil Pratt, Sunshot label, like "Do Your Own Thing". "No Big Thing" was a hit in Jamaica at the time.'

By 1973, the Twinkle Brothers _were_ a fully self-contained unit. 'Norman said, "This group is too big, we have to learn to play some instruments,"' Ralston laughs. 'So he buy some second-hand.' Ralston handled guitar, Eric Bernard played keyboards, Derrick Brown played bass and Karl Hyatt was on percussion.

'Nobody would play the drums,' Norman chuckles, 'so I end up playing them. Norman continued to be employed by hotel bands and toured Mexico and Guatemala with Sonny Bradshaw in 1975, but became chiefly concerned with Twinkle self-productions. 'We were recording with other producers, but about '74, '75, I stop singing for other people, just deal with the Twinkle. That's where we came with the first album, _Rasta 'Pon Top.'_

_Rasta 'Pon Top_ addressed liberation struggles and the African identity of Rastafari, a notable shift in the group's focus. 'All over the world, there were changes,' says Norman. 'You have groups like the Temptations singing some heavy lyrics, so myself as a writer, I decided I'm going to do things like that. Plus, with humanity, I sing what I believe. It's not even a matter of the sales, 'cause the music help us also to see and take us around different people, and you hear of countries that you thought weren't even in the world. When I was growing up, the spiritual part of the Bible tell me about Jerusalem, and I used to believe it was somewhere in the sky. But being in music opened my eyes very early to know that these things was on earth, that it wasn't a dream thing,'

'Most of our songs say something about Africa,' Ralston adds. 'We have the love side too, but we'r e more into the deeper roots, what's going on around the world. Things that we feel from the ghetto, that's what we put out. We like to go in some chords that nobody else touch – that's how we feel it. We'r e from the countryside and we feel it more spiritual. We are not the city person, we are more laid back and with God.'

With the band now on solid footing, Norman opened a record shop in Falmouth's Water Square and began producing material with local talent. 'One of the guy in the band was a cabinetmaker. He build me a shop – the little shop with the big stock. When we started producing ourselves, if we have like five songs for the Twinkle Brothers to record on a session, I would carry like five other artists, and record one-one song with them.'

_Rasta 'Pon Top_ and these accompanying singles were issued in Britain on Grounation, a roots subsidiary of Vulcan records. 'I was putting out lots of stuff in Jamaica on my label,' Norman recalls, 'and it was very hard. We were doing everything ourselves, driving round the island. Every other week you go to a shop and they tell you, "We have that one. You have a new one?" I couldn't be putting out new songs that often, so I say I have to find a new market. A lawyer friend of mine was going to England and he said, "You could stay where's I'm staying", so that's how I came. I went to Vulcan and they wras interested in all those material.'

When Vulcan folded about 1977, executive Chips Richards set up Carib Gems with former Pama employee Joe Farquarson and his colleague Adrian Sherwood, who had previously run the J&A distribution service together. Sherwood would shortly go into record production, notably working with Prince Fari on his splendid _Message From The King_ set and mixing the _Cry Tough Dub Encounter_ series. The Twinkle Brothers' second album, a less-focussed set called _Do Your Own Thing,_ was licensed to Carib Gems, and a couple of singles, including a recut of 'It's Not Who You Know', surfaced on the Tops label, based at a record shop in Brixton's Acre Lane.

The disc that gave them the broader recognition they deserved was _Love,_ initially issued as a ten-inch mini-LP on Virgin Front Line; half the material was cut with Sly and the Revolutionaries at Channel One. 'The ending of '77, I did a session in Jamaica and came up with five songs. I went to Island and they told me to come back in two weeks, but them time I come to England only for like four weeks, so you have to do things quick. Chips Richards told me that Virgin is looking [for] artists, so I went down there with "Solid As A Rock", "Free Africa", "Watch The Hypocrites" and the version to "Free Africa" with Sir Lee. I had this other track, "I Love You So", which I recorded at Treasure Isle studio, but I didn't think it was up to standard because the volume was very low. When I play it to them, they say "Yeah, we like that", so they got the six tracks and they came out with it as a ten-inch – it have a different look in the shops.'

The strong harmony arrangements and pertinent message of _Love_ brought the Twinkle Brothers into the overseas major league; at home in Jamaica, they continued to run their grassroots record shop and label in Falmouth. Similarly, though Dennis Brown's material for Joe Gibbs was given major-label promotion from 1978, the singer remained strongly aligned with his core roots audience on self-produced work. Brown also played a major role in raising the profile of Junior Delgado, an old friend whose deep, rough voice carries spine-tingling portents of anguish. 'I know Dennis Brown from I was a kid,' the burly singer chuckles. 'I and D. Brown have around two decades tied up in music, because Dennis Brown was like a whiz kid. Everybody used to love him – they even used to love him more than Bob Marley.'

Delgado was born in Kingston in 1954: '48½ Luke Lane, I grew up there until the city was getting combustible and my people move out to Rockfort. The first time I was singing is at Ward Theatre. Me and my mother went to watch the movies, and I went up on the stage and they throw money at me. My mother was a dressmaker, a merchant tailor also. My dad used to work on tower cranes and heavy-duty equipment like JCBs and E25 Caterpillar. It's really singing [that] take me away from that area.'

His career started with the group Time Unlimited. 'I and Orville Smith and Junior Marshall was Time Unlimited, but this guy that was bigger than us, Glasford Manning, he used to sing for Coxsone Downbeat and he used to live over in Trench Town, Ninth Street. Over Trench Town, they was evacuating some people to Callalloo Bed, near to [Washington] Boulevard. We meet up Glasford Manning in that swamp over there with a lot of mosquitoes. We were rehearsing and Trevor Douglas take the group to Scratch to do an audition. Scratch says, "We have to record him right now." He wanted to do it right there, same night, because he's a genius – don't let them tell you nothing, that man is a genius.'

A few crucial nuggets surfaced from these early sessions: 'He and Joe Gibbs release "Reaction" on a label called Reflection. "African Sound", Glasford Manning was doing lead, and "23rd Psalms", I was doing the lead.' Because Scratch held back additional material, the group cut sides for Rupie Edwards as the Heaven Singers; they then cut some tunes for Tommy Cowan that remains unreleased.

In 1975 Delgado went solo, recutting 'Reaction' for Larry Lawrence with the Wailers band at Harry J; this was followed by 'Thinking' and 'Every Natty' for Niney the Observer, which brought him back into close contact with Dennis Brown. 'Niney used to have us in his hand, me and D. Brown. We lived together, move up and down together. Me and Dennis Brown went away and recorded [a version of the Heptones'] "Party Time". He did put it out on DEB first and we did sell forty thousand out of a car back, just like that. We start making songs like "Trickster". A lot of hits keep coming.'

The earliest Delgado hit to surface on DEB Music was 'Tition', a critique of politicians set to an infectious rhythm. 'It was me and Chinna who do that song in Channel One studio. Chinna was playing bass, Keith Sterling was playing keyboards and Santa Davis was on drums – only three instruments.' A later hit, 'Devil's Throne', was subsequently licensed to Joe Gibbs. 'Those tunes was done in Channel One,' Junior recalls. 'It was Ossie Hibbert done that song with me. He gave it to Joe Gibbs and they gave him a car, a Ford Cortina L.'

Junior's debut album, the 1978 set _Taste Of The Young Heart,_ was highly popular in Jamaica and the UK. Tastefully assembled by Dennis Brown, the album was issued on DEB Music and distributed in the UK by EMI; one of its outstanding tracks is the fearsome 'Storm Is Coming', an apocalyptic number produced by Augustus Pablo. 'I and Pablo go back from kid days, like Dennis Brown,' Delgado reminisces. 'We didn't come in this business as big people. I remember when we used to go to a club to sing, they were hiding us from the naked women because we were little.'

While DEB Music helped Delgado's star to rise, Augustus Pablo was gaining international prestige through the overseas issue of ethereal productions on the Hawkeye label. Some of the product had been recorded several years earlier. 'Everything in Pablo's camp happens very slowly,' says Carlton Hines, founder of the group Tetrack. 'Money was always in short supply.' Though only a backing vocalist in the group, Hines was the writer and arranger of their material; he is a down-to-earth individual who now runs a restaurant in Queens, New York. Over an excellent lunch of steamed fish, Hines recalls the group's rise: 'I spent my formative years in East Kingston. In Mountain View there was a sound system called Tetrack, run by a guy called Owen Archer. Tetrack is really the title of a provincial ruler in the Roman Empire. That set was one of the baddest sets in the East – many artists would come by and leave dub plates. With Paul Mangaroo and Dave Harvey, we form a group as Tetrack. They were guys in the neighbourhood – we used to meet under a mango tree. A guy called Denzil would sit in on the rehearsals sometimes – he used to go to KC with Pablo. He said, "I'l l introduce you to Pablo", and we were in awe of Pablo because of "Java". The group started '72, so we had been rehearsing for almost two years. We went uptown, check out Pablo and discover Pablo always wanted a group, because Pablo love group singing. We went to a place called Black Ants Lane, off Red Hills Road – a have-not community. Pablo's playing some tracks and he picked up "Let's Get Together". I forgot the name of the group, but it was an obscure [foreign] song, and he gave it to us to rehearse.'

This debut recording was executed at the Black Ark with the assistance of Lee 'Scratch' Perry. 'When we went into Black Ark studio, it's like three scaredy-cats – they had to turn off the lights in the studio. We ended up positioning ourselves in such a way that Scratch could not see anybody's face. It's '74, probably about August. A few months afterwards, it came out.'

Tetrack came to the attention of the outside world a few years later, when Hawkeye picked up an original number called 'Let's Get Started'; the label later issued a remixed 'Let's Get Together' on a disco with Jacob Miller's 'Each One Teach One'. As Hines recalls, 'We did a couple of other nondescript songs, then we did "Let's Get Started". That song did not include all three Tetracks, because Dave wasn't there. We went to Tubby's to record that, and a number of Rockers people were to record that day, like Ricky Grant, Locksley Castell, Hugh Mundell. Pat Kelly happened to come along and Pablo said, "Come sing a harmony". We look in _Black Echoes_ and saw it at number ten. When I looked back later it was at number one, so Pablo said, "Let's do an album", but because of finances the album came much later than it should.'

The bulk of Augustus Pablo's work never made it on to a major overseas label, but it is among the most moving and individually spiritual music ever recorded. The Phase One catalogue, which also remained outside the majors, was likewise composed of enthralling roots material. Roy Francis, the label's founder, is on the balcony of Mixing Lab, the perpetually buzzing studio he currently runs near Half Way Tree. Despite the hectic atmosphere, with his two cell phones constantly ringing, the mustachioed Francis is relaxed, cheerful and very accommodating. 'I was born in Trench Town, 1945,' he says, his elongated vowels betraying the many years he spent in New York. 'My dad used to sell things on the street like mangoes – all kind of hustling he used to do. My mom used to sell downtown on the sidewalk. When I was around ten I went to Spanish Town, and I go to America when I was around seventeen. My dad went on farm work, run off and hook up with some woman, get his green card and sponsor me up there in Brooklyn. I go to Peterborough School of Aeronautics in New Jersey. I'm a certified airline mechanic, work for Delta and Pan Am.'

Though he lived in Brooklyn Francis'j ob enabled him to make frequent visits to Jamaica, where he went into record production in 1977. 'As I used to work with the airline and fly free, I used to [be] in Jamaica every week. I met this guy named Derrick Smith, his alias is Gurr. He used to work for Jimmy Radway, selling his records. I was fooling around with his cousin, so he say, "You want to invest in some music?" I decide I'm going to put some money into it, so he bring this group to me named the Chantells, tell me that they'r e wicked singers. They record a couple songs with Duke Reid before I met them. I don't know nothing about producing, so Gun-was the one. We went to Randy's downtown – he do the rhythm, produced four tracks with the group: "Children Of Jah", "Natty Supper", "Blood River" and "Stumbling Block", with Horsemouth Wallace, Robbie Shakespeare, Ansel Collins. How I get the name Phase One, I copy it from Channel One – Channel _One_ at those times was having nothing but big hits.'

Phase One rapidly became a label noted for its quality, with the work of the Chantells outstanding. The group styled themselves after the soul acts of Philadelphia and Chicago, with lead singer Samuel Bramwell's soaring falsetto backed by responsive harmonies from Tommy Thomas and Lloyd Forrest, but much of their repertoire dealt with Rastafarian retribution, as is evident from the titles named above, which Francis says initially failed to hit. 'They wasn't being successful,' he recalls. 'I left Gurr in Jamaica to be doing the business and I went back in the States. The first four recordings sold maybe a thousand, two thousand, and that was like a drop in the bucket – I barely make back my money. Those days you could sell thirty to forty thousand records in Jamaica as a hit song, because then you didn't have much cassette player, no CDs, so eveiybody have a little turntable in their house. It's not like now, when a hit song in Jamaica is maybe two thousand.'

It was the Chantells' 'Waiting In The Park' that established the group and the Phase One label in 1978. 'That's when me and Gurr break off and I said I'm going to do this on my own,' Francis explains. 'We went to Joe Gibbs' and did two songs, "Waiting In The Park" and "Man In Love", and "Waiting In The Park" was a huge success. The group was really big in England. I fly to London and stay at my sister's house in Walthamstow, and Pama [back in business since 1977 as the Jet Star Phonographic distribution company] used to send a taxi to my house to buy those records. Then I was spending so much time in Jamaica I get fired from my job, but the job was only paying me like five hundred a week, and I could make that in a hour, so I didn't mind losing my job – the only thing I miss is my flying benefits. I decide I'm going to be a producer full time, and I start recording all kind of tracks by Keith Boswell and Lopez Walker. I was at Channel One doing sessions and saw [Walker] standing outside – he say he want to do something for me, start sing a song by the name of "Jah Jah New Garden". I take him right in the studio and record the rhythm, voice him a week after and put it out. He was a baldhead and then he turn Rasta, start to come to me with some story, so I didn't bother with him no more.'

'Jah Jah New Garden', cut in the vibrant, danceable style known as 'steppers', was a vision of Rastafarian Utopia. Francis also used the rhythm for a fine deejay cut by a baldhead known as Jah Berry, another artist from his growing stable of unknowns. 'I met him at Joe Gibbs' when we do "WTaiting In The Park", says Francis. 'He's a guy who come from somewhere down Maxfield Avenue. I had other artists like the Terrors, Leroy King [who] did a song named "Mash Down Babylon", the Untouchables [with] "Sea Of Love" [a cover of the Twillights' Cajun pop song, previously cut in reggae by the Heptones], and I dig out some of the wickedest rhythm I had [for] _Phase One Dubwise.'_

Though Francis allowed a second dub album and some singles to be issued by an associate in the UK, he essentially kept Phase One as an independent label, resisting offers from established reggae companies which wanted to license his material. 'When I come to London,' he proudly recalls, 'Greensleeves and Trojan, all these guys looking for me.' Unfortunately, the untimely demise of the Chantells led Francis to leave the music business for a considerable time. 'Some company in England wanted them on a tour, singing some little clubs like Palm Beach. I don't know who give them some weed, but the three of them went to jail. After they got bail, they had to stay in the country until they went on trial. Two of them got away and one of them do time. Because they were my main group and I was feeling so goddam disgusted over what happened, my whole vibes cut: I decide I'm not going to mess around with this damn recording no more. I went to America, working for this firm that build aeroplane parts. I left my tapes in a friend's basement with my records, and the guy's basement flood out.'

Another entirely independent label issuing quality roots was JA Man, a West Kingston outfit formed by Dudley 'Manzie' Swaby and Leroy Hollett. 'The record thing started about '73-'74,' says the dreadlocked Manzie at Capo studio in Flatbush, 'but I really influenced from youth days. The school that we used to go to was right behind Studio One, so I used to go inna the studio before Mr Dodd come run we out. Don Drummond's mother used to live inna the same yard 'pon Love Lane with my grandmother, so more time him used to come round with him horn. '73, me live round a Craig Town, and Junior Byles used to live up the road, right near to gully bank, so more time we used to [go] down there and smoke herb, play a little guitar, until we just say, "Cho, let's go do two tune." Blacka Morwell a the first man that carry me down at Randy's , through him used to know the runnings. The first tune that me do was "See The Dread There" with Rupert Reid – he used to there inna the yard with me. The next tune was a version of "Drum Song" with Bobby Ellis. We do four tune, but me just give Morwell two: "Bit By Bit", and [I] don't remember the next one. Jah Whoosh used to deejay 'pon one sound over Jones Town, so Jah Whoosh did a tune named "Free Up Me Ganja" and me get a fight fi that tune because of the lyrics: "Babylon sell it, the lawyer love it, the doctor recommend it", all long before Peter Tosh do fi him tune ["Legalize It"]. "Take A Set", that was the biggest seller that come out of that session.'

In late 1975 the JA Man base of operations moved from Manzie's Love Lane home to 129 Orange Street, site of the House of Music record shop. By then, the outfit had already recorded 'Remember Me' with Junior Byles, the first of a handful of prime singles cut before the singer succumbed to mental illness. 'Then me no do no more tune a Randy's again,' Manzie recalls. 'Me gone a Channel One and do over "Movie Star" with Hortense Ellis as "Super Star", and do "Remember Me" and "Chant Down Babylon" with Junior Byles. When Junior start get kinky is really the tune named "Pitchy Patchy" – that's a little after him do "Fade Away" [an outstanding ode to Rastafari cut for Channel One].'

One of the label's finest singles is Dave Robinson's 'My Homeland', given an optimistic backing by the Revolutionaries. 'Dave Robinson and D. Brown used to live in a big yard together, so all the while me a say, "D. Brown, let me do two tune". It's really him who say, "Do two tune with Dave."'

After cutting further works with various singers and deejays, JA Man issued an untitled dub album in 1977. Dudley Swaby subsequently set up the Manzie label on Slipe Road in 1978, leaving the House of Music to became the Roots and Roots Shoe House, a new base of operations for Doctor Alimantado.

One of the most commercially successful local releases of 1977-8 was _Soul Reggae,_ the debut album by Beres Hammond, then lead singer with Zap Pow. _Soul Reggae_ was the first hit album to surface from Aquarius studio, but the disc was never issued overseas; ironically, it was the esoteric Zap Pow which had the benefit of a contract with Island. Hammond is at present one of the most in-demand of reggae singers, and his sensitive musical arrangements have also earned him widespread respect as a producer. In the isolated environs of Stony Hill, Beres leaves a session at his Sileckshan studio to make sure his guest is comfortable in the shade; after offering some freshly cut sugar cane, he relates the details of his long and varied career.

**Beres Hammond [David Katz]**

'I was born in a little community they call Annotto Bay. My father was a councillor for the area, a politician [for] the JLP. Those days politics was much better in Jamaica – they never used to have these guns. My mother, I never knew her as anything else but a person being around the house, taking care of all of us, because she had ten children. From [when] I was about nine, I used to come to Kingston on the weekends. I had sisters here, scattered all over, so I used to just go between all of them. Then I took the opportunity to go downtown and see the different record stores and studios. The voice that I really used to like was Alton Ellis and Ken Boothe – I thought they were exceptional. The Heptones, Melodians, I used to love their harmonies. On the radio stations here we were flooded with foreign music: the Beatles, Engelbert Humperdinck and Gilbert O'Sullivan, and I used to try to imitate them. Marvin Gaye, he stood out in my mind. Stevie Wonder, I thought he was brilliant. My American inspiration was shared too between Sam Cooke and Otis Redding. I used them to test out how well I could sing.'

Beres moved to Kingston full-time 'in my last year in primary school. I was doing the same juggling between the sisters, because then the dollars was very few.' His singing career began in the capital city: 'I did one recording when I was about eleven or twelve with Clancy Eccles ["Wanderer"], because Clancy was a friend of the family, but it was never released until a few years ago. One day when I was passing on Eastwood Park Road, an audition was taking place: Merritone, he was running a amateur talent series, and my brethren forced me to write my name down. I did four ballads and he asked me if I know any reggae, and at the time Delroy Wilson had "Rain From The Skies". I did that one and he said, "Yeah, everything all right." Wednesday night, the crowd was with me – this was VIP, a club in Half Way Tree. The response was overwhelming.'

About two years later, in 1975, Beres Hammond was drawn into Zap Pow. 'I was performing as a solo person, still doing amateur shows, and then there was Cynthia Schloss. We teamed up as a duet, went right up to Jamaica House quite often. I was also a member of a group called Tuesday's Children" One night, when the group got a gig in one of the hotels, Zap Pow was the backing band. After the show Dwight checked me and said, "Youth, you can sing. Come join we." '

Beres' rich timbre and expressive delivery brought Zap Pow a new scope, freeing its members to concentrate on their instruments and injecting an essence of soul into the group's intriguing combination of roots reggae and jazz. His talents helped the band score an album contract with Island in 1978, but he left the group the following year after experiencing greater success with his solo Aquarius disc. 'I wanted to get a feel of what outside of Jamaica was, so Zap Pow provided that. We went up to US and Canada, so I was with them from '75 until '79. Chris Blackwell signed us, but I thought if we got signed we'd be on billboards. I thought we would have been in Australia and New Zealand, Malaysia, but that didn't work out. So that's when I thought to myself that I should be doing something else, so I started working with [guitarist and arranger] Willie Lindo. Zap Pow was some political motivated kind of music – Zap Pow would just tell it like it is, different issues from my love thing. I had some songs that was burning up inside me, which was more a line between people – a family type of thing.

'When my album came out, it took less than a month for it to blow out all over the place. I released a single, "One Step Ahead" – it went like a bolt to number one, stayed there for three and a half months, stayed on the chart itself for maybe two years. We figured we would work with Aquarius because Herman Chin-Loy was always down our necks, plus he had a big studio there, not doing anything, because there was no hit songs coming from there – it was kind of a big graveyard, so working by Aquarius we would be undisturbed.'

'When I was in the studio, I didn't even want a person to come in and peek or walk through the door,' confirms Herman Chin-Loy. 'It breaks your concentration.' Herman also recalls that his studio was often used for radio advertising. 'A lot of commercials was done there by Boris Gardiner and Peter Ashbourne. Fabulous Five had a thing with my brother going on there.' He agrees that the studio lacked a roots sound, but says this was not his intention. 'I always wanted a roots sound – it's just that the studio was not capable. It had a better quality in terms of the top end, like for voicing, but for the bass and drum, which I really needed – because bass and drum is reggae to me – it didn't have it, no doubt about that. That's the reason I went down to Channel One and did some bass and drum, and came back to my studio and finished [it].'

Though Aquarius may not have achieved the ghetto bass-and-drum sound, as the only twenty-four-track studio on the island it was the perfect setting for the complex, big-band brass arrangements of Cedric Brooks' _United Africa._ Brooks' multi-layered score brought instrumental reggae to another level in 1978. Likewise, Rico's great _Man From Wareika_ album, recorded at Joe Gibbs', Randy's and Island's Hammersmith studio under Karl Pitterson's direction, was such a well-constructed set of reggae jazz that the esteemed Blue Note label licensed it from Island in 1977.

'I would say that was the first album I was able to perform to the best of my ability,' says Rico happily. '[Pitterson] got the best musicians to do this album. In Jamaica, we had Robbie and Sly and Ansel Collins. The first things that came to me were the things that I family used to play in Wareika Hills, with Count Ossie and Don Drummond. I'd say that was my first album with a lot of jazz in it, and creative elements. If you notice, I don't solo a lot – I put more melodies into the thing than solos.' One of the album's outstanding tracks was 'Africa', cut with session players in London. Its rhythm was also used by Ijahman Levi for a song on his acclaimed Island debut, _Haile I Hymn._

Blue Note was then a subsidiary of United Artists, who made further tenuous dips into the reggae market with material acquired from secondary sources. First, the company took over the catalogue of Tropical Sound Tracks after that label went bust. The result was the haphazard 'Anthology _Of_ Reggae' series, issued in 1978; these ranged from the concept albums co-produced by Clive Hunt and Geoffrey Chung to older Studio One compilations. The Magnum label, which issued reggae in the UK from 1977, was connected to Pye (though initially aligned with Philips); in 1978 it was relaunched as Ballistic, another subsidiary of United Artists. The material on Magnum and Ballistic was licensed by Mo Claridge, who had broken away from Creole records (established as a branch of EMI in 1971) to form the Mojo distribution company. To start with, Claridge issued singles by artists such as the Meditations on an independent label called Bam Bam; concurrent with Ballistic, he also issued roots material on Warrior.

**Roy Cousins in London [Dave Hendley]**

The first group behind which Claridge put significant promotion was the Royals, with a compilation album called _Pick Up The Pieces;_ according to Roy Cousins, Claridge acquired this material from Militant Barry, a deejay who worked with Keith Hudson and ran the Kiss record label in London, but Barry himself had received the material from a secondary source. As Cousins explains, 'When I was living at Grass Quit Glade [in Cockburn Pen], this guy David Mohammed's grandfather was the owner of the yard. He came up to England and become my link – I send the tape to him, and him took the tape to Militant Barry, and Barry take the album to Mojo.' After Cousins presented himself in England, Claridge cut out the middlemen and further material was licensed directly. 'When I come it was Pye who had _[Pick Up The Pieces];_ I went back to Jamaica and send up _Ten Years After._ I was closely associated with [South London sound system operator] Lloyd Coxsone, so Coxsone get a whole lot of dubs from _Ten Years After,_ play it all round London. John Telford was Mojo's publisher, so through Telford he set up a deal with United Artists. They send a first-class ticket and I bring up _Israel Be Wise._ United Artists take _Freedom Fighters Dub, Liberation Dub;_ them take over _Ten Years After and. Pick Up The Pieces'_

'Conscious Man', a radio-friendly song of romantic conduct recorded at Lee Perry's Black Ark by harmony trio the Jolly Brothers, first surfaced in 1977 on Seven Leaves, a label founded by Jamaican expatriate Tony Owens; Mo Claridge quickly licensed the song from Owens and issued it on Magnum. When re-released on Ballistic in 1978 it turned out to be the label's biggest success, skirting the lower regions of the UK pop charts and hitting further in Europe when issued on an extended 'disco mix' EP by United Artists the following year. Unfortunately, the anticipated Jolly Brothers album did not live up to expectations. After Roy Cousins introduced Claridge to the group, the uneven _Consciousness_ was recorded with Prince Jammy; further Black Ark material cut for Tony Owens, which retained a similar feel to the hit single, was kept unissued for many years following protracted disputes with Ballistic.

At the Black Ark, Lee Perry was inches away from toppling into an abyss: though the popularity of _Police And Thieves_ was matched by that of the psychedelic soul of George Faith's _To Be A Lover,_ by the end of 1978 Scratch and Island were in conflict over Blackwell's refusal to issue _Heart Of The Congos,_ the stunning debut album by spiritual harmony group the Congos. Island also failed to issue two of Perry's most adventurous self-produced albums, an experimental set by two Congolese singers and a pop-reggae album by Candy McKenzie, plus early work by deejay Mikey Dread and singer Earl Sixteen. After succumbing to various financial and personal pressures Perry decided to concentrate on an individual spiritual quest, and by early 1979 had shut the doors of his studio.

The Congos' lead vocalist, Cedric Myton, was also involved in Prince Lincoln Thompson's Royal Rasses, another group that scored a contract with Ballistic through connections with Roy Cousins. Thompson and Myton first sang together in the Tartans with Devon Russell and Lindburgh 'Preps' Lewis. The group scored big with the rock steady hit 'Dance All Night' for Federal, moved on to work for Caltone and Treasure Isle, and cut some self-produced numbers at Studio One before pursuing solo careers. By 1975 Thompson had formed the Royal Rasses, with harmony provided by Keith Peterkin and Clinton Hall, ghetto toughs known as 'Cap' and 'Johnny Kool'; Jennifer Lara also occasionally contributed. The group's piercing harmony, led by Thompson's anguished voice, caused interest in British reggae circles when singles such as the uplifting 'Love The Way It Should Be' and haunting 'Kingston 11' were issued in small quantity by London sound system operator Neville King.

**Prince Lincoln [Dave Hendley]**

As is alluded to on 'Kingston 11', which speaks of the harsh reality of the ghettos that make up West Kingston, Roy Cousins recalls that such sweet harmony was fostered in conditions of extreme hardship, where toughness becomes essential to survival. 'Prince Lincoln was a member of the Pigeon gang, like Devon Russell. Cedric was a saint out of the four of them. Prince pass his scholarship and went to Excelsior School, which is a top school in Jamaica, but because him always have him knife, he was expelled. Him mother kick him out of the house, so Prince Lincoln was living down Hunts Bay Road in a likkle board shack, planting greens for a living, never wear shirt nor shoes – when I take Mojo down there, him never have on a shirt. Prince did have the _Humanity_ album them time, produced by Errol Thompson, Marcia Griffiths' baby father, a deejay at JBC

Given major promotion, _Humanity_ was a sweeping success. As with the Royals' material, Brixton-based sound system Coxsone Outernational stoked up interest among the black population, whilst quality album packaging and a major 1979 European tour won progressive student fans. Unfortunately, subsequent albums aimed at the crossover market failed to reach either audience, signalling the demise of Ballistic in the early 1980s.

In an effort to match the super-stardom of Bob Marley, the major overseas promotion of singers and vocal groups such as Prince Lincoln, the Gladiators, the Mighty Diamonds, Culture and Dennis Brown brought the reggae message to increasingly wider audiences. Concurrently, though typically less polished, the hottest deejays of the period were also playing a crucial role in the international acceptance of Jamaican music.

**Watering the garden: Tappa Zukie [Dave Hendley]**
**CHAPTER TEN**

Oh Lord: Deejays and the International Pinnacle of Roots

_Trench Town, that's where Jah pick me and put me, so that's why when I sign up with Virgin I build a community centre and that Golden Age home, to give back to the people and show my appreciation to them... a lot of things could have happened to me, but God take care of my reward._

Tappa Zukie

_I become like a overnight hero... because reggae was not regarded as no substantial or enlightening art form._

Mikey Dread

IN THE LATE 1970s the deejay retained a crucial role in the international dissemination of reggae music. As the roots style continued to make an indelible impact overseas, deejays were accorded a particularly high status in Britain, where major labels helped the form to reach strong levels of popularity.

It was Virgin that ultimately had the greatest success with deejays, but by the time they tried to get their hands on Doctor Alimantado the toaster had largely reinvented himself as a singer. In late 1976 Alimantado gave a dynamic performance to a packed crowd at Kingston's Ward Theatre; he was set to repeat the event at the Carib on Boxing Day when disaster came in the form of a speeding bus, which nearly killed the toaster in a downtown Kingston street. Alimantado recalls the circumstances with a visible shudder: 'It was a very traumatic time in my life, when many people start to realize that what I was saying all these years is something that mean a lot to the world, so everybody seems to be zooming in on me, trying to take a bit. I was supposed to do a rehearsal for my first show at the Carib, and my friend invite me to the sea that morning and I went in the water and nearly drowned. I took in a lot of water - someone had to stand on my stomach and pump it out. I leave the sea, and I was going from here to the road there and the bus hit me down. I believe it wasn't an accident. Because my dread was flying at the time, I believe that's why the guy just swing around and hit me. The bus run me over and some people have to be shouting, go in front of the bus and stop the bus. In the hospital, a few things happen to me like food poisoning. My recuperation stage was very, very traumatic'

Fortunately, these traumas would bear wonderful fruit in the form of Tado's biggest hit, the life-affirming 'Born For A Purpose', which he sang, and its attendant toast, 'Life All Over'. 'When I came out of the hospital, I was lying on my bed at home and an idea came to me. I started to sing it and I needed to get a paper and pen to write it down, but I wasn't able to move and there was nobody else in the house. I pull myself off the bed, which was very painful, and get on my knees – you don't know the beauty of your foot until you'r e in that stage. It took me nearly half an hour to get a pen and paper, and I didn't knowT how to write music, but I tried to write it so that I know to how fall into a rhythm pattern so I could get the remembrance of it. When I was able to walk on crutches, I went to the studio and said to the musicians, "I'v e got this song to do and I haven't got any money." They say, "Cho, come man, no worry." Joseph Hoo-Kim said, "You working in the studio all the while. Just come." Really and truly, I didn't pay any money to get that song recorded – the musicians and the studio was free.

'When the song was recorded, Mighty Diamonds and everybody was going crazy over it. I went to Channel One and said, "I can't put it out now. Would you put it out for me?" I told them the song named "Reason For Living" but Joe Joe said, "No, this tune should name 'Born For A Purpose' ", so that's how it was originally on his label. Later on I put it on my label when I was able to move around.' The record's fame spread far and wide, finding a champion abroad in Johnny Rotten, who voiced approval of the song's defiant stance on London radio. Its success would result in Alimantado emigrating to Britain.

After he had recovered from his accident Doctor Alimantado gave his most notable performance to a capacity audience at the National Arena – a definite high point in his live career. 'Most people remember that perfonuance until this day,' he states proudly. He came to London in the latter half of 1977 with the intention of setting up a UK branch of his label; however, discussions with Island proved mutually unsatisfactory, and though Virgin licensed the sung twelve-inch 'Find The One' they were unable to establish a long-term agreement with Tado. 'When I came to England first, it was to set up a company, and [reggae retailers] Dub Vendor and Daddy Kool was supposed to be the managers, but in negotiations it break down. We had to go our separate ways, with me owing them some plane fare and a bit of money. At the time there were companies like Virgin willing to put half a million pounds on Doctor Alimantado, but Greensleeves offered to help me set up my own company, which was more important to me. Greensleeves' offer wasn't financially viable, but it offered me the best in a stable company.' Alimantado's _Best Dressed Chicken In Town_ became the company's inaugural album release in 1978.

After U Roy and I Roy, one of Virgin's most prominent deejays was Tappa Zukie, though his relationship with the company was turbulent and much of his best material was issued elsewhere. At Mixing Lab, Tappa is swaying on his feet, the sweat on his brow seemingly caused by rum rather than the afternoon heat. In West Kingston, where he was born David Sinclair in 1955, he endured a rough upbringing. 'I grew up in between Greenwich Town and Trench Town, the hardcore town. Most people know me as the "cork and tar": a cork and tar is a ball that you beat 'til it becomes likkle. It is so tough that when it hit you, it's like a bomb. The leather ball, if you'r e beating it, it bust wide open, but a cork and tar it never bust, and the smaller it get is the hotter it make. My parents, pressure reach them, and they didn't even have time to think about wre, so I have to go 'pon the road from [when] I was twelve. When I run away from home the people of Trench Town take to me, they say, "When your mother and your father forsake you, the lord God Jah will pick you up."'

It was in these youthful days that Tappa started deejaying on the I-Oses and Maccabees sets, prefiguring the later fame of youngsters like Little John and Beenie Man. 'I was the dancehall crave, the young thing that was happening in the dancehall. I was the first little-boy deejay, and I used to hear people saying I greater than U Roy, Big Youth and Dennis Alcapone.' Along with this early fame came wildness. 'I used to play sound and everybody rate me, and they say that I was a hyped youth. People say crazy things and I'l l do crazy things, so Bunny Lee, my brother and my mother decide to send me away to England to escape these crazy things I do. I was sixteen or seventeen years old.'

The move brought Tappa even greater exposure. 'I had never recorded, never appeared on a show before, and Bunny Lee introduced me on this show U Roy had at Woodlands Hall in Ladbroke Grove [London]. They played the rhythm for Slim Smith's "The Time Has Come" and I toast over it. At the time, everybody had me as a warrior. People was scared of me – for what, I don't know! I'm just a guy who stand up for my rights and don't let nobody push me around, so I figured the man is a warrior, so that's when I made that album _Man A Warrior.'_ The album, produced by Clement Bushay around 1973 and issued in 1975 by Klik records, caused quite a stir overseas. American new wave singer Patti Smith professed her admiration of it, and later brought the disc greater acclaim by facilitating a significant reissue.

Though Tappa's voice was still unbroken when the album was cut, he sounds surprisingly confident on most of it. On the title track, he translates the hardships of his street existence into a calmly charged defiance. Other tracks seem rather juvenile, particularly the comic-sounding 'Archie The Red Nosed Reindeer', a barb apparently aimed at one of the neighbourhood toughs. 'Archie was one of my friends,' Tappa explains. 'He used to live in White Street. Those guys was the big guys on the corner, but I was a shooter. I was a hit-man, so I was just troubling him, because Archie was a bad guy.'

When Tappa returned to Jamaica towards the end of 1974 he was chiefly employed as muscle. 'I was actually a bodyguard for Bunny Lee,' he confirms, 'and I enforce artists to work and record for him. Bunny Lee is like a father to me – me and my brother Blackbeard used to go to the studio with him.' Lee was at first reluctant to record the young man, so Tappa cut the strong 'Judge I Oh Lord' for his associate, Lloydie Slim. He then began voicing the odd tune for Lee, but during an altercation over the foreign issue of 'Natty Dread Girl Don't Cry' Tappa used threatening behaviour towards his boss; however, the pair quickly patched up their quarrel and Lee gave the toaster cuts of a number of his hit rhythms. These backing tracks and others obtained from Channel One gave Tappa the platfonii for further material, with driving rockers-style beats allowing for a more zestful and energetic performance.

Tappa then founded the Stars label, moving into the producer's chair with ease. In addition to producing his own vocal and dub material, he recorded exceptional work with Greenwich Farm vocalists such as Junior Ross and the Spears (notably 'Judgement Time') and Prince Allah ('Bosrah' and 'Heaven Is My Roof). In the summer of 1976 Zukie returned to the UK to license more material to Klik, who hit with the singles 'MPLA' and 'Pick Up The Rockers'. Tappa's dynamic stage shows, in which his vocal skills were matched by limber kung-fu moves, complemented the esteem that the _Man A Warrior_ album had already gained him; Klik quickly arranged to issue the popular _MPLA_ album. 'A lot of things could have happened to me, but God take care of my reward,' Tappa insists. 'I was rewarded when I came to England and the people nominate me to be a star, though I came to England to promote Junior Ross and Prince Allah.'

Virgin enjoyed great success with _MPLA after_ picking it up from Klik. As Tappa's star continued to rise, a Virgin contract for the _Peace In Tlie Ghetto_ album enabled him to offer tangible assistance to the underprivileged Trench Town community that had given him support when he most needed it. 'Trench Town, that's where Jah pick me and put me, so that's why when I sign up with Virgin I build a community centre and that Golden Age home, to give back to the people and show my appreciation to them.'

The subsequent _Tappa Roots_ album included Tappa's suggestive 'She Want A Phensic', one of the biggest reggae hits in England in 1978, but he then withdrew his allegiance from Virgin for political reasons. 'Virgin write me up as a Mafioso because I demands back my contract from them. No disrespect intended, but I heard at the time they was selling a lot of records in South Africa, but those monies wasn't coming back to England. Some people tell me they was investing in guns to use against my people in South Africa, so I confront Mr Branson, say, "I'm a black man and I don't support such things." He said, "Tappa Zukie, I'm surprised at you. What are you talking about?" I said, "That's the argument on the street, so I don't want to be a part of this", and that's how me and Virgin mash up. At the time U Roy was going for them in Africa, and Culture and I was going for Virgin in England. I had "Phensic", so I was happening for them. From there, no big company would deal with me, because I'm the cork and tar. That's how I decide to come back to Jamaica and establish my own thing.'

Released around the same time as 'Phensic' was the harder 'Living In The Ghetto', a first-hand account of life on the street that could only have come from someone who had spent the majority of their days in such surroundings. ' "Living In The Ghetto" is after me decide to make the community centre,' Tappa recalls, 'so it's like exposing the lifestyle. I was living deep in the ghetto then.'

**Voice of Thunder: Prince Fari [Beth Lesser]**

More hits followed, including the boastful 'Oh Lord', which swept the island more than any previous hit Zukie had done. His duet with Horace Andy on a recut of the Soul Syndicate's 'Natty Dread A Whe She Want' was initially destined for Virgin, but drew a strong response on both sides of the Atlantic when issued independently by Tappa; Jet Star's distribution of the extended twelve-inch was particularly successful in the UK. Like 'Living In The Ghetto', the half-sung 'Raggy Joey Boy' was another poignant description of ghetto life, but Tappa avoided the trend set by older deejays and never made the full shift from toaster to singer. 'That's when I get raggy there,' he says. 'That's when everybody say that Tappa Zukie was a terrorist, but I was just tired of seeing people taking advantage of poor people, so I have to stand up to defend them. You notice that _[Raggy Joey Boy]_ is the only album with a little singing on [it], because the way I take it with music is from one extreme to the other. I don't see myself just like a dancehall artist, I just see myself as a musician, so I'l l make jazz, funk, reggae, anything – the frame of mind and the vibes to really hit me at that moment.'

Of all the deejays signed to Virgin's Front Line, Prince Fari is perhaps the most legendary. 'What I really love about Prince Fari,' says Joseph Hill, 'is that he project the music as a source of spiritual strength. I love the way he handles the good lyrics that he got.' Fari was a gruff toaster who had a long prison record. The self-styled 'Voice of Thunder' hailed from Spanish Town and was originally known as King Cry Cry until producer Enos McLeod renamed him. His recording debut came at Studio One, where he had previously been employed as security; his smooth yet charged delivery on 'Natty Farmyard' gave a hint of things to come. Fari's first album, _Psalms For I,_ was a stunning religious concept disc cut for Lloydie Slim around 1975; the following year _Under Heavy Manners_ made good use of hit rhythms from Joe Gibbs, but it was the _Message From The King_ and _Long Life_ albums on Virgin's Front Line that brought him to a wider overseas audience in 1978.

U Brown also had two albums issued by Virgin Front Line, the excellent _Mr Brown Something_ and _Can't Keep A Good Man Down._ Hugh Brown became U Brown on the sound system circuit because he patterned his style after U Roy, whom he regularly heard when he was growing up. 'I usually live at 35 Bond Street and Duke Reid was next door,' the tall, bald toaster reveals, 'and in life, each one teach one.' Brown is waiting to take the mike at Leggo studio, about eight blocks from the spot where he first encountered U Roy; the cosy facility is one currently favoured by veterans and conscious Rasta youth.

'I started first with a sound named Silver Bullet from Tower Hill – Olympic Gardens,' he continues. 'I mess around with that sound for over a year, and then a friend was keeping a dance with another sound system named Sounds of Music, based in Waterhouse. I mess around with him about another fifteen months. I get my real big break when U Roy met with a motorbike accident, fracture his leg. I Roy wasn't around much to fill in, 'cause he was travelling very often then, so there was a dance keeping in Sunrise Crescent, and Dillinger was the one that they requested to deejay. A guy that work with Tubby's sound recommend me to Tubbys, and on the night Tubbys say he really want me round the sound. Each night I go, it's always more inspiration. Tubby's was the number one sound in the world that time, play everywhere in Jamaica – from Negril Point to Portland.'

U Brown's fame on King Tubby's sound led to his debut recording in 1975, produced by Joe Gibbs' cousin, then a law student in London. 'I first went into the studio with Winston Edwards and the first two songs were "Jamaican Tobacco" and "Wet Up Your Pants Foot" – 1 record those at Tubbys. My next was for Yabby You, "Wolf In Sheep Clothing" [aka "Dem A Wolf']. Yabby You sing a song on it named "Anti Christ". At that time, Tubby's was _the_ studio. Although it wasn't a studio where you lay rhythm tracks, most man always come at Tubby's to get a mix, because Tubby's have the spice. Yabby come there, Niney come there, Bunny Lee come like him a the resident man there.'

**U Brown at Leggo Studio [David Katz]**

After his time on Tubby's sound U Brown had a number _of_ other significant residencies, most notably on King Attorney, the sound system owned by PNP 'enforcer' Tony Welch and later known as Socialist Roots." When that sound encountered problems, U Browrn found himself on the mike at Jack Ruby's Hi Power in Ocho Rios. 'Jack Ruby take me from Kingston when politics was getting hot,' he says gravely, 'because one time Socialist Roots did have to stop play – too much pressure from the people and the police, and in those days police don't respect entertainer.' Ruby then had a supremely powerful sound system that had island-wide appeal.

It was through Striker Lee that U Brown started cutting self-produced material on the Hit Sound label around 1977. 'Bunny Lee is like another Coxsone,' he emphasizes. 'When you round Bunny Lee, you must learn something 'bout the business. Bunny Lee give me the first rhythm, a version of a Barry Brown song. That's where I started my first production, "Badness A Madness" – I gave it to Federal to distribute.' His biggest hit was 'Weather Balloon', a flight _of fancy_ narrated with much gusto at a session supervised by engineer Crucial Bunny at Channel One. 'I met a girl, June, and even now she's still my wife,' he quips happily, speaking of the song's obscure inspiration. 'Lyrically, things just build, and you go in the studio and try a thing.' Another high point for U Brown was his toast on the extended mix of Linval Thompson's 'Train To Zion', cut in 1977 for Socialist Roots.

At this point, Linval Thompson was reaching full stride as a vocalist and producer of his own material. Thompson says that, as a teenager in the early 1970s, he drew inspiration from the styles of Al Campbell, Dennis Brown and Johnny Clarke. 'I was born in Kingston in 1954, grew up in the Three Mile area,' he recalls. 'Mother and Father had their own business, like grocery stores. I was singing at school when Jacob Miller started recording for Coxsone, and I wasn't recording, but I was trying to, just like Johnny Clarke. We was living in the same area, Kingston 13.'

In the early seventies Thompson's parents emigrated to Brooklyn, where they took domestic work. Linval joined them and subsequently settled in Queens, where he remained for roughly two years; in order to further his singing career, he often mingled with expatriate musicians. 'Buccaneers was one of the first reggae band in New York,' he recalls. 'Bunny Ruggs was there, before he turned Third World, and Rick Frater. Me never perform with them, but I think I was trying to. Horace Andy used to come around that time also.'

Though progress was slow in terms of live performance, Thompson was able to make his debut recording within a year of arriving in America. 'I went to a studio in Brooklyn named Art Craft with Patrick Alley, a singer [that] sound like John Holt's style. I spend the money and do "There's No Other Woman In This World". I come back to Jamaica maybe '74, and the first thing I do is for "Stamma", K.Hobson – I know him from Orange Street area. He hear the first song that I recorded and he liked that sound, near like how Dennis Brown sound, so we do an original song named "Westbound Plane". I voice [it] on a rhythm track at Randy's studio. Then I do two songs for Phil Pratt ["Jah Jah Redder Than Red" and "Girl You'v e Got To Run"]. He hear the sound and everybody say that this new artist comes around, has that Dennis Brown sound. I do two for Scratch too, "Kung Fu Man," and the other one I can't remember.' Another number called 'Kung Fu', again celebrating martial arts, was cut the same year in Jamaica for Kass Harris, 'a guy that have a record shop'.

**Linval Thompson [David Katz]**

These early efforts formed stepping stones to success, which Linval achieved by 1975 when he teamed up with Bunny Lee. 'They create a little buzz,' he explains. 'That make Bunny Lee get interested in me and that's where the hit come – hit after hit.' His first recording for Striker was the highly popular 'Don't You Cut Off Your Dreadlocks', written despite the fact that Thompson sometimes trimmed and combed his hair. After the release of the _Don't Cut Off Your Dreadlocks_ album Thompson gradually took charge of his own creations, a process he describes as largely intuitive. 'I never plan it,' he modestly insists. 'It just happened. A guy will come and say he want me to do some songs. I say, "All right, I'l l sing some for you and I'l l sing some for myself, so I can get a cut of the rhythm tracks." That's the way I start, exchanging. The first song what I do name "I Love. Marijuana", I use Family Man on bass at Randy's . Socialist Roots hear the sound. I was the youngest artist in Jamaica on my own, so they ask if I could sing a song for them, play this instrumental track in the dance [a recut of the Studio One classic "Death In The Arena", aka "Whipping The Prince"] and I listen to it, never write no song, never have no idea, but I say, "Yes, I will voice it." Then we go to Channel One and the lyrics come to me just like that. "Train To Zion" was the biggest hit after "Don't Cut Off Your Dreadlocks" – mash up the whole of Jamaica.'

Not long afterwards, Thompson began licensing albums to a revitalized Trojan in the UK (now controlled by Marcel Rodd of Saga, specialists in low-budget classical LPs) and Clocktower records in New York. 'I do my first album, J _Love Marijuana,_ I do a dub album _[Negrea Love Dub],_ and I do a Big Joe deejay album name _African Princess._ I know him from Three Mile – he was on some likkle sound at that time.' In this period Thompson was also working with singers such as Cornell Campbell and Wayne Jarrett and deejays such as Trinity and Ranking Trevor, in addition to crafting further hits of his own such as 'Six Babylon', a tale of police brutality.

On the other side of Spanish Town Road, a few streets south of the Three Mile home ground of proto-dancehall stars Johnny Clarke, Linval Thompson and Al Campbell, heavier and more deeply religious roots music was being constructed by a core of committed artists in Greenwich Farm. Bertram Brown's Freedom Sounds was a focal point for local singers concerned with truth, rights and justice; the label was based at Brown's home at 14 East Avenue, next to the family's wholesale liquor store. 'I was born right here in 1950,' Brown says in the Freedom Sounds yard, 'right here so me navel string cut. Me father was a cooper, they make barrel to store rum in, and my mother was a housewife, because it's ten pickney and me a the last one. Me grow up round here through '51 storm, all them bad elections, the wars and peace, and me still here with the youth them.'

**Champion of the underdog:**

**Bertram Brown [Bernard Warin]**

Bertram is a short man with a ruddy complexion who seems to be always on the go. Freedom Sounds was reactivated some years ago as a base of operations for veteran Rasta singers based nearby, and Brown is constantly called to the telephone; he has a dour countenance and seldom smiles. His bustling headquarters is a dilapidated concrete shell with records stacked haphazardly against the crumbling walls; the place is in bad need of a lick of paint and some new furniture, yet it retains a homely character and obviously continues to operate on a grass-roots ghetto level.

The Freedom Sounds label was officially inaugurated in 1975, though Brown says he began producing at the start of the 1970s; he says he got involved because local talent creating message music was largely being ignored. 'Me get the inspiration from Prince Allah and Milton Henry,' Brown explains. 'When me come from school, me see them a play them box guitar, and Prince Allah always a chant biblical songs 'bout "Lot's Wife" and "Great Stone", and me no see nobody a record him. The first job me father get for me was in the same barrel place, and we save up our money and go by Randy's , there so me lay me first rhythms: "Thank You Me Lord" and "Judgement Time" wdth Prince Allah, and "Cornbread And Butter" with Milton Henry. Songs like those, me use Soul Syndicate _every_ time. Then we include Philip Fraser, Earl Zero, Rod Taylor, Frankie Jones, Sylvan White. All them likkle man come, we a cook and eat and live together, all of we live right round the place. Bunny Lee lives two doors from me, so me grow up see Slim Smith, Ken Boothe and Cornell Campbell a come through. I remember when Earl Zero sing "None Shall Escape The Judgement", him do it for Bunny Lee and Johnny Clarke sing it over.

'So when I see all them things I say the youth them have talent, and them have the message most of all to really show the people truth and rights, because where there's no truth there can't be a kingdom and a proper government, so it's that we a seek within the music to make the people understand, cause without them understanding we is lost. Freedom Sounds is here, from those days, to give the people good music which portrays love and harmony at all times and discipline within mankind as a whole, show how mankind fi live with one another. I deal with who the people reject, who the people nah listen to. I always have a notion that the stone that the builder refuse always come back to be the headstone.'

Working with Soul Syndicate and cutting dubs at King Tubby's studio, Bertram Brown oversaw some of the heaviest roots music of the period, his artists' indignant lyrics matched by fearsome rhythm tracks and dubs that emphasized the songs' foreboding and menacing qualities. Brown says the area's dominant dancehall had long been a great inspiration. 'Right beside my yard was the biggest dancehall inna Western Kingston, the New Style Lawn. Coxsone usually play there, Duke Reid, Sir George the Atomic. I grow up attending these dances, listening to all these good musics, getting the inspiration and vibes.'

The man called Prince Allah – born Keith Blake – is also known as the Gentle Giant, and the epithet seems entirely appropriate: his hefty frame is almost always crowned by a broad and radiant smile, he is courteous and helpful to everyone and seems governed by a peaceful religiosity. It was in church, in fact, that the quality of Blake's voice was first noted. 'My mother and father used to love go to church, so when I was about seven them carry me to Hope Chapel, Methodist, and I sang "Our Father", and everybody said, "Yes!" After I leave school, I had a friend by the name of Soft [Roy Palmer] and one by the name of Milton [Henry]. They love music and Milton could play the guitar, so we used to sing together. We met Joe Gibbs – in those times he just come from Guantanamo Bay. Him carry we to studio and we did two songs for him, "Hope Someday" and "Fay" as the Leaders.'

**The Freedom Sounds gate [David Katz]**

After recording a handful of other sides for Gibbs, at the start of the 1970s Blake renounced all things worldly to join the followers of Prince Emmanuel Edwards at the 'Bobo Dread' camp in Bull Bay, Saint Thomas. The Bobo branch of Rastafari has come to be associated with fundamentalism, particularly after a dramatic expansion in the 1990s; some of the faithful have suggested that Edwards himself was another manifestation of Selassie. Drumming and chanting have always been central to their worship. 'I went up to the Bobo Camp, was up there about six years just chanting,' Blake recalls. 'So when I leave, I start dealing with record. Up at Emmanuel we used to read about Melchizedek, this High Priest that have no mother or father, no beginning nor no days at the ending of time. So when I leave there and come home on Sea View Avenue, Tappa Zukie, as a likkle youth, he used to run likkle weed, but him with Bunny Lee now, and Bunny Lee decide fi help him out so that he could get a little studio time. We went to the Ark studio. Lee Scratch Perry, he really does the arrangements. The harmony, it's Soft and Tony Brevett of the Melodians.'

The result was the arresting 'Bosrah', a 1976 single credited to Ras Allah and the Spears. 'When I small, I used to love Mohammed Ali, the boxer,' explains Blake, 'so through me love Mohammed Ali so much, everybody just call me Allah. After Tappa Zukie went to England with that tune, we do a LP up at Channel One _[Heaven Is My Roof] with_ "Funeral", "Daniel In The Lion's Den".' 'Funeral', one of the album's outstanding tracks, was a symbolic rejection of society. 'When I was up at the Bobo, we used to read the Bible every day. Him say, "Let the dead bury them dead", so it's just that likkle vibes there. At that time, when I look inna myself, I say it's not just a _physical_ funeral, because even the system round you is like a funeral. So I say I nah gonna follow them system, that mean I'm not going go to them funeral. I wasn't really dealing with just a physical dead, like my father and mother, because if them dead, me a going go to them funeral. I looking at the system: it's like a funeral, just lead to destruction the Same way.'

**Prince Allah [Steve Mosco, courtesy of Jah Warrior records]**

Other strong material was cut for Freedom Sounds, such as 'Lot's Wife' and 'Bucket Bottom', which used a proverb to illustrate Allah's disappointments within the music industry. 'It was just a thing I was going through with some of the promoters,' he explains. 'I say, "Every day them bucket go a well, one day the bottom must drop out. You use me, one day it's going to stop."' Another outstanding track was the 1977 single 'Great Stone', again inspired by Bible readings at the Bobo camp. Bertram Brown says King Tubby greatly shaped this record by adding a custom sound effect to illustrate better Allah's message of a 'great great stone just a come to mash down Rome'.

'King Tubby mixed that, and I think that is one of the wickedest mix we have ever made with that rumbling,' Brown exclaims. 'You hear the stone coming in that song. We get a rumbling sound first from some thunder sound we get out of a movie, get it and stretch it, put it 'pon a two-track [tape]. We usually work with King Tubby because we love King Tubby, he inspire we a lot. The greater portion of work was done by King Tubbys. Scientist did things still, but him was just an assistant, because Jammys used to mix in between. Even before Jammy become a producer, we a work with them man there as the engineer. All of them man there is Tubby's understudy, so King Tubby really do a lot for music business.'

After his return to Jamaica and installation as Tubby's assistant engineer, Jammy rapidly established a reputation as a skilled mixer; he had already inched into the production sphere before moving back to Kingston. 'I produce one record I released in Canada,' he explains. 'That was Nana McLean, a do-over song by the name of "Single Girl". When I came back to Jamaica in 1976, I redid it in a better fashion with the same artist.' Jammy was subsequently instrumental in shaping what would be known as the Waterhouse style, working largely with neighbourhood singers who favoured a particular vocal slurring. 'All of those artists that I used to work with, they grew with us in the Waterhouse area: Black Uhuru, Locksley Castell, the Travellers. I was the young producer coming up in the area. Everybody think about supporting me, and I used to cater for them. We were just experimenting in those days, but some of those songs became legendary.'

The Waterhouse act to become most famous was Black Uhuru, a vocal trio with an ever-shifting line-up. The group was initially formed as Uhuru, the Swahili word for unity, with Garth Dennis as lead singer and Don McCarlos and Derrick 'Duckie' Simpson providing harmony. At home in Los Angeles, Dennis says Uhuru came together when he carried the vibes of Trench Town singing groups to Waterhouse, after the building of the Olympic Gardens housing scheme brought a massive influx of people from Kingston 12.

'I grew up in different parts of Kingston – my dad travelled all around doing carpentry. My sister Joan is the famous Joey from the duet Andy and Joey. She did that early recording "You'r e Wondering Now", and it was a monster hit. When we relocated to Trench Town, that happens to be the same yard that Joe Higgs was living in, and I'm a twin brother-in-law to Joe Higgs: one of his brothers and one of my sister [had] a son, and one of my brothers [and] one of his sisters [had] a son. Myself, Junior Braithwaite and a guy named Ricardo Scott, we had the first little trio around there.

**Garth Dennis [Steve Villegas]**

'After we left Trench Town and moved to Waterhouse, I still used to come back to Trench Town to do rehearsal with Bob and the Wailers, and with Pipe them [that is, the Wailing Souls]. My family come to Waterhouse, that's where I met Duckie and Don Carlos. Since they know I was from Trench Town and they know my sister is a singer, they used to come by my house to attend rehearsal with me. Our home at 14 Balcombe Drive was like a community centre, because my parents used to travel to London from a very early time. We was left alone for a while, so we could invite friends in without being hassled. I decided we needed a trio, 'cause I love groups because of Joe Higgs, and we always listen to the Impressions, the Temptations. Me and my sister left Trench Town and bring the musical vibration a Waterhouse to the youth. Before that, you have Yabby You and them people from up top, but the youth, the vibrancy, Duckie and the whole of them, it's right through we them come.'

Uhuru's recording debut resulted from their incidental discovery. 'In Water-house there was an elder by the name of Brother Junie. He has a place on Henley Road that we used to go and recreate weselves, just jam there during the days. Sometimes he would cook lunch and sell, and these guys from Dynamic Sounds came to have lunch one day: George Philpotts, an engineer, and Paul Fuller, another producer. We sang a couple of songs for them and they liked "Folk Song". I get the idea from Curtis Mayfield, but I put some melody to it and add some words. They arranged a session for us at Dynamics, and Karl Pitterson was there. I already know Karl from a younger days, [because] I had a girlfriend who was a cousin to his girlfriend, and then here he is, this engineer.'

Dennis says this initial recording did not run smoothly. 'After I put my lead voice down... [there] was problem putting the harmony together. Boris Gardiner had a session after us, and our time was running into his time, so he asks us if we wanted [him] to assist, and Boris lend his voice. That's how "Folk Song" was completed. It come out on the Top Cat label, distributed by Dynamics, but this was Karl's project – between Karl, George and Paul Fuller. A couple months after that we did "Time Is On Our Side" [at] Randy's , [for] Clive Chin, but the same thing happened there: the harmony's lacking.'

The third and final single featuring this initial line-up was 'Slow Coach', a song that addressed conflicts in Jamaica and the Middle East. 'That war there with Golda Meir in '66, and the Prime Minister who came to power shortly after that, Michael Manley, those two persons inspire that song a lot.' It was recorded for Andy's , a label established in New York by record shop owner Raymond 'Benno' Anderson. 'He grow up in Waterhouse and migrated to the States from a very early age, come down and hold an audition and choosed that song. We lay the rhythm at Randy's , and when we come to Tubby's to do the vocal it was the same thing with the harmony – couldn't nail it down. Andy went back in New York and put out that song as a single. Instead of putting the group name there, he just used my name. We become... not really inactive, but after those songs I hardly see Duckie.'

Uhuru's inactivity coincided with the reactivation of the Wailing Souls, after original member George 'Buddy' Haye rejoined founders Winston 'Pipe' Matthews and Lloyd 'Bread' MacDonald, who had been singing with Joe Higgs as Atarra the previous year, following the departure of Oswald 'Saboo' Downer and Norman 'Fats' Davis. As Bread notes, 'We did some background work with Jimmy Cliff on a song called "Dear Mother" that Joe Higgs wrote, and he redid [Bob Marley's ] "No Woman No Cry" also. Joe say him have some songs fi record and he need us to do the background vocal, and in return he's going to teach us how to really knit-up the group together. Fats and Saboo, they were much older guys than us, big men with kids to support, and you never make no money from singing. So Fats started working on a ship and Saboo got some kind of deal with the government, wherein they went into the country and start doing some farming. So it was me and Pipe and Buddy along with Joe Higgs. Garth Dennis wasn't a member of that foursome, but he used to always be around and drop inna the harmony sometimes.

**The Wailing Souls [Beth Lesser]**

'Channel One start [to] crack over all the Studio One hits, and Channel One had a track for one of our songs, which is "Back Out", so [Joseph Hoo-Kim] say him would like if Wailing Souls sing 'pon the rhythm as the original guys to sing "Back Out", but 'cause Atarra 'was our own business and we start spend our own money _we_ say, "We nah sing for nobody else, so no bother call we." For about a year he was trying to get us. Eventually he send one of our brethren named Kaiso who live inna the neighbourhood, he was working up there as an all-rounder. Kaiso come and preach and say him figure if him could a get us fi come, it would be like a feather in his cap, so we go up to Channel One, but instead of "Back Out" we did "Things And Time". We build new lyrics, cause from our early days we always say we no like to sing over songs. "Things And Time" was our first official number one inna Jamaica.'

Garth Dennis was then drafted in, giving the group the greater harmonic depth for which they had been noted at Studio One. 'Because we had started singing with Fats and Saboo, when we did "Things And Time" we never feel right,' Bread recalls. 'We said we need a next man, and Garth is the man.'

'Buddy Haye was there in Trench Town, and then he come to live in Waterhouse,' says Dennis. 'He was still in communication with Pipe and Bread, and they went to record "Things And Time". They asked me to work out some harmonies on a couple of songs for them, and the songs that we did became instant hits: "Jah Give Us Life", "Very Well", "Joy Within Your Heart". There was a programme, _Where It's At,_ run by Alphonso Walker at JBC every Saturday, so I start appearing there with Wailing Souls.'

As the Wailing Souls gained top chart positions, Black Uhuru started to solidify. 'By then, a young Michael Rose used to come amongst us in Waterhouse,' notes Garth Dennis. 'Michael had a brother, Joseph Rose, who was a good friend of Sly. Sly wanted to record some songs with Michael Rose, because he's a good singer. Michael find Duckie, and they start going to Channel One to visit Sly. Tunes like "Shine Eyed Gal" and "General Penitentiary" – I used to rehearse all those songs with them while I was with the Wailing Souls.' 'When me start sing with Uhuru, it was me, Duckie and Garth Dennis,' confirms Rose at his Miami home. 'We used to rehearse [at] one schoolyard and at Garth Dennis' yard.' Dennis says that Rose – then often called Tony – was previously active in the Jays, another aspiring neighbourhood vocal trio. 'Ruddy, Errol [Nelson] and Scuner, the brother of King Tubbys, that was the Jays. Scuner left for the States, so Ruddy and Errol continue singing, and they use Michael Rose. I saw them on _Wliere It's At,_ and I saw them doing a couple of shows as well. That was before he joins Black Uhuru as the lead singer.'

Rose states that the first Black Uhuru recordings with himself, Duckie Simpson and Errol Nelson yielded the powerful 'Wood For My Fire' and 'Rent Man', both portraying the hardships of ghetto life. 'A Dennis Brown we did record it for,' Rose notes, 'but ["Rent Man"] end up on Joe Gibbs for some reason.' Before joining Black Uhuru Rose cut a number of strong singles as a solo artist, making him a natural choice for group leader; he says his brothers and Sly Dunbar played an important part in his musical development. 'I grow up a Waterhouse. My father used to work at a chocolate factory, then he work at a glass company, make all kind of different glass and drinks bottles. My brother Joseph used to sing around the house – that's how I get enthusiastic about singing. The other one, Rap Rose, used to do harmony. Joseph used to work at the Ministry of Works, and when holiday time come they used to sing [at] company [functions]. So they recorded "We Three Kings", that Christmas carol, at a little studio in Waterhouse named SRS - it's Newton Simmons' studio, a little two-track thing. Newton used to work at the airport, maybe inna the lookout tower. Sly was the one who recorded the track - Sly knew my brother very good.'

Rose made his recording debut for the same outfit as a deejay, toasting on a song by Andell Forgie, a founding staff member _of Reggae Swing_ magazine. 'We used to fool around [with] a sound system named Sammy's , sing 'pon the mike and deejay. Them come up with a tune named "Woman A Ginal Fi True" and asked me [to] just do something on it.'

About 1975 Michael cut more notable work with Niney the Observer and Soul Syndicate. 'I start sing like Dennis Brown and then people start hear 'bout me. Niney want to do a track, so we did "Freedom Over Me", "Clap The Barber".' The latter was reworked as 'Guess Who's Coming For Dinner' (aka 'Dreadlocks Coming For Dinner'), giving vent to the frustrations of the young dread; a further recut was later a major hit for Black Uhuru. 'A Rastaman would see a girl and can't follow her home, because he's a man who grow him hair,' Rose explains. 'Other people can't see through that.'

Rose also cut the arresting 'Observe Life' for Lee Perry that year, before gaining broader experience by performing on the North Coast hotel circuit. In 1976 Rose cut the exhilarating 'Running Round' for another neighbourhood entrepreneur; of all his solo work, it is this song which perhaps provides most evidence of Dennis Brown's influence. The rhythm track, as usual, featured Sly Dunbar, who also had Rose voice a cover of Ken Boothe's 'Artibella' for an early release on Sly's Taxi label.

Rose's strong link with Sly would yield particularly fine results in Black Uhuru; the singer says that the group's debut album, recorded in 1977, was originally conceived as a Taxi disc. _'Love Crisis_ was supposed to record for Sly, but it never happen because Sly go 'pon tour with Peter Tosh. We did so anxious to record the tune them that when Jammys say him would a do the album, we just did it for Jammy.' The album did much to establish their reputation as a hard roots trio, with lyrics focussing on Rastafari values and pertinent social issues; it also established Jammy as a formidable producer.

Dubs of many of these tracks appeared on _Prince Jammy In A Lion Dub Style,_ an album that highlighted Jammy's individual remixing skills, which contrasted Tubby's approach by placing a greater emphasis on cymbal crashes and keyboard sounds; the treble sphere was typically well represented and equalization implemented with greater subtlety. Jammy's stark and moody dub of Horace Andy's sublime _In The Light,_ recorded at Harry J in 1977 for New York-based producer Everton DaSilva in conjunction with Augustus Pablo and bassist Michael 'Myrie' Taylor, was another forceful disc; Jammy would later mix minimal, echoing dubs _of_ some of Pablo's best works, including the dub counterpart to Hugh Mundell's _Africa Must Be Free._

Tubby and Jammy also helped give shape to the mind-bending dubs dreamed up by Michael Campbell, the man who transformed Jamaican radio through his nighttime _Dread At The Controls_ programme. The towering Campbell, better known as Mikey Dread, is speaking on the telephone from his current base in Miami; his voice is uncannily like the nasal tenor of his records. Dread says his interest in radio and electronics began when he was a boy. 'I live between Port Antonio and Negril,' he explains, 'and in Negril I become aware about the power of electricity and communication. Me and my likkle friend them take a generator from a bicycle wheel and rub it and spin it until we get light. We take a battery and connect it to a bicycle bulb and it lights up. When I was twelve, I left Negril and came again to Port Antonio. At Titchfield High School, where I did my O-levels, I was always into the sciences and mathematics and physics.'

**Dread at the controls: Michael Campbell on the roof of Treasure Isle [Dave Hendley]**

At the same time, the lure of the dancehall was irresistible. 'Me inna me teens when me a play sound [called] Safari, play some dangerous tune: "Satisfaction", Carl Dawkins, and "You'l l Be Sorry" by Freddy McKay. We play the sound anywhere – I don't see back my house for weeks. Me play another sound as well named Sound Of Music later in the years. Me develop a certain love for broadcasting later on in life with the sound system thing.

'Eventually me and some friends create a radio station at my high school called Radio Titchfield. We may be the only school in Jamaica whe ever had a licence to broadcast. We had like a five-mile radius for the radio station, and we used to jam the radio, because the rich people [who] carry their kids to school in the car listen to RJR, so me just change [Radio Titchfield's ] frequency to RJR: they come within five miles of the radio station, the radio just switch to me. When you ride into school and you hear some rub-a-dub inna the morning, you wonder what's going on. Me have a deejay friend and the two of us used to MC the events at the school, plus me always perform a tune, like Big Youth's "S-90 Skank" or something else that current.'

Once Campbell saw the inside of a real radio station, his desire to be involved in broadcasting intensified. 'One of the main thing[s] every school does is carry you to the _Gleaner_ company to see how the newspaper is done, and take a tour of the radio stations and King's House,' he recalls. 'I see the man talk at the radio station and I was fascinated by it, and years later me come back to the same job. Me go to town when I-man go to the College of Arts, Science and Technology: for a couple years, me study electrical engineering. I wanted to do electronics engineering, but they never offer that – them do three-phase power building, like how to install an elevator, something what me no really into, so me leave from there and start working. In Jamaica within them time, there was a lot of prejudism because of how black your skin is, so that force man like me who is well-black to really excel inna whatever I-man doing in terms of academics, because me can see a next youth who, through his father is Chinese, they will say he can get a job at the airport, but me must work inna one sugar factory. Me still have that vibes about me and me no like how life treat certain people.'

Despite such hurdles, Campbell got an internship at JBC. 'RJR turn me down, saying I was too qualified,' he notes with dissatisfaction, 'so me go a JBC, and learn from some of the pros: Ossie Harvey, he was a popular technical operator. Back in the days [then], radio in Jamaica was not like one man spinning the music, playing commercials, reading the news and the weather and talking. Radio was divided up into different departments, [with] a booth for the announcer, who faces the operator through a glass. I sit at the control, I control him: if I turn the board on audition and I'm playing strictly rub-a-dub on the next side, he don't even know the difference. It was supposed to be six months in radio before I go into the field as a transmitter engineer, but within six months I realized that I can take this to a next level. JBC sign off at midnight and the kids from school were up studying until late, so we wanted something to keep us company. Me tell Ossie Harvey and another man named Mr Linton why them never go twenty-four hours and them say, "Boy, nobody listen to the radio after twelve o'c lock", so through nie's a country man me tell them I would like to do a little thing a night-time and them say, "Yeah? We'r e going to give you this thing still because we like what you'r e doing, but you would have to come a work Saturday night too." I normally work Monday to Friday.'

So the _Dread At The Controls_ show was born in 1976. However, there were certain restrictions: Campbell, as an engineer and not a 'radio personality' as such, was not allowed to speak on air. 'A girl named Freddy Rodriguez used to be the announcer,' says Campbell of the show's early phase. 'She was a nice, sexy announcer. Me and her would select from what the library had, but when she left I just bring in my record box and dub plate. At school, I have to write certain research papers in English and I did mine on reggae, so me interview eveiy man 'pon Idler's Rest and every artist, so me start to know all the producers through Watty Burnett from the Congos, who's also from Port Antonio. From I did my research for college, me already knew all of the man them who saying anything in reggae – me know where to locate every man and me know what them a deal with. I was moved by Tubbys, Coxsone and Lee Perry. Me did know Joe Gibbs too, Rupie Edwards, I Roy, Keith Poppin, Freddy McKay, Gregory, Dennis, Pablo. I was moved by a lot of people, but Tubbys teach me the most, 'cause Tubbys always respect the fact that me into the sound thing and take it to the broadcast level and still deal with the street people.'

Unlike other Jamaican programmes, which relied heavily on foreign pop music, _Dread At The Controls_ presented pure, authentic, indigenous Jamaican roots music from midnight to 4.30 am, every night of the week except Sunday. Since Campbell was unable to speak he built up an impressive battery of complex sound effects and customized jingles' that turned his broadcasts into a seamless blend of exciting sounds. Campbell's airing of exclusive dub plates meant his show was always ahead, presenting the latest sounds even before they caught on in the dancehall. In addition to captivating Jamaica, the programme gained cult followings in Cuba and Trinidad as well as in the USA and UK, and twice won Campbell the award of 'Broadcaster of the Year'. But some of his superiors were displeased by its success. 'Within JBC, there's a lot of jealousy,' he explains. 'Everywhere people talk about the show and I become like a overnight hero, and them people never see me as a hero, them see me more or less as a country man. Them get mad, because reggae was not regarded as no substantial, cultural[ly] enlightened or enlightening art form. I start make some tunes, because the people give me a fight fi make a tune that say, "The dread you have to love". Me make Dread At The Controls company, and me put out whatever I feel.'

Campbell says this debut recording, 'Love The Dread', was instigated by King Tubby. 'When me go town and meet Tubbys, me start read a whole heap of books 'bout sound recording that me never have access to before, specific books 'bout the mixing console. He know me is a man who love [to] read, so Tubbys make me read text books and magazines, and him could answer me questions. Then me would go Sundays with Tubbys and Carlton Patterson, and him show me some little things about multi-track recording and dub. I recorded my first song because of my involvement with Tubbys: I was making a jingle for my radio show and me and Tubbs talk about [the concept of 'Love The Dread']. Tubbs like it, so Tubbs say, "Do the whole tune and just make it a record." Tubbs show me how fi get me label and how to get into the business, and here I am today – no other man ever show me nothing about how fi start a label, or how7 fi get me tune recorded, and how fi mix it right, and how fi lay the rhythm... Tubbs teach me everything. Other people, me just end up working with them.'

Mikey Dread was sometimes appearing on Socialist Roots with U Brown and Ranking Trevor in this period; the first producer to benefit from his vocal input was Joe Gibbs with 'Friend And Money', a cut of Dennis Brown's biggest-ever hit, the rockers-style recut of 'Money In My Pocket'. Mikey says he was asked to voice the tune partly because of his ceaseless promotion of Althea and Donna's 'Uptown Top Ranking' – a recasting of Trinity's 'Three Piece Suit' by two upper-class schoolgirls who caught the ear of Jacob Miller – helped the novelty groove to become a substantial hit. 'Me always there a studio a look fi dub. Me said me want to listen to some tunes whe never released and them play "Uptown Top Ranking". Me ask them why them don't release it, and them never like the tune. From me start rinse it [air it on his own show], that blow up the place, and the man them call me back and then me start give them ideas. Me tell them me need to do a tune and them put on Dennis Brown's rhythm, and me just take one take and lick it and then me move on. Them days me just a build my label, and me just do one-one tune for certain man. Scratch was the luckiest, because me do more than one tune fi him – Scratch get the best of Mikey Dread. Scratch check me one time and say that him want me do a tune. I think I did "Dread At The Mantrol" first. Me make some tune when me really fresh, because every morning me leave JBC and reach home by six o'c lock, Lee Perry's there, and him gone with me for the whole day, until it's time for me to go back and work the night. We do a lot of tracks, like "Sun Is Shining" with Bob Marley. Him always have some great ideas and me and him never had a problem, because the man is a genius and I could recognize it, because I come from a different academic school. It's just before "Barber Saloon" Scratch come.'

'Barber Saloon', the humorous tale of a dread who chops off his locks, was another single to surface from Dread's link with King Tubby and Carlton Patterson; though U Brown bowed out of voicing the rhythm for Patterson, creating 'Weather Balloon' on his own instead, Dread's spontaneous cut proved equally successful. 'Due to how certain things did gwan, and me did get the rhythm [for "Love The Dread"] from Patterson, then me owe Patterson a favour. We never plan fi do "Barber Saloon" on the rhythm, it just happen that we go inna the studio and me just remember something that me see, and me just joking around to say, "What a rude little dread", and by the time me ready fi do the tune, they say, "We take it already." Them already voice it and me couldn't put what me wanted to put on the rhythm.'

Another strong one-off collaboration was 'Proper Education', a track voiced for producer Witty Reid. Like 'Barber Saloon' and 'Love The Dread', the song was eventually included on Mikey Dread's debut album, _Evolutionary Rockers._ 'Witty was a good producer,' Dread consents. 'He was a policeman, and him produce "Just Like A Sea" with David Isaacs, a tune that me always push 'pon the radio. It became a number one, and me said, "Yo, me want a cut of this tune." '

As his radio show increased in popularity, Mike Dread began voicing a series of hard-hitting singles by upcoming artists. The first of these was 'Molly Collie', sung by Edi Fitzroy and written by radio and TV producer Pam Hickling, wife of well-known psychiatrist Dr Fred Hickling. 'I produce it and created the rhythm with Sly them, but the lyrics were written by Pam Hickling, one of the greatest unknown writers out of Jamaica,' says Mikey Dread. 'Because we always working with JBC at the same time, I always have Edi doing some jingles for me with his voice, because Edi was one of my main supporters at JBC. Me end up taking him to Mona where me a live – him never have to worry about rent or nothing. Me take Edi Fitzroy and certain other man under my wings and move them out of the ghetto. We just have a bonding where we really take reggae to a certain level. We start making proper tune: a lot of people were promising to start producing him, like [comedian] Ranny Williams. Me and Pam became very close friends and we have a company [40 Leg], the three of we own everything equally.'

Though his tone is high and bright on record, face to face the dreadlocked singer's speaking voice is definitely at the lower end of the scale. At his box-like home across from the imposing Gun Court, Edi, born Fitzroy Edwards, navigates the twisting path that led to the unlikely circumstances of his first recordings. Born in the town of Chapleton in Clarendon, he spent his early years in Montego Bay where his father, a cane farmer and grocery store manager, ran the Vasco sound system, 'one of the first sound systems inna the West'. When his parents split up in 1969 Edi went with his mother to downtown Kingston, where she found domestic work. 'Those days, downtown Kingston was the place to be,' he reminisces. 'Not like now when you have war and crime. I start going to Westminster Commercial Institute with my brother. We pursue accounts and after I graduated my first job was at JBC, where I reach the level of Accountant Payable.

**No dream trip: Edi Fitzroy [David Katz]**

'Coming from a musical family, where my father used to deal with music and t'i ng, I know that fire was in 1.1 love Jacob Miller, because we both live in the same community, Kingston 13, and I feel he one of the strongest voice out of Jamaica. Him have a long range, so he had a great influence on me. I usually go by Joe Gibbs' 'pon Saturdays – fi years me a go there, [but] all me can hear [is] "Come back tomorrow."

'One day me there at JBC and a sing inna the studio, and a lady there passing, Pam Hickling. She just pass and hear that voice and say, "I'm going to record you." The next day she go and draw the money, about 300 dollars to do a rhythm: that time Michael Campbell, the Dread at the Controls, usually work at JBC. Him know a likkle about engineering, so he took me and she to Channel One, and Sly and the Revolutionaries, them lay the first track entitled "Molly Collie" – it was number nine in the top forty charts in Jamaica. About four months after that, my second song was "Country Man" – that was even bigger. "The Gun" was also a monster hit.

'If you listen to my early songs, I don't see myself singing fantasy, or making up something which is not real, because you can't put people on a dream trip. When I look around in the city, seeing so many sufferation – people not working, some people cannot even pay them rent so they can send them kids to school – and being fortunate that my mother could work and support my education, seeing the vibes, me say my music haffe have depth.'

Fitzroy's 'Country Man' had a captivating dub, incorporating various hard-to-identify sound effects and highlighting a driving drum pattern. Like much of Mikey Dread's early work, the dub was mixed by King Tubby himself. 'It's just a _DATC_ [Dread At The Controls] thing,' says Dread. 'We were dying something and it works. It's like in the lab: you'r e testing fonnulas, some of them work and some of them have side-effects that make people sick. That's how me look 'pon life and look 'pon me music: wre have to create, but when we find a formula we keep it.'

Other strong material came with singers like Rod Taylor and Michael Israel. 'Rod Taylor had done a song [for Freedom Sounds] which I used to play on the radio called "Ethiopian Kings", so me make him come audition at my house fi play "His Imperial Majesty" and "Behold HIM". He wrote the lyrics for "Behold HIM", but "His Imperial Majesty" was my song. We recorded it and we used to get it played on both radio stations heavily. Wayne Chin always play it 'pon RJR – he don't really [play] strictly reggae, but we always in a competition thing. Michael Israel is a champion singer. Both of us come from Port Antonio, and we'r e still friends up 'til now. From [when] we were young kids, he was a guy who always win a lot of song competitions. Him named Michael Brown, but me call him Michael Israel.'

Meanwhile, the _Dread At The Controls_ radio show had such prestige that Mikey received some tempting offers of employment. 'Chris Blackwell came to take me from JBC to bring me to Nassau, and I had to tell him no,' he recalls. 'I think I had found a formula and it was working for me. How would I be at the height of my career and go and jump on a bandwagon that is uncertain? Him want me fi leave radio to do sound engineering in Compass Point, because he see me as a great engineer-to-be; Tyrone Downey had brought me to him. Them day there, me no really know who the hell is Chris Blackwell. Them man there never really come a JBC no give me no music.'

When things eventually turned sour at JBC Mikey Dread took over Errol Brown's engineering position at Treasure Isle studio because Errol was preparing to _move to_ Tuff Gong, the new studio that Bob Marley had built at 56 Hope Road. 'Me and Errol were friends, and I'm about to leave JBC because me couldn't take the bullshit, so Errol come down and show me a few things, and when him leave I-man just take it over. Me do some Culture t'i ng, maybe "Natty Never Get Weary" LP _[Cumbolo]_ and some other likkle Treasure Isle tune. I was there for maybe a year. After that time, things start happen for me and me start travel.'

Photographer Dave Hendley, who was then working for the rejuvenated Trojan company as well as running his own Sufferer's Heights label, brought Dread to the UK after meeting him on a trip to Jamaica in early 1979. 'Dave Hendley was the one responsible for getting Mikey Dread to London to help me to launch Dread At The Controls in England, as well as Sugar Minott's label,' Dread confirms. 'Trojan signed me and Sugar Minott that same year, and part of the deal was to come to England to promote. I give Trojan _Dread At The Controls_ [a remixed _Evolutionary Rockers]_ and I was going to set up a company, do all my productions through there, and we were going to start with _African Anthem.'_

The album, a thrilling dub set mixed to parallel a _Dread At The Controls_ radio session, was issued on Cruise, a label that Hendley established with fellow Trojan staff member Paul Wateridge. However, the partnership was short-lived and Dread subsequently issued his material in conjunction with other fledgling UK independents.

When he returned to Jamaica after his first brief visit to the UK, Mikey Dread was approached by the Clash, with whom he furthered the reggae-punk alliance by producing and toasting on their 'Bank Robber' single. 'The Clash send for me the second time around,' he explains. 'Them say they try a lot of producers – Lee Perry and a whole heap a guy – and they never have no hits. Them ask if me want to work with them, but I didn't want to. I didn't know who they were and I didn't want to go back to England – England too cold.'

Eventually Dread was persuaded to return to Britain, where he went on the road with the group; Edi Fitzroy also joined them on certain performances. 'For me to produce them, I wanted to hear or see what it was,' Dread laughs. 'Me come from Jamaica [where] no man no play some punk music. I didn't even know which beat I'm on, or where is the start of this damn note! In order for me to take a job, I need to know which sort of fans you have and how does your music go across. We do the work and it was good. They were cool with me and we got some good stuff accomplished.'

By the time Mikey Dread and Edi Fitzroy toured Britain, roots reggae had achieved its pinnacle of international popularity. In the years that followed, the status of Jamaican sounds would become devalued. This was partly in response to a shift in the ruling style: the classic harmony trios, who sang of suffering while praising Jah, were giving way to the spiky edges of early dancehall, in which a solo singer or deejay would typically address less weighty matters. But as with previous stylistic shifts, such changes were not absolute; a few hannony trios survived, and several artists composed songs of sensuality as well as 'sufferers' lyrics, but in general the mood was becoming less heavy and more geared towards dancing feet.

As the major overseas record labels gradually lessened their commitment to reggae, the faddish British music press denounced the music as passe and most publications ceased to cover it. In retrospect, it seens this attitude was motivated by financial concerns. The collapse of lucrative markets in West Africa had a decisively negative impact, and Jamaica's worsening political situation drove companies to seek material elsewhere. As the appetite for exoticism intensified executives discovered an alternative means of peddling it by adulterating the music of Africa for a so-called 'World Music' category. Such factors isolated reggae once more, causing most Jamaican artists to concentrate on their home audience. This would ultimately bring a refreshing rawness and authenticity to the predominant sound that arose as the 1970s gave way to the 1980s.

Nice Up the Dance: Dub Poetry and Dancehall Rub-a-Dub

_Most of what I write is what I feel and what I see. I learned that the pen is sometimes mightier than the sword and people can write things and motivate people to think; that is what my work is all about, to make you think._

Mutabaruka

_Sometimes some so-called producers, when you start playing something for them, them say them don't like it, so we were saying we would take all of those rejected stuff and play them for ourselves, and all the rejected things started running._

Robbie Shakespeare

AT THE END of the 1970s, Jamaica was gripped by dramatic social upheaval. With the new decade came a change of government, the result of a transformation that was anything but smooth or gradual. If the 1976 general election had seen plenty of bloodshed, it was but a prelude to the extreme violence unleashed in the run-up to that of 1980.

Despite Michael Manley's grand idealism and willingness to challenge the policies of world powers, shortages of food and basic goods, frequent power cuts, runaway inflation and escalating unemployment made it increasingly clear that Democratic Socialism was not working. Additionally, grotesque acts of violence and politically motivated murders were becoming more commonplace and certain incidents suggested that Manley was not fully in control.

The most notorious of these was the Green Bay Massacre, which took place in December 1977. Twelve JLP gunmen from the Southside ghetto, close to the wharf, were lured to the Green Bay firing range in the belief that they would be able to get hold of automatic firearms; when they got there, soldiers from the specialist Military Intelligence Unit were waiting in ambush. In the ensuing shootout five JLP men were killed and several others wounded. Manley claimed the action was part of his determined effort to rid the streets of violent crime and refused to make the soldiers appear in court; the reputedly radical National Security Minister, Dudley Thompson, even went so far as to remark, famously, that 'No angels died in Green Bay.' However, widespread rumours decried the action as the work of MIU renegades, suggesting that Manley was not entirely in charge of the nation's armed forces. The notorious event was widely commented on in song, with the most direct criticism coming from deejays such as Tappa Zukie with 'Murder' and Lord Sassafras on 'Green Bay Incident'.

In the wake of this violence came the unexpected peace treaty between the downtown rudie gangs, brokered on 10 January 1978 by PNP don Bucky Marshall and senior JLP man Claudie Massop, with assistance from fellow toughs Tony Welch and Carl 'Byia' Mitchell, plus members of a Rasta organization known as the Niyabinghi Theocracy. Again, the peace was widely referred to on disc: Jacob Miller scored high in the charts with 'Peace Treaty Special'; Dillinger made an impact with 'War Is Over'; George Nooks revived Little Roy's 'Tribal War'; and Oku Onoura surveyed the situation on 'Reflections In Red', one of the first songs recorded at Marley's Tuff Gong studio and one of the earliest examples of Jamaican 'dub poetry' to be committed to vinyl.

Dub poetry stems from the experimental setting of verse to music: the politically challenging poems, often expounding a Rastafari world view, are typically recited in a heavy patois, whilst the rhythmic emphasis is provided by straightforward reggae or a backdrop of jazzy instrumentals and Niyabinghi beats. Though others would find greater fame with dub poetry, the true pioneer of the genre in Jamaica is Oku Onoura.

Of mixed Chinese and African ancestry, he was born Orlando Wong in Franklyn Town but took the name Oku Onoura, meaning 'Voice of the People', to signify an African identity. In the late sixties Onoura set up a school and first-aid centre for underprivileged youth in the Eastern Kingston ghetto of Dunkirk, but in 1970 he was sent to prison for anned robbery. In 1974 Cedric Brooks' Light of Saba group performed at the prison, and Oku recited his poems with their musical backing; he was given an early release in September 1977, after a campaign supported by the academic Poets, Essayists and Novelists organization. Then, in February 1978, Onoura and his fellow poets Mutabaruka and Michael Smith aired poetry set to music at a Rastafarian rally at Kingston's Heroes Circle as part of the peace treaty festivities, and to mark the fiftieth anniversary of Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association.

Perhaps the best-known of the Jamaican dub poets as a result of international releases of albums cut since the 1980s, Mutabaruka is an outspoken individualist. His late-night _Cutting Edge_ broadcasts on Ine FM currently have the ear of the nation, and Muta never fears to speak his mind on air. Perpetually barefoot and with a grey widow's peak visible in his forelocks, he cuts a striking figure. After a charged live performance, in which he appeared in chains to emphasize the inhumanity of slavery, the poet spoke of the way he came to harness the power of the word.

He was born Alan Hope in Rae Town, Kingston, but left at a young age to spend fifteen years in the countryside. After returning to the capital in the sixties he began to publish poems under the name Mutabaruka, which means 'one who is always victorious' in a Rwandan tongue. His vibrant poetry, which embraced Rastafarian philosophy and the political activism of black power, was highly critical of mainstream Jamaica. In the 1970s his work was published widely on the island, especially in the magazine _Reggae Swing._ 'I was doing poetry from the late sixties, early seventies, in books and magazines,' he explains. 'Then a book came about, and I started to perform them in different literary circles. Most of what I write is what I feel and what I see. I learned that the pen is sometimes mightier than the sword and people can write things and motivate people to think; that is what my work is all about, to make you think. When you listen to my poems, when you read my poems, it must motivate you to find solutions for your problems. I cannot guarantee to have all the solutions to all of the problems, but I can make you think of these problems and be motivated towards a constructive solution.'

**Chinna Smith at Tuff Gong [Beth Lesser]**

Michael Smith cut 'Word' with Light of Saba in 1978. He came to prominence through the Jamaican School of Drama, where the Poets in Unity collective was formed in 1979. Smith's strong command of street vernacular, often delivered rapid-fire, gave his poems a particularly gripping sense of realism. 'Michael Smith was one of those extraordinarily gifted people that the Third World just throws up every so often that has a tremendous way with words, that was able to use the ordinary spoken language of Jamaicans in a way that was both entertaining and spine-chilling,' says London's foremost reggae poet, Linton Kwesi Johnson, producer of Smith's album _Mi Cyaan Believe It._ 'He was totally committed to ordinary people, to the struggles and the plight of the sufferers of Kingston, the peasants. As a performer, he was electric on stage. He brought so-called "dub poetry" to a level of acceptability which hadn't been there for it before and has since had a lot of imitators.'

Johnson is a short man with a well-groomed beard, always smartly dressed and often crowned with a pork-pie hat. He is typically short of time and is sometimes reluctant to be interviewed, but we have had several informal discussions about music, literature, politics and emigration, all elements that inform his work. In addition to having a razor-sharp mind, grounded political beliefs and an ongoing commitment to facilitating social change, the well-read poet's penchant for debate reveals a refreshing openness. For instance, I have seen him engage in a lengthy, lucid exchange in the small hours on the relative merits of social order with a tattooed Spanish anarchist, one of a group of squatters that occupied a building in Johnson's neighbourhood.

Johnson was born in Clarendon, but emigrated to the UK at the age of eleven in 1963. 'My parents were peasants, poor people,' he reveals in the South London bar that serves as his unofficial office. 'My father was working in the Four Paths bakery, my mother did domestic work. I was born and raised in Chapleton, then when my mother came to work I was living in Sandy River at the foot of the Bull Head mountains, not far from James Hill, where the poet and novelist Claude McKay came from. I spent some holidays in Kingston with my mother – she was living at Slipe Road, near Torrington Bridge. I spent a lot of time in Hope Gardens, because I had three uncles and an aunt working there. My grandparents were farmers; my grandmother raised me for three years when my mother came here.'

Johnson says it was his teenage membership of the Black Panthers in London that first inspired him to write. 'The Black Panthers were a militant black organization in England that took the name from the American Panthers, but it was completely separate – there were no political ties in that sense, although we used to read the Panther papers from America, read Bobby Seale's _Seize The Time,_ Eldridge Cleaver's book, we followed the teachings of Huey P. Newton and so on. But we were an organization which was tackling racism in Britain and organizing around issues dealing with the police and the courts, because those were the burning issues of the day. That was where I first learned about black literature and began to become interested in poetry.'

**Linton Kwesi Johnson [Elspeth Collier]**

After obtaining a degree in sociology from Goldsmith's College in 1973, Johnson wrote the play _Voices of the Living and the Dead,_ examining the legacies of colonialism. He was also actively involved with the _Race Today_ collective. _'Race Today_ was a combative journal that not only reported on the struggles and burning issues _of_ the day, as far as the black community was concerned, but was also involved in helping to build organizations, working in close alignment with the Black Panthers movement and other organizations like the Northern Collectives in Bradford and Leeds,' Johnson explains. 'We were involved in several important campaigns that helped to transform both the political and cultural lives _of_ black people in Britain.'

In the mid-1970s, when Johnson was writing about reggae in the British music press, he coined the phrase 'dub poetry' in reference to the verbal artistry of deejays such as U Roy and Big Youth. The tag was later applied to his own work after he cut the first full-length album _of_ poetry set to reggae rhythms, _Dread Beat And Blood,_ released by Virgin in 1977 and credited to Poet and the Roots. Johnson is an erudite man and his careful choice of words gives his poetry a particular cadence; when set to the complex arrangements of multi-talented musician Dennis Bovell its emotional content acquired greater emphasis, rendering the medium accessible to audiences which might normally be turned off by politically oriented verse. In Britain, poets such as Johnson and Benjamin Zephaniah gave dub poetry a worthy status; in Jamaica, Oku Onoura, Mutabaruka, Michael Smith, Jean Binta Breeze and others associated with the Jamaican School of Drama were using the power _of_ the word to ferment change. However, leading lights in both countries have tried to distance their work from the term; Onoura is the only one who is really comfortable with it.

The dub poets' performance at Heroes Circle in February 1978 marked the end of Bob Marley's sixteen-month overseas exile following the attempt on his life at Hope Road. He returned to Jamaica that same night after being approached by peace treaty intermediaries from the Twelve Tribes of Israel to headline the One Love Peace Concert at the National Stadium on 22 April, with all proceeds to be used for the benefit of ghetto communities. During his performance, Marley famously called Seaga and Manley on stage to join hands.

'That was a very special event,' Edward Seaga earnestly remembers. 'The peace had been established already and people looked at it as something that would endure, so they arranged the peace concert and asked Marley to come. By that time, things had become quite harmonious: [the concert] happened in April and the peace process started in January, so the parties had a much smoother relationship – on a leadership level as well. There was no aspect of that initiative that would have caused me to say, "I don't want to get involved in this." It was something I wanted to see as a natural extension of what was happening.' When I suggest it is surprising that he and Manley shook hands at a time when they were bitter enemies, he insists, 'In the system you don't have bitter enemies. You have strong opposition.'

In either case, the sad fact is that the peace treaty was derailed in February 1979 when the police killed Claudie Massop and two of his colleagues; Massop's body was found to contain over forty bullet wounds. This death followed a spate of riots instigated by the National Patriotic Movement – a group said to have been backed by the JLP – after an International Monetary Fund-instigated currency devaluation and the shortfall of projected finance brought a huge increase to the price of petrol. Kingston's power station was temporarily shut down, as were banks, schools and other civic institutions; tourists were detained at unofficial roadblocks; shops were looted and destroyed. The 'tribalist' violence that had been the norm gradually returned and reached its climax during the 1980 election campaign, which was akin to a civil war with Jamaica on the brink of tearing itself apart.

In April, snipers fired on Manley when he appealed for votes in Southside; in retaliation, nearly one hundred PNP rudies, some armed with machine guns, invaded a JLP fundraising dance on Gold Street, killing five and injuring ten. In June, a military coup planned by Vietnam veteran H. Charles Johnson, leader of the far-right Jamaica United Front, was discovered and prevented by the army; Andrew Young, US ambassador to the UN in the Carter administration, warned of a supposed destabilization campaign devised by the National Security Council. In July, an American magazine named Richard Kinsman as being in charge of fifteen CIA operatives in Jamaica; shortly after the report was published Kinsman told the _Gleaner_ that his home had been bombed, but never reported the alleged attack to the police. By mid-July the number killed was estimated at 350 and rising; hundreds more would be slaughtered in the months of mayhem to come. In October, three weeks before the election, PNP Member of Parliament Roy McGann was murdered; on polling day there were major fires in Jones Town and a number of people were shot while attempting to vote. By the end of the year over one thousand Jamaicans were said to have been killed, most in election-related violence.

The election resulted in a crushing defeat for the PNP, who won a mere nine of the sixty seats in Parliament. When Seaga took up the reigns of power there was rejoicing in Washington as Jamaica turned its ideals away from Cuba and back to the free market; most observers saw Manley's defeat as anything but surprising. 'He destabilized the economy,' says Edward Seaga. 'We were the only country in the entire world to have lost eight consecutive years in negative growth: he made the people 20 per cent poorer at the end of his term of office than they were at the beginning, lost 20 per cent of the GDP [Gross Domestic Product]. Unemployment was at a record high; the cost of living was at a record high; there was a scarcity of foodstuffs, until some fourteen thousand small shops closed – there was nothing to put in there. Motor vehicles had to be parked at the roadside, factories had to close, because they couldn't get simple spare parts. He totally destabilized himself by wrecking the economy, which in later years he admitted – in the early eighties he admitted that socialism was dead and that it was a mistake.'

Musically, there were also great changes afoot as the old decade gave way to the new. On 23 March 1980 Jacob Miller was killed in a road accident. Then the most popular roots singer in Jamaica, despite overseas releases aimed at the disco market, he was given an impressive state funeral. And the death of Bob Marley from cancer on 11 May 1981 was followed by the best-attended funeral in Jamaican history. Marley's passing is sometimes regarded by foreign commentators as a general reference point for the symbolic death of roots music, but it is worth remembering that Marley's status outside Jamaica is disproportionate; he is certainly the best-known reggae artist internationally, but the albums for Island that made his name abroad were less highly esteemed at home. In any case, the early dancehall style had already gained considerable ground by 1979.

**Sly and Robbie [Beth Lesser]**

One of the most significant new production outfits to bring about the stylistic change was the duo of Sly and Robbie. They had increasingly joined forces on recording sessions in the latter half of the 1970s, and when Peter Tosh was assembling a band for an international tour Robbie made sure Sly was included. The pair subsequently decided to take the plunge by entering the production arena in early 1979, despite initial apathy from their peers. As Robbie recalls, 'Sly got some free time at Channel One and nobody didn't want to play at first. I remember I even stand up and cry and Sly said, "Cool, Robbie man, everything will work out." One day Gregory Isaacs came and give us six songs and in those six songs was "Soon Forward", our first Taxi hit.'

**Gregory Isaacs [Dave Hendley]**

Often working with keyboardists Ansel Collins and Robbie Lyn and guitarists Radcliffe 'Douggie' Bryan, Ranchie MacLean and Geoffrey Chung, Sly and Robbie's Taxi productions naturally emphasized the bass and drum. Sly had been the backbone of the sound of Channel One, and needless to say his mechanized beats were pivotal to the new style they were forging; Robbie's driving, spacious bass melodies provided the perfect foil. Sly says it was his 1978 contract with Virgin that brought the badly needed financial backing that would enable the duo to forge ahead with rhythmic experimentation. 'I made _Simple Sly Man_ [with] some rhythm from Joe Joe, and I got some money from Virgin and put it into Taxi. That's where the whole Taxi label start growing and everybody start running back to us.'

It is fortunate that Sly made use of this money when he did; a year or so after the 1979 release of _Sly Wicked And Slick Virgin_ wound up the Front Line label, reportedly because their export revenue had been curtailed by a change of government in Nigeria. 'Their biggest market was in Nigeria, South Africa, places like that,' says Norman Grant, 'so when those markets fell, they pulled out.' The Twinkle Brothers' _Countryman_ was one of the last Front Line releases, containing dread anthems like 'Never Get Burn' and 'Since I Throw The Comb'; Norman reveals that the album was heavily tampered with for the overseas market. 'We record it on eight-track at HarryJ and at the time the big companies want you to go twenty-four, so I run it off to a twenty-four-track [tape] and Virgin went into their studio and do a bit of overdubbing with [bassist and dub mixer] Paul Smykle when we weren't around. Some of the guys wasn't too pleased, because they even roll off one of the bass lines.'

As Front Line closed down Gregory Isaacs, Prince Fari and Ashanti Roy from the Congos were signed to Pre, a subsidiary of Charisma; but despite considerable success with Isaacs in 1980-1, the label soon ceased to promote reggae. Of the Jamaican acts transferred to Virgin's parent label, both I Roy and the Gladiators made their least appealing and most commercial sets to date before being dropped by the company, just as Sly and Robbie's instinctive feel for future trends landed them a deal with Island records.

Part of what made the Taxi sound so appealing was Sly's adventurous approach to rhythm. For instance, he was the first drummer on the island to experiment with Syndrums, which he used to build a number of furious post-rockers styles. 'I'd heard the Syndrum on some electronic song,' Sly recalls, 'but I thought that was the only sound you could get: "doop doop". I heard this "coo coop, coo coop" on M's "Pop Music", and I said, "The groove sound nice. How can I get that sound, but still in a groove that could fit in reggae?" On _Sly Wicked And Slick,_ "Queen Of The Minstrel", that was the first song I played it on, then the next song [was] "General Penitentiary" [by] Black Uhuru. After that, I tried to experiment in "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner".'

Such elements are partly what make Black Uhuru's 1979 _Showcase_ such a brilliant record. Like the Gregory Isaacs album of the same name it had six songs, all presented with extended mixes, placing Uhuru's chilling vocals over Sly and Robbie's unbeatable rhythms and strong production values. As ever, Michael Rose's lyrics were sharp and to the point on songs like 'Abortion' and 'Plastic Smile'. 'I have to enlighten my sisters that abortion is dangerous,' Rose explains, 'because woman take abortion and lose them lives. Why not be cautious, that's what the song is saying. "Plastic Smile" is like someone smiles with you, but then when you turn your back they say, "He's a piece of shit." When you'r e a Rasta, you find 'nuff discrimination. These things have to enlighten you – you have to tell the world about it.'

**Duckie, Puma, Michael: the classic Black Uhuru lineup [urbanimage.tv/Adrian Boot]**

The trio now had greater harmonic symmetry with Sandra 'Puma' Jones, a black American drafted into the group when Errol Nelson rejoined the Jays. 'Puma do some social work inna Jamaica and I think she used to dance for Ras Michael,' Rose recalls. 'We went up Hope Road to visit a elder knots fa dreadlocked elder] and run into Puma, heard her singing to Bob Marley _Kaya_ album. We ask her if she did interested, she said she would try it out.'

Though she was an official group member since _Showcase,_ Rose reveals that Puma was absent for the recording of _Sinsemilla,_the album that got the group a contract with Island records in 1980. 'When we record _Sinsemilla,_ she wasn't there for some reason and me have to sing the harmony. We just put her face 'pon it, and the album run 'way.' Along with the herb anthem title track, _Sinsemilla_ offered poetic reasoning on a range of human topics, including the human race's unnecessary division on 'The Whole World Is Africa'.

'The whole inspiration with that is how earth set up,' Rose explains, 'and the everyday life of the Rastaman, the fighting, and Babylon at war fi land. A earthquake separate the land. If you look at the world and see how it was one thing, but because the people them fight so much, it have so much negative vibes that the earth move. If people more 'pon a neutral level, where everything free and people just live natural life, that mean you have a different vibe, but you have to pay for land, you have war, man capture, take 'way. That just push off a whole negative thing inna earth, so [some] place stable and some place a move.'

The sound that Sly and Robbie created on Black Uhuru's _Showcase_ and _Sinsemilla_ was so captivating that Island subsequently promoted the 'Rhythm Twins' as honorary members of the group. The duo were also the anchor of their live touring band, and Island harnessed the pair for other high-profile projects such as those recorded by hard-edged singer Ini Kamoze and androgynous funk chanteuse Grace Jones. 'A lot of people don't know that Grace Jones record was actually a Black Uhuru sound,' says Sly of 'Pull Up To The Bumper', her first big hit. 'We brought the master tape of "Sinsemilla" to Nassau, and we'r e playing it for Chris [Blackwell], and he said this is wickedest thing he heard, and [producer] Alex [Sadkin] was saying they need to get the drum sound for Grace. That's the way the sound was born.'

While Island was raising the Rhythm Twins' profile abroad, their Taxi label was picking up steam in Jamaica. By 1980 they had a hot stable of artists, scoring big hits with Jimmy Riley's recut of the Uniques' 'Love And Devotion', the Tamlins' version of Randy Newman's 'Baltimore' (based on Nina Simone's melodic restructuring of the tune), rude deejay General Echo's humorous kung-fu epic 'Drunken Master', and two from the gruff-voiced Junior Delgado: 'Fort Augustus', a warning of the perils of prison, and 'Merry Go Round', a plea for fidelity from a lover. 'From when I was a kid,' Delgado says of the former tune, 'I don't know if it's because my mommy went to America to work, but I used to always feel like I'm caged up, like I'm in prison. Plus, when I was driving past that prison in the middle of the sea called Fort Augustus, that's how the song came. Sly and Robbie did love it, they want to record it, and we did "Merry Go Round" also, same session. Then we'r e going to come in a new decade. We record the songs around '79, and it releases in '80.'

Although Black Uhuru continued to sing of Selassie's glory, the rise of Sly and Robbie as a production force, with Sly's mechanized, modernistic drum and Syndrum patterns to the fore, ultimately pointed away from roots and further into dancehall. As the predominant sound began to take on a harder edge, the Roots Radics emerged as the backing band that would be most crucial in defining its form. They were an amalgamation of session players created after the advent of Sly and Robbie spelt the demise of the Revolutionaries.

The Radics started as an offshoot of the fading Morwells, with bassist Flabba Holt and rhythm guitarist Bingy Bunny forming the nucleus. On Orange Street, at the offices of Leggo records, Flabba is in the company of Skatalites trumpeter Johnny Moore; he speaks of the Radics' formation as a gradual process. 'The band wasn't really that tight,' he says of their first sessions in the late 1970s, 'because I use Winston Wright a lot that time, Santa, Bo-Pee [guitarist Winston Bowen] and Tarzan [keyboardist Errol Nelson]. Like the Revolutionaries, man just come in. We play and play until we find Steelie [keyboardist Wycliffe Johnson] and say that little youth sound more wicked than anything – me and the drummer, Style Scott [Lincoln Scott, aka Rotterdam], say, "Sound like him could come in." Long time me and Bingy Bunny juggle before at Randy's , did 'nuff sessions. Radics no really come yet at the time.' According to Flabba, the first recording session to feature an early version of the Roots Radics yielded 'a song with Earl Zero – the first Earl Zero sound. After that we get Steelie. We a use Santa until we buck up on Style Scott, then we just form the band Radics officially], because them man there dedicated: me, Steelie, Style Scott and Bingy Bunny. We did play and play until we get the guitarist named Sowell [Noel Bailey, a former Youth Professionals member who began his career as a singer], bring him in as a lead. He come with a different sound, like him put a pipe inna him mouth [due to liberal use of wah wah and fuzz box effects pedals]. It sound different and people like that.'

**The Roots Radics [Beth Lesser]**

With a string vest exposing his hefty frame, Flabba is running through a rumbling bass line, reclining in an easy chair, his feet pressed against a table. A friendly and welcoming gentleman, Flabba says his stage name was acquired during his youth in the ghetto. 'My full name is Errol Alexander Carter,' he explains. 'When I sing, people say, "You sound like John Holt", so from that time they call me Flabba Holt. I used to have a brother who make some big dumpling, him tell me if I don't eat that dumpling I'm going to get beaten, so I eat the whole pile of dumpling. Flabba just stick 'pon me from youthman days, original name. I born in Trench Town, but I really come from Denham Town. Most of the man like Alton Ellis, Heptones come from Trench Town, but Ken Boothe, Flabba Holt, Johnny Osbourne come from Denham Town. My birth date is 1950. I really raised by my mother, because my father meet in some kind of accident and die when I'm small. I used to dance 'pon stage, _Opportunity Hour,_ and I win 'nuff prize at Majestic Theatre. I really dance [to] one special song, "Ball Of Fire" [by] the Skatalites. Any time that song there on, man try to contest me. As a youth me used to follow Coxsone, because Coxsone had the better sound. Duke Reid was a bad sound, but King Stitch, that deejay wicked.'

By the early 1970s, Flabba was associated with Rupie Edwards' Success label. 'Them time, I really move 'mongst Rupie Edwards, did some songs with him like "Yamaha Skank" with Shorty the President and Earl "Chinna" Smith. I really move with Rupie Edwards [when] Gregory Isaacs come in a group them call the Concords. Johnny Clarke, me rehearse them youth there and build them into perfection.' Flabba also voiced a song called 'Girl From Manchester' in this period as a deejay, but the record flopped on release. 'It was really Rupie Edwards' idea,' laughs Flabba. 'We go in Randy's studio and just do a little thing, but it never really took off because the rhythm wasn't right.'

**Flabba Holt [Adrian Thomas]**

Flabba subsequently cut songs as a singer, of which the most notable is the 1976 sound-system favourite 'A You Lick Me First'. By 1975 his skills on bass guitar had brought him into the Morwells. 'In Trench Town I play the guitar, and [someone said], "Try the bass, mon", so me take up the bass and play something wicked. Theophilus Beckford, that man give me 'nuff encouragement. Them time, a little band form up. My bass guitar had no name on it, but me get the real thing from Big Youth, a Fender Jazz.'

By 1979 the Roots Radics were making their presence heavily felt, often with tightly wound, slowed-down versions of classic rhythms. In the band's early days, when they were still relying on Santa and Bo-Pee, pivotal releases were cut with a teenage dancehall crooner named Barrington Levy. The singer started in a group called the Mighty Multitudes, who signed a contract with Byron Lee in 1977 but later disbanded. As a solo artist Levy made his Radics-backed debut with 'A Yah We Deh', but it was the song 'Collie Weed', voiced on a slowly rollicking cut of the 'Conversation' rhythm, that first brought him to the top of the Jamaican charts, followed quickly by 'Looking My Love', cut on a hesitant remake of 'Real Rock', and the original 'Shine Eye Girl'. Levy's lyrics, which were often poignantly poetic, always retained a sense of humour; for instance, in the song 'Many Changes In Life' he used his descriptive powers to speak of youthful days as 'Long time ago when my eyes was at my knees'. His vocal trademark is a stretching of the vowels, elongating words for greater emphasis, and a frequent exclamation of 'Whoah!' in the upper register.

The producer of this highly popular solo material was Henry 'Junjo' Lawes, a character from Waterhouse with a stick-thin frame, whose harnessing of the Roots Radics as a platform for new dancehall artists saw him rapidly emerge as the leading producer of the early 1980s. Linval Thompson, a close associate and one of the first producers to work with the Radics, says Junjo came to music from an entirely different arena. 'I really brought Junjo in the business,' he says definitively. 'He just see me in the road and want to follow me around, want to come with me to the studio. He wasn't no musician, he was a guy on the street, working for the politician, if you understand what I'm trying to say. Then I w7as _the_ singer, so everybody want to go up there with me.'

Like Linval Thompson, Junjo Lawes typically had the Roots Radics build their rhythms at Channel One, aided by a fresher crew of engineers who understood the needs of dancehall audiences. Those who shaped the sound at Channel included Lancelot 'Maxie' McKenzie, who cut material with the Revolutionaries from 1978; drummer Stanley 'Barnabas' Bryan, who worked on material for GG and others from 1977; and 'Crucial' Bunny Graham (aka Bunny Tom-Tom). Joseph Hoo-Kim offered the following thoughts about the trio: 'Maxie was Ernest's personal friend. He only take the voices and mix for other producers. Crucial Bunny usually _fix_ bike round the bike shop. I would put Bunny Tom-Tom and Maxie as the same type of engineer, but Bunny Tom-Tom was a little more flexible, not as aggressive a mixer. Barnabas live across the road from the studio, so we gave him a try.' Anthony 'Soljie' Hamilton, a former Jamaica Defence Force conscript who had worked on the Echo Vibrations sound system, was another to get his start at the studio as an engineer, later becoming a leading producer. He started hanging out at Channel One in the late seventies, making his way to the mixing desk by 1980. After building their basic rhythms with some of these engineers at Channel One, Lawes and Thompson would usually voice and mix their productions at King Tubby's , at first using Prince Jammy and later drawing on Scientist for the bulk of their creations.

**Junjo Lawes [Beth Lesser]**

The teenage electronics wizard and apprentice amplifier repair man at Tubby's , otherwise known as Overton H. Brown, became part of Junjo Lawes' team one fateful day in 1979; his knowledge of electronics and innovative approach to dub subsequently made him the top remix engineer of the early 1980s. Scientist says he was born in 1960 and raised in the Harbour View area, close to Kingston's international airport. 'I been living with my grandparents from days old,' he chuckles. 'It was the thing to do back in them times. My grandfather was a policeman and he went into accounting. My dad, he was into electronics professionally, so I kind of picked it up from him. I was repairing televisions, building sound system amplifiers at sixteen, seventeen. I would build one and test it with instruments and everything would read normal, but when I test it with one of the mixes from Tubbys with that "flying cymbal" and that crisp high-hat the amplifiers go crazy – it didn't look normal. Every time you play reggae through this thing it start freaking out – overworked amplifiers.

'That kind of interest me to meet Tubbys, because he was doing all those sound effects. I had this friend who was doing this welding job for him, and he introduced me to Tubbys. I start buy couple hard-to-get transformers that he would wind himself- it was a regular place to get hard-to-find parts. After Tubbys saw what I could do, he had me there repairing amplifiers and televisions. Before I went to Tubbys I had a vision about building a recording studio and building a console. I was running jokes with Tubbys about making consoles with moving, motorized faders back in the seventies – I envision the whole automated thing. When I started to talk about console with automation, they say, "It must be a Scientist."'

**Barnabas [Beth Lesser]**

Though Scientist was Tubby's electronics apprentice, he secretly wanted to try his hand at recording and did his best to observe the techniques of the resident engineers. 'Jammys was the main engineer there at the time and Pat Kelly used to engineer on and off,' he recalls. 'I was going in there just to look over somebody's shoulder, but the main thing was to get back inside to wind some transformers and fix something. I was telling Tubby I can go in there and do that thing [sound engineering], but it was like a joke, because he didn't have anybody my age doing that type of work.'

**Scientist [right] with Yabby You at Tuff Gong [courtesy of Yabby You]**

Differing accounts of his engineering debut have been printed. Scientist himself recalls that smaller producers such as Errol 'Don' Mais, proprietor of the Greenwich Farm label Roots Tradition, were encouraging Tubby to give him a try at the mixing desk, but it was Junjo Lawes who eventually gave the youth the go-ahead. 'One day Junjo Lawes came there with Barrington Levy and was waiting on Jammys. He get frustrated, it getting late, and he ask King Tubbys to go and mix for him – he begging Tubbys to do it, but the King tell them, "Send the kid in there – let him do it." Everybody was reluctant because I was just a kid, I had no history. Qunjo] didn't want me to, he just do it because there was nobody else to work. I apply my electronic experience and powered up the console, get the mike to work, figured out how to string up the tape. He sang "Collie Weed" – that song went to number one! I didn't do much electronics after that – it was most of Junjo's sessions: Barrington Levy, Johnny Osbourne.'

**Sammy Dread [Beth Lesser]**

It was partly Scientist's creative mixing that brought Sammy Dread to the attention of British audiences; his second recording, 'African Girl', came on a Lovelinch disco with seamless editing and a particularly inspired dub. Dread was one of the first dancehall singers from Greenwich Farm to gain popularity at the end of the 1970s; he names Linval Thompson and Sugar Minott as his favourite singers, but Michael Prophet's style, drawn from the wailing techniques of Bob Andy and Dennis Brown, was the most obvious inspiration for his early work. 'I grow up in Kingston 13 with Michael Palmer, Ranking Joe, Ranking Trevor, Ni-codeemus,' Dread says in a voice far deeper than the tenor of his records. 'In Greenwich Farm it was me, Rod Taylor, Michael Prophet, Philip Fraser, Sylvan White, Barrington Levy. I know Earl Chinna Smith and Earl Zero. They used to play the guitar, and I was humming and they said, "You going to sing one of these days." I was a forklift driver, working at the Kingston wharf. Then Bertram Brown from Freedom Sounds, I come with this tune "Reggae On The Move" for him, but that never release in Jamaica. Don Mais, he do this recording with me, "African Girl", whe Leroy Smart do the back-up vocal. That 45 was a big hit for me in London with Peter Ranking.'

'Don Mais give me a try,' notes Michael Prophet, 'because he try to make himself be a producer with Sammy Dread and Peter Ranking.' Michael has lived in London since the mid-1980s. When he rolls up to a meeting in Camden High Street in a silver Mercedes, wearing a crisp suit and lots of gold, it is evident that life is treating him well. Born Michael Haynes, the singer got his stage name by working with Yabby You, but says Don Mais was the first to produce him. 'I did a few songs for Don Mais with Soul Syndicate even before I sing anything for Yabby You,' he reveals, 'but them tune never get no publicity.' As with Sammy Dread's early shots, this material surfaced abroad on Lovelinch discos, after Prophet came to prominence with Yabby You.

**Michael Prophet [David Katz]**

Though Scientist became a leading light by shaping the material that Junjo Lawes and Don Mais were forging with the Radics and Soul Syndicate at King Tubbys, at the same time he made an important contribution by helping to rejuvenate the Studio One sound in 1979–80. It was partly the vinyl 'war' against Channel One instigated by Sugar Minott that initiated the Studio One renaissance as the 1970s drew to a close, with formidable hits coming from a loyal set of singers that included Minott, Freddy McGregor, Johnny Osbourne, Willie Williams, plus deejay duo Michigan and Smiley. The upgraded musical texture came largely from session keyboardist Pablove Black and bassist Bagga Walker, both prominent members of the Twelve Tribes of Israel organization; with Scientist often at the mixing desk their creations had an intensified brightness, particularly at the treble end of the spectrum.

'A few months after [the "Collie Weed" session] I went and checked Studio One, because I wanted to learn how to do live recording,' Scientist recalls. 'Hanging out at Randy's corner, "Idler's Rest", I got to know [singer] Peter Broggs. He was recording there and encouraged me to go. Mr Dodd is a type of a man [who] would give anybody the break, but you have to go through a screening process. Me, Sugar Minott, Michigan and Smiley, Freddy McGregor, all of us would wait outside. Mr Dodd would say, "Hey, Jackson, come back and check me tomorrow. I'm going downtown to open the downtown store" – you come back the next day and go through a couple more days like that. By that time, he was up to twenty-four tracks. The engineer – I knew him as Bim-Bim – he showed me the basics: this is this mike and this is the drum room. But I had an electronics background, so everything just came second nature to me.

'About the first session I did there was Peter Broggs, then Michigan and Smiley, "Nice Up The Dance", Willie Williams, some of the Johnny Osbourne, Sugar Minott, and we did a bunch of overdubs with Bagga Walker and Pablove Black. [Dodd] had the old rhythms on two-track. We would run those into the twenty-four-track and he would have Bagga play over the bass lines and Freddy McGregor played a lot of those [drum] overdubs. I was at Studio One close to a year, on and off, because my main thing was to try and gain experience recording live music. I missed Tubby's environment because it had a mix of electronics, so I was kind of in between both of them, but Mr Dodd didn't feel too comfortable about that.'

One of the biggest hits of 1979 was Sugar Minott's 'Oh Mr D C, a track that Scientist engineered at Studio One. The song updated the Tennors' roc steady classic 'Pressure And Slide' as a herb dealer's plea for mercy from the police. 'You have people in Maxfield Park that live off herb business,' Minott explains, 'and when people go to the country to get herb in Jamaica, it's like you'v e gone to rob a bank, so your kids are waiting and fretting. The song came to me, like people just trying to live, can't you give us a chance? That time was a hard time for me and I had to sell the song for fifty dollars, 'cause I have two children, very young, and no food. Scientist was the engineer on that song – he'd just left Tubbys and came to Studio One, but Coxsone run him away: "Tubbys send you here to mash up me business, what kind of thing you doing?" because him used to do some experimenting and Coxsone couldn't understand it.'

**Bagga Walker [right] with Max Romeo [David Katz]**

'After a time, Mr Dodd brought up this scenario [that] they send you down here to spy,' Scientist confirms. 'Mr Dodd figured that everybody wanted to steal the secret of his sound. Until now, he trusts no one. When I went down there I started to point out a lot of problems with the equipment, and how Mr Dodd wanted us to record it didn't really sound right. Back in those times everybody was trained to record flat – you don't record with EQ. It was taught that you EQ afterwards. So I invented my own style where we recorded with EQ, and the sound with Sugar Minott and Michigan and Smiley, you started to get a crispness to it. Mr Dodd would go crazy! He thought we was trying to sabotage something. Bagga Walker and the rest of the musicians convinced Mr Dodd that them rather [prefer] that sound, so everybody started to do away with the flat recording.'

Eventually, Scientist tired of repeated conflicts with Dodd and returned to Dromilly Avenue. 'After Mr Dodd's paranoia, I start doing more stuff at Tubbys,' Scientist explains, 'because Tubbys was more technically inclined. Mr Dodd was not, and when we make recommendations to him he always think we are trying to sabotage. I'm a kid, telling this big icon, "This is outdated, and you need to calibrate the machines." He don't want to hear that. It becomes like a waste of talent after a while, so I just continue working at Tubbys.'

Live equalization had been pioneered by Lee Perry at the now dormant Black Ark, with instruments also subjected to heavy phasing and echo effects while they were being recorded. At Studio One, Scientist's application of live EQ brought an increased sense of high fidelity to Coxsone's tracks, with Freddy McGregor's overdubbed drumbeats, Syndrums and cymbals given an enhanced treble emphasis. The technique is particularly noticeable on tracks like 'Nice Up The Dance', a number one chart hit by Michigan and Smiley, that celebrated the culture of the dancehall on an updated 'Real Rock' rhythm; Willie Williams' apocalyptic 'Armagideon Time' also made use of a less embellished cut of 'Real Rock' that left greater space for his subdued vocal.

**Willie Williams [Beth Lesser]**

In the corridor of an anonymous hotel on the outskirts of London, Williams recalls that his link with Studio One dates back to the rock steady period. 'The artist that brought me to Studio _One_ was Bob Andy,' he says in a voice that is deep, yet barely more than a whisper. 'I live close to where he and Marcia Griffiths was living in Washington Gardens. We became friends and started checking each other out music-wise. On Sundays they would always go to Tyrone Evans' home, bang around with the piano and sing along.' Williams' debut session yielded 'Calling', which made it on to Coxsone's _Party Time In Jamaica_ album, plus an original called 'Prisoner Of Love' that was not released; both were cut at the same session as the Gladiators' 'Hello Carol'. Williams was still attending school then, but music was always his primary focus.

'I'm from Saint Anne,' the singer says. 'Where I was born is not far from where Bob Marley come from. My dad was a carpenter, but passed away at a early age. I was seven when I came to town, say about 1960, and ended up in Trench Town with my brother and his wife. At Trench Town Comprehensive High School, Sly Dunbar and myself, we were in the same class. I had a sound system at a early age called Triple Tone, with two brethren in Duhaney Park. That love for the music drive me to want to make my own songs to play on the set. The songs that I was singing, most people didn't want to record those songs, said they were too revolutionary, so I went in to Harry J about '69 and produced "Prisoner Of Lonliness" on the Soul Sounds label, with Bobby Kalphat, Benbow and Albert Griffiths from the Gladiators playing guitar and singing.'

After a few more inconsequential tunes, in the early 1970s Williams began to produce other artists, including Delroy Wilson and a later incarnation of the Versatiles, formed after Junior Byles and Louis Davis left the group. After subsequently gaining important live experience in Toronto, Williams cut his most memorable work towards the end of the seventies. 'I went to Canada about '74, met up with Jackie Mittoo and forge a friendship, and we start working together. I was the singer for his band, along with Lord Tanamo on hotel gigs. I get tired of that after a while, because I wanted to express my own thing: that is when I started going back to the studio with Lloyd Parks, Benbow and Bobby Kalphat, do "Messenger Man" and "Unity". We do the rhythm at Channel and voice and mix at Tubbs'. "Messenger Man" became an album. The song was being played on a regular basis in New York, so Coxsone heard the song and wanted to start something again – this was '79. Jackie Mittoo and myself went back to Jamaica and started doing an album, which eventually became _Armagideon Time.'_ Like Yabby You, who later became a close associate, Willie Williams is a dread who worships Jesus Christ and does not recognize the divinity of Selassie. 'Armagideon Time', another song that captivated the punk audience and was eventually covered by the Clash, is partly a depiction of the fulfilment of biblical prophecy.

The perpetually devout Freddy McGregor sought to emphasize the general unity at Brentford Road in this period, partly fostered by a shared religious faith. 'Myself, Sugar Minott, Johnny Osbourne, Jennifer Lara, we do most of the harmony tracks at Studio One since after Ken Boothe,' he explains. 'We are responsible [for] about everything that goes on there, because we pretty much run the studio. We all sing harmonies together on each other's stuff. Bagga and Pablove, these were the musicians at the time and we are all very, very close, because we are all members of Twelve Tribes of Israel, so we were really locked in. We just hold a vibe together and share ideas.'

Freddy's reputation as a lead singer had increased after touring with popular show bands Generation Gap and Soul Syndicate. 'In 1972 I was living at Al Campbell's house on Delacree Lane,' he recalls. 'It's in the ghetto, and that's another experience for me. I was always a youth with Afro, my bell-foot pants and my soul comb, 'cause I wasn't in for badness, I was in for music. Being a ghetto, it was so tough as a country boy, you have no place in terms of getting by. I was depressed, because every song you release you'r e hoping it's going to be the one – and it was never the one. Sometimes me think about getting another job, take up the newspaper, but I wasn't really qualified for any job so it always revert back to the music. It was really frustrating, searching for the next hope, but don't want to go back to country. My goal was really to help my family.

**Freddy McGregor [David Katz]**

'One evening I heard a horn blow outside: Horsemouth say, "Me have some uptown boy, them have band, and a you me come for, because you are my little grassroots ghetto singer." Me jump in the van with him, and this is my audition with some uptown youths who are really university – that's a different scene for me again. Me do some Stylistics, "Black Magic", "Me And Mrs Jones", Lou Rawls, anything within the top forty. My first salary was thirteen-fifty a week. We play every place across Jamaica, uptown, downtown, midtown. We became the most famous band performing on night clubs, office parties, school graduations. Singing in the dance band was creating a difference for me, 'cause then I was becoming more versatile, singing soca, soul, calypso, you name it. But I still had to carve out a sound for myself, and that sound would only come through recording – I was always conscious of that.'

Another skill he learned in Generation Gap was mastery of the drums. 'One New Year's Eve night, we were playing in Saint Elizabeth at a hotel called Treasure Beach. When the band took a break, Horsemouth took a boat with a fisherman to Savannah La Mar to get some smokes. That's how I got to play the drums. For about two months I had to play drums and sing and it turned out nicely, until the manager decided they needed me back out front, so we got another drummer.'

After Generation Gap broke up Freddy fronted the Soul Syndicate from 1975, finally achieving the kind of success he had always striven for with a series of antiestablishment hits cut at Studio One in the latter half of the seventies; he says the shift of focus that helped to facilitate his breakthrough was directly related to his membership of Twelve Tribes. 'The -whole of us start to see Rasta, read the Bible 'nuff, and it's pure[ly] them inspiration we nah see before, so from them times the trend of my music start to move: "Africa Here I Come", "Bobby Babylon", "Rastaman Camp", "Wine Of Violence", 'cause the Bible me a read, and me start to get deeper into things.'

In addition to singing harmony on Sugar Minott's material, Freddy McGregor added new drum parts to much of it, as Coxsone was keen to give his older rhythms a more contemporary sound. 'I do loads of drum tracks at Studio One. Most of the Sugar Minott era I overdubbed, 'cause Mr Dodd was just getting into updating, and that became another earner for me. I would sing harmony every day at Studio One, but there was always something else to do, so that Friday you would ensure yourself of a salary.'

However, Freddy says by the time he cut the atmospheric 'Rastaman Camp' most of his peers had moved on from Brentford Road. 'Them time we have the studio all to weself, 'cause Sugar gone out to Channel One, Johnny Osbourne start move. I was the last one to leave Studio One.'

Sugar Minott broke away to begin his own productions at Channel One in 1979, bartering studio time and getting musicians to lay rhythms for free. 'Some guy give me 800 dollars and I just beg my friends, the musicians,' Sugar recalls, 'so they all chipped in. First songs I put out were all hits: "Man Hungry", "River Jordan". Then we start producing and all the kids start following us. I had my van marked Black Roots maybe a month after leaving Studio One and I was dropping off records at Coxsone, trying to sell them. The first song I did was "In The Resident" with Stepping King Miguel, a youth from the country who used to take us everywhere on his bike. Me carry it to Coxsone, but me never realize it was Coxsone's rhythm still. I was trying to help Barry Brown, 'cause me and him was close, so we record "Not So Lucky", and then Tristan Palmer, "Spliff Tail", all number one songs, just out of the blue, from nowhere.'

Freddy McGregor also began to record outside Studio One in 1979, first at the instigation of Niney the Obseiver. 'Nmey come for me and say, "Youth, your name big a England – song there popular, so we have to do some other things as Studio One hold you down." Me really worried about it too, because Sugar had left and the Channel One sound clean and sound wicked, and me really have to take a deep breath and think about it seriously in terms of leaving Mr Dodd. That was probably the most pressure I had gone through as a youth, not knowing whether that was the right move, but I wanted to take my chances, because I wanted it to happen for me any which way.

'We walked into Channel One and we whacked off all the rhythm tracks in one day, and it took me another two days to write all the songs. This was something we been doing at Studio One every day, so writing songs for a rhythm was like a joke to me and Johnny Osbourne – we could wrap up all twenty songs in no time. That was how that album _[Mr McGregor]_ came together, but I think the beauty with the album was that I used some of my Studio One experiences. It was the norm for most artists to just voice a rhythm track, but we always said, "Some harmony can make it nice, some horns here and there."

'He promised me he would make me go to England, and I have so much respect for Niney from that day onwards. I never realized those were people with such good heart until I actually get a chance to work with them. Bunny Lee too – I used to spend a lot of time with Bunny Lee and his family in Greenwich Farm. Those are people I have enough love, regard and respect for. I like to look at every single aspect of my career as a blessing: everyone who has contributed in any way, I really look at it as a blessing.'

Freddy also scored a substantial hit in 1979 with the self-produced 'Jogging', a song that benefited not only from Freddy's drumming skills but also from finely balanced harmonics and skilled musical arrangement. It was created with former fellow members from Generation Gap, including bassist Howard 'Spread' Bedasse, keyboardist Mikey Hewlitt and guitarist Dalton Browne, who remains Freddy's band leader today. McGregor also produced the _Black Woman_ album by Judy Mowatt, with whom he was having a relationship at this time. 'I was living at Bull Bay, Saint Thomas, out by sister Judy's house, and we used to go down to the beach every morning and run, myself and another friend called Dave Gad, our fitness guru. We used to run, swim, exercise, go to sister Judy's house, get on the piano. At that time we were getting the _Black Woman_ album together, so we spent lots of nights out there so we could be at the beach early morning, working out.

'After running one morning, it just a concept: we'r e jogging on the sands in a Babylon, feeling fit fi conquer creation, crisp track shoes and a big bobby socks – that's what people wear when them a jog. Every morning we used to see people a run: people have on them track shoes and run at Mona Reservoir, so seeing people getting into physical fitness I thought it was a good idea to create a song like this. The first time I produced a track was "Jogging", thanks to Bob Marley for allowing me the opportunity to use his studio. Chris Blackwell walked into the studio that day, asked me if I am interested to go to Nassau to do a remix of a track, "Jagged". He licensed that track from me in 1980 and released it with a Michigan and Smiley on the other side, has it on a few compilations too. That was the beginning of real production for me.'

Johnny Osbourne was happy to be accepted at Studio One after a decade of living abroad. 'Studio One was where I wanted to be all the time,' the singer relates, 'but I didn't get a chance to do anything before 1979. I was singing in Canada with a group called Ishan People; we did two albums, produced by David Clayton- Thomas from Blood, Sweat and Tears, with a Canadian company called GRT, but I wasn't a solo artist, my name wasn't upfront, so I decide to build back my name. When I came back to Jamaica, 1979–80, I start singing for Studio _One._ The first song [was] "Water More Than Flour", and I did this album, _Truths And Rights.'_

The album is one of the outstanding LPs to come from Studio One in this period. Its emotionally charged vocals are delivered with a great depth of feeling, yet Johnny insists his lyrics were sung spontaneously. 'Most of these songs just come in my mind and I sing them – I don't even write them up. Sometimes I might have to sing a song today and I don't know what I'm going to sing about, but by the time I reach the studio a song just come right in me. These are not songs that I sit and write – it's more like an inspiration.'

Many of these songs addressed topical social issues and spiritual matters. 'Forgive Them', a Studio One single delivered in searing falsetto, asked the Almighty to forgive those engaged in political violence. 'That time I used to love to sing Earth, Wind and Fire, the Delfonics, the Temptations, the Miracles and the Stylistics, so I had to learn that sort of falsetto,' Osbourne says. 'I went back to Jamaica ten years after [I left] and I saw that politics get to be a bigger thing, the order of the day. People are killing each other who grew up together, taking different sides like they didn't know each other, so I'm saying "Forgive them, they know not what they do." 'Of equal gravity was 'Purify Your Heart', cut for Winston Riley in 1981; the song attacked a form of religious hypocrisy. 'That's about the same thing: you have to make sure that you are right before you can tell somebody else they'r e not right. Sometimes I could see some Christians separate themselves from people who are not into their faith. If you'r e a Christian and I'm not in your religion and then you don't embrace me, I figure you'r e not doing the right thing.'

In addition to providing backing vocals on other Studio One material Johnny Osbourne played harmonica on certain notable tracks, including the extended mix of 'Mr DC, Osbourne had previously played harmonica on Black Uhuru's 'Love Crisis', as he had been friendly with Prince Jammy in Canada; the pair would later create the strong _Folly Ranking_ album after Osbourne left Studio One in late 1980. 'Jammys is a friend of mine,' the singer emphasizes. 'When I come back to Jamaica I had to be with Jammy, so we just started making some music'

The departure of Sugar, Freddy and Johnny from Dodd's camp made way for the arrival of Earl 'Sixteen' Daley, a mellifluous tenor who had already cut plenty of inspired material. 'I started out at Waltham Park Road where I grew up, on the street corner, hanging out at night,' Earl says with a grin. 'At the age of thirteen I started getting into Chi-Lites, James Brown music. Dennis Brown was like a role model for us.'

After singing in various talent contests Earl formed the Flaming Phonics with some school friends. 'Sundays was audition days at Treasure Isle. Duke liked one of the songs. We tried to start recording and Duke started letting off gunshots – we didn't get round to voicing it, because we didn't want to go back. With Herman Chin-Loy we did "Hey Baby", but Jamaica wasn't really ready for four guys, like a Four Tops kind of thing – they were into U Roy and King Stitt.'

When the group went their separate ways, Earl Sixteen started recording on his own. 'The first solo recording that I did was for Phonso [Alphonso Bailey], his label is Globe International. I had this schoolmate called Winston MacA-nuff, he wrote "Malcolm X". He asked me to follow him into the studio one day, me and Franklyn Waul, "Bubbler". Winston had already laid some tracks at Joe Gibbs, so we did "Malcolm X" first there. That was the first song that Franklyn actually recorded. A couple months afterwards we didn't hear it come out, so we went to Derrick Harriott and did it for him as well with a couple of other songs. When Derrick went to press "Malcolm X" we find out that Joe Gibbs actually was pressing "Malcolm X" on a white label, only for export, so it kind of cramped our thing.'

Around the same time, in 1975, Earl replaced Tinga Stewart as lead singer in the Boris Gardiner Happening. 'It was really strenuous,' he recalls. 'You had to do all the current songs in the charts – calypso, soul, reggae – because a road band is like cabaret. Boris was a proper musician... I was really impressed with him and I kind of fell in love with the whole scene. Me, Boris Gardiner and Errol Walker was the three main singers. Keith Sterling was playing keyboards, we had Willie Lindo on guitar, Paul Douglas on drums. I was so thrilled being involved – these guys were stalwart musicians – but I started getting influenced into Rastafarianism, started growing my locks, and Boris fired me. They had a big nurses' ball at the Oceana Hotel and Boris goes, "You have to trim your hair, you have to be clean for this gig." I just went up there with my stretch-foot trousers and my Clarke's [shoes], looking good with my tarn on my head and a couple of locks hanging out. Everybody was dressed up in long floral gowns – it was a proper, formal ball and I was in my rough-neck pants. After that gig Boris went, "I'm sorry, you have to go. We probably won't get this job again." Then I started working for Scratch.'

Following a handful _of_ sides for the Upsetter, including the heartbroken 'Cheating' and declaratory 'Freedom', Earl became more spiritually oriented, which drew him towards Augustus Pablo. 'After working with Perry I got really into smoking the raw weed, going really ital. That's when I starting hanging out with Pablo, 'cause Pablo was really into the ital stuff. He was busy working with Hugh Mundell, Delroy Williams, Norris Reid, Tetrack, so I had to wait. I'v e only done two songs for Augustus Pablo, "Changing World" and "Rastaman Is A Peaceful Man" – we did it for a guy called Maxwell Lynch. I met Pablo through Hugh Mundell, but everything that I did was through Boris. Boris Gardiner's really a great person. Mundell and all these guys lived around him and there was all these producers coming up to get him to do sessions, because he was one of the best. Apart from Lloyd Parks, Boris could write music, so he was essential.'

Earl Sixteen's debut album, the hastily voiced _Shining Star,_ was produced by Earl Morgan of the Heptones. 'I met Heptones through Perry at the studio. He got some rhythms which he'd acquired from Lloyd Parks and a couple people, and he was coming to England and said, "If we do a couple songs, we could try to get a deal for you and make some money." 'Sixteen's second set, the Mikey Dread production _Reggae Sounds,_ also drew mixed results. 'I got involved with Mikey about 1980 [when] I used to hang out at Aquarius during the day. He put out a couple singles in Jamaica which didn't really come out too good, because they weren't really ready for Mikey Dread's stuff. He was working at Tubby's , trying to update it, using soul with a lot of guitars. It wasn't really ready for Jamaica, but it was working in England.

'After the Mikey Dread stuff I started working between Pablo and Yabby You, because I was doing backing vocals for Yabby. I wanted to do some tunes for Junjo, because Junjo was kicking in '82-'83 – he was really stinging. I used to go to Channel One, even ended up doing a few songs for Joe Joe Hoo-Kim. I didn't really do any songs for Junjo, but I was there with him. Then Linval Thompson came along and I did a few songs for Linval. After that, I thought I'm going to go and do some work with Studio One, because I got to find out that all the tracks that Channel One do was Studio One's tracks – they made them over. So I don't think I should really work on a copy when I can work on the actual stuff

Earl Sixteen's most significant Jamaican work was thus recorded at Studio One. 'Donald Hossack, my schoolmate from long time, wrote a song for me and goes, "Let's go down to Coxsone one Sunday and see if he would be interested in it." We waited around a couple of Sundays, until Coxsone noticed us sitting under the tree. I reach about three verses and he goes, "Where's the chorus in the song? You haven't got a punch line. You have to rewrite that song, you'r e wasting my time... I'l l tell you what, I like your voice", and he gave me about ten seven-inches. "What you should do, listen to these versions and write some songs, because you could sing on the rhythm." I practised up: "Fight It To The Top" [aka "Heptones Gonna Fight"] was one of the famous rhythms in Jamaica, but nobody really had any other covers of it at the time.'

The end result was 'Love Is A Feeling', a song that Sixteen had previously cut elsewhere but which became another Studio One anthem. 'Coxsone goes to me, "Earl, I'v e never told anybody this, but that song 'Love Is A Feeling', I pressed it 'til my hands were weak. I run out of labels trying to press that tune." 'Also highly popular on sound systems was 'No Mash Up The Dance', a single Sixteen voiced on the 'Peanut Vendor' rhythm;) both hits helped maintain Coxsone's profile in the early 1980s.

On the international scene, Island continued to issue challenging reggae. A deal with King Sounds brought Grove Music material produced by Yabby You to Island, distributed by EMI in 1979-80, including Tony Tuffs self-titled debut LP, Yabby's own _Jah Jah Way,_ and, best of all, Michael Prophet's _Serious Reasoning._ 'Yabby You in a class by himself,' Prophet says. 'That Ras there a very strong Ras, and you have to be strong to deal with man like Yabby You: headstrong, rootically strong, biblically strong, physically strong. When I meet up with Yabby You, it's like all hell break loose. It was actually three of us. We grew up together and were going to deal with a group, but when Yabby You hear my voice he know I don't need no backing. I usually at all of the studio them in Jamaica, seeing if I can meet a [producer] and I get a lot of let down. One day I was coming from Sonic Sounds and, passing Channel One, I see Zebby, he control Channel One gate, and Zebby tell me, "Yabby You a work with Wayne Wade, Patrick Andy and Alric Forbes." Yabby You have 'nuff music out there. "Conquering Lion" a wicked sound, his bass line is just different from any other producer's , so me go in there and confront him.

'The first lyrics that I ever write was "Praise You Jah Jah". He say, "Yeah, you have any more?" and me just continue singing. Him say I must pass by him yard up Waltham Park Road and we start to do rehearsals. The first time we go to the studio we voice "Fight It To The Top", but to me "Praise You Jah Jah" is bigger, because it's a self-contained tune. It's from the belly, the heart, the earth.' The album's other outstanding tracks include 'Love And Unity' (aka 'Mash Down Rome') and 'Turn Me Loose', which appeared on the soundtrack of the film _Babylon,_ a London sound system drama starring Aswad's Brinsley Forde.

The Wailing Souls' _Wild Suspense,_ released by Island in 1979, brought the group to the attention of wider overseas audiences. After their success at Channel One the quartet sought greater independence by forming the Massive label, scoring further self-produced hits with the Revolutionaries. 'We went to collect some funds off of a previous song, but feel we weren't dealt with justifiable,' says Garth Dennis, 'so we decide to get some studio time for the money and we produced "Bredda Gravalicious".'

'The big man keep getting bigger, the poor man keep getting poorer,' says Bread. 'Him have everything and him still want more, so that is "Bredda Gravalicious". We did that for ourselves, then two guys from Island records came and offered us a proposition, and that was _Wild Suspense._ Some of the horns was done in Jamaica, with Dean Fraser and them man there, and another set of the horns was done in England with Rico Rodriguez, Vin Gordon, Bobby Ellis.'

The overdubbed horns gave the album a strong contrast to the original Massive single releases. Its rhythmic cohesion came courtesy of Sly Dunbar, who developed a number of notable new beats around 1978: the introduction of 'Bredda Gravalicious', for instance, had an augmented military drum roll known as 'Sly Tackle', whilst the drumming of 'Row Fisherman' was meant to imitate the sound of a dribbling basketball.

The extended hit singles 'Old Broom' and 'Sugar Plum Plum', issued by Island in the UK in 1980, were highly popular tunes produced by Sly and Robbie. Pipe recalls the mixed reaction to such ballads. ' "Sugar Plum Plum" was a number-one hit all over, but when I write love songs people say Wailing Souls gone soft – that's why I always write about protesting. With the name Wailing Souls we were thinking about lost souls crying out in the wilderness, so those kind of music make people recognize Wailing Souls, but whenever we do a love song it build a boom too.' A planned album, to be produced by Sly and Robbie, was unfortunately left unfinished after disputes arose.

Pablo Moses also had forward-facing roots material issued by Island in this period. Moses' second album, the 1980 set _A Song,_ was as contemplative as his debut. _Pave The Way,_ released the following year, had a futuristic sound built on a metallic bass and drum from Val Douglas and Mikey Boo, spiced by synthesizer licks from Peter Ashbourne. ' "A Song" itself was partially a vision, a dream,' says Moses of the imaginative title track. 'The rest I put together in a yard, under this pear tree. I put a bench underneath it and I would sit there and practise, and people from the street couldn't see me. It was like a little hide-out – I would smoke my herb round there. That corner gave me three albums: _Revolutionary Dream, A Song_ and _Pave The Way. Revolutionary Dream_ was more aggressive, pretty, and _A Song_ was more _of_ a spiritual connection within a cultural way. _Pave The Way_ was a combination of both of them, with aggression and a spiritual, cultural connection. I try to name each album making a statement along the way, like _Revolutionary Dream:_ "I'm a revolutionary dream that came"; in order to deal with the revolution, I bring _A Song_ with many songs; in order to get through the revolution, you have to _Pave The Way.'_ But later arguments between Island and Geoffrey Chung led to Pablo Moses being dropped by Island, despite the critical acclaim awarded to both _A Song and Pave The Way._

Meanwhile, the Roots Radics band was gaining a higher profile abroad. The contract that Junjo signed with Greensleeves meant his LPs were widely distributed in the UK and USA (the latter through a link with folk label Shanachie), introducing the sounds of the Roots Radics and the evolving Jamaican dancehall to a whole new audience from 1980.

Certain elements of the Roots Radics sound remained constant from the band's inception: their material was always constructed to make the most _of_ Flabba's meaty bass lines and Bingy Bunny's reliable rhythm guitar. Early on, percussionist Christopher 'Sky Juice' Blake helped give the Radics a readily identifiable sound with plenty of accentuated wood-block and cow-bell beats, in contrast to Sticky's preference for graters and shakers and Skully's reliance on the conga drum and tambourine. Occasional horns from saxophonist Dean Fraser, trombonist Ronald 'Nambo' Robinson and trumpeter Chico Chin assisted the creation of a fuller sound; the three were taught their craft by Babe O'Brien of the National Volunteers organization, and were an integral part of Lloyd Parks' We The People band at Joe Gibbs' studio. Once the Roots Radics line-up had solidified in the early 1980s, Style Scott's tight drumming, often making use of Syndrums, helped propel the sound forward, given a modern complement by Sowell's effects-laden guitar and offset by Steelie's trilling organ and piano, greatly inspired by Jackie Mittoo's style at Studio One.

Sugar Minott was among the first to make use _of_ this crew on 'Hard Time Pressure', a blistering recut of Hopeton Lewis' 'Sounds And Pressure', ' "Hard Time Pressure" was just growing up in Maxfield Park,' Minott explains. 'I live amongst people who used to rob banks and betting shops just to feed people, not because they want to rob. I used to run from police every day of my life, duck from gunshot every day of my life, so these were the things coming out in the music. I record that at Channel One, the first time that Style Rotterdam played drum on, and Steelie. Jammys mixed it.'

Mikey Dread, who worked solidly with the Roots Radics from 1980, was one _of_ the first to showcase Steelie's piano skills on an instrumental cut of 'Jumping Master'; the song was highly influential on the ruling style of the day. 'Me built 'nuff of me original t'i ng with Sly, Horsemouth, Bagga Walker, 'nuff Studio One musicians,' says Dread, 'and later on me just work with the Radics, because me and Style were very close friends, as well as me and So well. That time those guys want a recognition, because Sly and Robbie was the only name people. Nobody know Flabba Holt nor Style, but they had played on "Just Like A Sea", and I asked the producer who were the musicians, and them carry me and introduce me to the man there. Them guys would come to my house, and they'd hear the songs we wanted to make, and we were waiting on the right time. One night we go to a dance, and we decide say, "We going to lick some tunes right now." Sly had this "Drunken Master", and me say me going to do something else wickeder than that, and me just go inna the studio and try something, and it just magic, it just wicked. Me say that one there a the "Jumping Master", and me voice it like that. Me run into Bunny Wailer at the mastering lab and him say, "A who play them rhythm there?" The next thing me know, it's "Rock And Groove": Bunny gone jump 'pon the same vibes.'

Like Dread's 'Jumping Master' and 'Break Down The Walls', Sowell Radics' 'All Night Jammin' also surfaced on the UK branch of DATC, distributed in 1981 by independent punk company Rough Trade and boosted by airplay on the Northwest London sound system Jah Observer. 'Sugar Minott was supposed to help him get it out,' say Dread of the tune, 'but Sugar never do it, so me just do it and make sure Sowell have some money.'

Sowell left the Roots Radics shortly after, opting to stay in England after the band's first tour with Gregory Isaacs, whom the Radics backed for a series of exceptionally successful early 1980s' LPs including _The Lonely Lover, Night Nurse_ and _Out Deh!._ He was replaced by Dwight Pinkney of Zap Pow, whose lead licks gave subsequent material a more aggressive edge. 'We went to England two times with Gregory Isaacs,' Flabba explains. 'The first time in about 1981, we bring Sowell for some show at the Rainbow. We leave him there because he say him not ready to go home. We used to rehearse up by Zinc Fence [at] Ripon Road, and Dwight come in and say, "You want a lead guitarist." '

As with much early dancehall work, Junjo's Radies-backed hit material was typically a mixture of love songs and protest music. Junjo was the next to make material of consequence with Michael Prophet after the singer broke away from Yabby You; though 'Gunman' was their biggest hit collaboration, 'Here Comes The Bride' was also highly popular. 'After leaving Yabby You, I start to jump around.' Prophet explains, 'because you have to eat food as artists. I do tune for Niney and Sugar Minott, Winston Riley. I produce my own self as well, me and a next guy, with [Minnie Ripperton's ] "Loving You". Through Junjo is like a ghetto man – the ghetto king – Junjo just started producing, so he draw for me. "Hold On To What You Got" was the first tune, and then me do "Here Comes The Bride". "Gunman" is a thing whe really happen to me. They robbed me, and that's why "Gunman" never die, because it's a history song.'

Similarly, younger singers like Little John and Barry Brown, taken in from Sugar Minott's Youth Promotion concern, mixed romance with tales of 'sufferation'; Johnny Osbourne's biggest hits for Junjo were songs of failed romance, such as 'Ice Cream Love' in 1981 and 'Yo Yo' the following year, but he was also cutting material for the producer that reflected the hard realities of ghetto life. As Osbourne notes, 'Sometimes you'r e recording for a producer and maybe he's channelling his music for a particular area, trying to make songs that suit where he think his market is. He's going to send these songs to some [company] in England, and England always love a lover's [tune], so "Ice Cream Love" was the first song I made for Junjo, hoping that he wanted a direct lover's song for the winter.'

Junjo also coaxed the best from Yellowman (aka Winston Foster), the phenomenally successful albino deejay, and Eek A Mouse (aka Ripton Hilton), an inordinately tall man who developed an individual take on the sing-jay style by interjecting scat-vocal nonsense between his verses. Greensleeves became the hot label for reggae in the early 1980s, and Junjo their top producer. The label also brought the mixing skill of Scientist the broader attention it deserved.

Scientist took dub into a whole other dimension in this era. He had a way of isolating Flabba's Holt's bass, as heard on albums such as _Scientist Meets Lite Roots Radics;_ he also made use of the test-tone in a highly creative and artistic manner, as heard on _Scientist Meets The Space Invaders._ 'If you ever watch _Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea,_ you hear that kind of a test tone, and you hear a echo behind it,' Scientist explains. 'That's where I got that from.' _Scientist Rids The World Of The Evil Curse Of The Vampires,_ supposedly mixed at Midnight one Friday the 13th in 1981, not only had plenty of EQ manipulation, ghostly echoes of drumbeats and squealing tape-winding effects, but was also given a liberal dose of shrieking zombie sounds. On the wonderful series of dub LPs he mixed for Junjo Lawes, Linval Thompson, Roy Cousins, Al Campbell, Mikey Dread, deejay-turned-producer Jah Thomas, Blacka Morwell and others, Scientist created what many believe are the last true 'classical' dub albums cut in Jamaica, most making use of the talented Roots Radics.

'I was doing a lot of unorthodox things at the time,' he recalls, 'things that a lot of people didn't approve _of._ Junjo had gotten lucky with me, so he allowed me to explore whatever's in my head. I did improve the sound in Tubby's studio and I started to do a lot of stuff Tubbys didn't even do on his own console. Then everybody started to ride the bandwagon. Bunny Lee used to record at Channel One and come to Tubby's to mix, and I did quite a few Pablo tracks with Hugh Mundell. I become the person round there, got very close with his family – the whole neighbourhood thought I was Tubby's son. Tubbys had given me my own set of keys to open and close the studio – he would barely come around himself. He come to the studio late, collect a little money. I was the person running the whole business.'

Though Scientist continued to mix at Tubby's as late as 1983, by 1981 he was engineering live recordings at Channel One, despite first encountering a familiar reluctance to employ him. 'I wanted to get experience in live sessions, because Tubby's was only a four-track place, really to do voice-overs. The same thing followed me everywhere: when I went to Channel One they thought I was a spy for Tubbys, because a little after I went there Tubbys started building his twenty-four-track. Back in those times, I could barely get a session; you had Soljie, Bunny Tom-Tom and Barnabas. Ernest Hoo-Kim was running the studio. Joe Joe was in New York, and he wanted that sound for himself, so Joe Joe would come down and he was pretty much the only one using me. I start engineering Yellowman _[Mad Over Me]_ and all that stuff that Joe Joe produced. I tightened up things at Channel One. I was the one who pioneered that type of a drum-and-bass sound down there with Viceroys _[We Must Unite]_ and Michigan and Smiley, "Diseases" rhythm. I did some Gladiators down there and Don Carlos too.'

Up in New York, Joseph Hoo-Kim opened the Hit Bound manufacturing plant in Long Island City in 1982; his J and L record shop closed the following year. When in Jamaica, he continued to shape the sound at Channel One. 'When Scientist mix down,' he explains, 'we begin to re-echo the tapes. After he mix, we run the four tape machines, echoing right along with the master tape.' The technique can be heard on albums such as _Showdown Volume 3,_ featuring Don Carlos and the Gladiators.

Soljie Hamilton helped keep Channel One material hot in the dancehall in this period. After mixing an early dub album for Sly and Robbie he instigated what was easily Sammy Dread's biggest hit, the dancehall anthem 'Ml6' (aka 'Bushmaster'). ' "Ml6" wasn't a tune that really voice for a record,' the singer reveals. 'It was a dub plate. Soljie come to me one day in the studio and said, "I'm going to Oracabessa, a dancehall four-sound clash." He tell me he want a tune to go and kill some sound in the dance. He was playing a lot of rhythm, but from [when] I hear the rhythm named "Scandal" I was thinking nobody never sing on that rhythm before – the only man who was on that was U Roy. When Soljie run the rhythm I say, "Bad boy a fire Ml6, policeman a fire AK47..." That's how "Ml6" really come.'

'Ml6' related the frightening array of firearms displayed on Kingston's streets; 'Roadblock', his other big hit for Channel One, drew on Marley's description _of_ being stopped for herb. 'When police and soldier blocking the place and you can't come out, curfew, Bob Marley did have a tune named "Three O'c lock Roadblock". I say I could go around this tune, because this is what going on, so I just said, "They call me Sammy Dreadlocks, and me no want fi run up in a roadblock", and it was a number one tune.' The eventual _Roadblock_ album, issued in 1982, had a forceful dancehall-style Soljie mix that emphasized drum and bass.

As the grassroots producers of Greenwich Farm, Waterhouse and Three Mile were doing their best to usurp the popularity of Joe Gibbs and Channel One, more deejays began recording at Studio One as part of a general trend on the island, making way for new styles and youthful talent. Increasingly, the deejays came to wield a more important role in determining the fashion of the moment.

The rough edges of Tappa Zukie's dancehall-oriented early work held some of the first portents of a significant shift in the dominant deejay style. As the 1970s gave way to the 1980s, such stylistic shifts were becoming more dramatically pronounced through the emergence of a younger set of dancehall performers that included Welton Irie, Prince Mohammed and Lui Lepke. One of those who made the most impact was a toaster who went by the name of the Lone Ranger. Nowadays a resident of the United States, Ranger sometimes returns to Kingston to record. Born Anthony Waldron in 1958, he lived in Whitfield Town until he was five, when he joined his parents in Tottenham, North London, where his mother had found work as a nurse. He returned to Jamaica in 1971 and attended the Vauxhall drama school, after which he became heavily involved in various Kingston sound systems. 'You have Merry Soul first and Yard Sound,' Ranger says. 'Then I step up to Soul Express in Franklyn Town, and from that I went to Soul To Soul, a big uptown sound. Being on that sound, I was more in the limelight than down the ghetto.'

Through chatting on the mike at sound system events Ranger voiced his first records as part of a harmony group called the I-fenders, formed with future promoter Chester Synmoie and another friend. 'The first song I sung was "Anne Marie", we voice it at Treasure Isle. But the deejay thing was stronger, so about '77 I was doing one and two deejay tunes.' His style developed through a constant exposure to sound system events: 'Going to school, my favourite deejay was U Roy, Jah Youth, Jazzbo. When I get my lunch money from my mum, instead of going to buy a lunch, we go downtown and buy records – the latest records hide in my school bag. With deejay lyrics, I was very well adapted. I play the sound, hold the mike and I can deejay twelve different records straight. Them say it sound good, so me take it serious.'

His big breakthrough came in 1979, with a song about a vampire from a popular television series. 'By '79 I was at my peak with Soul To Soul, and I did a tune named "Barnabas Collins". Through I grow up in England I used to watch _Dark Shadows,_ so me just write something off of it. It was my first international hit: that tune gave me a tour throughout Europe two times – within the space of one month, they request me back again. Then I went back into the studio, did another number one tune named "Love Bump".'

'Love Bump' is a typical example of Lone Ranger's dancehall-oriented style; to keep the momentum flowing, he spices up his lyrics with plenty of trademark exclamations such as 'ribbit' and 'oink', as though in imitation of a frog or pig. The style would be adapted by many of the next generation of deejays, most notably by Yellowman, perhaps the most successful deejay of all time; it was specifically the use of such exclamations and other nonsense words that contributed to his early rise on hits like 'Mad Over Me', 'Jack Sprat' and 'Zungguzungguguzungguezeng'.

A gradual series of other hits resulted from Lone Ranger's fertile association with Studio One; most of the material was cut before 'Love Bump', but Dodd was slow to issue it. 'Me have a friend named Tony Walcott, a good friend of Coxsone who have a whole heap of dub plates. Every Sunday him come from church and put on this "Strictly Rub A Dub" rhythm and tell me fi deejay. One Sunday he told me we have to meet somebody, and that person happens to be Mr Dodd. We went up to Studio One and voice tunes like "Three Mile Skank" and "Answer Me Question", then we do the _Other Side Of Dub_ album and _Badda Dan Dem.'_ The latter is more representative of Ranger's talent, with outstanding examples including 'Automatic', relating the tale of Garvey's betrayal over Johnny Osbourne's magnificent 'Truth And Rights', and the boastful 'Badda Dan Dem', cut on the 'Shank I sheck' rhythm.

It was in this period that Ranger left Soul To Soul. 'Soul To Soul is owned by a policeman,' Ranger details, 'a big-time superintendent, and he was having problems with his job. They were putting pressure on him, saying he can't deal with the sound and the police force, so he wasn't able to keep up with the sound. I decide to move on and went to Virgo.' In 1980 Virgo was awarded the accolade of best sound system of the year, its prestige greatly enhanced by Ranger's presence.

While Lone Ranger's style was increasingly being adapted by upcoming dancehall deejays he maintained his top position by a further string of hits for other producers, beginning with the Jamaican chart smash 'Rosemarie', a loose adaptation of Ray Charles' 'Girl Next Door' cut for Winston Riley. 'Back in them days, there was a stiff competition,' he explains. 'You had a lot of deejays around, like General Echo, Michigan and Smiley and Eek A Mouse, and each one was in the chart, so I do "Rosemarie" for Techniques. Then I was with Channel One with "The Big Fight", a tune by me and Welton Irie, then we did "Johnny Too Bad" and "Loving Arms", and all these tunes went into the chart. A couple other tunes from Coxsone start to come out, like "Strictly Rub A Dub", so I had one tune at number one, one at number two, one at number seven – about five tunes in the charts. That's when I did a show in the States at Madison Square Gardens.'

That Lone Ranger would appear at such a prestigious American venue showed that dancehall was set to run things in the early 1980s, as the international roots fervour began to wane. When major record labels ceased to promote reggae abroad, Jamaican musicians and producers became somewhat less fixated with the outside world and the music entered another introspective phase.

Under Mi Sleng Teng: Bringing Dancehall to the Brink of Digital

_You have to go with the time if you want to eat food. If you want to earn a living from the music, you have to do whatever is going on today. In the early seventies we used to do live music. Then we just want to experiment, so we did something with the 'Sleng Teng' and it changed the whole scene.... 'Sleng Teng' was the big hit that made everybody switch over._

Prince Jammy

_Reggae music is the only music in the world that every nation relate to. If them don't understand the lyrics, at least the rhythm gets to their mind, their heart–it penetrates._

Cocoa Tea

AT THE START of the 1980s, the emerging dancehall style gave Jamaican music a bold new focus. As dancehall rapidly captivated the island, a host _of_ new stars began to appear in its light. The more versatile of Jamaica's roots artists also found their way to it; though the fonn was largely about fresh blood, a number of veterans regained significant glory by rolling with the changes in style, even if such transitions were not always executed smoothly.

For instance, Junjo Lawes successfully rejuvenated the Wailing Souls' status when 'Firehouse Rock' was a huge hit on both sides of the Atlantic in 1981, but Lloyd 'Bread' McDonald says the group was initially reluctant to work with him. 'Them time Junjo just come,' he recalls, 'and most of the product wasn't all that professional. We say, "Junjo, you come and put all ten man on one track, we no deal with that – a creativity we deal with." We had an association with Greensleeves, which is one reason why we even did things with Junjo. We said, "If anything, Junjo can't play any tricks 'pon we", and it work out to be one of the best associations we ever have with a producer. Junjo was the first producer we could check any time, night or day. He has good ideas and would make good recommendations. We ended up doing five albums [together].'

John Holt, too, benefited from an association with Junjo: 'Sweetie Come Brush Me' was a big hit in 1982 and 'Police In Helicopter', which described the drastic anti-ganja measures enacted by Seaga in conjunction with US President Ronald Reagan's 'war on drugs', was an international smash in 1983. That same year, Junjo established the Volcano sound system at his base in Myrie Avenue, a busy patch of the ghetto near the industrial junction of Three Mile; the sound system kept Junjo and the Roots Radics at the height of popularity in Jamaica.

Junjo's associate Linval Thompson also created an impressive series of hits with vocalists whose careers had been well established when young Linval was still wearing short pants. Johnny Osbourne rocked the dancehall with 'Kiss Somebody' in 1981; Freddy McGregor topped the charts with the harmonious 'Big Ship', and the Viceroys made an impact with 'We Must Unite' in 1982; the Meditations conquered America with 'No More Friend' in 1983. 'I never feel no way,' Thompson says when asked if it felt strange to be producing such legendary artists. 'It's just like a power and everything was hit. Greensleeves send for me. Everything was cool – they treat me good. When the Father give you a gift, nothing can stop you.'

At the same time, Thompson was voicing albums as a singer and continuing to record new artists. 'Everybody coming to me want to sing: Barry Brown, Wayne Wade, Rod Taylor, Sammy Dread. That time, nobody's talking about those artists.' Another group he worked with in his early days as a producer was Mystic I, a roots trio featuring Anthony Johnson, who later cut popular solo material. 'It's some guy in the ghetto [who] come from the same area, Kingston 13,' Thompson recalls. I hear the sound and I like the sound, so we record them.'

Despite his obvious drive and talent for facilitating hits, circumstances made Linval Thompson bow out of the production arena. 'The business kind of change,' he explains. 'Everything was getting down slow. It start from a Freddy McGregor album... a likkle problem money-wise. I also have a Tristan Palmer album, a Cornell Campbell album and an Al Campbell album from that time. Everything kind of get shaky, because I have so much album and no business, through money get tie-up, so we went to America. I had a couple good break: that time I get a family and still collecting royalties from Greensleeves, but nothing strong wasn't going on.'

In the early 1980s, changes in the social fabric of Jamaican society saw several leading perfomiers and producers drop out of action at their peak. On 22 November 1980, General Echo was killed by police when an unlicensed fireami was discovered in the car he was travelling in; I Roy described the incident as 'cold-blooded murder'. Robbie Shakespeare faced a charge involving ownership of an unlicensed gun the same year, whilst Gregory Isaacs served time in 1982, just as _Night Nurse_ was poised to make him the most popular reggae singer in the world. 'They transfer me from Harbour Street to Gun Count to General Penitentiaiy, when they charge I for two unlicensed guns,' Isaacs wearily explains. 'How the time did really a run, you had to protect yourself. That's the only reason I had them, not to do nothing.' This was by no means Isaacs' only conflict with the law: in 1982, Isaacs admitted he had already been arrested twenty-seven times.

The clamp-down on unlicensed weapons was partly a result of dwindling political patronage: Kingston's endemic violence was gradually becoming connected more to thievery and drug dealing than to political alignment. As the perceived need for 'tribalist' warfare decreased, the politicians faced a new challenge when their heavily armed 'enforcers' became involved in the cocaine trade. In the late 1970s cocaine appeared in the social circles of the uptown elite and at the hedonistic beach parties thrown by tourists in Negril; in the early 1980s Jamaica became a way-station for Colombian and Peruvian coke destined for North America. In 1984 alone, 130 pounds of cocaine was seized by the Jamaican police and a 45 million US dollar shipment intercepted by the Coast Guard. Within a few years the insidious presence of cocaine had drastic consequences on Jamaican society, with the music scene being particularly affected.

Politically and economically, the country was still highly unstable. In 1983 Edward Seaga called a snap election, which was boycotted by Manley as Seaga refused to update the archaic electoral register. His policy of 'Seaganomics', modelled on Ronald Reagan's 'trickle down' strategy in the USA, was a failure; his removal of price controls but refusal to raise the minimum wage put many basic goods out of the reach of most ordinary citizens, and another twenty thousand people joined the ranks of the unemployed. Huge IMF loans, which the government had difficulty repaying, resulted in the devaluation of the Jamaican dollar in 1984.

Such changes in the social landscape encouraged leading producers to leave the country as Jamaica entered another harsh phase. The killing of Prince Fari on 15 September 1983 was the final element that convinced Roy Cousins to emigrate to Liverpool for good. I went blind with cataracts and I divorce and remarried,' Cousins explains. 'Me there work with Fari and them kill him, and me just decide fi call it a day. Them kill him over a dance: they wanted to keep a dance and him give [a promoter] half of the money and owe him half, but [the promoter's ] woman mash up the dance the night, she have a fight, so Fari say him nah pay his other half of the money. Prince [is] one of the man who come through the system the hard way. Is a man who go to prison a Jamaica and certain things, and Jamaica is [about] survival. Edgewater him live, and him go home to water him garden, and the [gunmen] them a watch him, and as soon as him roll up the hose to go in, they go in with him. Them say everybody fi lay down on the floor, and I hear him lay down neatly, him don't put up any resistance, but him wife, she know the boy them, and she a put up resistance, and they shoot she first, but she never dead, and they shoot him, kill him like an animal. In the living room you see the blood with his fingermark all over the wall, when a person in agony.'

As an increasing number of artists and producers joined the exodus, expatriates living in New York began clamouring for a piece of the island's evolving dancehall action. The most consistent was Donovan Germain, who cut arresting material with Sly and the Revolutionaries for his Revolutionary Sounds label as the seventies gave way to the eighties. Germain made a strong impact in the USA and UK with a series of notable discs by Cultural Roots; the group was one of the last great harmony trios, showing that a roots sensibility need not be out of place with hard rhythms incorporating Syndrums. Germain's productions were usually marked by a particularly firm drum sound, with bright horn melodies, often arranged by Clive Hunt and Dean Fraser, an equally important component. Both can be heard on the Tamlins' 1982 hit 'Baby Love', a hard recut of the Sensations' rock steady classic from Treasure Isle. Germain would later become one of the island's leading producers after shifting his base of operations back to Kingston.

**Johnny Dollar: Roland Burrell at One Blood [David Katz]**

The Tanka label, also based in New York, made an initially greater impact in Jamaica in the early 1980s through a series of hits with singer Roland Burrell, but the label's glory was short-lived. Burrell was another who eased the shift away from harmony groups, raising the primacy of solo vocalists during the early dancehall period. 'I used to live down by Trench Town from [when] I was fourteen, but I born in Clarendon,' Burrell explains, leaning against the ital food counter that is part of Junior Reid's studio complex. Burrell says that during his early days in Kingston he sang informally with members of the Linkers. His professional debut came on Hugh Griffiths' 'Step It In Ballet', a minor hit produced by fellow singer 'Prince' Huntley.

'The first show we get, we mash it up, and people start want we,' Burrell recalls. 'Skateland, that's the second show we get, but before we go a Skateland, Hugh Griffiths say him want to sing alone, so me just start out 'pon me own and do a tune for Ansel Collins named "Working Man". Afterwards, a brother from New York come down by Channel One. Ansel Collins bring me to Tanka, so the first tune I sing for him was "Johnny Dollar".'

Tanka's bass-heavy cut of the oft-versioned tune, delivered with clarity by Burrell, captivated the Jamaican dancehall audience. 'It took off about two years in the dancehall before it came 'pon 45,' the singer explains. 'It never released down here yet. A dancehall sound man buy it 'pon dub plate and he just give [it to] Sly, and Sly put it out, and it took off. That tune really make my name. Afterwards, Channel One say they want to do a tune with me, so Tanka give them "Stomiy Night" and it gwaan good – in England, it number one. A next brother in New York named Sir Tommy, [fellow singer] Admiral Tibet do a All Star album for him and we start to do some more 45s. After we make three number one tune with Tanka and the _Johnny Dollar_ album, then he drop out – some misfortune thing go on, a set-up thing.'

While those musical entrepreneurs who were resident in the USA began to exert some influence on the sounds being made in Jamaica, a select few Jamaicans were using their time abroad just as constructively. Sugar Minott helped usher in the UK lover's rock craze in the early 1980s by cutting soul-oriented material with Jackie Mittoo; he also cut noteworthy discs in New York in 1983–4 at the Bronx studio run by Lloyd 'Bullwackie' Barnes. 'I was in Jamaica, struggling,' says Minott of 1980, 'and Roy Allen from Hawkeye records came to Jamaica. We make "Good Thing Going", an old American song [that] was a hit for Michael Jackson, the song start to sell in England big and I hit _Top Of The Pops._ Me figure me would catch a different vibes, so me just went to the studio, Easy Street. It was some guy playing rock – never hear reggae before. The first session at Easy Street, I did four hits.'

Minott says Jackie Mittoo was instrumental in shaping the overall feel of his work in this era. Jackie Mittoo was in Canada, playing in some hotel in a tux. When we had "Good Thing Going", I needed somebody who could just put everything together, so me say, "Jackie Mittoo is the teacher, that's the man." The album _Roots Lovers,_ some of it was done in New York, like "Penny For My Song", and even the horns, them overdub there. "My Heart Is True", Jackie Mittoo gave me that rhythm from Studio One. Coxsone gave him the rhythm and he gave it to me and was helping me right there, but Coxsone got jealous – he didn't like the alliance.'

Minott's most consistent New York connection turned out to be the Bullwackie's crew. 'My brother-in-law take me down to Wackies the first time I went to New York. Me see it was some poor people with some old raggedy stuff, so I figure what bad can I do if I help these people? I start making songs like "Herbman Hustling". [Assistant engineer] Douglas Levy, he produced that rhythm.'

Like 'Oh Mr DC, "Herbman Hustling' was a depiction of those who deal in ganja to survive. The original New York version is slow and languorous, but it was the fast-paced version that Minott subsequently voiced for Sly Dunbar in late 1984 that helped steer Jamaican music into another direction, as the rhythm of the Jamaican version (based on Don Drummond's Studio One instrumental 'Heaven-less') was created with a keyboard bass and Oberheim DMX drum machine, and no guitar or other live instrument in sight. 'That's the first computerized rhythm in Jamaica,' Minott claims, 'Sly was the first man who had those machines. Sly was ahead of his town: even the bass, it's not bass playing. You put the bass inna the [keyboard], that's what he played – him alone play that rhythm. Nobody else could sing on it that day. When Sly start to play that, every singer buck, because it's one chord, too straight, go nowhere. You don't hear no other singing come on that rhythm, only Yellowman and Lui Lepke.'

Sly used a Roland 808 drum machine on record as early as 1983, initially to supplement his organic drumbeats; in 1984, he used various drum machines in conjunction with an electronic Simmons drum kit. 'I bought a 808 first, had it for a while,' Sly explains. 'I use the clap from the 808 to play on "Trouble You A Trouble Me" by Ini Kamoze. The same clap was on Dennis Brown, "Revolution". The 808 I only use [fully] on one song, Black Uhuru's "Somebody's Watching You". I start playing around, but on the same album _[Anthem]_ I use the Simmons: I had just bought it, came down to Nassau, took all night to get the sound. The drum machines I started using, I bought the DMX, then the [Synare] SP3. The DMX, I use it to play only a couple songs, because they didn't want me to use it as a drummer because they couldn't play my style, but I used it on "Herbsman Hustling" for Sugar Minott. Then I use it on "Taxi Connection". The action of the DMX was so true, like my action, that's why I loved it so much – a lot of people think I'm playing real [drums]. I didn't buy the Linn Drum; I liked it, but I preferred the DMX because of the sound, and the Linn Drum action was a bit stiff

With its synthesizer bass line and purely electronic rhythm, 'Herbman Hustling' was a startling predictor _of_ what would soon be the common form of Jamaican dancehall music. However, it is worth remembering that drum machines had long been a component of Jamaican popular music, though at first used only intermittently and with much less prominence. For instance, in 1974–5 both Bob Marley and Lee Perry used a primitive rhythm box on songs like 'So Jah Say', 'Dub Revolution' and 'Rainbow Country', but such equipment was used by them solely as a percussive element buried beneath the usual mix of live instruments. Augustus Pablo, too, used drum machines in the 1970s, typically during rehearsals, as did Family Man Barrett on some _of_ his productions.

Despite Minott's comments above, the first instance of a totally pre-programmed reggae rhythm created solely by synthesizers and drum machines dates at least as far back as late 1982, when Bunny Wailer collaborated with Marcia Griffiths on the dance number 'Electric Boogie'. Though the song was a major hit in Jamaica their efforts took time to find favour abroad, despite being issued on an extended twelve-inch by Island. 'A gig that I-Threes went to do in Toronto didn't turn out too wonderful,' Griffiths explains. 'I got maybe about 700 dollars, and I invested in a keyboard in Canada – a rhythm box – and it was the greatest buy I'v e ever made, because it had every single sound on it. I took it in the studio with brother Bunny, and Bunny was fascinated with the same sound that I loved, which was the piano playing the repeater sound, "nenga-nenga-nenga-nenga", so that was what we put down first on tape, and then the rhythm, "boom, baff, boom, bafF'. Bunny is a talented songwriter, and one of the greatest producers I know. He took that home in the country, and the following morning he came back with the song "Electric Boogie". The song was released coming up to Christmas in 1982 and it went straight to the number one spot, and ever since there was never a dead period of it not selling anywhere.'

As new electronic products sparked further rhythmic experimentation, other notable developments were taking place in the ground-level dancehall arena. Along with Frankie Paul, Jamaica's answer to Stevie Wonder, perhaps the biggest dancehall vocal artist to break in 1984 was Cocoa Tea. A tall singer with a distinct and slightly nasal tone, Tea brought something of a country intonation to his delivery. 'The difference between Cocoa Tea and most of the youth whe come from the town,' the singer explains, 'is because I am a country man, I bring this same country folk melody to town and sing. Me no change nothing, which is most unusual to people, so it always capture the mind, capture the people listening.'

**Electric Boogie: Marcia Griffiths [Horseman]**

Tea is in an unfinished building next door to Roaring Lion, the studio he opened some years ago near his home in a country town in Clarendon. He says he grew up in the same region. 'I was born and raised in Rocky Point, about six miles from here. Born 1959, raised by my mother alone, because my father migrated to America. I used to sing in choir from a tender age. Them time I couldn't really write a song, but I could sing like a songbird. It steps to a next level when I was about fourteen: my brethren used to rehearse together and them have a likkle group. As the Clarendonians was from this area they couldn't say Clarendonians again, so them call themselves the Rocky-donians – they were fishermen. Sang Hugh [aka Keith Morgan], he used to rehearse with us too. He's from Westmoreland, but his father, Bongo Son, was living in Rocky Point, so he came here as a young youth. After, he became famous [with] "Rasta No Born Yah". '

In his teens, when he was still known by his real name, Calvin Scott, Cocoa Tea got his first taste of studio recording after hooking up with popular singer Willie Francis. 'Willie Francis sang a song by the name of "Oh What A Mini", he became famous and make a transition from singing to producing. He used to come to the country a lot to eat roast fish at Rocky Point, so I became acquainted [with] him. We went into towm and [the group] did one song, and I did one song which was "Searching In The Hills" – Sang Hugh wrote that. We record it at Channel One, about 1974. Style Scott and Flabba Holt was a part of it.'

Unfortunately the song sank without a trace, despite being licensed to the independent Magnet label in England, and it was 'about eternity after that' when Tea next found himself in the studio. 'I run around for a while, trying to do other things: went to Caymanas Park, trying to be a jockey, but it was not really my job, so I came back to the country. Growing up, the responsibility thing start to dawn on me now. It's getting a little late, so you have to get yourself together, and I started to try my best to wnte a song – that is what I said to myself was my main objective. About 1980, I went back in the studio and did a song by the name _of_ "Summer Time" for myself, but [through] lack of promotion it never did anything, so I came back again with another song by the name of "Big Iron", a cover version of Marty Robbins. There was a record jury that time on the radio in Jamaica, and a man on the radio say, "Cocoa Tea? This one sound bitter like cerassee tea!" They throw it away and say it was no good.'

It was his command of the mike at sound system events that brought Cocoa Tea into the limelight a few years later, catapulting him to fame as the new star in Junjo Lawes' camp. 'AH sound systems that come to Rocky Point – Metro Media, Kilimanjaro, Socialist Roots, Sturgav, Black Harmony – I sing on all of them, so that's where I first link with Junjo. Me's a dancehall singer, and a dancehall singer who grow up in the dancehall them time you have to have on-the-spot lyrics. In those days you can't go in a dancehall and sing back a man's song like these youngsters do, you have to come original. I write lyrics and I am equipped with the ability to change my key, which is the most important thing in any music, so any rhythm you put on me sing 'pon it.

'I mash up the dancehall all over the place: [deejays] Peter Metro and the whole of them come, Josie Wales and Charlie Chaplin come and when them come in they'r e hot, [but] me mash up the dance [so] they can't hold no mike. I had a friend who had a girlfriend from Old Harbour by the name of Sonia, and him and Sonia got a big war, so that's why I went about writing a song named "Lost My Sonia" and every dance I draw that song, it mash up the place.

'When Volcano came to Rocky Point in December 1983, Lui Lepke, Lee Van Cleef, Toyan, Little John and all of them man say, "Cocoa Tea, you have to come to town and check Junjo." I went to Junjo in February on Myrie Avenue, start to sing a capella for Junjo. Josie Wales say, "Cocoa Tea, any man who sing and make me dance without rhythm must haffe bust in the business." The first studio Junjo took me to is Harry J. That's when I record the first song, "Who Are The Champion", then "Rocking Dolly". After that came the big hit, "Lost My Sonia".'

This material finally brought Cocoa Tea a similar status to that of other quintessential dancehall singers, putting him in the same league as Barrington Levy, the veteran Sugar Minott and contemporaries like Frankie Paul and Half Pint. Tea remarks that, although he became one ofjunjo's top artists, Junjo himself had little involvement with the creation of Tea's material. 'He just put the money up,' Tea insists. 'First time I was going to the studio he was there, but after that it was people like Steve and Bellow, Junjo's two right-hand man, whe do all of the business.'

In 1985 Junjo decided to shift his Volcano sound system and base of operations to New York, a move that would seriously curtail his career. 'Junjo did migrate and went to prison for a while,' Tea explains. 'That's why I say it's hard for people to really trouble hard drugs. Any time you trouble certain things, it mess you up. In Junjo's case, him getting in by distributing it, that's how he wind up in America. I don't know why – he never need it. The man had the world at his fingertips and just gave it away like that, so I move over to Corner Stone down a Greenv/ich Farm, Michael Chin. That man teach me about money management – he was like a father to me. I did two albums for him: _Mr Cocoa Tea_ and _Settle Down._ From there I went on to Jammy's .'

Corner Stone was one of the labels that spun off from Freedom Sounds as the seventies turned into the eighties; another was Church of Music, formed by Delroy McKoy around 1981. Once the bulk of Soul Syndicate had emigrated to California, Chinna Smith formed the High Times Players with bassist Chris Meredith and drummer Benbow Creary, and they became the favourite backing band of Greenwich Farm producers; Junjo Lawes and Prince Jammy also made use of their talents. As Chinna explains, 'The whole shotting [shooting] thing and the violence, some of the man decide say them go a foreign go live. Then everybody start branch off. Sly and Robbie start do them own thing and the industry start get selfish. Radics say them nah play with certain man. I realize the music kind of get a way, because no man want to work together again and everybody want to be them [own] producer, so me go downtown, have me record shop, and put together a little band called High Times Players. Junjo Lawes start come in, do some tunes for Yellowman like "Mr Chin". Jammys come back from Canada, me do some bad Dennis Brown for him too. We start do a series of show downtown, start get into our own production. Mutabaruka come in, do a wicked album, _Check It.'_

The High Times sound was marked by Chinna's tastefully melodic arrangements, which naturally made space for his expressive lead guitar and often incorporated jazz elements. Scientist specifically singled out the group for praise: 'The musicians that I love working with the most was High Times Players – I could just do what I want. As a result, they got the best sound.' This adaptability provided the perfect platform for the recorded work of Mutabaruka, who began setting his poems to music under Chinna's direction at Tuff Gong studio in 1981.

'Me know Chinna from just being around music,' Muta recalls. 'I did a show with Jimmy Cliff and he was the guitarist in Jimmy Cliffs band. He produced the first 45, then he produced the album. There is more people that is listening than reading, in Jamaica especially. In recording the poems, we get a wider audience and get to express ourselves more.'

Mutabaruka's vinyl debut was 'Every Time A Ear De Soun', depicting the alienation that Rastas experience in a chaotic society that perpetually rejects its African heritage, prefers the trappings of colonial culture and gives greater status to foreign disco music than to Niyabinghi drumming or dub. 'The inspiration comes from different sounds that you hear in your community,' the poet explains, 'different sounds that you hear around you: the gunshots, woman screaming, the news on the radio about the Russians and the Americans, things people say to Rasta. All of these is expressed very shortly in one poem, to try to make the people get a picture. Them say, "Comb your head, nasty dread", them say, "Drum and bass have no taste." All of these things is sounds, different sounds that you hear.'

The acclaimed _Check It,_ issued in Jamaica in 1982, established Mutabaruka's name outside Jamaica through its issue in the USA the following year on the independent Alligator label; the album contained forceful material that examined issues of identity and spoke out against racial inequality and imperialism. One of the disc's hardest-hitting numbers is 'Whiteman Country', a depiction of immigrant life in Britain. ' "Whiteman Country" is a poem inspired by the understanding that there was a lot of Jamaicans coming to England in the early sixties on the banana boat, because they were taught that England was a better place to live,' he explains. 'There was a time when England was colonizing Jamaica and most of the colonial people used to run to the colonial master country. When they come here, they realize that things was not really better than where they were coming from, so that poem was just reiterating that it's not good to stay in a white man's country, knowing that no matter what you do in Britain, you will always be from the Caribbean. That poem was telling black people in England, "Remember where you'r e coming from." '

Delivered without musical backing, 'Sit Dung Pon De Wall' spoke of the peculiar relationship between the wealthy and the destitute, with a rich man's fears noted by the eyes of a benign sufferer. 'There's a paranoia between the rich and the poor: poor people always want to be rich and rich people always feel that poor people will soon rise up against them. The rich man is watching the poor with his guns, having all these guards around his house, and the poor man is watching the rich, so it's a vice-versa thing, "I sit dung 'pon de wall, a watch him a watch me". In feeling that the poor is going to rise up against him, the rich man opens himself up to a whole lot of things that is not really there, paranoia... there is a thing about mad people in Jamaica walking the streets, where people is always feeling that a person [who] is mad don't understand what is going on, but really the world don't show me that. The "sane" people is the ones who make the guns, make the nuclear weapons, and they are paranoid that one day these things are going to explode.'

The High Times Players were also the first to back Frankie Paul on record. 'The first person to bring me into the studio is Earl Chinna Smith, in 1980,' the singer reveals during a late-night break from a London recording session. He is a pleasant man to interview, because he constantly bursts into song and often does dramatic impersonations of the characters who have helped him along the way. 'I used to live near to Tivoli Gardens and I went down there trying to find my school friend. This guy named Stucco heard me singing Larry Graham's "One In A Million" and he said, "Youth, you a waste your talent. Tomorrow morning, come check me." We went down to High Times, went on the beach, and I started singing the Larry Graham song again, and from that day a whole lot of things start happening. We went to Bob Marley's studio and I recorded one song, "The Rich And The Poor", an original.'

Frankie, born Paul Blake, says Chinna was also responsible for his stage name. 'They used to call me Singer Paul back in the days. When I went to High Times I was talking about Frankie Beverley and Frank Sinatra, so Chinna say, "Why we no call you Frankie Paul?" '

After Chinna's initial promotion of him, the singer began his gradual rise to fame. 'I perform on stage shows and sing in the streets while coming from school and big crowd draw – everybody know this goddam kid here. People say, "Me have some brethren at Maxfield Avenue. You ever hear about Channel One?" [Singer] Junior Tucker used to record at Channel One and Dennis Brown, so it just click to me.'

Brown was one of Paul's biggest influences, but it was a meeting with Stevie Wonder in his formative years that had the most direct impact. 'I was born in Kingston, but my parents originally came from Hanover. I used to live between Oxford Street and Oakland Park Road, downtown, Two Miles area. My mom used to keep dances and she used to do higglering, kept it going like a mother and father. From five years of age I went to the Salvation Army School for the Blind, in which I learned how to act and make my music skills better. 1978, Stevie Wonder brought a Braille copier for the school and it was a tremendous evening for all of us. I sang "I Can See Clearly Now", both of us together. Then, when I was fourteen, I went into a band called the Mighty Tides: all policemen, home guards, security, and me the only school kid in that band. I used to sing Tom Jones, "Blueberry Hill" and "Somewhere Over The Rainbow". It was in the Christmas era and I was in a play called _Tamberlaine The Mad Fowl,_ choreographed by Hortensia Lindsay from the School of Drama in Jamaica. I was a dog that got up and sang "Working My Way Back To You Babe". '

**Dancehall sensation Frankie Paul [Beth Lesser]**

After cutting early singles for various producers, Frankie recorded his first album, _Strange Feeling,_ in 1983. 'Winston Riley's niece Sandra was my girlfriend at the time,' he reveals. 'She brought me down to the shop and he wanted me to do an album.' Subsequent albums of equally high standard followed for Joe Gibbs, Channel One, Junjo Lawes and George Phang, a young man of high social standing in the Concrete Jungle ghetto who wanted to try his hand at record production. Though the Channel One set, shared with Sugar Minott, was the first to bring Frankie Paul to the attention of audiences outside Jamaica, the singer says it was junjo's _Pass The Tu-Sheng Peng,_ cut with the Roots Radics, that really boosted his career. 'When I did that Junjo album, it put me right where I wanted to be: number one, two, three, four in America, number one, two, three in Jamaica, number one, two, three in England.'

Of these top four hits, 'Worries In The Dance' and 'Dem A Talk Bout' reflected Paul's entrenchment in dancehall culture; 'The Prophet' was a spiritual number that drew from Dennis Brown; but the weed-smoker's anthem 'Pass The Tu-Sheng Peng' was the biggest and best of the bunch. Though Junjo brought Paul to the top of the charts, the singer recalls an initial wariness when approached by the producer. 'I was very scared working with Junjo at the time, because people that used to hang around Volcano sound was some dangerous coots, and then I didn't know who is who.'

While Frankie Paul was working with the Radics for Junjo, the High Times Players were providing the tight and exciting backing of Prince Jammy's emerging stable of stars. Jammy had spent the early part of the decade gradually becoming more self-sufficient as a producer. In the front room of his home at 38 Saint Lucia Road in Waterhouse Jammy installed a two-track machine for basic editing work; around 1982 he acquired a four-track and was then able to voice and mix on the premises. Such greater independence reaped fruitful rewards in 1983-4 through a number of lasting hits by aspiring Waterhouse singers Half Pint and Junior Reid.

Half Pint (aka Lyndon Roberts), a short teenager with a powerful voice, came to the producer's attention when he was asked to mix the singer's debut by John Marshall, an associate of Yabby You who had funded the recording with his partner, Errol Myrie. Recognizing the singer's potential, Jammy scored instantly with Pint's 'Money Man Skank', followed by 'Mr Landlord', 'Pouchie Lou' and 'One In A Million'. In 1985 Pint left Jammy's stable for further hits with Sly and Robbie, including 'Hold On', which described the uncomfortable nature of a love triangle; his biggest hit to date then came with 'Greetings', one of the pro to-digital beats that Sly and Robbie built for George Phang.

Junior Reid made his recording debut at the age of thirteen in 1979 for Hugh Mundell, who was then working with Augustus Pablo. Reid's One Blood studio, off a heavily congested Kingston thoroughfare that bisects ghetto neighbourhoods and industrial districts, is one of the spots on the island associated with the promotion of young talent, though plenty of veterans record there too and the central focus is Reid's own creations. As Reid became a follower of Prince Emmanuel Edwards some years ago, many of the people who hang out near the food counter wear the distinctive turbans that identify them as fellow 'Bobo Dreads'; it is a lively spot in the evening, with much protracted reasoning and general comradeship among those milling about.

Inside the small studio Reid is voicing a song called 'Propaganda', in reference to the 'official' burial recently given to the supposed remains of Haile Selassie in Ethiopia; the rhythm, over ten years old, was originally Reid's version of Michael Jackson's 'Dirty Diana'. The young Bobo taking the session looks no older than fifteen; as the mixing board has a chronic fault, he has to keep tapping it to make all the song's components audible. Despite the fact that large quantities of master tapes, piled high like columns, are wedged between the oversize mixing board and the room's constrictive walls, an assortment of dreads have crammed themselves into whatever space is left in order to observe the proceedings. The tensely charged Reid is like a man possessed, arms flailing around his thin but muscular frame as he bounces to the rhythm and pours out his mistrust of the Babylonian media. He is uncertain about some spontaneous lines and keeps dashing back into the mixing area to demand the opinion of the assembled onlookers; given pride of place is the deejay Big Youth, a close associate.

Eventually, when Reid is satisfied enough to take a short break, he speaks of early group work cut in 1982 for a London-based roots label. 'Robert and Michael Palmer, they was Negus Roots,' Reid explains. 'They used to live in Waterhouse, but they went to England and live, and [when] they come back down in Jamaica they want to work with me. They put out two singles, "If I" and "Sister Dawn". When they came back to Jamaica, they want to do a album. I was moving around with my friends them, they like singing, so we just say, "Why not name ourselves as a band, Voice of Progress? We did the album _Minibus Driver._ Then, when we were supposed to do the follow-up album, they was taking up a lot of studio time, screwing up things, so I just went back solo.'

**Refuting the Babylonian media:** **Junior Reid [David Katz]**

Jammy then cut dancehall hits with the singer, notably 'Boom Shack A Lack' and 'Higgler Move'; in Britain the strongest impact was made with the moving 'Jailhouse', released through North London sound system operator Ken "Fatman" Gordon on the KG Imperial label. This hit material, plus the album Reid cut for Jammy with the High Times Players, showed the singer establishing his own particular interpretation of the Waterhouse vocal style. Reid went on to record for Junjo, but it was after hooking up with Sugar Minott's Youth Promotion in 1984 that Reid cut his biggest hit: 'Original Foreign Mind', a perceptive take on the lure of immigration, rose high in the Jamaican charts and also made an impact on the growing American reggae scene. Reid was then drafted into Black Uhuru on Michael Rose's surprise departure, just after the group won a Grammy for _Anthem_ – the first such award for a reggae album. 'People start tell me you can fire or hire, so I just say forget this,' explains Michael Rose. 'From [when] it start reach them extremes there, I'm turned off.'

'I was asked to join Black Uhuru,' Junior Reid states with pride. 'It was a great time. I link up with Black Uhuru with a hit song, "Fit You Haffe Fit". 'Reid injected fresh energy into the group, particularly on live performances, but returned to his solo career in the late 1980s. He says he left the group 'due to music politics' more than anything else; his ominous description of events is a reminder that in their heyday Black Uhuru got greater international attention than any contemporary reggae act. 'After them kill Bob Marley, they never want nothing more so powerful,' Reid insists, 'and Black Uhuru was the next group to get big promotion behind, so they just try to mash up the whole reggae and keep it 'pon a level like how you see them have it now. So me just go forward solo.'

Some of the hit material that Half Pint and Junior Reid recorded for Jammy benefited from the hands of Scientist, who became so disgruntled with the state of affairs at Channel One that he left for the twenty-four-track Tuff Gong shortly afterwards, opting for the more peaceful environment of the complex at 56 Hope Road. 'Nobody really wanted to give me credit,' he grumbles, 'and I'm the only one down there with an electronic background, so if anything get damaged or not working properly I could get it to work some. Everybody getting jealous, because everybody older than me, but I am bringing stuff to the studio that they never did before. I went to Tuff Gong and the sound changed. Before, only uptown bands like Third World going to Tuff Gong, the hardcore dancehall thing was not being done at Tuff Gong. One of my strongest supporters there was Tristan Palmer, and then Early B. All of those dancehall people started going to Tuff Gong – Tuff Gong took away all the customers from Channel One. After that they closed down because they lost all their clientele.'

Joseph Hoo-Kim says Channel One's demise stemmed partly from his brother Ernest's departure from the music business. 'Ernest didn't like the confinement – he couldn't take being in the studio too much, so he began to operate gambling machines again. I bring Kenneth in the business, the same time with Frankie Paul, but it begin to get down when I and Kenneth didn't get along.'

Scientist says the atmosphere at Tuff Gong was initially more appealing than the one he had left at Channel One. 'Tuff Gong had Chow, a very good maintenance engineer – the studio was kept very good. Matter of fact, it was the most comfortable place I worked. Round at Tubbys and Channel One you have to deal with all the bad ghetto elements. When I went to Tuff Gong, I could finally breathe and just be an engineer.' Unfortunately, such tranquillity was not to last. 'I was at Tuff Gong about a year-and-a-half, didn't have to worry about too much of the gangster runnings, but some of the same elements started to come there because I carry that sound wherever I go... but I was fed up with the whole runnings, it was becoming too much of a rat race. I didn't feel the vibes, so I come to America in 1985. My sisters, my mother, everybody was living here.' Thus the last of the classical dub masters made his exit from Jamaica, and a notable decline in dub albums followed.

Meanwhile, other artists were taking reggae's liberating message even further afield. 'I'm the first artist to go to Japan, bringing sound system,' says Sugar Minott, ever in touch with the dancehall experience, 'and Sister Carol go over there and Frankie Paul. They didn't know that there was a thing called sound system – the first time we play, they put this little diagram in the magazine to show you how to hook it up. I have to be the selector at the same time, trying to teach some Japanese youth.' The impact of reggae on the Japanese consciousness was such that acts like the abstract instrumental group Mute Beat would eventually collaborate with the Jamaican artists who inspired them – a strong testimony to the transcendent qualities of a music that has crossed seemingly impenetrable social and linguistic barriers. 'Reggae music is the only music in the world that every nation relate to,' says Cocoa Tea. 'If them don't understand the lyrics, at least the rhythm gets to their mind, their heart – it penetrates.'

Ironically, it was a Japanese creation that brought indelible changes to Jamaican popular music at the start of 1985. The Casio company produced a number _of_ inexpensive keyboard instruments, including easily portable models with pre-set rhythms and built-in keyboard melodies. One such pre-set provided the blueprint for Wayne Smith's 'Under Mi Sleng Teng', a paean to the wonders of marijuana that would change the face of the Jamaican recording scene. Smith was another Waterhouse singer with a high tone; he started recording for Jammy in 1980 and was featured on mid-eighties' Channel One material. A friend, Noel Daley, had a Casio keyboard, and the pair discovered a pre-set that inspired Smith to write 'Sleng Teng', borrowing heavily from the phrasing and structure of Barrington Levy's 'Under Mi Sensi'. Smith took the concept to Jammy, who got session player Tony Asher to construct the rhythm with drum machines and synthesizers, using the pre-set keyboard melody for the bass line. When Jammy first aired the resultant song at a Kingston clash with Black Scorpio sound, pandemonium ensued; the sheer minimalism of the rhythm bore the portents of a new style, its syncopation particularly enthralling to the dancehall audience. On its release, 'Sleng Teng' caused shock waves all over Jamaica, and shortly afterwards, all over the world.

The repercussions of the spectacular success of 'Sleng Teng' were many and varied. The song immediately spawned countless recuts by raw hopefuls and seasoned talent alike; among the most noteworthy are 'Pumpkin Belly' by rising dancehall singer Tenor Saw and Culture's delirious 'Catch A Rasta'. The success of 'Sleng Teng' made Jammy's tiny studio a completely self-sufficient reality; with keyboards, sequencer and drum machine he had enough to construct hit rhythms, voicing and overdubbing as necessary. He no longer had to rely on the more established, larger and better-equipped facilities like Harry J and Channel One; everything could be done right at home, in his converted bedroom. In time this approach would revolutionize the way recordings were made in Jamaica, as others began to convert similar spaces; the concept of the bedroom studio was also taken up in places like Chicago and London, where aspiring producers and club deejays used similar set-ups to turn tape loops and sampled sequences into dance music.

'The times change,' says Jammy of the shift from live to digital recordings. 'You have to go with the time if you want to eat food. If you want to earn a living from the music, you have to do whatever is going on today. In the early seventies, when I used to record at Channel One or Harry J, we used to do live music. Then we just want to experiment, so we did something with the "Sleng Teng" and it changed the whole scene, and that was great for me – even today, everybody is using electronics, computerized drums, drum machine. I really revolutionized that part of the music with "Sleng Teng". It was [being done] a little before "Sleng Teng", but "Sleng Teng" was the big hit that made everybody switch over.'

Though most producers adapted to the digital form without fuss, certain key figures were less keen. 'What really bother me is I didn't like computer,' says Joseph Hoo-Kim, noting that 'Sleng Teng' signalled the end of Channel One. 'When the computer sound come in, I run one session with Sugar Minott and one with Diamonds, and after that I say, "No." I didn't like the sound and I didn't like one man playing a rhythm, so I didn't run no more session after that.'

The incredible popularity of 'Sleng Teng' prompted further changes and innovations, but this time the shift was more than stylistic: the very way music was created in Jamaica became different, requiring less finance and demanding technical rather than musical ability. Although the change in style seems drastic when looked at in retrospect and from the outside, to the Jamaican dancing public of the time it made perfect sense. The rugged rhythms of computer drums reflected the harsh reality of modern urban life, providing exciting fuel for the dancehall audience, and in any case the predominant sound had been heading in this direction for a long time through increased use of synthesizers and electronic drumbeats.

As noted throughout this book, Jamaica's dancehall culture has always reflected the desires and tastes of the island's public; I have also tried to show that reggae music has undergone endless cycles of renewal as its creators experiment with new techniques in their quest for fresh sounds and styles that can be created easily in difficult conditions. In this sense the digital explosion can be viewed as part of the overall continuity, albeit one that often perplexes roots enthusiasts. 'Sleng Teng' may have loosened the floodgates and brought Jamaican music headlong into the digital age, but the new music was ultimately a continuation of what preceded it, and a vast number of further shifts in style, form, and content have succeeded it right up to the present day. Though sexually suggestive 'slackness' and violent 'gun talk' came to dominate for a time – typically propagated by deejays over the barest of computer rhythms – reggae music would come full circle with the new roots movement that came to the fore from 1993 and saw more singers and live instruments returning to the mix as well as a revival of Rastafari elements. These days, Jamaican popular music can take any number of bewildering forms: hardcore dancehall deejays like Bounty Killer and Elephant Man perform the Kingston equivalent of American 'gangsta rap' over an electronic version of the ancient Pukumina beat, whilst artists like Luciano, Everton Blender and Bushman present an updated classical roots, appealing to an international audience through a spiritual message set to a complex backing of live and electronic instruments. Somewhere in between are the fiery Bobo Dread ranters like Capleton and Sizzla, who preach fundamentalist values over rhythms often more akin to heavy metal or hardcore punk than anything that was once known as reggae; veterans such as Dwight Pinkney craft easy-listening instrumental recuts of classic hits, and performers like Lieutenant Stitchie and Carlene Davis blend reggae and country elements with gospel music. In fact, the changes in Jamaican music since 'Sleng Teng' are so numerous, brought by a preponderance of new artists and others in the music industry, that another book is needed to place these figures in their proper context.

**Unleashing the computer: Prince Jammy [Beth Lesser]**

Changing times naturally bring forth different sounds due to a variety of factors. During the height of the digital era, Rico Rodriguez suggested a political motivation behind the advent of the deejay. 'Most of the music in Jamaica is business music,' he stated with disdain, 'or one particular party may have deejays who they support. This particular party is in power, so the show that they put on, it's pure deejays on it. They put the deejay first, because the deejay can utter phrases to suit a political party that an instrumentalist cannot perform, so the deejay thing has become a political element of the scene in Jamaica and musicians are treated like shoe-shine boys. I am a Rastaman who give out against society utterly. We don't defend PNP or JLP or whatever P – we defend people. No one owns music. People with money will speculate about music, but the musicians have the final argument.'

'Since them kill Bob Marley, them try to kill reggae from there,' says Junior Reid, alluding to a broader conspiracy. 'They consider Bob Marley the king of reggae, so they would really have to switch the business and make it be more computerized. Certain companies start say that they'r e not looking for one individual, they'r e looking for ten man on one rhythm, so you go to England and you don't make no money. That become the trend, and then when that producer come back to Jamaica, him tell the guys, "This is _how_ the reggae going now. You have to have ten man on the same rhythm or you'r e not going to eat any food", so every man just gone a [certain] way, and when the people in America and England hear reggae coming out of Jamaica now, them say we are not creative any more since Bob Marley and those guys not around – we are not creative any more, because ten of us is on the same beat. The people say reggae dead. Bob Marley was a soldier just like we, but at the same time I don't want to be a next Marley, because what them do to Bob Marley, I don't want them do that to me. We don't come as no lamb to the slaughter in this judgement, we come as the Conquering Lion of the tribe ofjudah, elect from Jah, ever-living God, earth's rightful ruler. So right now them have to hand over everything.'

Sugar Minott adds some perceptive thoughts on why reggae's militant message waned during the digital onslaught of the late 1980s: 'People just want to hear songs that make them feel good in the long run,' he reasons, 'make them feel happy. It's not every time you want to tell somebody, "They'r e bombing up Belfast" – that's not music, that's politics.

'We use the music to send a message what we feel and the struggle that we see. When me likkle, me used to sing "I want to go to Africa", because we used to believe in it, but now you want to go to Africa, you take a plane, simple as that! [Repatriation] did not happen the way we wanted it to happen. We have to face the reality, 'cause it don't make sense singing music that don't mean nothing. Right now, I don't like no songs so much about "Babylon" – it don't make no sense. People come say, "This is a federation of Rastafari", and I was a Twelve Tribes, sing for free, "Power to the people" and all that shit. But in the long run, everybody's just the same. If you deal with music, [and] used to believe in [something], but if you get to know that it's not so, you can't be feeding people [something] false, so my music is getting even more real – it's getting happy again. When I used to sing "Man Hungry" it was real, I wasn't making it up, but [if] people's going to sing "We want repatriation", you can go to Africa if you want easy now. I understand there's people go to Gambia to do shows, but we never know that. We was like, "Where is Africa? Somewhere on the map. We want to reach it, that's where our people [are] from, that's our ancestor." I used to say, "Africa is the black man's home" for my only kid, so now you know that you can go there I ain't going to sing that again.

'Like they say the Cold War done, some different things, so you can't go on that same way... how the music come now in Jamaica now, they have F-150s, they got Benz, how they going to sing about "Man Hungry"? They want "Grooving in my jeep", but in our days we don't roll with no jeep, man suffer, so man say, "Babylon a put on the pressure", 'cause that was the only way you could sing out the frustration. The music get so different now, I have to adjust and appreciate all those things I used to take for granted.'

Though the liberating message that drew many to reggae may have gone underground in its birthplace, by the time Jamaican music went digital reggae's solid foundation of inspired creativity and devoted religious faith had built a truly global house with many mansions, inspiring a great audience well beyond its land of origin. I leave the closing words to Cocoa Tea, one of the artists to have consistently sung conscious material, to emphasize reggae's universality: 'Reggae music is the heartbeat of the people. Reggae music highlight the struggles of the people, no matter what race of life people come from, 'cause reggae music come fi make the people them get help. It there to uplift the mind and refresh the soul and to teach us how to live in love and harmony. Reggae music preach equal rights and justice. We have to unite black and white: you have your struggles you a go through, me have mine, it's only that I have the medium in which to express your struggles and highlight mine too [at] the same time. One song say "Not because you live on the hill and I live down there on the flats, everything that you do indirectly affects me whether you know it or not", so it no matter where you want [to] live or who you want [to] be: the war that a gwan down a Israel, the shooting and killing that go on a Jamaica, election business whe a gwan in America, the mad cow disease whe a gwan in a Europe, the AIDS that kill all the people in Africa, we'r e going to highlight all of those struggles, because what? It's all of us problem together, me brethren, so we all must come together and try and tackle it, one by one.'
**Notes**

CHAPTER ONE

. Morgan notes that the revue featured a wide variety of performers. 'We had artists like Derrick Harriott and the Jiving Juniors, Count Prince Miller and the Downbeats, [singing duo] Bobby and Faye, Sparky and Pluggy dancing and the Wisdom Brothers balancing on bicycles; Hyacinth Clover would be singing also, which is Bim's wife.'

. Due to its association with this specific sound system location, 'Lover Boy' gained the alternative street title of 'S-Corner Rock'.

. That is, it took Duke Reid's team half an hour to repair or replace the broken stylus.

. The exact form of Motta's equipment is disputed; he may have cut straight on to acetates before he acquired a tape recorder.

. Tewari's surname has often been misspelled. Dada literally means 'paternal grandfather', but is also used in India as an endearing term of respect for an elder or boss, similar to the African-Jamaican Baba.

. This South African instrumental, originally by penny whistle player August Musurugwa, has been covered internationally many times. It was highly popular in Jamaica, and was adapted by several reggae artists in the sixties and seventies.

. Mr and Mrs Khouri were uncertain of the exact year; the company may have moved earlier.

. Both Shalit's fore and surnames have often been misspelled. I am grateful to Richard Noblett for pointing out the official documents that confirm the correct spellings.

CHAPTER TWO

. KUSF radio broadcast, 4 April 1992; interview conducted by Andrew Rush and Michael Turner.

. Incredibly, Buster says 'Oh Carolina' was initially sold to Blue Beat in England without his knowledge or permission by producer Ruddy Abrahams. 'Abrahams used to sell Calypso to Mr Shalit through Stanley Motta, and the man take my record and give Shalit, says is fi him own. If you look 'pon the original [Bluebeat] record, you will see the writer [is credited as] Abrahams. I went to Eddie Seaga and him send me to his attorney, who write them, threatening to sue. Sonny Bradshaw and Ray Hylton set up a meeting at the Myrtle Bank Hotel, and this white man sit down and me and him a talk. Mr Shalit said he didn't want to get into a fuss with me, him would prefer to work with me. Sonny Bradshaw and them advise, say it was good for me; after a while me say me will go with him, and the man became one of me greatest teachers, me best friend. Mr Shalit is a man who know some ten-plus languages; he is a man who was an intelligence [officer] in the United States Army, jump out of airplanes in Germany 'cause him knew the dialect, so he is a very, very wise man. What I had at the time was a sort of village concept of things, and Mr Shalit internationalized my mind.'

. The winner was Tony Gregory, a singer who recorded extensively for Studio One in the 1960s.

. Morgan says the group was composed of 'Bill, Jill, Ken and myself, all male'.

. The original Lord Koos of Kingston, still alive, is not to be confused with the late Lord Koos who established a sound system and record label in London; as the Matador notes, 'All the sound systems in England clone our name.'

. The Niyabinghi order is an orthodox branch of Rastafari that takes its name from an anti-colonial religious movement active in East and Central Africa in the early 1900s; to 'chant Niyabinghi' is to sing praises to Jah and voice opposition to Babylon, with the backing of 'Niyabinghi' drumming, itself based on burru drumming techniques.

. Interview with Steve Barrow, 1994, for the Reggae Archive project.

CHAPTER THREE

. Though the name Ethiopians points to Dillon's growing awareness of Rastafari, he reveals that their original choice of name was the Heartaches: 'We were very young at them times, not even knowing what Ethiopians really means. Coxsone as a elder man who understands more, he chose and say, "Ethiopians sound good – the right one that." '

. KUSF radio broadcast, 4 April 1992; interview conducted by Andrew Rush and Michael Turner.

. Junkanoo is a ceremonial dance performed in elaborate costumes with percussive accompaniment. It is derived from West African harvest rituals.

. As Taitt explains, 'Lloyd Knibb went into the Skatalites – the Studio One band. They had Jah Jerry, but when Roland have his solo, he got a little lost, so every Sunday I record for the Skatalites, but Jerry was playing out with them. I didn't deal with Coxsone too much – only when the Skatalites were recording on Brentford Road.'

. As Malcolm recalls, 'I didn't start earning money from recording, but band leaders took me out and I get like thirty shilling per night. I played with Trenton Spence. I played with Percy Myers from Allman Town, a good saxophonist. I played with a band named Ansel Smart and the Rivals, myself and Jackie Mittoo – [Smart] played no instrument, but he was the manager for Singer Sewing Machine Company and put this band together. Then the university formed this band with these university girls, Kes Chin and the Souvenirs. Kes shake the maracas and sing, and we had three doctors from Barbados – they were at the university, but they were top-class musicians. Dr Adrian Clark, he plays the piano, Dr Basil Robinson was the band leader, he plays the bass, and Dr Don Torrington plays the tenor. Then another band form by the name of the Cavaliers: Lester Sterling was the band leader and a little youth called Jackie Jackson was the bass man. We elect Rita Marley as the singer and go round the island advertising Dragon Stout for Desnoes and Geddes – no big money, but as youths, we enjoy it.'

. Jarrett notes that other acts at the event included Gorgeous George, Patti Labelle, Hortense Ellis, Lascelles Perkins, Jimmy Cliff and Count Prince Miller.

. Ken Boothe, who was also featured on the tour, notes that 'the band got scrapped in England because of bad arrangements – people weren't getting enough money'.

. In 1978, Peter Tosh and Mick Jagger scored a much bigger international hit with a cover version.

. As Griffiths recalls, 'The first song I did was called "Wall Of Love", with Jackie Mittoo, Lloyd Knibb, Brevett on bass, the original Skatalites – it is still not released yet. Another friend, who was living in the same yard, named Nugent wrote that song.'

. As Seaton remembers, 'We had actually formed a Gaylads band, came into the studio one night and surprised Coxsone. I was on guitar, Maurice was on bass, Delano was on guitar and Jackie Mittoo sat in on the piano, with Winston Fallon our drummer. We back up loads of people, like Slim Smith and Dudley Sibbles with the song "Gun Man".'

. Grant is better known for the roots material he recorded with Augustus Pablo in the late 1970s.

. The Soul Vendors, led by Roland Alphonso, was formed from the ashes of the Soul Brothers unit.

. Originally from Port Antonio, Brown first came to Kingston around 1962 to join the Vikings, at the invitation of band leaders Victor and Sonny Wong.

CHAPTER FOUR

. Lee is also linked with Morgan through marriage; as Derrick notes, 'Bunny Lee have children with my cousin Mackie, that's how I get to know7 him, and since he took on my cousin, I took on his sister Nellie. We married in 1968.'

. As Eccles recalls, 'Around '62 I start making shows. In '63, I start with the Clarendonians, '64–' 65 it was the Wailers at various country theatres, and in 1967 I put back Wailers in the "Battle of the Stars" at the Ward Theatre, [with] a whole set of acts.'

. Crooks admits that the shows he presented were not always what they were advertised to be. 'We used to be unfair to the country people, because one time I remember I went to Port Morant School and I brought Blacka Morwell to sing as Delroy Wilson. He did well, but couldn't remember some of the lines of the songs. I did that because the country people used to want the artists like mad, and if you can't get them, then you get somebody else to go. On those shows we had Cables, Heptones, Ken Boothe, Alton Ellis and a dancer. Sometimes we go to country with a truck and have to come back by a bus because we didn't make any money.'

. Glen notes that Yvonne was featured on the hits 'Meekly Wait And Murmur Not' with Roy Panton and 'Two Roads Before You' with Derrick Morgan. She was also featured on stage shows with Jackie Wilson, Byron Lee and Kes Chin – 'AH the big bands.'

. As Morgan explains, 'A Jack is a man-horse and Jinny is a woman-horse. The song is "Hold you Jack, let me tie me Jinny": you hold your girl-child, and let me tie up my boy-child, 'cause me no want nothing fi gwan.'

. Some of Sibbles' other classic lines include Larry and Alvin's 'Mean Girl', the Abyssinians' 'Satta Massa Ganna' and 'Declaration Of Rights', the Mad Lads' 'Ten To One', the adaptation of Eddie Floyd's 'I'v e Never Found A Girl' known as 'College Rock', Roy Richards' adaptation of Little Richard's 'Freedom Blues', John Holt's 'Fancy Make up', the Heptones' 'Sweet Talking' and the Soul Vendors' instrumental 'Full Up' (re-created for the Mighty Diamonds' 'Pass The Kutchie' and later reinvented as Musical Youth's novelty pop hit 'Pass The Dutchie'). 'The Studio One Alton Ellis is me too,' says Sibbles proudly, 'Dennis Brown's "No Man Is An Island" [originally by the Van Dykes] and Horace Andy, "See A Man's Face" and "Mr Bassie".'

. Campbell recalls the musicians on these sessions as Jackie Mittoo on piano and organ, Rick Frater on lead guitar and 'a youth named Patrick' on rhythm, Boris Gardiner and Leroy Sibbles on bass, plus saxophonists Lester Sterling, Cannonball Bryan and Roland Alphonso, and Vin Gordon on trombone.

. For instance, on Judge Dread' and Buster's version of James Carr's 'Dark End Of The Street', Marshall notes that 'the harmony inna it is me and Skully and Sticky, and a brother named Trevor from Spanish Town'.

. 'She did light jazz and cocktail music in hotels in the sixties and seventies,' Lyn explains, 'played with Lennie Hibbert for a while, and in Headley Jones' band – he played bass. Her name is Gertrude, but she was known as Bobby Lyn.'

. According to Lyn, 'The headliner for the band was Ken Boothe, and it was the remnants of the Studio One band: Fil was the drummer, Eric Frater was the guitarist and Leroy Sibbles was the bass player. They wanted to do a promotional item associated with the cigarette, so we did this song called "Without Love", which is the first recording I played on. It came on the Embassy label, by Ken Boothe and the Swinging Kings. We added the horn section after, which was "Deadley" Headley Bennett, and Denzil Laing was the percussionist.'

. Featured duets by the pair include 'Ben Johnson Day' and 'Johnny Pram Pram'.

. According to Collins, other group members to play on the session include a bassist known as Baba and a guitarist called Scotty.

CHAPTER FIVE

. Other members included bassist Earl 'Bagga' Walker, future Wailers keyboardist Earl 'Wire' Lindo and future Third World bassist Richard Daley on guitar. As Santa recalls, 'We were green, inspired kids who didn't matter about money or anything.'

. Pratt says the tune was 'Safe Travel', a song he recut on his own in 1968.

. The song was originally cut by Ken Boothe at Studio One.

. As Tony Chin recalls, 'It was me, Max Romeo, Lloyd Charmers and Santa sing [harmony] on it in Randy's , and Augustus Pablo plays keyboards.'

. The Chosen Few were Franklyn Spence, Richard 'Richie Mac' MacDonald, Pat Satchmo and David Scott, who also gained fame as the deejay Scotty.

. In Jamaica, buzzards are typically called John Crows.

. Horace recalls that he first went to Studio One as part of a duo. 'I came with a good friend, Frank – he's the lead singer with Wadada now. We used to sing together, and we pass the audition, but when we went to record it never work.'

. 'I'm Alright' was harmonized by Chinna Smith under the alias Earl Flute.

. Other notable backing musicians included Leroy Sibbles on bass, Fil Callender on drums, Richard Ace on keyboards and Vin Gordon on trombone.

. Lloyd Daley recalls the care with which the song was put together. 'That was an outstanding rhythm – it took us six hours to make that rhythm with eleven musicians on a twenty-four-track Neve console at Federal.' In 1970 Daley constructed a studio of his own at 43 Waltham Park Road, but was unable to equip it properly; 'Yin Mas Gan' is thus a tantalizing example of the kinds of sounds he might otherwise have created. 'It was designed by some Germans,' Daley notes. 'Graeme Goodall know them. I wasn't going for no mediocre equipment – I wanted a Neve console, twenty-four-track. I spent three months at Neve in Neasden [London] as an engineer, because I was gonna bring down a partially assembled console, but because of the non-payment of royalties [by British record companies] from my investment of my recordings I had to withhold furnishing my studio.'

. Bands with which Madden played include the Cavaliers, Bobby Demarcado and the Presidents, the Checkmates, the Jamaica Supremes, Los Cavaleros, the Diamonds, the Comets and the Jets.

. In addition to Madden and Brooks, the Mystics featured guitarist Lloyd 'Gitsy' Willis, drummer Danny Mowatt, bassist Joe Rugglus and a vocalist called 'Chuku'.

. Madden says hired session players on the track include saxophonist Ossie Scott and trombonist Joe McConnack, plus Peter Ashbourne on piano and Aubrey Adams on organ.

CHAPTER SIX

. 'Maybe it come to lock Duke's jaw by the meaning of it,' Perry cryptically comments. 'Do him a favour and lock his jaw because he fighting against me. From it lock, him get trapped – lock jaw, the death of Duke Reid.'

. On Louis Armstrong's 1926 recording "King of the Zulus", Armstrong's cornet solo is vocally interrupted by an unidentified Jamaican who is apparently gatecrashing his barbecue. Through the Jamaican's utterance is not exactly in deejay form, it sets a fascinating precedent to it and I'm grateful to James Dillon for pointing out its significance.

. The song uses an oblique recut of Emie Freeman's 'Live It Up', previously adapted by the Skatalites for 'Beardman Ska'.

. As Glen recalls, 'Cecil Lloyd was Jamaica's number one piano player. His wife also plays with him on piano – a white lady, but very good.' Other band members included bassist Cluette Johnson, guitarist Ernest Ranglin and alto saxophonist Karl 'Cannonball' Bryan. Though talented singers such as Bob Andy and Chenley Duffus auditioned with the band, Glen says he got the position 'because I was quick and could remember'.

. Dromilly has often been misspelled, even on labels controlled by Tubby.

CHAPTER SEVEN

. Brown's version is based on Santana's hit reworking of Green's tune.

. Brenda and the Tabulations' 'Tip Of My Tongue' reached number five on the US charts in 1971. 'Piece Of My Heart' was a substantial hit for Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company composed by Aretha Franklin's older sister Erma. The reggae versions over which Tado placed his toasting were voiced by Hortense Ellis, who was then recording as Mahalia Saunders after her marriage to one Mikey Saunders.

. In 1974 Tado cut 'Return Of Muhammed Ali' for 'a brethren called Louie'. The following year, he versioned Joy White's hit 'Dread Out Deh' for Lloyd 'Spiderman' Campbell. Tado also notes that he cut some songs for Studio One in this period, plus a song for Joe Gibbs 'on one of those "Joe Frazier" rhythms that he put Big Youth on later', but the material was not released due to conflicts with both producers.

. Interview with David Rodigan, Capital Radio, London, 1981.

. As note 4.

CHAPTER EIGHT

. As Clarke recalls, 'I did a song for a guy named Stair, but it was never issued. He was the engineer for Federal, a Syrian-looking guy with long hair like a hippie, smoke a lot of weed. Eventually I went to Clancy Eccles – first song I did was "God Made The Sea And The Sun" at Harry J recording studio. It wasn't released officially. In those days when you do a song, they usually just run a couple test pressings, have it on blank label.'

. Other band members included bassist Tony Ramsey, keyboardist Ansel Collins, drummer Neville Grant and guitarist Philip Grant.

. Cridland says that the Linkers began around 1969 as himself and Oswald Grey, a harmony coach at Delacree Lane to whom he was introduced by members of the Thrillers. 'Our first song was for Lloyd Matador, named "Say Say". Little Roy was singing for Matador at the time. Another few months after, we met up with Constantine Brown in Jungle [Arnett Gardens]. Oswald Grey left the group, he more run into the Church, so now is me and Con and another brethren we call Peedo as the Linkers. We do "Loser" for some JLP man named Vin w7ho want come in the business. From there, I audition with JJ and we do "Niyahman Story".'

. 'You Can Run' was issued in the UK without the group's knowledge, credited to the Hurricanes. Danny notes that the vocalists wTere 'me, a guy from Trench Town called Dennis and Lloyd Forrest – after we split up, he sing with the Jays, and after he left the Jays he start to sing with the Chantells'. In the same period, Clarke also recalls recording 'Poison Dagger', issued on the Black Sheep label, 'Bertha', done in 'kind of a conscious style for this likkle man [who] used to come by Federal named Mr Lee', and a self-produced effort at Dynamics called 'This Time'.

CHAPTER NINE

. Clarke says the Buccaneers were 'a Jamaican group that played dance music and Top 40 for weddings'. The Bluegrass Experience featured drummer Sparrow Martin, guitarist Eric Frater and keyboardist Glen Adams.

. As Big Youth explains, 'When they put him in prison and he was coming out, him say, "After I enter through this door, no one else shall enter", and no one has entered back through that door. He said that place is going to be a car park... and it have to be, because they were the ones that form the constitution of that place, but through him was the darker spade, them push him out.'

. Dennis Brown and Cynthia Richards were also with the group at that time.

. Norman worked with Llans Thelwell and the Celestials; Ralston played in a steel band. 'I did two LP with Llans Thelwell in the sixties,' Norman reveals. 'We were working at the Colony Hotel in Montego Bay, before it turned into the Half Moon. I worked there for six or seven years. Llans Thelwell was an engineer at the airport – he was the bass player. We were singing songs like "Up, Up, And Away", and Qim Reeves'] "Green Grass Of Home". We record those songs at Dynamic, and that's where I learned a bit of drumming, one night when the drummer didn't turn up.' Ralston adds, I was playing in Irving Ellis and the Northcoasters steel band, that was about '68–' 70. Irving is the younger brother of Alton Ellis. He came to Falmouth to coach this youth club and give me leadership of the band. I was playing the bass drum first, five big drums, then I play the one they call the guitar pan – it's close to the bass.'

. Norman also recalls cutting unreleased material with Lee Perry in this period: 'Bunny Lee is a producer [who] would get other people involved: when we go to Kingston, if Bunny Lee is not doing a session and another producer is recording, he would take the producer and say, "Record this guy." We did some songs for Lee Perry that way, four or five tracks. That was '70–' 71, but I never hear them [again]. I remember one of them was "Reggae For Days": "Why won't you come and do the reggae with me, reggae reggae reggae for days." '

. Norman says other group members featured on the album include 'Paul Hurlock, he was in the Cardigans and Llans Thelwell and the Celestials with me, and he have his own one-man band at the time. Glen Stair, he's still in Jamaica, one of the cocktail pianists playing in the hotels. Bongo Asher start play percussion with us, he wrote "Give Rasta Praise" and "African Liberation".'

. Singles recorded include 'Gone Me Gone' by Linford Gilzing, a singer 'from the hills, about ten miles from Falmouth'; 'God Bless The Youth' by The Mystics, 'Eric Bernard and two of his brethren'; 'Babylon A Fight Rastaman' by 'Allah', aka Austin Williams, 'he used to play a bit of percussion while we were rehearsing'; and 'Whip Them No Skip Them' by toaster Sir Lee of the Screaming Target sound system 'from Deeside, about twelve miles from Falmouth', which was particularly popular when issued in Britain.

. 'Glen Marcinick, the guy that owned Tops, he was involved in the [original] "It's Not Who You Know",' Norman explains. 'He came to Jamaica to cut dubs at the time for [Brixton sound system owner Lloyd] Coxsone, and he went in the studio and make some music – we thought it was Bunny Lee's session. When I came to England, I get to realize he was the one who did it, and I gave him a couple of tracks to release.'

. The material includes 'I'm Tipping' and 'Sweet Sixteen', with Third World as session musicians.

. 'The drummer was Benbow', Hines recalls, 'the bass player was Clayton Downie, and Clayton went back and played rhythm guitar. Then Pablo put some haunting overdubs on it.'

. As Hines notes, 'The rhythm was laid at Joe Gibbs or Harry J. Jacob Miller was playing the drum originally on that, and it was overdubbed by Horsemouth, and Robbie Shakespeare play the bass.'

. Other members include Caiman Scott, the brother of Scotty, and Ferris Walters.

CHAPTER TEN

. Tado says backing vocals were provided by Bim Sherman, Mike Brooks and Pauline Lindsey; the musicians include bassist Errol 'Flabba' Holt, drummer Sly Dunbar, guitarist Bingy Bunny, trumpeter Bobby Ellis, trombonist Vin Gordon, plus Bobby Kalphat on piano and Dennis Ferron on organ.

. As Brown notes, 'The original name for the sound was Soul Attorney and the original owner was Rupert Brown. Because of political things, the sound have to pack up. Tony Welch bought the sound and it plays for a couple of years as King Attorney, and then they change it to Socialist Roots.'

. As Lloyd Daley notes, Jack Ruby's was the largest tube amplifier that was ever built in Jamaica – it was forty KT88s, built by Lloyd Daley, the Matador.'

. The song was issued by Coxsone in 1964. Dennis says Andy was 'a brethren we meet in Trench Town, his name is Reuben Anderson'.

. Musicians on 'Folk Song' include drummer Cornel Marshall, bassist Lloyd Brevett, plus Gladdy Anderson on piano and Winston Wright on organ.

. Dennis says Clive became aware of the group through Waterhouse resident Denver Williams, a relative of his stepmother, Patricia Chin. Session players on the disc include drummer Carlton Barrett, bassist Lloyd Parks and guitarists Chinna Smith and Alva Lewis.

. As Rose recalls, 'Me get involved in the whole tourist thing with a band named Happiness Unlimited. Beechwood Avenue, at Hummingbird Restaurant, that's where we used to rehearse. You have to sing every type of music: the BB King thing, R&B, reggae, calypso, dinner music'

. Rose says the song was backed by a tailor named Winston Samuels (aka 'Thread') and Danny White, 'a guitarist whe come from the roots neighbourhood, but them man go a high school and university'.

. Dennis recorded an earlier version in 1972 with Niney at Joe Gibbs', which was also popular in Jamaica.

CHAPTER ELEVEN

. The album was first issued in Jamaica on Taxi as _Stalk Of Sensimenia._

. As Williams recalls, 'With the Now Generation I produced Delroy Wilson with "I Wish It Was Me", a Tyrone Taylor original. Along with that was the Versatiles' "Stronger Strong" and "Give Them Bread". It was [Dudley] Earl, Spanner and Robert, three brethren from Rollington Town – they were brethren with Junior Byles and the rest of the people them. We went into the studio with the Wailers' band – at that time it was called Rhythm Force – just after the period of the Hippy Boys. It was Family Man, Carly, Glen Adams, Reggie – the usual crew.'

. The earliest-known cut of this rhythm in Jamaica is Dodd's 'College Rock', a melodica instrumental credited to Big Willie; the melodic structure stems from Eddie Floyd's soul hit 'I'v e Never Found A Girl'.

. Other notable members include former In Crowd guitarist Michael Murray and bassist 'Professor' Larry Silvera.

. Ital is a strictly naturalistic way of life propagated by some followers of Rastafari.

. The frequently versioned rhythm was based on a popular Cuban hit.

CHAPTER TWELVE

. Interview with David Rodigan, Capital Radio, London, 1981.

. Cultural Roots was originally composed of Hubert Brooks, Norman Gallimore and Wade Dice; a later incarnation featured Devon Russell.

. 'Prince' Huntley Dakin, who sang back-up with Burrell on the tune, is the operator of the Modern Printey on Maxfield Avenue and founder of the Greedy Puppy label.

. The song was originally created by the Corporation.

. The song's greatest overseas success came in 1989 when it became a hit in Washington DC because of a dance that the public created to go with it; a remix by Miami Sound Machine made sure the song remained in the charts.

. The song was a sizeable Rasta hit in 1974, produced by Lloyd F. Campbell with Niney's assistance.

. Cocoa tea is a sweet breakfast drink, whilst cerassee tea is a medicinal beverage made from an extremely bitter vine.

. Tea notes that this first session almost didn't happen, as 'the first day I was going to the studio I was held with a spliff – first time ever I get hold with a spliff in a me life. Police stop the car, and me have a draw of weed in me pocket and me get it off, but Lee Van Cliff tell the police is mine – I just gave him a spliff, he said he nah go a jail for no man's weed. The policeman lock me up and carry me to Half Way Tree, and I was lucky that time because I got bail the same day.'

. Paul notes that the song was first cut several years earlier for Monica's records of Toronto.

**Acknowledgements**

I would like to thank wholeheartedly all those who consented to be interviewed; their honest recollections and poetic utterances relate the story of reggae's solid foundation. I would also like to thank all the fellow journalists, photographers, friends, family members and other colleagues who assisted with this book; your contributions are greatly appreciated.
