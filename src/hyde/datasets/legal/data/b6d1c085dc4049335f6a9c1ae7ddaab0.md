THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT (this “Amendment”), dated as of
November 20, 2020, amends the Credit Agreement (as amended, restated, modified
or supplemented prior to the date hereof, the “Credit Agreement”) dated as of
March 19, 2020 among PHILLIPS 66, a Delaware corporation (the “Borrower”),
PHILLIPS 66 COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the “Initial Guarantor”), the
lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”) and MIZUHO BANK, LTD., as the
administrative agent for the Lenders (in such capacity, the “Administrative
Agent”).
WHEREAS, on or about April 6, 2020, the parties thereto entered into that
certain Master New Lender Agreement whereby the parties increased the total of
all Commitments to $2,000,000,000 pursuant to Section 2.20 of the Credit
Agreement;
WHEREAS, on or about June 10, 2020, the parties thereto entered into that
certain First Amendment to Credit Agreement whereas the parties thereto agreed
to extend the Commitment Period to September 19, 2020;
WHEREAS, the Commitment Period has expired, and the Lenders have no further
obligation to make Loans to the Borrower above the Outstanding Amount as shown
on Schedule I;
WHEREAS, the parties desire to further amend the Credit Agreement, subject to
the terms and conditions set forth herein;
NOW THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:
Defined Terms; References. Unless otherwise defined in this Amendment, each
capitalized term used but not otherwise defined herein has the meaning given
such term in the Credit Agreement, as amended by this Amendment. Each reference
to “hereof”, “hereunder”, “herein” and “hereby” and each other similar reference
and each reference to “this Agreement” and each other similar reference
contained in the Credit Agreement shall, after the Amendment Effective Date,
refer to the Credit Agreement as amended hereby.
I. AMENDMENT
Effective as of the Amendment Effective Date (as defined in Section 3.1 below),
the Credit Agreement is amended as follows:

example: double-underlined text) as set forth in the pages of the Credit
Agreement attached as Exhibit A hereto.
1.2     The Credit Agreement is hereby amended to restate Schedule I thereto in

to the total Outstanding Amounts shown thereon.

V. LENDERS
5.1    New Lenders. By executing and delivering this Agreement, each Lender
joining the Credit Agreement as a Lender (each a “New Lender”), for itself,
hereby agrees (a) to become a party to the Credit Agreement as a Lender as
defined therein and (b) to be bound by all the terms, conditions,
representations, and warranties of the Credit Agreement and the other Loan
Documents applicable to Lenders. Each New Lender is hereby added to the Credit
Agreement as a Lender, and all references to the Lenders in the Loan Documents
shall be deemed to include each New Lender. The Outstanding Amount of each New
Lender, which will be funded by said New Lender on the Second Amendment
Effective Date, as set forth below, is shown on Schedule I attached hereto.
5.2    Exiting Lenders. Simultaneously with the effectiveness of this Amendment,
each Lender that will be reallocating its total Outstanding Amount among certain
of the other Lenders as herein provided (each an “Exiting Lender”) shall be
deemed to have, and does hereby sell, assign, transfer and convey to each other
remaining Lender hereunder (the “Remaining Lenders”) and to the New Lenders, and
each of the Remaining Lenders and the New Lenders hereby purchases and accepts,
the Outstanding Amounts and Loans of the Exiting Lenders such that, after giving
effect to this Amendment, (a) each Exiting Lender shall (i) be paid in full for
all amounts owing to such Exiting Lender under the Credit Agreement, (ii) cease
to be a Lender under the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents and (iii)
relinquish its rights (provided that it shall still be entitled to any rights
which by their express terms survive the termination, repayment, satisfaction or
discharge of such Exiting Lender’s obligations under the Credit Agreement in
respect of any circumstance or event or condition arising prior to the Amendment
Effective Date) and be released from its obligations under the Credit Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and (b) the Outstanding Amounts of each of the
Remaining Lenders and the New Lenders shall be as set forth on Schedule I
hereto. Such assignment and assumptions shall be deemed to have been effected
pursuant to the terms, provisions and representations of the Assignment and
Assumption attached as Exhibit D to the Credit Agreement as if each of them had
executed and delivered an Assignment and Assumption (with the Effective Date, as
defined therein, being the Second Amendment Effective Date hereof) and without
the payment of any related assignment fee, and no other documents or instruments
shall be, or shall be required to be, executed in connection with such
assignments (all of which are hereby waived). The foregoing assignments,
transfers and conveyances are without recourse to the Exiting Lenders and
without any warranties whatsoever by the Administrative Agent or the Exiting
Lenders as to title, enforceability, collectability, documentation or freedom
from liens or encumbrances, in whole or in part, other than the warranty of each
Exiting Lender that it has not previously sold, transferred, conveyed or
encumbered such interests. The Remaining Lenders, the New Lenders and the
Administrative Agent shall make all appropriate adjustments in payments under
the Credit Agreement for periods prior to the adjustment date among themselves.

CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of March 19, 2020, among PHILLIPS 66, a Delaware
corporation (the "Borrower"), PHILLIPS 66 COMPANY, a Delaware corporation (the
"Initial Guarantor"), the several banks and financial institutions from time to
time parties to this Agreement, and MIZUHO BANK, LTD., as administrative agent
(the "Administrative Agent").
The parties hereto hereby agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1.    DEFINITIONS
Section 1.1    Defined Terms. As used in this Agreement, the following terms
shall have the following meanings:
"ABR": for any day, a rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the next
1/16 of 1%) equal to the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day,
(b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus ½ of 1% and (c)
the Eurodollar Rate for a one month Interest Period that begins on such day (and
if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day) plus
1%; provided that the Eurodollar Rate for any day shall be based on the
Eurodollar Rate at approximately 11:00 a.m. London time on such day, subject to
the interest rate floor set forth therein. "Prime Rate" shall mean, for the
purposes of this definition only, the rate of interest per annum publicly
announced from time to time by the Administrative Agent as its prime rate in
effect at its principal office in New York City (the Prime Rate not being

such amount available to the Administrative Agent on such Borrowing Date, and
the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available
to the Borrower on such Borrowing Date an amount equal to such Lender's
Commitment Percentage of such Borrowing. The Administrative Agent shall notify

made available to the Administrative Agent), times (iii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days that elapse from and including such
Borrowing Date to the date on which such Lender's Commitment Percentage of such
Borrowing shall have become immediately available to the Administrative Agent
and the denominator of which is 360. A certificate of the Administrative Agent
submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this Section
2.3(c) shall be prima facie evidence of the accuracy of the information set
forth therein, absent manifest error. If such Lender's Commitment Percentage of
such Borrowing is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such
Lender within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to recover the amount of such Lender's Commitment
Percentage of such Borrowing (minus the amount, if any, which such Lender had
made available to the Administrative Agent) on demand from the Borrower with
interest thereon (A) for the period from and including such Borrowing Date to
the date one day after such demand, at a rate per annum equal to the

setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is
determined in accordance with clause (1) or (2) of the definition of “Benchmark
Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement
will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan
Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings
without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to,
this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) if a Benchmark Replacement is
determined in accordance with clause (3) of the definition of “Benchmark
Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement
will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan

other Loan Document; provided that, this clause (d) shall not be effective
unless the Administrative Agent has delivered to the Lenders and the Borrower a
Term SOFR Notice.

implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have
the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time

Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a
Benchmark Replacement), (i) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate
(including Term SOFR or Eurodollar Rate) and either (A) any tenor for such
Benchmark is not displayed on a screen or other information service that
publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in
its reasonable discretion or (B) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator

non-representative tenor and (ii) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause
(i) above either (A) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information
service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement) or (B) is not, or is
no longer, subject to an announcement that it is or will no longer be
representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the
Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” for all
Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed

deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a Borrowing of or
conversion to a Reference Rate LoanLoans. During any Benchmark Unavailability
Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an
Available Tenor, the component of the ABR based upon the Eurodollar
Ratethen-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will
not be used in any determination of the ABR.
(h)    (b) Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in
the event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its applicable lending
office to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans either
generally or having a particular Interest Period hereunder, then (a) such Lender
shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent thereof and such
Lender's obligation to make such Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended (the
"Affected Loans") until such time as such Lender may again make and maintain
such Eurodollar Loans and (b) all Affected Loans which would otherwise be made
by such Lender shall be made instead as Reference Rate Loans (and, if such
Lender so requests by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, all
Affected Loans of such Lender then outstanding shall be automatically converted
into Reference Rate Loans on the date specified by such Lender in such notice)
and, to the extent that Affected Loans are so made as (or converted into)
Reference Rate Loans, all payments of principal which would otherwise be applied
to such Lender's Affected Loans shall be applied instead to its Reference Rate
Loans.

Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders, at the Administrative

Administrative Agent shall

HOU 3974255

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





distribute such payments to each Lender to its Eurodollar Office or Domestic
Office, as applicable, promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. If any
payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar Loans) becomes due and
payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be extended to
the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a Eurodollar Loan becomes
due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless the result of such
extension would be to extend such payment into another calendar month, in which
event such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day. In
the case of any extension of any payment of principal pursuant to the preceding
two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at the then applicable rate
during such extension.
(c)    If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the
Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees
then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of
interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto
in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties,
and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among
the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then
due to such parties.
Section 2.13    Payments by the Borrower. Unless the Administrative Agent shall
have been notified in writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment
due to be made by the Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such
payment to the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that
the Borrower is making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall
not be required to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Lenders their respective Pro Rata Shares of a corresponding amount. If such
payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower within three
Business Days after such due date, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any amount which was made
available pursuant to the preceding sentence, and each Lender severally agrees
to repay forthwith on demand, such amount with interest thereon at the rate per
annum equal to the daily average overnight Federal Funds Effective Rate during
such period as quoted by the Administrative Agent and calculated on the basis of
a 360-day year for the actual days elapsed. Nothing herein shall be deemed to
limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender against the Borrower.
Section 2.14    Other Costs; Increased Costs.
(a)    The Borrower agrees to pay to each Lender which requests compensation
under this Section 2.14 (by notice to the Borrower), on the last day of each
Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Loan made or maintained by such
Lender, so long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves against
"Eurocurrency liabilities" under Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System (or, so long as such Lender may be required by such Board
of Governors or by any other Governmental Authority to maintain reserves against
any other category of liabilities which includes deposits by reference to which
the interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in this
Agreement or against any category of extensions of credit or other assets of
such Lender which includes any Eurodollar Loans), an additional amount
(determined by such Lender and notified to the Borrower) representing such
Lender's calculation or, if an accurate calculation is impracticable, reasonable
estimate (using such reasonable means of allocation

as such Lender shall determine) of the actual costs, if any, incurred by such
Lender during such Interest Period as a result of the applicability of the
foregoing reserves to such Eurodollar Loans, which amount in any event shall not
exceed the product of the following for each day of such Interest Period:
(i)    the principal amount of the Eurodollar Loans made or maintained by such
Lender to which such Interest Period relates outstanding on such day; and
(ii)    the difference between (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the
Eurodollar Rate (expressed as a decimal) applicable to such Eurodollar Loan and
the denominator of which is one minus the maximum rate (expressed as a decimal)
at which such reserve requirements are imposed by such Board of Governors or
other Governmental Authority on such date minus (y) such numerator; and
(iii)    a fraction the numerator of which is one and the denominator of which
is 360.
(b)    If any Change in Law shall:
(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement (including any compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or
other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or
credit extended by, any Lender;
(ii)    impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition,
cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by
such Lender; or
(iii)    subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes,
(B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded
Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal,
commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities
or capital attributable thereto;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or
maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or
to increase the cost to such Lender or to reduce the amount of any sum received
or receivable by such Lender, or such other Recipient hereunder (whether of
principal, interest or otherwise), then, upon the request of such Lender or
other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender or such other Recipient,
as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender or such other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered.
(c)    If any Lender determines in good faith that any Change in Law regarding
capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's
holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by
such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding
company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Lender's policies and the policies of such Lender's holding
company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time
the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will
compensate such Lender or such Lender's holding company for any such reduction
suffered; provided that such Lender is generally seeking compensation from
similarly situated borrowers under similar credit facilities (to the extent such
Lender has the right under such similar credit facilities to do so) with respect
to such Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements.

(d)    A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary
to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as
specified in clause (b) or (c) of this Section 2.14 shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereof.
(e)    Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation
pursuant to this Section 2.14 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's
right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be
required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14 for any increased
costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such
Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation
therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred
to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
Section 2.15    Taxes.
(a)    Payments Free of Taxes. Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without
deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Law. If
any applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable
Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any
such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall
make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted
or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the
applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such
deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and
withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15) the
applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received
had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(b)    Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. The Loan Parties shall timely pay
to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law, or at
the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for, the payment of
Other Taxes.
(c)    Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes
by any Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.15,
such Loan Party shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing
such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of
such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(d)    Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify each
Recipient, within 30 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.15) payable or paid by such
Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such
Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount
of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy
to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf
or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.




38
HOU 3974255

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





(e)    Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the
Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any
Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any
Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such
Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do
so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the
provisions of Section 9.6(b) relating to the maintenance of a Participant
Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case,
that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan
Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the
relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment
or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing
to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the
Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due
to the Administrative Agent under this clause (e).
(f)    Status of Lenders.
(i)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly
completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding
or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to
backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion,
execution and submission of any such documentation (other than such
documentation set forth in Section 2.15(f)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below)
shall not be required if in the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion,
execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed
cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position
of such Lender.
(ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a

backup withholding tax;
(B)    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so,

as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time

comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those
contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender
shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times
prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such
additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such
Lender has complied with such Lender's obligations under FATCA or to determine
the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
clause (D), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of
this Agreement.
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered
expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such
form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(g)    Treatment of Certain Refunds. If any party determines, in its sole
discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes
as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 2.15 (including by
the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.15), it shall pay
to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent
of indemnity payments made under this Section 2.15 with respect to the Taxes
giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes)
of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by
the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). Such
indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to
such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this clause (g) (plus
any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such
refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this clause (g), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay
any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this clause (g) the payment of
which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax
position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification
payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.
This Section 2.15 shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to
make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes
that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.
(h)    Survival. Each party's obligations under this Section 2.15 shall survive
the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of
rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments
and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan
Document.
(i)    For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders hereby
authorize the Administrative Agent to treat)

this Agreement as not qualifying as a "grandfathered obligation" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i).
Section 2.16    Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to
hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain
or incur as a consequence of:
(a)    failure by the Borrower to make a payment when due of the principal
amount of or interest on any Eurodollar Loans of such Lender;
(b)    failure by the Borrower to borrow Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has
given a Borrowing Request requesting the same in accordance with Section 2.3;
(c)    failure by the Borrower to make a conversion into or continuation of
Eurodollar Loans after the Borrower has given a notice requesting the same in
accordance with Section 2.6;
(d)    failure by the Borrower to make any prepayment of Eurodollar Loans of the
Borrower after the Borrower has given notice of the same in accordance with
Section 2.5(a);
(e)    the making of any conversion or prepayment of Eurodollar Loans on a day
which is not the last day of the Interest Period with respect thereto; and
(f)    any assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.18;
including in each case any such loss or expense arising from the reemployment of
funds obtained by it to maintain its Eurodollar Loans hereunder or from fees
payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained and any
foreign exchange losses actually incurred. If a Lender becomes entitled to claim
any amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall promptly notify the
Borrower, through the Administrative Agent, of the event by reason of which it
has become so entitled. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 2.16 and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such claim,
submitted by such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) to the Borrower,
shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.
Section 2.17    Mitigation Obligations. If any Lender requests compensation
under Section 2.14, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount
to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender
pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to
designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder
or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices,
branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section
2.14 or Section 2.15, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not
subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise
be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.
Section 2.18    Replacement of Lenders. If (a) any Lender requests compensation
under Section 2.14, (b) the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to
any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lenders pursuant
to Section 2.15, or (c) any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if any Lender
fails to execute and deliver any amendment, consent or waiver to any Loan
Document requested by

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





the Borrower by the date specified by the Borrower (or gives the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent written notice prior to such date of its intention not to
do so) which amendment, consent or waiver is required to be executed by all
Lenders or all affected Lenders, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and
effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such
Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject
to the restrictions contained in Section 9.6), all its interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such
obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment); provided that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior
written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld or delayed, (ii) such Lender shall have received
payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued
interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder,
from the assignee or the Borrower, as applicable, (iii) in the case of any such
assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.14 or
payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will
result in a reduction in such compensation or payments, and (iv) in the case of
any assignment resulting from a Lender failing to execute and deliver any
amendment, consent or waiver requested by the Borrower, the applicable
amendment, consent or waiver has been approved by the Required Lenders.
Section 2.19    Defaulting Lenders.
(a)    If a Defaulting Lender as a result of the exercise of a set off shall
have received a payment in respect of its outstanding Loans which results in its
pro rata share of the outstanding Loans being less than such Defaulting Lender’s
pro rata share of the sum of the aggregate amount of the Commitments, then no
payment will be made to such Defaulting Lender until all amounts due and owing
to the Lenders have been equalized in accordance with each Lender’s respective
pro rata share of the sum of the aggregate amount of the Commitments. Further,
if at any time prior to the acceleration or maturity of the Loans, the
Administrative Agent shall receive any payment in respect of principal of a Loan
while one or more Defaulting Lenders shall be party to this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent shall apply such payment first to the Loan(s) for which
such Defaulting Lender(s) shall have failed to fund its pro rata share until
such time as such Loans(s) are paid in full or each Lender (including each
Defaulting Lender) is owed its pro rata share of all Loans then outstanding.
(b)    Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply
for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law:
(i)    Ticking Fees. Fees otherwise payable pursuant to Section 2.8(c) shall
cease to accrue on the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender and the Borrower
shall not be required to pay any such fee for such period that otherwise would
have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender.
(ii)    Voting. Neither the Commitment nor the principal amount of the Loans of
such Defaulting Lender shall be included in determining whether all Lenders or
the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any
consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to Section 9.1), provided that any
waiver, amendment or modification (i) that would increase or extend the
Commitment of or reduce the principal or interest owing to such Defaulting
Lender under this Agreement or (ii) requiring the consent of all Lenders which
affects such Defaulting Lender differently than all other Lenders, as the case
may be, shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.




43
HOU 3974255

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





(iii)    Defaulting Lender Cure. In the event that the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all
matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then on such date
such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the
Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender
to hold such Loans in accordance with its Commitment Percentage and shall no
longer constitute a Defaulting Lender hereunder; provided that except to the
extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder
from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any
claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender's having been a Defaulting
Lender.
Section 2.20    Increase in Commitments.1 
(a)    Subject to the prior or concurrent occurrence of a Successful Syndication
(as such term is defined in the Fee Letter), at any time after the Closing Date,
provided that no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Borrower may request an increase of the aggregate Commitments by
notice thereof to the Administrative Agent in writing (such notice, a
"Commitment Increase Notice"), in an amount not less than $10,000,000. The
Administrative Agent will provide the Lenders with notice of such Commitment
Increase Notice. Any such Commitment Increase Notice shall be in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. The Borrower may, in its
sole discretion, but with the consent of the Administrative Agent as to any
Person that is not at such time a Lender, offer to any existing Lender or to one
or more additional banks or financial institutions the opportunity to
participate in all or a portion of such unsubscribed portion of the increased
Commitments pursuant to Section 2.20(b) or Section 1.1(c), as applicable.
(b)    Any additional bank or financial institution that the Borrower selects to
offer participation in the increased Commitments, and that elects to become a
party to this Agreement with the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (a "New
Lender"), by the execution of an agreement (a "New Lender Agreement")
substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1, shall become a Lender for all purposes
and to the same extent as if originally a party hereto and shall be bound by and
entitled to the benefits of this Agreement. The Commitment of any such New
Lender shall be in an amount not less than $10,000,000.
(c)    Any Lender that accepts an offer by the Borrower to increase its
Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall, in each case, execute an
agreement whereby it agrees to be bound by, and accept the benefits of, this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (a "Commitment Increase Agreement")
substantially in the form of Exhibit E-2, with the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent. Upon delivery to the Administrative Agent of one or more
New Lender Agreements or Commitment Increase Agreements, the Administrative
Agent shall enter any such New Lender and its Commitment, or increasing Lender’s
increased Commitment, in the Register and shall distribute a new Schedule I
reflecting the Commitment of such New Lender or increasing Lender’s increased
Commitment and the Commitments, as increased.


            
1 On or about April 6, 2020, the applicable parties entered into the Master New
Lender Agreement whereby the total Commitments were increased to $2,000,000,000
pursuant to this Section 2.20.






44
HOU 3974255

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





(d)    The effectiveness of any Commitment Increase Agreement or New Lender
Agreement shall be contingent upon receipt by the Administrative Agent of such
corporate resolutions and certificates as to no Default and accuracy in all
material respects of the representations and warranties made by the Borrower in
this Agreement as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request with respect
thereto, in each case in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent.
(e)    Additional Loans made on or after the date that any bank or financial
institution becomes a New Lender pursuant to Section 2.20(b) or any Lender's
Commitment is increased pursuant to Section 1.1(c), (the "Re-Allocation Date")
shall be made pro rata based on their respective Commitments in effect on or
after such Re-Allocation Date (except to the extent that any such pro rata
borrowings would result in any Lender making an aggregate principal amount of
Loans in excess of its Commitment, in which case such excess amount will be
allocated to, and made by, such New Lender and/or Lenders with such increased
Commitments to the extent of, and pro rata based on, their respective
Commitments), and continuations of Loans outstanding on such Re-Allocation Date
shall be effected by repayment of such Eurodollar Loans on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto and the making of new Loans pro rata based on
the respective Commitments in effect on and after such Re-Allocation Date. In
the event that on any such Re-Allocation Date there is an unpaid principal
amount of Eurodollar Loans, such Loans shall remain outstanding with the
respective holders thereof until the expiration of their respective Interest
Periods (unless the Borrower elects to prepay any thereof in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this Agreement), and interest on and repayments of such
Loans will be paid thereon to the respective Lenders holding such Loans pro rata
based on the respective principal amounts thereof outstanding.
(f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.20, (i) no
Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Commitment unless it agrees to
do so in its sole discretion and (ii) the aggregate amount of such increase in
the Commitments shall not exceed $1,000,000,000.
(g)    If requested, the Borrower shall execute and deliver a Note or Notes to
each New Lender and replacement Notes to Lenders signing a Commitment Increase
Agreement in the amount of said Lenders’ Commitments.
(c)    Upon the effectiveness of any New Lender Agreement or Commitment Increase
Agreement, Schedule I and other pertinent sections hereof shall be automatically
and proportionately modified to reflect the increased Commitment, the exact
figures to be agreed between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and all
references to the Commitments shall be deemed amended, mutatis mutandis.

or (ii) which seeks to prevent, enjoin or delay the making of the initial Loans
hereunder, if any.
(b)    As of the ClosingSecond Amendment Effective Date, since December 31,

expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect has occurred with respect to the
Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate or will occur upon the issuance of any Notes or

obligations under the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the Code with
respect to each Plan and are in compliance in all material respects with the
presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code with respect to each Plan.

make any contribution or payment to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan or in respect

Section 3.8    Taxes. (a) The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all
material United States federal income tax returns and all other material tax

adversely affect the performance by the Borrower of its payment obligations

governmental charges are, in the opinion of the Borrower, adequate.

provided above in this Article 7, all other notices of any kind are hereby
expressly waived.
ARTICLE 8.    THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
Section 8.1    Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably
appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this
Article 8 are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as
a third-party beneficiary of any of such provisions (except for the Borrower
with respect to its consent right set forth in Section 8.7). It is understood
and agreed that the use of the term "agent" herein or in any other Loan
Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Administrative Agent
is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express)
obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such
term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect
only an administrative relationship between contracting parties.
Section 8.2    Rights as a Lender. The bank serving as the Administrative Agent
hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as
any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other
advisory capacity for, and generally engage in any kind of business with the
Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the
Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the
Lenders.
Section 8.3    Exculpatory Provisions.
(a)    The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except
those expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing,
(i)    the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other
implied duties, covenants, functions, responsibilities, obligations or
liabilities regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing,
(ii)    the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any
discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary
rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is
required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the
circumstances as provided in Section 9.1) provided that the Administrative Agent
shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of
its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is
contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of
doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor
Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of
property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law, and








59
HOU 3974255

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





(iii)    except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall
not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as Administrative Agent
or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
(b)    The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the
Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the
circumstances as provided in Section 9.1) or in the absence of its own gross
negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment.

or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate,
report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith,
(iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other
terms or conditions set forth herein or the occurrence of any Default or Event
of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of
this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the
satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article 4 or elsewhere herein, other
than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.
Section 8.4    Notice of Default. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not
to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
(other than an Event of Default described in Article 7(a)) unless the
Administrative Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that
such notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Administrative Agent
receives such a notice or any notice pursuant to Section 5.1 or Section 5.2, the
Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders. The
Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders;
provided that unless and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such
directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take
such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or
Event of Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the
Lenders.
Section 8.5    Reliance by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying
upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document
or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by
the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement
made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper
Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The
Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the
Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall
not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the
advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
Section 8.6    Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any
and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or
more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its
rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory
provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to
the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any

such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection
with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as
activities as Administrative Agent.
Section 8.7    Resignation of Administrative Agent. Subject to the appointment
and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this
paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the
Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall
have the right with the consent of the Borrower (not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed; and provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required
during the continuation of an Event of Default), to appoint a successor. If no
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent
gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on
behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent which shall be a
bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon
the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a
successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent
(other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the retiring Administrative
Agent), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a
successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its
predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.
After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this
Article 8 and Section 9.5 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
retiring Administrative Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related
Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Section 8.8    Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent by Other Lenders. Each
Lender acknowledges and agrees that the extensions of credit made hereunder are
commercial loans and not investments in a business enterprise or securities.
Each Lender further represents that it is engaged in making, acquiring or
holding commercial loans in the ordinary course of its business and has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate,
made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement as a
Lender, and to make, acquire or hold Loans hereunder. Each Lender shall,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information (which may contain material,
non-public information within the meaning of the United States securities laws
concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates) as it shall from time to time deem
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document
furnished hereunder or thereunder and in deciding whether or to the extent to
which it will continue as a Lender or assign or otherwise transfer its rights,
interests and obligations hereunder.
Section 8.9    Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the
pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial
proceeding relative to any Loan Party, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein
expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be
entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or
otherwise:

interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that
are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or
advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative
Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their
respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent under Section 2.8, and Section 9.5) allowed in such
judicial proceeding; and
(b)    to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Section 2.8 and Section 9.5.
Section 8.10    Guaranty Matters. The Lenders authorize the Administrative Agent
to release any Guarantor from its obligations as a Guarantor under this
Agreement pursuant to a written request made by the Borrower, if (a) such
Guarantor ceases to be a Required Guarantor as a result of a transaction
permitted under this Agreement or (b) such Guarantor is an Elective Guarantor at
the time of such release. Any such request shall be accompanied by a certificate
of a Financial Officer of the Borrower certifying (which certification shall
constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower hereunder) that (i) no
Event of Default then exists or will exist after giving effect to such release,
(ii) after giving pro forma effect to such release, the Borrower is in
compliance with Section 6.1(u) as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter
for which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 5.1, and
(iii) the conditions for release set forth in this Section 8.10 have been
satisfied. Upon request by the Administrative Agent at any time, the Required
Lenders will confirm in writing the Administrative Agent's authority to release
any Guarantor from its obligations under this Agreement pursuant to the terms
and conditions hereof.
Section 8.11    No Duties. The Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner shall
notNone of the Joint Lead Arrangers or Joint Bookrunners shall have any duties,
responsibilities or liabilities in such capacities under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents other than the duties, responsibilities and liabilities

Section 9.3    No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no
delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any
right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or

exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies,

rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by Law.

foregoing obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to any Confidential
Information that becomes part of the public domain independently of any act of

the SoleJoint Lead ArrangerArrangers for all their out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the development, preparation, negotiation
and execution and, with respect to the Administrative Agent only,
administration, of this Agreement and any other Loan Document and any other
documents prepared in connection herewith, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the reasonable legal
fees and disbursements of Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, counsel to the

hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations
hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions
contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii)
any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any
property owned or operated by the Loan Parties or any of their respective

Parties or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and
regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such
indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.
(c)    To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be
paid by it to the Administrative Agent or the SoleJoint Lead ArrangerArrangers
under Section 9.5(a) or Section 9.5(b), each Lender severally agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent or the SoleJoint Lead ArrangerArrangers, as the case
may be, such Lender's Pro Rata Share (determined as of the time that the
applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid
amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim,
damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or
asserted against the Administrative Agent or the SoleJoint Lead
ArrangerArrangers in its capacity as such.

(d)    To the extent permitted by applicable Law, no party hereto shall assert,
and each such party hereby waives, any claim against any other party, on any
theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages
(as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or
as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof; provided that, nothing in
this Section 9.5(d) shall relieve the Borrower of any obligation it may have to
indemnify an Indemnitee against special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages asserted against such Indemnitee by a third party.
(e)    All amounts due under this Section 9.5 shall be payable not later than 10
days after written demand therefor.
(f)    The agreements in this Section 9.5, including the Borrower's indemnity
obligations, shall survive repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable
hereunder.
Section 9.6    Successors and Assigns; Participations; Purchasing Lenders.
(a)    This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of
the Borrower, the Lenders, the Administrative Agent, all future holders of the
Loans and their respective successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may
not assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement,
other than in connection with an assignment or transfer otherwise permitted
hereunder, without the prior written consent of each Lender.
(b)    Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, at any time sell to one or more banks or other financial institutions
(each, a "Participant") participating interests in any Loan owing to such
Lender, any Note held by such Lender, any Commitment of such Lender, or any
other interests of such Lender hereunder. In the event of any such sale by a
Lender of a participating interest to a Participant, such Lender's obligations
under this Agreement to the other parties to this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, such Lender shall remain solely responsible for the performance
thereof, such Lender shall remain the holder of its Loan for all purposes under
this Agreement, and the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without
the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in the proviso in the second sentence of Section 9.1 that affects such
Participant. Without affecting the limitations in the preceding sentence, each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14, Section 2.15 and
Section 2.16 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein) with respect
to its participation in the Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to
time; provided that such Participant (i) agrees to be subject to the provisions
of Section 2.17 and Section 2.18 as if it were a Lender, and (ii) shall not be
entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such Sections than the
transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount
of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender to such Participant
had no such transfer occurred, unless the sale of the participation to such
Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent. Each Lender that
sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower's request and expense, to use
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions
of Section 2.17 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by Law,
each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.7(b) as
though it were a Lender, provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 9.7(a) as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a
participation shall, acting solely for this

purpose as a nonfiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it
enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and
stated interest) of each Participant's interest in the Loans or other
obligations under the Loan Documents (the "Participant Register"); provided that
no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the
Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any
information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans or
its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the
extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan
or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the
United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register
shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such
participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to
the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its
capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a
Participant Register.
(c)    Each Lender may, (i) with the consent of the Borrower (except that such
consent shall not be required (x) during the continuation of an Event of
Default, (y) in the case of any assignment to an existing Lender or an Affiliate
thereof, during the occurrence and continuation of a Default, or (z) for an
assignment by the Initial Lender to an Approved Lender on or before April 20,
2020 (the “Initial Syndication Period”), and which consent, when required, shall
not be unreasonably withheld), and the Administrative Agent (except that such
consent shall not be required for (x) any assignment to an existing Lender or an
Affiliate thereof or (y) for an assignment by the Initial Lender to an Approved
Lender during the Initial Syndication Period, and which consent, when required,
shall not be unreasonably withheld) or (ii) in consultation with the Borrower,
following the Initial Syndication Period and until the Syndication Date (as
defined in the Engagement Letter), in the case of any assignment to commercial
and investment banks whose senior, unsecured, long-term indebtedness (at the
time of such selection) has a rating by either S&P or Moody’s of at least A2 or
A, sell or assign to one or more Lenders or additional banks, financial
institutions or other entities (other than the Borrower, any of its Affiliates
or a natural person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or
owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person)) (a "Purchasing
Lender") (other than a Purchasing Lender that is a Defaulting Lender or that
would be a Defaulting Lender upon becoming a Lender hereunder) all or part of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement pursuant to a duly executed
Assignment and Assumption; provided that (i) if such sale is not to one or more
existing Lenders or an Affiliate thereof, such sale shall be in a minimum amount
of $10,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent, and for so long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents
and (ii) the Commitment retained (if any) by such transferor Lender after such
sale shall be at least $10,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent, and
for so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower,
otherwise consents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender may sell to one or
more Lenders or Purchasing Lenders designated by the Borrower all of its
Commitment and/or all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption as described in the preceding sentence
in connection with a purchase thereof effected pursuant to Section 2.18. Upon
(A) the execution of such Assignment and Assumption, (B) delivery of an executed
copy thereof to the Administrative Agent, (C) recordation of such transfer in
the Register and (D) payment by such Purchasing Lender to the Administrative
Agent of a registration and processing fee of $4,000 if such Purchasing Lender
is not a Lender prior to the execution of such Assignment and Assumption and
$2,000 otherwise (provided that the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion
may elect to waive such fee) and (E) payment to the Administrative Agent of any
additional amounts required by Section 9.6(e), from and after the Transfer
Effective Date determined pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption, such
Purchasing Lender shall for all purposes be a Lender party to this Agreement and
shall have all the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement to
the same extent as if it were an original party hereto and, in the case of an
Assignment and Assumption executed pursuant to Section 2.18 or any other
assignment permitted

HOU 3974255

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





hereunder of all of a Lender's Commitment and/or all of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, the transferor Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto, but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.14,
Section 2.15, Section 2.16 and Section 9.5, in each case with respect to facts
and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Such
Assignment and Assumption shall be deemed to amend this Agreement to the extent,
and only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of any Purchasing
Lender that was not a Lender prior to the execution of such Assignment and
Assumption and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments, Commitment
Percentages, and Pro Rata Shares arising from the purchase by such Purchasing
Lender of all or a portion of the rights and obligations of such transferor
Lender under this Agreement. Upon the consummation of any transfer to a
Purchasing Lender pursuant to this Section 9.6(c), the transferor Lender, the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so
that, if required, a replacement Note is issued to such transferor Lender and a
new Note or, as appropriate, a replacement Note, is issued to such Purchasing
Lender, in each case in principal amounts reflecting their respective Commitment
and/or Loans. Such new Notes shall be in the form of the Notes replaced thereby.
(d)    The Administrative Agent shall maintain, acting solely for this purpose
as agent for the Borrower at its address referred to in Section 9.2, a copy of
each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register (the "Register")
for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders any Commitments
of, and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to each Lender
from time to time. The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the
absence of manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the
owner of the Loan recorded therein for all purposes of this Agreement. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(e)    Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Assumption executed by a transferor
Lender, a Purchasing Lender, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and,
unless waived by the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 9.6(c), payment by
the Purchasing Lender to the Administrative Agent of a registration and
processing fee of $4,000 if such Purchasing Lender is not a Lender prior to the
execution of such Assignment and Assumption and $2,000 otherwise, the
Administrative Agent shall (i) promptly accept such Assignment and Assumption,
(ii) on the Transfer Effective Date determined pursuant thereto record the
information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give notice of such
acceptance and recordation to the Lenders and the Borrower.
(f)    In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any
Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and
until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties
to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative
Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as
appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of
participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including
funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the
applicable Pro Rata Share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the
Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby
irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities
then

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent and each other Lender
hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as
appropriate) its full Pro Rata Share of all Loans in accordance with its Pro
Rata Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of
rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective
under applicable Law without compliance with the provisions of this Section,
then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for
all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
(g)    The Borrower authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or
Purchasing Lender (each, a "Transferee") and any prospective Transferee any and
all financial information (other than Confidential Information except as
permitted by Section 9.4) in such Lender's possession concerning the Borrower,
which has been delivered to such Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement or which has been delivered to such Lender by the Borrower in
connection with such Lender's credit evaluation of the Borrower prior to
entering into this Agreement.
(h)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such
Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal
Reserve Bank or other central bank, and this Section 9.6 shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.
(i)    The Borrower, upon receipt of written notice from the relevant Lender,
agrees to issue a Note to any Lender requiring a Note to facilitate transactions
of the type described in Section 9.6(h) above.
Section 9.7    Adjustments; Set‑off.
(a)    If any Lender (a "Benefited Lender") shall at any time receive any
payment of all or part of its Loans or interest thereon, or receive any
collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set‑off,
pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature referred to in clause (f) of
Article 7, or otherwise) in a greater proportion than any such payment to and
collateral received by any other Lender, if any, in respect of such other
Lender's Loans or interest thereon, such Benefited Lender shall purchase (for
cash at face value) from the other Lenders participations in the Loans, or shall
provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the
proceeds thereof, to the extent necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to
share the excess payment or benefits of such collateral or proceeds ratably with
each of the Lenders in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided, however, that (i) if any
such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this Section 9.7 shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for
the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee
or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate
thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section 9.7 shall apply). The
Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively
do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant
to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights






70
HOU 3974255

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if
such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.
(b)    In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided by Law,
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default each
Lender and each of its respective Affiliates shall have the right, without prior
notice to any Loan Party, any such notice being expressly waived by such Loan
Party to the extent permitted by applicable Law, to set off and appropriate and
apply against the obligations under this Agreement any and all deposits (general
or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any
other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether
direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time
held or owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the account of any Loan
Party; provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any
such right of set-off hereunder, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over
immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.19 and, pending such payment, shall be
segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in
trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the
Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement
describing in reasonable detail the obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender
as to which it exercised such right of set-off. The rights of each Lender and
their respective Affiliates under this Section 9.7 are in addition to other
rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its
Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the applicable Loan
Party and the Administrative Agent after any such set‑off and application made
by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the validity of such set‑off and application.
Section 9.8    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts and all of
said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same

74
HOU 3974255

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support "QFC
Credit Support" and each such QFC a "Supported QFC"), the parties acknowledge
and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the
regulations promulgated thereunder, the "U.S. Special Resolution Regimes") in
respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below
applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in
fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the
United States or any other state of the United States):
In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a "Covered
Party") becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime,
the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support
(and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC
Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such
QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent
as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if
the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation
and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a
state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate
of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special
Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise
apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised
against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent
than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution
Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of
the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the
foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties
with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any
Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
ARTICLE 10.    REQUIRED GUARANTEE
Section 10.1    Guarantee. Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders (the "Subsidiary Guarantee"), as primary obligor and not merely as
surety, the prompt and complete payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by
acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement and any other Loan Document, whether for
principal, interest, fees, expenses or otherwise, including obligations which,
but for an automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code or any
other insolvency law or other proceeding, would become due (such obligations
being hereinafter referred to as the "Guaranteed Obligations"), and agrees to
pay any and all expenses (including the legal fees, charges and disbursements of
counsel) incurred by the Administrative Agent and each Lender in enforcing any
rights under the Subsidiary Guarantee. No amendment or modification of the
Subsidiary Guarantee may be made without the prior written consent of each
Guarantor. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the
obligations of the each Guarantor under the Subsidiary Guarantee shall be
limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render
its obligations under the Subsidiary Guarantee subject to avoidance under
Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11, United States Code) or any
comparable provisions of any applicable state law.
Section 10.2    Waiver of Subrogation. Notwithstanding any payment or payments
made by a Guarantor hereunder, or any set-off or application of funds of any
Guarantor by the Administrative Agent




75
HOU 3974255

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





or any Lender, such Guarantor shall not be entitled to be subrogated to any of
the rights of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders against the Borrower or
against any collateral security or guarantee or right of offset held by the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders for the payment of the Guaranteed
Obligations, nor shall any Guarantor seek any reimbursement from the Borrower in
respect of payments made by the Guarantor hereunder, until all amounts owing to
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders by the Borrower are paid in full. If
any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights
at any time when all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall not have been paid in
full, such amount shall be held by such Guarantor, in trust for the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, segregated from other funds of such
Guarantor and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Guarantor, be turned over to
the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of itself and the Lenders, in
the exact form received by such Guarantor (duly indorsed by such Guarantor, if
required), to be applied against the Guaranteed Obligations, whether mature or
unmatured, in such order as any Lender may determine.
Section 10.3    Amendments, etc. with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations.
Each Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without
any reservation of rights against such Guarantor, and without notice to or
further assent by any Guarantor, any demand for payment of any of the Guaranteed
Obligations made by the Administrative Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by
the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, and any of the
Guaranteed Obligations continued, and the Guaranteed Obligations, or the
liability of any other party upon or for any part thereof, or any collateral
security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect thereto, may,
from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended, amended, modified,
accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender, and this Agreement, and any Note and any other document in
connection therewith may be amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in
whole or in part, as any Lender may deem advisable from time to time, and any
collateral security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations
may be sold, exchanged, waived, surrendered or released. Neither the
Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to protect,
secure, perfect or insure any Lien or security interest at any time held by it
as security for the Guaranteed Obligations or for this Subsidiary Guarantee or
any property subject thereto.
Section 10.4    Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each Guarantor waives any
and all notice of the creation, renewal, extension or accrual of any of the
Guaranteed Obligations and notice of or proof of reliance by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender upon this Subsidiary Guarantee or acceptance of this
Subsidiary Guarantee; the Guaranteed Obligations, and any of them, shall
conclusively be deemed to have been created, contracted or incurred in reliance
upon this Subsidiary Guarantee; and all dealings between the Borrower and the
Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as
applicable, on the other, shall likewise be conclusively presumed to have been
had or consummated in reliance upon this Subsidiary Guarantee. Each Guarantor
waives diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default
or nonpayment to or upon the Borrower, such Guarantor or any other Guarantor
with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations. This Subsidiary Guarantee shall be
construed as a continuing, absolute and unconditional guarantee of payment
without regard to, and each Guarantor hereby expressly waives any defenses to
its obligations hereunder based upon (a) the validity or enforceability of this
Agreement, any Note, any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any collateral
security therefor or guarantee or right of offset with respect thereto at any
time or from time to time held by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, (b)
any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of,
all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other Guaranteed Obligations of
any other Loan Party under or in respect of the Loan Documents, or any other
amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from any Loan Document,
including any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from the
extension of additional credit to any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or
otherwise, (c) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a




76
HOU 3974255

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be
asserted by the Borrower against the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or
(d) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of
the Borrower or any Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to
constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower for the Guaranteed
Obligations, or of any Guarantor under this Subsidiary Guarantee, in bankruptcy
or in any other instance. When pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder
against the Guarantors, the Administrative Agent and each Lender may, but shall
be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies as it may have
against the Borrower or any other Person or against any collateral security or
guarantee for the Guaranteed Obligations or any right of offset with respect
thereto, and any failure by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as
applicable, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments
from the Borrower or any such other Person or to realize upon any such
collateral security, or guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve the
Guarantor of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights
and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a matter of law, of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders against each Guarantor.
Section 10.5    Reinstatement. This Subsidiary Guarantee shall continue to be
effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any
part thereof, of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must
otherwise be restored or returned by the Administrative Agent or any Lender upon
the insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of the
Borrower or upon or as a result of the appointment of a receiver, intervenor or
conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the Borrower or any
substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payments had
not been made.
Section 10.6    Payments. Each of the Guarantors and the Borrower hereby agrees
that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid to the Administrative Agent, for
the account of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, without set-off or
counterclaim in Dollars as expressed to be payable hereunder and under any Note,
in immediately available funds at the office of the Administrative Agent
specified in Section 9.2.
Section 10.7    Additional Guarantors. Upon the execution and delivery by any
Person of a Guarantee Joinder and other required documents as provided in
Section 5.9, such Person shall be a Guarantor and shall be a party hereto as if
an original signatory hereto.

The foregoing pricing grid is based upon the Borrower's Senior Debt ("Index
Debt") ratings as determined from time to time by S&P and Moody's. For purposes
of the foregoing, (i) if both S&P and Moody's shall not have in effect a rating
for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the circumstances referred to in the
last sentence of this paragraph), then such rating agencies shall be deemed to
have established a rating in Level 6, (ii) in the event either S&P or Moody's
shall not have in effect a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of
the circumstances referred to in the last sentence of this paragraph), then the
foregoing pricing grid will be based upon the Borrower's Index Debt ratings as
determined solely with respect to the other rating agency, (iii) in the event
that the Borrower's Index Debt ratings from S&P and Moody's fall in different
levels, then the Applicable Margin in the above pricing grid will be that
applicable to the higher rating, unless one of the two ratings is two or more
levels lower than the other, in which case the Applicable Margin in the above
pricing grid will be that applicable to the rating one level lower than the
higher rating, and (iv) if the ratings established or deemed to have been
established by S&P and Moody's for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than
as a result of a change in the rating system of S&P or Moody's), such change
shall be effective as of the date on which it is first announced by the
applicable rating agency. Each change in the Applicable Margin shall apply
during the period commencing on the effective date of such change and ending on
the date immediately preceding the effective date of the next such change. If
the rating system of S&P or Moody's shall change, or if either such rating
agency shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations,
the Borrower and the Lenders shall negotiate in good faith to amend this
definition to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of
ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such
amendment, the Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference to the rating
most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation.
