TERMS OF FACILITY

 

2.1 Term Loan.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Lender severally
agrees to make a Term Loan to the Borrowers on the Effective Date in a principal
amount not to exceed the applicable term loan commitment set forth on Schedule
1.2B, in the manner and for the purposes provided in Section 2.2.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (and without affecting
any other provisions hereof), the funded portion of each Term Loan made on the
Effective Date shall be equal to 96.00% of the principal amount of such Term
Loan (it being agreed that the full principal amount of each such term Loan
shall be the “initial” principal amount of such Term Loan and deemed outstanding
on the Effective Date and the Borrowers shall be jointly and severally obligated
to repay 100.00% of the principal amount of each such Term Loan as provided
hereunder). The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that such 4.00% of original
issue discount shall be treated as reducing the issue price of the Term Loan by
like amount in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1273-2(g)(2),
resulting in an aggregate of four percent (4%) of original issue discount in
respect of the Term Loan for federal income tax purposes, and shall report
consistently therewith for all purposes.

    

 - 24 -

  

 

(b) The Borrowers may request the Term Loan by providing at least one (1)
Business Day’s prior written notice thereof to the Agent, in the form of a
Borrowing Request. Each Lender shall severally make available to the Agent an
amount equal to such Lender’s Percentage Share of the Commitment at an account
designated by the Agent by 11:00 a.m. New York time on the Effective Date. The
amount so received by the Agent shall, upon receipt of all requested funds and
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, be made available to one or more of
the Borrowers, as directed by the Borrowers, in immediately available funds. The
portion of the Term Loan to be repaid to each Lender shall be evidenced by the
Note of such Lender.

 

(c) The failure of any Lender to make the portion of the Term Loan required to
be made by it hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligation to
make the portion of the Term Loan required to be made by it, and no Lender shall
be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make its portion of the
Term Loan.

 

2.2 Use of Loan Proceeds. Proceeds of the Term Loan shall be used: (a) to
finance the acquisition of the properties contemplated in the Acquisition
Agreement, (b) for the working capital and general business purposes of the
Borrowers not otherwise prohibited under applicable provisions of this Agreement
and approved by the Agent, and (c) to pay fees and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as more particularly
described on Schedule 2.2.

 

2.3 Repayment of Term Loan.

 

(a) Principal. The Borrowers hereby unconditionally promise to pay to the Agent,
in cash, for the account of the Lenders, (i) beginning on May 1, 2020 and on the
first day of each calendar month thereafter (in each case, if not a Business
Day, the immediately succeeding Business Day), a principal amount in respect to
the Term Loans equal to one percent (1%) of the then outstanding Loan Balance,
and (ii) to the extent not previously paid, the then unpaid principal amount of
each Term Loan on the Maturity Date and as otherwise contemplated in Section
2.9. The Term Loan is not a revolving loan; amounts repaid hereunder may not be
reborrowed.

 

(b) Interest. Each Term Loan shall bear interest on the principal amount thereof
on each day outstanding from the Effective Date, at a rate per annum equal to
the Contract Rate payable in cash on each Interest Payment Date. Accrued cash
interest on each Term Loan shall be paid in cash in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date applicable to such Term Loan. Interest on past‑due principal and,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, past‑due interest, shall accrue at
the Default Rate and shall be payable upon demand by the Agent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, during the existence of any Event of Default, such interest shall
be payable upon demand by the Agent. While any Event of Default exists or after
acceleration, interest shall accrue and the Borrowers shall pay interest (after
as well as before entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on
any amount payable by the Borrowers hereunder, at a per annum rate equal to the
lesser of (A) the Highest Lawful Rate and (B) the Default Rate.

     

 - 25 -

  

 

2.4 [Reserved].

 

2.5 Outstanding Amounts. The outstanding principal balance of the Note of each
Lender reflected by the notations of such Lender on its records shall be deemed
presumptive evidence of the principal amount owing on such Note. The liability
for payment of principal and interest evidenced by each Note shall be limited to
principal amounts actually advanced and outstanding pursuant to this Agreement,
the original issue discount amount and interest on such amounts calculated in
accordance with this Agreement. The Agent shall maintain accounts in which it
will record (i) the amount of each Term Loan made hereunder and the Contract
Rate or other interest rate applicable thereto; (ii) the amount of any principal
or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to
each Lender hereunder; and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Agent
hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof. The
entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to this paragraph shall be
prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations therein
recorded; provided that the failure of any Lender or the Agent to maintain such
accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligations of
the Borrowers to repay the Term Loan in accordance with its terms. In the event
of any conflict between the records maintained by any Lender and the records of
the Agent in respect of such matters, the records of the Agent shall control in
the absence of manifest error.

 

2.6 Taxes and Time, Place, and Method of Payments.

 

(a) All payments required pursuant to this Agreement or the Notes shall be made
without set-off or counterclaim in Dollars and in immediately available funds
free and clear of, and without deduction for, any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes; provided, however that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable
shall be increased by the amount (the “Additional Amount”) necessary so that
after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to
additional sums described in this Section 2.6(a)) the Agent or any Lender, as
the case may be, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had
no such deductions been made, (ii) each Borrower shall make any such deductions
and (iii) each Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. In addition, to the
extent not paid in accordance with the preceding sentence, each Borrower shall
pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable law.

 

(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.14, the Borrowers, on a joint and
several basis with any other Borrower, shall indemnify the Agent and each Lender
for Indemnified Taxes and Other Taxes payable by such Person, provided, however,
that no Borrower shall be obligated to make payment to the Agent or any Lender
in respect of penalties, interest and other similar liabilities attributable to
such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes if such penalties, interest or other
similar liabilities are attributable to the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Person seeking indemnification; provided further, that neither
any Lender nor the Agent shall be entitled to indemnification for Indemnified
Taxes and Other Taxes paid by such Person more than three months prior to the
date such Lender or the Agent gives notice and demand thereof to the Borrowers
(except that, if the indemnification is based on a Regulatory Change giving rise
to such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes the effect of which is retroactive,
then the three month period referred to above shall be extended to include the
period of retroactive effect thereof).

(c) If a Lender or the Agent shall become aware that it is entitled to claim a
refund from a Governmental Authority in respect of Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes paid by any Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.6, including Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrowers, or
with respect to which any Borrower has paid Additional Amounts pursuant to the
Loan Documents, it shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower of the
availability of such refund claim and, if the Lender or the Agent, as the case
may be, determines in good faith that making a claim for refund will not have an
adverse effect to its taxes or business operations, it shall, within 10 days
after receipt of a request by the Borrowers, make a claim to such Governmental
Authority for such refund at the expense of the Borrowers. If a Lender or the
Agent receives a refund in respect of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid
by any Borrower pursuant to the Loan Documents, it shall within 30 days from the
date of such receipt pay over such refund to the relevant Borrower (but only to
the extent of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid pursuant to the Loan
Documents, including indemnity payments made or Additional Amounts paid, by the
relevant Borrower under this Section 2.6 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable out of pocket
expenses of such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, and without interest
(other than interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to
such refund).

 

(d) If any Lender or the Agent is or becomes eligible under any applicable law,
regulation, treaty or other rule to a reduced rate of taxation, or a complete
exemption from withholding, with respect to Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes on
payments made to it by the Borrowers or any of them, such Lender or the Agent,
as the case may be, shall, upon the request, and at the cost and expense, of the
Borrowers, complete and deliver from time to time any certificate, form or other
document demanded by the Borrowers, the completion and delivery of which are a
precondition to obtaining the benefit of such reduced rate or exemption,
provided that the taking of such action by such Lender or the Agent, as the case
may be, would not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender or the Agent, as
the case may be, be disadvantageous or prejudicial to such Lender or the Agent,
as the case may be, or inconsistent with its internal policies or legal or
regulatory restrictions. For any period with respect to which a Lender or the
Agent, as the case may be, has failed to provide any such certificate, form or
other document requested by any Borrower, such Lender or the Agent, as the case
may be, shall not be entitled to any payment under this Section 2.6 in respect
of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes that would not have been imposed but for
such failure.

 

(e) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction in the United States
of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia (other than Lenders
that are corporations or otherwise exempt from United States of America backup
withholding Tax) shall (i) deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent, when such
Lender first becomes a Lender, upon the written request of the Borrowers or the
Agent, two original copies of United States of America Internal Revenue Service
Form W-9 or any successor form, properly completed and duly executed by such
Lender, certifying that such Lender is exempt from United States of America
backup withholding Tax on payments of interest made under the Loan Documents and
(ii) thereafter at each time it is so reasonably requested in writing by the
Borrowers or the Agent, deliver within a reasonable time two original copies of
an updated Form W-9 or any successor form thereto.

   

 - 27 -

  

 

(f) Each Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than
the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia
(each such Lender, a “Foreign Lender”) that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding Tax under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrowers are located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with
respect to payments under the Loan Documents shall deliver to the Borrowers and
the Agent, but only at the written request of any Borrower or the Agent, such
properly completed and duly executed documentation prescribed by applicable law
or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent as will permit such
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate, unless in the good
faith opinion of any Foreign Lender such documentation would expose such Foreign
Lender to any material adverse consequence or risk. Such documentation shall be
delivered by such Foreign Lender on or before the date it becomes a Lender. In
addition, each Foreign Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the
obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Foreign
Lender. Each Lender (and, in the case of a Foreign Lender its lending office),
represents that on the Closing Date, payments made hereunder by the Borrowers or
the Agent to it would not be subject to United States of America federal
withholding tax.

 

(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.6(a), the Borrowers shall not be
required to indemnify any Foreign Lender or to pay any Additional Amounts to any
Foreign Lender, in respect of United States of America federal withholding tax
pursuant to Section 2.6(a), (i) to the extent that the obligation to withhold
amounts with respect to United States of America federal withholding tax existed
on the date such Foreign Lender became a Lender; (ii) with respect to payments
to a new lending office with respect to such Lender’s Percentage Share of the
Loan Balance, but only to the extent that such withholding tax exceeds any
withholding tax that would have been imposed on such Lender had it not
designated such new lending office; (iii) with respect to a change by such
Foreign Lender of the jurisdiction in which it is organized, incorporated,
controlled or managed, or in which it is doing business, from the date such
Foreign Lender changed such jurisdiction, but only to the extent that such
withholding tax exceeds any withholding tax that would have been imposed on such
Lender had it not changed the jurisdiction in which it is organized,
incorporated, controlled or managed, or in which it is doing business; or (iv)
to the extent that the obligation to indemnify any Foreign Lender or to pay such
Additional Amounts would not have arisen but for a failure by such Foreign
Lender to comply with the provisions of Section 2.6(f).

 

(h) All payments by any Borrower hereunder shall be made not later than 2:00
p.m., New York time, on the date specified for payment under this Agreement to
the Agent at the account most recently designated by it in Dollars, in
immediately available funds and shall be made without any set of, counterclaim
or deduction whatsoever. Any payment received after 2:00 p.m., New York time,
may, in Agent’s discretion, be deemed to have been made on the next succeeding
Business Day for all purposes. Except as provided to the contrary herein, if the
due date of any payment hereunder or under any Note would otherwise fall on a
day which is not a Business Day, such date shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day, and interest shall be payable for any principal so
extended for the period of such extension.

2.7 Pro Rata Treatment; Adjustments.

 

(a) Except to the extent otherwise expressly provided herein (for the avoidance
of doubt, including Section 9.9), (i) the borrowings pursuant to this Agreement
shall be made from the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective
Percentage Shares, (ii) each payment by the Borrowers of fees shall be made for
the account of the Agent or the Lenders as agreed among them, (iii) each payment
in reduction of the Loan Balance shall be made for the account of the Lenders
pro rata in accordance with their respective shares of the Loan Balance, (iv)
each payment of interest hereunder shall be made for the account of the Lenders
pro rata in accordance with their respective shares of the aggregate amount of
interest due and payable to the Lenders, and (v) each payment by the Borrowers
under Commodity Hedge Agreements with a Lender shall be made only to the Person
or Persons entitled thereto.

 

(b) The Agent shall distribute all payments with respect to the Obligations to
the Lenders promptly upon receipt in like funds as received. In the event that
any payments made hereunder by the Borrowers or one or more of them at any
particular time are insufficient to satisfy in full the Obligations due and
payable at such time, such payments shall be applied (i) first, to fees and
expenses due pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan Document,
(ii) second, to accrued interest, (iii) third, ratably to pay the Prepayment
Fee, if any, due on the Term Loans (including, for the avoidance of any doubt,
any Prepayment Fee due resulting from the prepayment of principal under clause
(iv) of this clause (b)), (iv) fourth, ratably to pay the principal amount of
all Term Loans (or being repaid at such time), (v) fifth, to any other
Obligations pro-rata on the basis of the ratio of the amount of all such
Obligations then owing to the Agent or the relevant Lender or Affiliate of any
Lender, as the case may be, to the total amount of the Obligations then owing,
and (vi) sixth, to the Borrowers.

 

(c) If any Lender (for purposes of this Section 2.7(c), a “Benefited Lender”)
shall at any time receive any payment of all or part of its portion of the
Obligations, or receive any Collateral in respect thereof (whether voluntarily
or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or proceedings of the nature
referred to in Section 7.1(e) or Section 7.1(f) or otherwise) in an amount
greater than such Lender was entitled to receive pursuant to the terms hereof,
such Benefited Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders such
portion of the Obligations of such other Lenders, or shall provide such other
Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral or the proceeds thereof, as
shall be necessary to cause such Benefited Lender to share the excess payment or
benefits of such collateral or proceeds with each of the Lenders according to
the terms hereof. If all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is
thereafter recovered from such Benefited Lender, such purchase shall be
rescinded and the purchase price and benefits returned by such Lender, to the
extent of such recovery, but without interest. The Borrowers agree that each
such Lender so purchasing a portion of the Obligations of another Lender may
exercise all rights of payment (including rights of set-off) with respect to
such portion as fully as if such Lender were the direct holder of such portion.
If any Lender ever receives, by voluntary payment, exercise of rights of set-off
or banker’s lien, counterclaim, cross-action or otherwise, any funds of any
Borrowers to be applied to the Obligations, or receives any proceeds by
realization on or with respect to any Collateral, all such funds and proceeds
shall be forwarded immediately to the Agent for distribution in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

2.8 Voluntary Prepayments. Subject to applicable provisions of this Agreement,
the Borrowers shall have the right, at any time or from time to time, to prepay
the Loan Balance; provided, however, that (a) the Borrowers shall give the Agent
written notice of each such prepayment no less than three (3) Business Days
prior to prepayment (the “Prepayment Notice”), (b) any voluntary prepayment
shall be in a minimum amount of (i) if being paid in whole, the Obligations, and
(ii) if being paid in part, $100,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 in
excess of that amount, (c) the Borrowers shall pay all accrued and unpaid
interest on the amounts prepaid, and (d) no such prepayment shall serve to
postpone the repayment when due of any Obligation or any installments thereof.
Upon the giving of any such Prepayment Notice, the principal amount of the Term
Loans specified in such Prepayment Notice, together with the interest then
accrued but unpaid on such principal amount and any Prepayment Fee with respect
thereto, shall become due and payable on the prepayment date specified therein
and shall be irrevocable; provided that any Prepayment Notice may state that
such notice is conditional upon the consummation of an acquisition or sale
transaction or upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or the receipt
of the proceeds from the issuance of other Indebtedness or capital stock or the
occurrence of any other specified event, in which case such Prepayment Notice
may be revoked by the Borrowers by notice to the Agent on or prior to the date
if such condition is not satisfied.

 

2.9 Mandatory Prepayments.

 

(a) In addition to payments in reduction of the Loan Balance provided for in
Section 2.3, the Borrowers shall promptly pay to the Agent, for application to
reduce the amount of the payment due at the Maturity Date to repay the then
existing Loan Balance in full all proceeds (net of reasonable and customary
transaction costs) from:

 

(i) the incurrence of any Indebtedness not permitted by the proviso to Section
6.1 (without waiving or modifying in any way remedies available to the Agent or
the Lenders as a result of any Event of Default arising from such incurrence of
Indebtedness by any one or more of the Borrowers);

 

(ii) any asset sales not permitted by the proviso to Section 6.4 (without
waiving or modifying in any way remedies available to the Agent or the Lenders
as a result of any Event of Default arising from such asset sales by any one or
more of the Borrowers); provided, that such proceeds shall be applied as soon as
possible, and in any event, within five (5) days after the receipt of such
proceeds; provided, further, however, that upon the Agent’s prior written
consent, such proceeds shall not be required to be so applied on such date so
long as no Event of Default then exists and the Borrowers have delivered a
certificate to the Agent on such date stating that such proceeds shall be used
to invest in or replace or restore any properties or assets (and, if such
investment is in Oil and Gas Properties, that such investment complies with
Section 6.19 of this Agreement) in respect of which such proceeds were paid
within 90 days following the date of the receipt of such proceeds (which
certificate shall set forth the estimates of the proceeds to be so expended),
and provided further, that if all or any portion of such proceeds are not so
used within 90 days after the date of the receipt of such proceeds (or such
earlier date, if any, as the Borrowers determine not to reinvest such proceeds
as set forth above), or, if later, within 90 days after the Borrowers have
entered into a binding commitment (prior to the end of the referenced 90-day
period) to reinvest such proceeds, such remaining portion shall be applied on
the last day of such period (or such earlier date, as the case may be) as
provided above in this Section 2.9(a)(ii) without regard to the immediately
preceding proviso.

   

 - 30 -

  

 

(iii) any insurance claim, except as to any proceeds allowed by the Agent to
repair or replace damaged Property giving rise to the relevant insurance claim;
provided that no prepayment shall be required pursuant to this Section
2.9(a)(iii) to the extent the net cash proceeds from such insurance claims do
not exceed $500,000 in a single transaction or related series of transactions or
$1,000,000 in the aggregate for the term of this Agreement (and only such excess
shall be required to be prepaid) and to the extent any net cash proceeds from
such insurance claims remain after the foregoing application to the Obligations,
the remaining Commitments of the Lenders shall be permanently reduced dollar for
dollar on a pro rata basis by such remaining net cash proceeds; provided,
however, that upon the Agent’s prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), so long as no Event of Default then exists,
such net cash proceeds shall be made available for use by the applicable
Borrower to pay or recover the costs of restoring, repairing or replacing the
affected Property during the period of 180 days after the applicable Borrower’s
receipt thereof.

 

(b) If, for any fiscal quarter of the Borrowers, commencing with the fiscal
quarter ending September 30, 2020, such Excess Cash Flow shall be a positive
number, on or before the Excess Cash Flow Application Date for such fiscal
quarter, the Borrowers shall prepay, without any premium or penalty, an
aggregate principal amount of Term Loan equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of
such Excess Cash Flow. Each such prepayment shall be accompanied by a Cash Flow
Sweep Worksheet in the form of Exhibit E, and made on or before the date (the
“Excess Cash Flow Application Date”) that is the third (3rd) Business Day
following the date on which the financial statements of the Borrowers for the
fiscal quarter most recently ended are delivered (or if earlier, required to be
delivered) pursuant to Section 5.3.

 

(c) The Borrowers shall provide one (1) Business Day’s prior written notice of
any mandatory prepayment required hereunder. Any prepayment under clauses
(a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iii) or (a)(iv) above shall be accompanied by a payment of
the Prepayment Fee related thereto. Upon such prepayment, the Prepayment Fee
shall become immediately due and payable, and the Borrowers shall pay such
Prepayment Fee, as compensation to the Lenders for the loss of their investment
opportunity and not as a penalty, whether or not an Insolvency Proceeding has
commenced, and (if an Insolvency Proceeding has commenced) without regard to
whether such Insolvency Proceeding is voluntary or involuntary, or whether
payment occurs pursuant to a motion, plan of reorganization, or otherwise, and
without regard to whether the Term Loans and other Obligations are satisfied or
released by foreclosure (whether or not by power of judicial proceeding), deed
in lieu of foreclosure or by any other means. Without limiting the foregoing,
any redemption, prepayment, or payment of the Obligations in or in connection
with an Insolvency Proceeding shall constitute an optional prepayment thereof
and require the immediate payment of the Prepayment Fee. Any Prepayment Fee
pursuant to this clause (c) shall be presumed to be liquidated damages sustained
by each Lender as the result of the redemption and/or acceleration of its Term
Loan and each Borrower agrees that it is reasonable under the circumstances in
view of the impracticability and extreme difficulty of ascertaining actual
damages and by mutual agreement of the parties as to a reasonable calculation of
each Lender’s lost profits as a result thereof.

  

 - 31 -

  

 

(d) As soon as practicable after any Borrower has knowledge that a prepayment
pursuant to clauses (a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iii) or (a)(iv) above is required to be
paid, such Borrower shall deliver to the Agent a certificate of a Financial
Officer demonstrating the calculation of the amount of the applicable net
proceeds or other applicable financial tests or proceeds giving rise to the
prepayment, as the case may be. In the event that any Borrower shall
subsequently determine that the actual amount received exceeded the amount set
forth in such certificate, such Borrower shall promptly make an additional
prepayment of the Term Loans in such excess, and such Borrower shall
concurrently therewith deliver to the Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer
demonstrating the calculation of such excess.

 

Upon receipt of any payment, Prepayment Notice or other prepayment to be made,
the Agent shall promptly calculate and notify the Borrowers of the amount of the
payment or prepayment required pursuant to Section 2.7, Section 2.8 and Section
2.9 and such determination shall be binding on the Borrowers, absent manifest
error.

 

2.10 Loans to Satisfy Obligations of Borrowers. Upon the occurrence and during
the continuation of a Default or an Event of Default, the Lenders may, but shall
not be obligated to, make loans for the benefit of the Borrowers or any of them
and apply proceeds thereof to the satisfaction of any condition, warranty,
representation or covenant of any Borrowers contained in this Agreement or any
other Loan Document. Such loans shall be and shall bear interest at the Contract
Rate, subject, however, to the provisions of Section 2.3 regarding the accrual
of interest at the Default Rate, which provisions shall be applicable to any
loan made for the benefit of one or more of the Borrowers pursuant to the
preceding sentence of this Section 2.10.

 

2.11 General Provisions Relating to Interest.

 

(a) It is the intention of the parties hereto to comply strictly with the usury
laws of the State of New York and the United States of America. In this
connection, there shall never be collected, charged or received on the sums
advanced hereunder plus the amount of the original issue discount interest in
excess of that which would accrue at the Highest Lawful Rate.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Notes to the contrary, during any
Limitation Period, the interest rate to be charged on amounts evidenced by the
Notes shall be the Highest Lawful Rate, and the obligation, if any, of the
Borrowers for the payment of fees or other charges deemed to be interest under
applicable law shall be suspended. During any period or periods of time
following a Limitation Period, to the extent permitted by applicable laws of the
State of New York or the United States of America, the interest rate to be
charged hereunder shall remain at the Highest Lawful Rate until such time as
there has been paid to each applicable Lender (i) the amount of interest in
excess of that accruing at the Highest Lawful Rate that such Lender would have
received during the Limitation Period had the interest rate remained at the
otherwise applicable rate and (ii) all interest and fees otherwise payable to
such Lender but for the effect of such Limitation Period.

  

 - 32 -

  

 

(c) If, under any circumstances, the aggregate amounts paid on the Notes or
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document include amounts which by law are
deemed interest and which would exceed the amount permitted if the Highest
Lawful Rate were in effect, the Borrowers stipulate that such payment and
collection will have been and will be deemed to have been, to the extent
permitted by applicable laws of the State of New York or the United States of
America, the result of mathematical error on the part of the Borrowers, the
Agent and the Lenders; and the party receiving such excess shall promptly refund
the amount of such excess (to the extent only of such interest payments in
excess of that which would have accrued and been payable on the basis of the
Highest Lawful Rate) upon discovery of such error by such party or notice
thereof from the Borrowers. In the event that the maturity of any Obligation is
accelerated, by reason of an election by the Lenders or otherwise, or in the
event of any required or permitted prepayment, then the consideration
constituting interest under applicable laws may never exceed that payable on the
basis of the Highest Lawful Rate, and excess amounts paid which by law are
deemed interest, if any, shall be credited by the Agent and the Lenders on the
principal amount of the Obligations, or if the principal amount of the
Obligations shall have been paid in full, refunded to the Borrowers.

 

(d) All sums paid, or agreed to be paid, to the Agent and the Lenders for the
use, forbearance and detention of the proceeds of any advance hereunder shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and
spread throughout the full term hereof until paid in full so that the actual
rate of interest is uniform but does not exceed the Highest Lawful Rate
throughout the full term hereof.

 

2.12 Increased Costs, etc.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.14 (which shall be controlling with
respect to the matters covered thereby), if any Change in Law: (i) subjects any
Lender (or its applicable lending office) to any additional Tax (other than (A)
any Tax on the net income of such Lender or any of its Tax Related Persons, (B)
any Taxes described in clauses (B) through (E) of the definition of Excluded
Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes, and without duplication as to amounts
payable to such Lender pursuant to Section 2.14) with respect to this Agreement
or any of the other Loan Documents or any of its obligations hereunder or
thereunder or any payments to such Lender (or its applicable lending office) of
principal, interest, fees or any other amount payable hereunder; (ii) imposes,
modifies or holds applicable any reserve (including any marginal, emergency,
supplemental, special or other reserve), special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC
insurance or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits or other
liabilities in or for the account of, or advances or loans by, or other credit
extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office of any Lender; or
(iii) imposes any other condition (other than with respect to a Tax matter) on
or affecting any Lender (or its applicable lending office) or its obligations
hereunder; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to
such Lender of agreeing to make Loans hereunder or to reduce any amount received
or receivable by such Lender (or its applicable lending office) with respect
thereto; then, in any such case, the Borrowers shall promptly pay to such
Lender, upon receipt of the statement referred to in the next sentence, such
additional amount or amounts (in the form of an increased rate of, or a
different method of calculating, interest or otherwise as such Lender in its
sole discretion shall determine) as may be necessary to compensate such Lender
for any such increased cost or reduction in amounts received or receivable
hereunder, provided that such amounts are reasonably determined. Such Lender
shall deliver to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Agent) a written statement,
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for calculating the additional
amounts owed to such Lender under this Section 2.12, which statement shall be
conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto absent manifest error.

  

 - 33 -

  

 

(b) Failure or delay on the part of any to demand compensation pursuant to this
Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such
compensation; provided that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a
Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions
suffered more than nine (9) months prior to the date that such Lender, as the
case may be, notifies the Borrowers of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender’s intention to claim
compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine (9) month period
referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof).

 

2.13 Taxes; Withholding, etc.

 

(a) Payments to Be Free and Clear. All sums payable by any Borrower hereunder
and under the other Loan Documents shall (except to the extent required by law)
be paid free and clear of, and without any deduction or withholding on account
of, any Tax.

 

(b) Withholding of Taxes. If any Borrower or any other Person is required by law
(as determined by the relevant withholding agent in good faith) to make any
deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax from any sum paid or
payable under any of the Loan Documents: (i) the Borrowers shall notify the
Agent of any such requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as
the Borrowers becomes aware of it; (ii) the Borrowers shall be entitled to make
such deduction or withholding and shall pay any such Tax to the relevant
Governmental Authority before the date on which penalties attach thereto; (iii)
the sum payable by such Borrower in respect of which the relevant deduction or
withholding is required shall be increased to the extent necessary to ensure
that after any such deduction or withholding, the Agent or such Lender, as the
case may be, and each of their Tax Related Persons receives on the due date a
net sum equal to what it would have received had no such deduction or
withholding been required; and (iv) within thirty (30) days after making any
such deduction or withholding, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Agent the
original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by the relevant Governmental
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment,
or other evidence of such payment satisfactory to the Agent; provided, no such
additional amount shall be required to be paid to the Agent, any Lender or any
Tax Related Person under clause (iii) above with respect to any (A) Taxes on the
net income with respect to any Lender or the Agent or any Tax Related Person,
(B) branch profits Taxes imposed by the United States, (C) U.S. federal
withholding Taxes to the extent such Tax withholding or deduction requirement is
in effect and applicable, as of the date hereof (in the case of each Lender
listed on the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date) (or, if later, the
date on which such Lender designates a new lending office) or on the effective
date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which such Lender became a Lender
(in the case of each other Lender), except to the extent that, pursuant to
Section 2.13, amounts with respect to such Taxes were payable to such Lender
immediately before it changed its lending office or such Lender’s assignor
(including each of their Tax Related Persons) immediately before such Lender
becomes a party hereto, (D) Taxes attributable to such Lender, the Agent and/or
their Tax Related Person’s failure to comply with Section 2.13(e) or Section
2.13(i), or (E) U.S. federal withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA
(collectively, “Excluded Taxes”).

  

 - 34 -

  

 

(c) Other Taxes. In addition, the Borrowers shall pay all Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authorities in accordance with applicable law. The
Borrowers shall deliver to the Agent official receipts or other evidence of such
payment satisfactory to the Agent in respect of any Taxes or Other Taxes payable
hereunder promptly after payment of such Taxes or Other Taxes.

 

(d) Indemnification by the Borrowers. The Borrowers shall indemnify the Agent
and each Lender, within ten (10) days after written demand therefor, for the
full amount of any Taxes paid or incurred by the Agent or such Lender or their
respective Tax Related Persons, as the case may be, relating to, arising out of,
or in connection with any Loan Document or any payment or transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority and all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred in enforcing the provisions of this
Section 2.13; provided, however, that the Borrowers shall not be required to
indemnify the Agent and Lenders for any Excluded Taxes. A certificate from the
relevant Lender or the Agent, setting forth in reasonable detail the basis and
calculation of such Taxes shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

 

(e) Administrative Requirements; Forms Provision. Each Lender that is not a
United States Person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Internal Revenue Code) for U.S. federal income tax purposes shall, to the extent
it is legally eligible to do so, deliver to the Agent for transmission to the
Borrowers, on or prior to the Closing Date (in the case of each Lender listed on
the signature pages hereof on the Closing Date) or on or prior to the date of
the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it becomes a Lender (in the case of
each other Lender), and at such other times as may be necessary in the
determination of the Borrowers or the Agent (each in the reasonable exercise of
its discretion), whichever of the following is applicable (i) executed copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form W 8BEN or W-8BEN-E, properly completed and duly
executed by such Lender, and such other documentation required under the
Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent to
establish that such Lender and its Tax Related Persons are not subject to
deduction or withholding of U.S. federal income tax with respect to any payments
to such Lender of principal, interest, fees or other amounts payable under any
of the Loan Documents or is subject to deduction or withholding at a reduced
rate, (ii) two copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, (iii) if such
Lender is claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under
Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, (x) a U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, and (y)
executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN and W-8BEN-E and such
other documentation required under the Internal Revenue Code and reasonably
requested by the Borrowers or the Agent to establish that such Lender and its
Tax Related Persons are not subject to deduction or withholding of U.S. federal
income tax with respect to any payments to such Lender of interest and other
amounts payable under any of the Loan Documents and (iv) to the extent a Lender
is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8IMY, accompanied by Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate, Internal
Revenue Service Form W-9 and such other documentation required under the
Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent to
establish that Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding of U.S. federal
income tax with respect to any payments to such Lender of interest and other
amounts applicable under the Loan Documents. Each Lender required to deliver any
forms, certificates or other evidence with respect to U.S. federal income tax
withholding matters pursuant to this Section 2.13(e) hereby agrees, from time to
time after the initial delivery by such Lender of such forms, certificates or
other evidence, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders such
forms, certificates or other evidence obsolete or inaccurate in any material
respect, that such Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so,
promptly deliver to the Agent for transmission to the Borrowers two new copies
of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, W-8IMY or W-8ECI, and as
applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate properly completed and duly
executed by such Lender, and such other documentation required under the
Internal Revenue Code and reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Agent to
confirm or establish that such Lender is not subject to deduction or withholding
of U.S. federal income tax with respect to payments to such Lender under the
Loan Documents or is subject to deduction or withholding at a reduced rate, or
notify the Agent and the Borrowers of its inability to deliver any such forms,
certificates or other evidence. Any Lender or the Agent that is a “United States
person” within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Internal Revenue Code
shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent a properly completed and duly
executed original of IRS Form W-9 or such other documentation or information
prescribed by applicable U.S. federal law or reasonably requested by the
Borrowers or the Agent as will enable the Borrowers to determine whether or not
such Person is subject to backup withholding or information reporting
requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, or
any other provision of any Loan Document, if any Lender shall have satisfied the
requirements of the first sentence of this Section 2.13(e) on the Closing Date
or on the date of the Assignment Agreement pursuant to which it became a Lender,
the Borrowers shall have an obligation to pay to such Lender any additional
amounts pursuant to this Section 2.13 (notwithstanding clause (E) of the
definition of “Excluded Taxes”) in the event that, as a result of any change in
any applicable law, treaty or governmental rule, regulation or order, or any
change in the interpretation, administration or application thereof, such Lender
is no longer properly entitled to deliver forms, certificates or other evidence
at a subsequent date establishing the fact that such Lender is not subject to
withholding as described herein. Nothing in this Section 2.13 shall be construed
to require a Lender or the Agent to provide any forms or documentation that it
is not legally entitled to provide.

(f) Treatment of Certain Refunds. If the Agent or any Lender determines in its
sole discretion, acting in good faith, that it has received a refund of any
taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrowers or with respect to
which the Borrowers have paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.13,
it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the
extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower
under this Section 2.13 with respect to the taxes giving rise to such refund),
net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent or such Lender, as the
case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the
Borrowers, upon the request of the Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the
amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any related penalties, interest or other
charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority or expenses related
thereto) to the Agent or such Lender in the event the Agent or such Lender is
required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no event will the Agent or
Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrowers pursuant to this paragraph
(f) the payment of which would place the Agent or Lender, as applicable, in a
less favorable net after-Tax position than the Agent or Lender, as applicable,
would have been if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such
refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the
indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had
never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require the Agent or
any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating
to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrowers or any other Person or
to alter its customary procedures and practices with respect to the
administration of taxes.

 

(g) FATCA Provisions. If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement would
be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were
to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including
those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as
applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent, at the
time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested
by the Borrowers or the Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue
Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or
the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers or the Agent to comply with
their obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with
such Lender’s obligations under FATCA, or to determine the amount to deduct and
withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this paragraph (g), “FATCA”
shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

 

(h) Indemnification by the Lenders. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the
Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Taxes other than
Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any
Borrower has not already indemnified the Agent for such Taxes and without
limiting the obligation of the Borrowers to do so), and (ii) any Excluded Taxes
attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent
in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or
legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A
certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any
Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender
hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time
owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Agent
to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under
this Section 2.13(h).

 

(i) Status of Agent. On or prior to the date on which the Agent becomes the
Agent under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable
request of a Borrower), the Agent will deliver to the Borrowers either (i) an
executed copy of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, or (ii) with respect to any
amounts received on its own account, an executed copy of an applicable Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8, and (y) with respect to any amounts received for or on
account of any Lender, an executed copy of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY
certifying that it is a U.S. branch that has agreed to be treated as a U.S.
person for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to payments received by
it from the Borrowers in its capacity as Agent, as applicable. The Agent shall
promptly notify the Borrowers at any time it determines that it is no longer in
a position to provide the certification described in the prior sentence.

  

 - 36 -

  

 

(j) Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.13 shall survive the
resignation or replacement of the Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the
replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.

 

2.14 Replacement Lenders.

 

(a) If any Lender has notified the Borrowers of its incurring any loss, cost or
expense under Section 2.12, the Borrowers may, unless such Lender has notified
the Borrowers that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer apply,
terminate, in whole but not in part, the Commitment of such Lender (other than
Woodbine or its Affiliates) (the “Terminated Lender”) at any time upon five (5)
Business Days’ prior written notice to the Terminated Lender and the Agent (such
notice referred to herein as a “Notice of Termination”).

 

(b) In order to effect the termination of the Commitment of the Terminated
Lender, the Borrowers shall (i) obtain an agreement with one or more Lenders to
increase their Commitments and/or (ii) request any one or more other banking
institutions to become a “Lender” in place and instead of such Terminated Lender
and agree to accept a Commitment; provided, however, that such one or more other
banking institutions are reasonably acceptable to the Agent and become parties
hereto by executing an Assignment Agreement (the Lenders or other banking
institutions that agree to accept in whole or in part the Commitment of the
Terminated Lender being referred to herein as the “Replacement Lenders”), such
that the aggregate increased and/or accepted Commitments of the Replacement
Lenders under clauses (i) and (ii) immediately above equal the Commitment of the
Terminated Lender.

 

(c) The Notice of Termination shall include the name of the Terminated Lender,
the date the termination will occur (the “Termination Date”), the Replacement
Lender or Replacement Lenders to which the Terminated Lender will assign its
Commitment, and, if there will be more than one Replacement Lender, the portion
of the Terminated Lender’s Commitment to be assigned to each Replacement Lender.

 

(d) On the Termination Date, (i) the Terminated Lender shall, by execution and
delivery of an Assignment Agreement, assign its Commitment to the Replacement
Lender or Replacement Lenders (pro rata, if there is more than one Replacement
Lender, in proportion to the portion of the Terminated Lender’s Commitment to be
assigned to each Replacement Lender) indicated in the Notice of Termination and
shall assign to the Replacement Lender or Replacement Lenders its Percentage
Share of the Loan Balance pro rata as aforesaid, (ii) the Terminated Lender
shall endorse its Note, payable, without recourse, representation or warranty,
to the order of the Replacement Lender or Replacement Lenders (pro rata as
aforesaid), (iii) the Replacement Lender or Replacement Lenders shall purchase
the Note held by the Terminated Lender (pro rata as aforesaid) at a price equal
to the unpaid principal amount thereof plus interest and fees, if any, accrued
and unpaid to the Termination Date and (iv) the Replacement Lender or
Replacement Lenders will thereupon (pro rata as aforesaid) succeed to and be
substituted in all respects for the Terminated Lender with like effect as if
becoming a Lender pursuant to the terms of Section 9.1(b), and the Terminated
Lender will have the rights and benefits of an assignor under Section 9.1(b). To
the extent not in conflict, the terms of Section 9.1(b) shall supplement the
provisions of this Section 2.14.

  

 - 37 -

  

 

(e) Any Terminated Lender shall reimburse the Borrowers for all reasonable and
necessary fees and expenses of counsel to the Borrowers and, if required by the
Replacement Lender or Replacement Lenders, of counsel to the Replacement Lender
or Replacement Lenders in connection with replacing such Terminated Lender with
a Replacement Lender or Replacement Lenders.

 

2.15 Security Interest in Accounts; Right of Offset. As security for the payment
and performance of the Obligations, the Borrowers hereby transfer, assign and
pledge to the Agent and each Lender (for the pro rata benefit of all Lenders)
and grant to the Agent and each Lender (for the pro rata benefit of all Lenders)
a security interest in all funds of such Borrower now or hereafter or from time
to time on deposit with the Agent or such Lender, with such interest of the
Agent and the Lenders to be retransferred, reassigned and/or released at the
expense of the Borrowers upon payment in full and complete performance by the
Borrowers of all Obligations. All remedies as secured party or assignee of such
funds shall be exercisable by the Agent and the Lenders with the oral consent
(confirmed promptly in writing) of the Required Lenders upon the occurrence of
any Event of Default, regardless of whether the exercise of any such remedy
would result in any penalty or loss of interest or profit with respect to any
withdrawal of funds deposited in a time deposit account prior to the maturity
thereof. Furthermore, the Borrowers hereby grant to the Agent and each Lender
(for the pro rata benefit of all Lenders) the right, exercisable at such time as
any Obligation shall mature, whether by acceleration of maturity or otherwise,
of offset or banker’s lien against all funds of such Borrowers now or hereafter
or from time to time on deposit with the Agent or such Lender, regardless of
whether the exercise of any such remedy would result in any penalty or loss of
interest or profit with respect to any withdrawal of funds deposited in a time
deposit account prior to the maturity thereof. If the foregoing provisions
conflict with the provisions of any of the Security Documents, the relevant
provision of the relevant Security Document shall control.

 

2.16 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in the
event that it becomes unlawful for any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office
to maintain loans bearing interest at a rate determined by the Agent to exceed
the Highest Lawful Rate, then the Agent shall charge an interest rate with
respect to the Term Loan that will approximate the Contract Rate or Default
Rate, as applicable, that was initially agreed to in this Agreement by the
parties hereto as reasonably determined by the Agent such that the interest no
longer exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate.

 

2.17 Power of Attorney. The Borrowers hereby designate the Agent as its agent
and attorney-in-fact, to act in its name, place and stead solely for the purpose
of completing and delivering any and all of the letters in lieu of transfer or
division orders delivered by such Borrowers pursuant to the provisions of clause
(i) of Article III or Section 5.7, including completing any blanks contained in
such letters and attaching exhibits thereto describing the relevant Collateral.
The Borrowers hereby ratify and confirm all that the Agent shall lawfully do or
cause to be done by virtue of this power of attorney and the rights granted with
respect to such power of attorney. This power of attorney is coupled with the
interest of the Agent and the Lenders in the Collateral, shall commence and be
in full force and effect as of the Closing Date and shall remain in full force
and effect and shall be irrevocable so long as any Obligations (other than
Contingent Obligations with respect to which no claim has been made) remain
outstanding. The powers conferred on the Agent by this appointment are solely to
protect the interests of the Agent and the Lenders under the Loan Documents and
Commodity Hedge Agreements with respect to the assignment of production proceeds
under certain of the Security Documents and shall not impose any duty upon the
Agent to exercise any such powers. The power of attorney under this Section 2.17
is expressly limited to the rights and powers set forth herein and no additional
rights or powers are herein created or implied. The Agent shall be accountable
only for amounts that it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such
powers and shall not be responsible to the Borrowers or any other Person for any
act or failure to act with respect to such powers, except for gross negligence
or willful misconduct.

 

2.18 Keepwell. Each Qualified ECP Borrower hereby jointly and severally,
absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or
other support as may be needed from time to time by each other Borrower to honor
all of its obligations in respect of Swap Obligations constituting a portion of
the Obligations; provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Borrower shall only
be liable under this Section 2.18 for the maximum amount of such liability that
can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section
2.18, or otherwise hereunder or under any other Loan Document, voidable under
applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not
of any greater amount. The obligations of each Qualified ECP Borrower under this
Section 2.18 shall remain in full force and effect until the Obligations are
paid and performed in full. Each Qualified ECP Borrower intends that this
Section 2.18 constitute, and this Section 2.18 shall be deemed to constitute, a
“keepwell, support or other agreement” for the benefit of each other Borrower
for all purposes of Section 1a(18)(A)(v)(II) of the Commodity Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, the Obligations owed by any Borrower or secured by any Lien granted by
such Borrowers under any Loan Document shall exclude all Excluded Swap
Obligations with respect to such Borrower.

 

2.19 Joint and Several Liability. The Borrowers acknowledge and agree that each
Borrower shall be jointly and severally liable for all obligations of the
Borrowers or any of them hereunder or under any other Loan Document.

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

To induce the Agent and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to induce
the Lenders to make the Term Loan, the Borrowers represent and warrant to the
Agent and each Lender (which representations and warranties shall survive the
delivery of the Notes) that:

 

4.1 Due Authorization. The execution and delivery by the Borrowers of this
Agreement and the borrowing hereunder, the execution and delivery by the
Borrowers of the Notes, the repayment of the Notes, payment of interest and fees
provided for in the Notes and this Agreement, the execution and delivery by each
Borrower of the Security Documents to which it is a party and the performance by
each Borrower of its obligations under the Loan Documents to which it is a party
are within the power of the relevant Borrower, have been duly authorized by all
necessary action by the relevant Borrower, and do not and will not (a) require
the consent of any Governmental Authority, (b) contravene or conflict with any
Requirement of Law, (c) contravene or conflict with any indenture, instrument or
other agreement to which the relevant Borrower is a party or by which any
Property of the relevant Borrower may be presently bound or encumbered or (d)
result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien in, upon or on any
Property of the relevant Borrower under any such indenture, instrument or other
agreement, other than under any of the Loan Documents to which it is a party.

   

 - 42 -

  

 

4.2 Existence. Each Borrower is a corporation, limited liability company or
limited partnership, as the case may be, duly organized, legally existing and,
if applicable, in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and is duly qualified as a foreign corporation, foreign limited
partnership, or foreign limited liability company, as the case may be, and, if
applicable, is in good standing in all jurisdictions wherein the ownership of
Property or the operation of its business necessitates same, other than those
jurisdictions wherein the failure to so qualify would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

4.3 Valid and Binding Obligations. All Loan Documents to which a Borrower is a
party, when duly executed and delivered by the relevant Borrower, constitute the
legal, valid and binding obligations of the relevant Borrower enforceable
against such Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other laws
affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles of
equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

 

4.4 Security Documents. The provisions of each Security Document executed by the
Borrowers are effective to create, in favor of the Agent, a legal, valid and
enforceable Lien in all right, title and interest of the relevant Borrower in
the Property of such Borrower described therein, which Lien constitutes a
first-priority Lien upon filing with the appropriate government office (except
as to Permitted Liens) on all right, title and interest of the relevant Borrower
in the Property of such Borrower described therein.

 

4.5 Title to Property. (a) Except for such encumbrances, preferential rights,
whether vested or otherwise, and Liens (except Permitted Liens) set forth on
Schedule 4.5A attached hereto, each Borrower has good and defensible title to
all of its material Property, free and clear of all encumbrances, preferential
rights, whether vested or otherwise, and Liens (except Permitted Liens) related
to such Property. Schedule 4.5B attached hereto sets forth a correct and
complete list as of the Closing Date of the location, by state and street
address, of all Real Property owned or leased by each Borrower, together with
the names and addresses of any landlords. Subject to the Permitted Liens, and
subject to any consent or nonconsent elections after the date hereof affecting
such Borrower’s Hydrocarbon Interests, each such Borrower owns at least the net
interests in production attributable to its Hydrocarbon Interests as reflected
in the exhibits to the Mortgages, and the ownership of such Properties shall not
in any material respect obligate such Borrower to bear the costs and expenses
relating to the maintenance, development and operations of each Property in an
amount in excess of its working interest in each Property that is not offset by
a corresponding proportionate increase in such Borrower’s net revenue interest
in such Property.

 

(b) To each Borrower’s knowledge, all material leases and agreements necessary
for the conduct of the business of such Borrower are valid and subsisting, in
full force and effect, and, to such Borrower’s knowledge, there exists no
material default or event or circumstance which with the giving of notice or the
passage of time or both would give rise to a material default under any such
lease or leases.

    

 - 43 -

  

 

(c) To each Borrower’s knowledge, the rights and Properties presently owned,
leased or licensed by such Borrower, including without limitation, all easements
and rights of way, include all material rights and Properties reasonably
necessary to permit such Borrower to conduct its business.

 

(d) To each Borrower’s knowledge, except as set forth on Schedule 4.5C, such
Borrower’s Oil and Gas Properties (if any) (and any Property unitized therewith)
have been maintained, operated and developed in a good and workmanlike manner
and in conformity with all Requirements of Law and in conformity with the
provisions of all leases, subleases or other contracts comprising a part of such
Borrower’s Hydrocarbon Interests and other contracts and agreements forming a
part of such Borrower’s Oil and Gas Properties, in each case, in all material
respects. Specifically in connection with the foregoing and except as in each
case could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (i) no
Oil and Gas Property of any Borrower is subject to having allowable production
reduced below the full and regular allowable level (including the maximum
permissible tolerance) because of any overproduction (whether or not the same
was permissible at the time), (ii) none of the wells comprising a part of any
Borrower’s Oil and Gas Properties (or any Property unitized therewith) is
deviated from the vertical more than the maximum permitted by Requirements of
Law, and such wells are, in fact, bottomed under and are producing from, and the
well bores are wholly within, or otherwise are legally located within, such
Borrower’s Oil and Gas Properties (or in the case of wells located on Properties
unitized therewith, such unitized Properties), (iii) as of the Closing Date, no
Borrower had any plug and abandonment liabilities associated with its or another
Person’s Oil and Gas Properties, including, without limitation, the bonding or
collateralization obligations of such Borrower associated therewith and (iv) as
of the Closing Date, no amounts are owing under any joint operating agreement or
similar arrangement with respect to the Borrowers’ Oil and Gas Properties, in
each case except as set forth on Schedule 4.5C.

 

4.6 Scope and Accuracy of Financial Statements. The draft consolidated Financial
Statements provided to the Agent in satisfaction of the condition set forth in
Section 3.1(f) present fairly (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments) the

automatically become immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand,
protest, notice of protest, default or dishonor, notice of intent to accelerate

as may be provided to the contrary elsewhere herein, all of which are hereby
expressly waived by the Borrowers.

Section 7.1(f) or Section 7.1(g), the Agent may, and upon the request of the
Required Lenders shall, by notice in writing to any Borrower, declare all
Obligations immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest,
notice of protest, default or dishonor, notice of intent to accelerate maturity,
notice of acceleration of maturity or other notice of any kind, except as may be
provided to the contrary elsewhere herein, all of which are hereby expressly
waived by each Borrower.

consent of the Required Lenders (confirmed promptly in writing), and the Agent,
in accordance with the terms hereof, may, in addition to the foregoing in this

pursuant to the Loan Documents.

 

(e) Should the Obligations under the Loan Documents become immediately due and

the Agent shall be entitled to proceed against the Collateral.

 

(f) Proceeds received by the Agent from realization against the Collateral and

ARTICLE VIII

 

THE AGENT

 

8.1 Appointment. Each Lender hereby designates and appoints the Agent as the
agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which
the Agent is a party or under which the Agent is granted any right or remedy.
Each Lender authorizes the Agent, as the agent for such Lender, to take such
action on behalf of such Lender under the provisions of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents to which the Agent is a party or under which the Agent is
granted any right or remedy and to exercise such powers and perform such duties
as are expressly delegated to the Agent by the terms of this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents to which the Agent is a party or under which the Agent is
granted any right or remedy, together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary elsewhere in
this Agreement or in any other Loan Document to which the Agent is a party or
under which the Agent is granted any right or remedy, the Agent shall not have
any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth herein or in any
other Loan Document to which the Agent is a party or under which the Agent is
granted any right or remedy or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender; and
no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities on the part of the Agent shall be read into this Agreement or any
other Loan Document to which the Agent is a party or under which the Agent is
granted any right or remedy or otherwise exist against the Agent.

 

8.2 Delegation of Duties. The Agent may execute any of its duties under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which the Agent is a party or under
which the Agent is granted any right or remedy by or through agents or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. The Agent shall not be responsible to any
Lender for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care.

 

8.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Neither the Agent nor any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates shall be (a)
required to initiate or conduct any litigation or collection proceedings
hereunder, except with the concurrence of the Required Lenders and contribution
by each Lender of its Percentage Share of costs reasonably expected by the Agent
to be incurred in connection therewith, (b) liable for any action lawfully taken
or omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to which the Agent is a party or under
which the Agent is granted any right or remedy (except for gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Agent or such Person as finally judicially determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction) or (c) responsible in any manner to any
Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any
Borrower or any Responsible Officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document
referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agent under or in connection
with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document to which the Agent is a party or
under which the Agent is granted any right or remedy, or for the value,
validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to which the Agent is a party or under
which the Agent is granted any right or remedy or for any failure of any
Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agent shall not
be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document to which the Agent is a party or
under which the Agent is granted any right or remedy, or to inspect the
Properties, books or records of the Borrowers.

  

 - 70 -

  

 

8.4 Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message,
statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine
and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or
Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to
the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent.
The Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof for all
purposes unless and until a written notice of assignment, negotiation or
transfer thereof shall have been received by the Agent. The Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document to which the Agent is a party or under which the Agent is
granted any right or remedy unless it shall first receive such advice or
concurrence of the Required Lenders as it deems appropriate and contribution by
each Lender of its Percentage Share of costs reasonably expected by the Agent to
be incurred in connection therewith. The Agent shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents to which the Agent is a party or under which the Agent is
granted any right or remedy in accordance with a request of the Required
Lenders. Such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
shall be binding upon the Lenders and all future holders of the Notes. In no
event shall the Agent be required to take any action that exposes the Agent to
liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document to which the Agent is a party
or under which the Agent is granted any right or remedy or applicable
Requirement of Law.

 

8.5 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice
of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default unless the Agent has
received written notice from a Lender or the Borrowers referring to this
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a “notice of default.” In the event that the Agent receives such a
notice, the Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Lenders. The Agent
shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event of Default as shall
be reasonably directed by the Required Lenders; provided that unless and until
the Agent shall have received such directions, subject to the provisions of
Section 7.2, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders. In the
event that the officer of the Agent primarily responsible for the lending
relationship with the Borrowers or any Responsible Officer of any Lender
primarily responsible for the lending relationship with the Borrowers becomes
aware that a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall use its good faith efforts to
inform the other Lenders and/or the Agent, as the case may be, promptly of such
occurrence. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, failure to comply with the
preceding sentence shall not result in any liability to the Agent or any Lender.

 

8.6 Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges
that neither the Agent nor any other Lender nor any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates has made
any representation or warranty to such Lender and that no act by the Agent or
any other Lender hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of the
Borrowers, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the
Agent or any Lender to any other Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agent
that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other
Lender, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own appraisal of and investigation into the business,
operations, property, condition (financial and otherwise) and creditworthiness
of the Borrowers and the value of the Properties of the Borrowers and has made
its own decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that
it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender
and based on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
and to make such investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, operations, property, condition (financial and otherwise) and
creditworthiness of the Borrowers and the value of the Properties of the
Borrowers. Except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to
be furnished to the Lenders by the Agent hereunder, the Agent shall not have any
duty or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other
information concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial
and otherwise) or creditworthiness of the Borrowers or the value of the
Properties of the Borrowers which may come into the possession of the Agent or
any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates.

  

 - 71 -

  

 

8.7 Indemnification. Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Agent and its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact and Affiliates (to the extent
not reimbursed by the Borrowers and without limiting the obligation of the
Borrowers to do so), ratably according to the Percentage Share of such Lender,
from and against any and all liabilities, claims, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any
kind whatsoever which may at any time (including any time following the payment
and performance of all Obligations and the termination of this Agreement) be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or any
other document contemplated or referred to herein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or any action taken or omitted by the Agent or any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates under or
in connection with any of the foregoing, including any liabilities, claims,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses and disbursements imposed, incurred or asserted as a result of the
negligence, whether sole or concurrent, of the Agent or any of its officers,
directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates; provided that no
Lender shall be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses or disbursements resulting solely from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Agent or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates, as finally judicially determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction. The agreements in this Section 8.7 shall survive the
payment and performance of all Obligations and the termination of this
Agreement.

 

8.8 Restitution. Should the right of the Agent or any Lender to realize funds
with respect to the Obligations be challenged and any application of such funds
to the Obligations be reversed, whether by Governmental Authority or otherwise,
or should the Borrowers otherwise be entitled to a refund or return of funds
distributed to the Lenders in connection with the Obligations, the Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Lenders of such fact. Not
later than Noon, Eastern Standard or Eastern Daylight Savings Time, as the case
may be, of the Business Day following such notice, each Lender shall pay to the
Agent an amount equal to the ratable share of such Lender of the funds required
to be returned to the Borrowers entitled to such funds. The ratable share of
each Lender shall be determined on the basis of the percentage of the payment
all or a portion of which is required to be refunded originally distributed to
such Lender, if such percentage can be determined, or, if such percentage cannot
be determined, on the basis of the Percentage Share of such Lender. The Agent
shall forward such funds to the relevant Borrower or to the Lender required to
return such funds. If any such amount due to the Agent is made available by any
Lender after Noon, Eastern Standard or Eastern Daylight Savings Time, as the
case may be, of the Business Day following such notice, such Lender shall pay to
the Agent (or the Lender required to return funds to the relevant Borrower, as
the case may be) for its own account interest on such amount at a rate equal to
the Federal Funds Rate for the period from and including the date on which
restitution to the relevant Borrower is made by the Agent (or the Lender
required to return funds to the relevant Borrower, as the case may be) to but
not including the date on which such Lender failing to timely forward its share
of funds required to be returned to the relevant Borrower shall have made its
ratable share of such funds available.

   

 - 72 -

  

 

8.9 Agent in Its Individual Capacity. Lender serving as the Agent hereunder and
its Affiliates may make loans to, accept deposits from, and generally engage in
any kind of business with the Borrowers or any of them as though such Lender
were not the agent hereunder. With respect to any Note issued to the Lender
serving as the agent, such Lender shall have the same rights and powers under
this Agreement as a Lender and may exercise such rights and powers as though it
were not the agent hereunder. The terms “Lender” and “Lenders” shall include the
Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender.

  

8.10 Successor Agent. The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation
to the Lenders and the Borrowers. Upon receipt of any such notice of
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the
Borrower, to appoint from among the Lenders or Affiliates of a Lender a
successor agent for the Lenders; and if no such successor shall have been so
appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment
within 30 days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such
earlier day as shall be agreed by the Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective
Date”), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf
of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth
above; provided that in no event shall any such successor Agent be a Defaulting
Lender. The term “Agent” shall mean such successor agent effective upon its
appointment. The rights, powers and duties of the former Agent as Agent shall be
terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former
Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any holders of the Notes. After
the removal or resignation of any Agent hereunder as Agent, the provisions of
this Article VIII and those of any Section of this Agreement relating to the
Agent, including Section 5.16, Section 5.17, Section 5.21, Section 5.22 and
Section 8.7 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by it while it was Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

 

 - 73 -

  

 

8.11 Applicable Parties. The provisions of this Article VIII are solely for the
benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and none of the Borrowers shall have any
rights as a third party beneficiary or otherwise under any of the provisions of
this Article VIII. In performing functions and duties hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents, the Agent shall act solely as the agent of the Lenders and
does not assume, nor shall it be deemed to have assumed, any obligation or
relationship of trust or agency with or for the Borrowers or any legal
representative, successor or assign of the Borrowers.

 

8.12 Releases. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to release any Collateral
that is permitted to be sold or released pursuant to the terms of the Loan
Documents. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to execute and deliver to the
Borrowers or any of them, at the sole cost and expense of the Borrowers, any and
all releases of Liens, termination statements, assignments or other documents
reasonably requested by the Borrowers in connection with any sale or other
disposition of Property to the extent such sale or other disposition is
permitted by the terms of the Loan Documents.

 

8.13 Credit Bidding. The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Agent, at the
direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the
Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in
satisfaction of some or all of the Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of
foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or
through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral
(a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code,
including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any
similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Borrower is subject, or (b)
at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt
conducted by (or with the consent or at the direction of) the Agent (whether by
judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law. In
connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the
Lenders shall be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the Agent at the
direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Obligations with
respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in
the acquired assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of
such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the
contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) for the
asset or assets so purchased (or for the equity interests or debt instruments of
the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection with such
purchase). In connection with any such bid, (i) the Agent shall be authorized to
form one or more acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to
such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, (ii) each of the Lender’s ratable
interests in the Obligations which were credit bid shall be deemed without any
further action under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles
for the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Agent shall be authorized to
adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or
vehicles (provided that any actions by the Agent with respect to such
acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or
equity interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the
governing documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required
Lenders or their permitted assignees under the terms of this Agreement or the
governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the
case may be, irrespective of the termination of this Agreement and without
giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in
Section 9.9 of this Agreement), (iv) the Agent on behalf of such acquisition
vehicle or vehicles shall be authorized to issue to each of the Lenders, ratably
on account of the relevant Obligations which were credit bid, interests, whether
as equity, partnership interests, limited partnership interests or membership
interests, in any such acquisition vehicle and/or debt instruments issued by
such acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Lender or acquisition
vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that Obligations that
are assigned to an acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for
any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the
amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of
Obligations credit bid by the acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such
Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Lenders pro rata with their
original interest in such Obligations and the equity interests and/or debt
instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle on account of such Obligations
shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Lender or any
acquisition vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable
portion of the Obligations of each Lender are deemed assigned to the acquisition
vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Lender shall execute
such documents and provide such information regarding the Lender (and/or any
designee of the Lender which will receive interests in or debt instruments
issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Agent may reasonably request in
connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the formulation or
submission of any credit bid or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by such credit bid. The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the
Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to consent to or elect not to
object to, any sale free and clear of the security interests granted to the
Agent under the Security Documents conducted under the provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code, including under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy
Code, or any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Borrower is
subject. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Agent shall use best efforts to
consult with the Lenders prior to exercising its rights under this Section 8.13.

ARTICLE IX

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

9.1 Assignments; Participations.

 

(a) None of the Borrowers may assign any of its rights or obligations under any
Loan Document without the prior written consent of the Agent and the Lenders.

 

(b) With the consent of the Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), any Lender may assign to one or more
assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
pursuant to an Assignment Agreement. Any such assignment shall be in the amount
of at least $25,000 (or any whole multiple of $25,000 in excess thereof), unless
the relevant assignment is to an affiliate of the assigning Lender or is an
assignment of the entire Commitment of the assigning Lender. The assignee shall
pay to the Agent, if requested by the Agent, a transfer fee in the amount of
$2,500 for each such assignment. Any such assignment shall become effective upon
receipt by the Agent of all documentation and other information with respect to
the assignee that is required by regulatory authorities under applicable “know
your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
USA Patriot Act, the execution and delivery to the Agent of the Assignment
Agreement and recordation by the Agent in the Register in accordance with this
Section 9.1(b). Promptly following receipt of an executed Assignment Agreement,
the Agent shall send to the Borrowers a copy of such executed Assignment
Agreement. Promptly following receipt of such executed Assignment Agreement, the
Borrowers shall execute and deliver, at their own expense, new Notes to the
assignee and, if applicable, the assignor, in accordance with their respective
interests, whereupon the prior Notes of the assignor and, if applicable, the
assignee, shall be canceled and returned to the Borrowers. Upon the
effectiveness of any assignment pursuant to this Section 9.1(b), the assignee
will become a “Lender,” if not already a “Lender,” for all purposes of the Loan
Documents, and the assignor shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder to
the extent of such assignment. If the assignor no longer holds any rights or
obligations under this Agreement, such assignor shall cease to be a “Lender”
hereunder, except that its rights under Section 5.17, Section 5.21, Section 5.22
and Section 8.7, shall not be affected. On the last Business Day of each month
during which an assignment has become effective pursuant to this Section 9.1(b),
the Agent shall update the Register to show all such assignments effected during
such month and will promptly provide a copy thereof to the Borrowers and each
Lender. Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of Borrowers,
shall maintain at one of its offices located in the Unites States of America a
copy of each Assignment Agreement delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount and stated interest of the Term Loan owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive and the Borrowers, Agent and the Lenders shall
treat each person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms
hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, in the absence
of manifest error. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, any assignment of
any Term Loan shall be effective only upon appropriate entries with respect
thereto being made in the Register. The Register shall be available for
inspection by any Borrower, Agent and any Lender, at any reasonable time and
from time to time upon reasonable prior written notice. This Section shall be
construed so that the Term Loan is at all times maintained in “registered form”
within the meanings of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the IRC and
any related regulations (and any successor provisions).

 

 - 75 -

  

 

(c) Each Lender may transfer, grant or assign participations in all or any
portion of its interests hereunder to any Person pursuant to this Section
9.1(c), provided that such Lender shall remain a “Lender” for all purposes of
this Agreement and the Transferee of such participation shall not constitute a
“Lender” hereunder. In the case of any such participation, the participant shall
not have any rights under any Loan Document, the rights of the participant in
respect of such participation to be against the granting Lender as set forth in
the agreement with such Lender creating such participation, and all amounts
payable by the Borrowers hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not
sold such participation. Each agreement creating a participation must include an
agreement by the participant to be bound by the provisions of Section 8.3,
Section 8.6 and Section 8.7.

 

(d) The Agent or any Lender may furnish any information concerning the Borrowers
in the possession of the Agent or such Lender from time to time to assignees and
participants and prospective assignees and participants.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.1 to the contrary, any Lender
which is a national or state bank may assign and pledge all or any of its Notes
or any interest therein to any Federal Reserve Bank or the Department of the
Treasury of the United States of America as collateral security pursuant to
Regulation A of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any
operating circular issued by such Federal Reserve System and/or such Federal
Reserve Bank. No such assignment or pledge shall release the assigning or
pledging Lender from its obligations hereunder.

 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 9.1, no transfer or
assignment of the interests or obligations of any Lender or grant of
participations therein shall be permitted if such transfer, assignment or grant
would require the Borrowers to file a registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission or any successor Governmental Authority or qualify the
Term Loan under the “Blue Sky” laws of any state.

 

9.2 Survival of Representations, Warranties, and Covenants. All representations
and warranties of the Borrowers and all covenants and agreements herein made by
the Borrowers shall survive the execution and delivery of the Notes and shall
remain in force and effect so long as any Obligation is outstanding.

 

9.3 Notices and Other Communications. Except as to oral notices expressly
authorized herein, if any, which oral notices shall be promptly confirmed in
writing, all notices, requests and communications hereunder shall be in writing
(including by facsimile or electronic mail). Unless otherwise expressly provided
herein, any such notice, request, demand or other communication shall be deemed
to have been duly given or made when delivered personally, or, in the case of
delivery by mail, when deposited in the mail, certified mail with return receipt
requested, postage prepaid, in the case of facsimile notice, when receipt
thereof is acknowledged orally or by written confirmation report or, in the case

Any party may, by proper written notice hereunder to the others, change the
individuals or addresses to which such notices to it shall thereafter be sent.

 

9.4 Parties in Interest. Subject to the restrictions on changes in structure set
forth in Section 6.10 and other applicable restrictions contained herein, all
covenants and agreements herein contained by or on behalf of the Borrowers, the
Agent or the Lenders shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
relevant Borrower, the Agent or the Lenders, as the case may be, and their
respective legal representatives, successors and assigns.

 

9.5 Rights of Third Parties. Except as provided in Section 9.4, all provisions
herein are imposed solely and exclusively for the benefit of the Agent, the
Lenders and the Borrowers and no other Person shall have any right, benefit,
priority or interest hereunder or as a result hereof or have standing to require
satisfaction of provisions hereof in accordance with their terms.

 

 - 77 -

  

 

9.6 Renewals; Extensions. All provisions of this Agreement relating to the Notes
shall apply with equal force and effect to each promissory note hereafter
executed which in whole or in part represents a renewal or extension of any part
of the Indebtedness of the Borrowers under this Agreement, the Notes or any
other Loan Document.

 

9.7 No Waiver; Rights Cumulative. No course of dealing on the part of the Agent
or the Lenders or their officers or employees, nor any failure or delay by the
Agent or the Lenders with respect to exercising any of their rights under any
Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof. The rights of the Agent and the
Lenders under the Loan Documents shall be cumulative and the exercise or partial
exercise of any such right shall not preclude the exercise of any other right.
The making of the Term Loan shall not constitute a waiver of any of the
covenants, warranties or conditions of the Borrowers contained herein. In the
event any of the Borrowers are unable to satisfy any such covenant, warranty or
condition, the making of the Term Loan shall not have the effect of precluding
the Agent or the Lenders from thereafter declaring such inability to be an Event
of Default as hereinabove provided.

 

9.8 Survival Upon Unenforceability. In the event any one or more of the
provisions contained in any of the Loan Documents or in any other instrument
referred to herein or executed in connection with the Obligations shall, for any
reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision
of any Loan Document or of any other instrument referred to herein or executed
in connection with such Obligations.

 

9.9 Amendments; Waivers. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be
amended, waived, discharged or terminated orally, except by an instrument in
writing signed by the Agent and the party against whom enforcement of the
amendment, waiver, discharge or termination is sought. Subject to the preceding
sentence, any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document may be
amended or modified by the Borrowers and the Required Lenders or waived by the
Required Lenders; provided that, notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, (a) no amendment, modification or waiver which (i) extends the
Maturity Date, (ii) forgives the principal amount of any Indebtedness of the
Borrowers outstanding under this Agreement or interest thereon or fees owing
under this Agreement, (iii) releases any guarantor of such Indebtedness, (iv)
releases all or substantially all of the Property of the Borrowers subject to
the Security Documents, (v) postpones any date scheduled for any payment of
principal of, or interest on, any Loan Balance, or any fees or other amounts
payable hereunder to the Lenders or under any other Loan Document to the
Lenders, or reduces the amount of, waives or excuses such payment, changes
Section 2.7 or any other provision of any Loan Document in a manner that would
alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, (vi) reduces the
interest rate applicable to the Loan Balance or the fees payable to the Lenders
generally, (vii) affects this Section 9.9 or (viii) modifies the definition of
“Required Lenders” shall be effective without the unanimous written consent of
all Lenders and the Agent; (b) no amendment, modification or waiver which
increases the Percentage Share of any Lender shall be effective without the
written consent of such Lender and the Agent; (c) in the event Cargill and/or BP
is a Lender, no amendment, modification or waiver which (i) amends or modifies
the definitions of “Approved Hedge Counterparty”, “Minimum Required Commodity
Hedge Agreements” or “Obligations” in this Agreement or any similar term(s) used
or defined in any other Loan Document or (ii) amends, modifies or waives the
terms of Section 5.8 or Section 6.17 of this Agreement, in either case, shall be
effective without the prior written consent of Cargill and/or BP, as the case
may be; and (d) no amendment, modification or waiver which modifies the rights,
duties or obligations of the Agent shall be effective without the written
consent of the Agent.

9.10 Controlling Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of
this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the provisions of this
Agreement shall control.

 

9.11 Disposition of Collateral. Notwithstanding any term or provision, express
or implied, in any of the Security Documents, upon the occurrence and
continuation of an Event of Default, the realization, liquidation, foreclosure
or any other disposition on or of any or all of the Property of the Borrowers
subject to the Security Documents shall be in the order and manner and
determined in the sole discretion of the Agent; provided, however, that in no
event shall the Agent violate applicable law or exercise rights and remedies
other than those provided in such Security Documents or otherwise existing at
law or in equity.

 

9.12 Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be deemed to be contracts
made under and shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of
the State of New York, without giving effect to principles thereof relating to
conflicts of law.

 

9.13 Dispute Resolution. This Section 9.13 contains a jury waiver, a class
action waiver and an arbitration provision. READ CAREFULLY.

 

(a) THIS DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION SHALL SUPERSEDE AND REPLACE ANY PRIOR
“JURY WAIVER,” “JUDICIAL REFERENCE,” “CLASS ACTION WAIVER,” “ARBITRATION,”
“DISPUTE RESOLUTION” OR SIMILAR ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE AGREEMENT OR PROVISION
BETWEEN OR AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO RELATING TO THE TRANSACTION WHICH IS THE
SUBJECT OF THIS AGREEMENT.

 

(b) TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, INTENTIONALLY, IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ITS RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BEFORE A JURY IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM, DISPUTE OR
CONTROVERSY WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (EACH OF
THE FOREGOING, A “DISPUTE”), AND, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW IN THIS SECTION 9.13,
DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY. IF A COURT
DETERMINES THAT THIS PROVISION IS NOT ENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON AND AT ANY TIME
PRIOR TO TRIAL OF THE DISPUTE, BUT NOT LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER ENTRY OF THE
ORDER DETERMINING THIS PROVISION IS UNENFORCEABLE, ANY PARTY HERETO SHALL BE
ENTITLED TO MOVE THE COURT FOR AN ORDER COMPELLING ARBITRATION AND STAYING OR
DISMISSING SUCH LITIGATION PENDING ARBITRATION (AN “ARBITRATION ORDER”). IF
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTY ALSO WAIVES THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE IN
COURT OR AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING ANY DISPUTE AS A CLASS ACTION, EITHER AS A
MEMBER OF A CLASS OR AS A REPRESENTATIVE, OR TO ACT AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY
GENERAL.

  



 - 79 -

  

     

(c) IF A DISPUTE ARISES, AND ONLY IF A JURY TRIAL WAIVER IS NOT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW OR RULING BY A COURT, ANY PARTY MAY REQUIRE THAT THE DISPUTE BE
RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION BEFORE A SINGLE ARBITRATOR. BY AGREEING TO
ARBITRATE A DISPUTE, EACH PARTY HERETO GIVES UP ANY RIGHT THAT PARTY MAY HAVE TO
A JURY TRIAL AS WELL AS OTHER RIGHTS THAT PARTY WOULD HAVE IN COURT THAT ARE NOT
AVAILABLE OR ARE MORE LIMITED IN ARBITRATION, SUCH AS THE RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY
AND TO APPEAL. 

 

ARBITRATION SHALL BE COMMENCED BY FILING A PETITION WITH, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE ARBITRATION RULES OF, THE AAA (THE “ADMINISTRATOR”) AS SELECTED
BY THE INITIATING PARTY. IF THE PARTIES TO THE DISPUTE AGREE, ARBITRATION MAY BE
COMMENCED BY APPOINTMENT OF A LICENSED ATTORNEY WHO IS SELECTED BY THE PARTIES
TO THE DISPUTE AND WHO AGREES TO CONDUCT THE ARBITRATION WITHOUT AN
ADMINISTRATOR. DISPUTES INCLUDE MATTERS (I) RELATING TO A DEPOSIT ACCOUNT,
APPLICATION FOR OR DENIAL OF CREDIT, ENFORCEMENT OF ANY OF THE OBLIGATIONS ANY
PARTY HERETO HAS TO ANY OF THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO, COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE
LAWS AND/OR REGULATIONS, PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER ANY AGREEMENT BY
ANY PARTY HERETO, (II) BASED ON OR ARISING FROM AN ALLEGED TORT OR (III)
INVOLVING ANY PARTY’S EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AFFILIATES OR ASSIGNS, DISPUTES DO NOT,
HOWEVER, INCLUDE THE VALIDITY, ENFORCEABILITY, MEANING OR SCOPE OF THIS
ARBITRATION PROVISION AND SUCH MATTERS MAY BE DETERMINED ONLY BY A COURT. IF A
THIRD PARTY IS A PARTY TO A DISPUTE, EACH PARTY HERETO CONSENTS TO INCLUDING THE
THIRD PARTY IN THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING FOR RESOLVING THE DISPUTE WITH THE
THIRD PARTY. VENUE FOR THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING SHALL BE AT A LOCATION
DETERMINED BY MUTUAL AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES THERETO OR, ABSENT SUCH AN
AGREEMENT, IN THE CITY AND STATE WHERE THE AGENT IS HEADQUARTERED.

 

IF A COURT ISSUES AN ARBITRATION ORDER, ALL PARTIES TO THE DISPUTE THAT DID NOT
SEEK THE ARBITRATION ORDER SHALL COMMENCE ARBITRATION. THE PARTY HERETO THAT
SOUGHT THE ARBITRATION ORDER MAY COMMENCE ARBITRATION, BUT SHALL HAVE NO
OBLIGATION TO DO SO, AND SHALL NOT IN ANY WAY BE ADVERSELY PREJUDICED BY
INITIATING OR PARTICIPATING IN LITIGATION OR ELECTING NOT TO COMMENCE
ARBITRATION. THE ARBITRATOR SHALL (I) HEAR AND RULE ON APPROPRIATE DISPOSITIVE
MOTIONS FOR JUDGMENT ON THE PLEADINGS, FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM OR FOR FULL
OR PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT, (II) RENDER A DECISION AND ANY AWARD APPLYING
APPLICABLE LAW, (III) GIVE EFFECT TO ANY LIMITATIONS PERIOD IN DETERMINING ANY
DISPUTE OR DEFENSE, (IV) ENFORCE THE DOCTRINES OF COMPULSORY COUNTERCLAIM, RES
JUDICATA AND COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL, IF APPLICABLE, (V) WITH REGARD TO MOTIONS AND
THE ARBITRATION HEARING, APPLY RULES OF EVIDENCE GOVERNING CIVIL CASES AND (VI)
APPLY THE LAW OF THE STATE SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT GIVING RISE TO THE
DISPUTE. FILING OF A PETITION FOR ARBITRATION SHALL NOT PREVENT ANY PARTY FROM
(I) SEEKING AND OBTAINING FROM A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION
(NOTWITHSTANDING ONGOING ARBITRATION) PROVISIONAL OR ANCILLARY REMEDIES,
INCLUDING INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, PROPERTY PRESERVATION ORDERS, FORECLOSURE,
EVICTION, ATTACHMENT, REPLEVIN, GARNISHMENT AND/OR THE APPOINTMENT OF A
RECEIVER, (II) PURSUING NON-JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE OR (III) AVAILING ITSELF OF ANY
SELF-HELP REMEDIES, SUCH AS SETOFF AND REPOSSESSION. THE EXERCISE OF SUCH RIGHTS
SHALL NOT CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTE TO ARBITRATION.

  

 - 80 -

  

 

JUDGMENT UPON AN ARBITRATION AWARD MAY BE ENTERED IN ANY COURT HAVING
JURISDICTION, EXCEPT THAT, IF THE ARBITRATION AWARD EXCEEDS $50,000, ANY PARTY
TO THE RELEVANT DISPUTE SHALL BE ENTITLED TO A DE NOVO APPEAL OF THE AWARD
BEFORE A PANEL OF THREE ARBITRATORS. TO ALLOW FOR SUCH APPEAL, IF THE AWARD
(INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATOR’S, THE ARBITRATOR’S AND ATTORNEY’S FEES AND COSTS)
EXCEEDS $50,000, THE ARBITRATOR WILL ISSUE A WRITTEN, REASONED DECISION
SUPPORTING THE AWARD, INCLUDING A STATEMENT OF AUTHORITY AND ITS APPLICATION TO
THE DISPUTE. A REQUEST FOR DE NOVO APPEAL MUST BE FILED WITH THE ARBITRATOR
WITHIN 30 DAYS FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE ARBITRATION AWARD. IF SUCH A REQUEST IS
NOT MADE WITHIN THAT TIME PERIOD, THE ARBITRATION DECISION SHALL BECOME FINAL
AND BINDING. ON APPEAL, THE ARBITRATORS SHALL REVIEW THE AWARD DE NOVO, MEANING
THAT THEY SHALL REACH THEIR OWN FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW, RATHER
THAN DEFERRING IN ANY MANNER TO THE ORIGINAL ARBITRATOR. APPEAL OF AN
ARBITRATION AWARD SHALL BE PURSUANT TO THE RULES OF THE ADMINISTRATOR OR, IF THE
ADMINISTRATOR HAS NO SUCH RULES, THEN THE AAA ARBITRATION APPELLATE RULES SHALL
APPLY.

    

ARBITRATION UNDER THIS PROVISION CONCERNS A TRANSACTION INVOLVING INTERSTATE
COMMERCE AND SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, 9 U.S.C. § 1 ET
SEQ. THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION, AMENDMENT OR
EXPIRATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF THE TERMS OF THIS PROVISION VARY FROM THE
ADMINISTRATOR’S RULES, THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION SHALL CONTROL. (D) EACH PARTY
HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO ONE HAS REPRESENTED TO SUCH PARTY THAT ANY OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE JURY AND CLASS ACTION WAIVERS IN THE EVENT OF
SUIT, AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS, AGREEMENTS
AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.13. THE BORROWERS HEREBY KNOWINGLY,
VOLUNTARILY, INTENTIONALLY, IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER LITIGATION
THAT RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR
THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THE AGENT OR ANY LENDER IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF ANY OF
THE TERMS OR PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR
OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT THERETO. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 9.13 ARE A
MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE AGENT AND EACH OF THE LENDERS TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT.

 

(d) EACH PARTY HERETO (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO ONE HAS REPRESENTED TO SUCH PARTY
THAT ANY OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE JURY AND CLASS ACTION WAIVERS IN
THE EVENT OF SUIT, AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS,
AGREEMENTS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.13.

 

THE BORROWERS HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY, INTENTIONALLY, IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT,
PROCEEDING, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER LITIGATION THAT RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE ACTS OR OMISSIONS OF THE AGENT
OR ANY LENDER IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF ANY OF THE TERMS OR PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR OTHERWISE WITH RESPECT THERETO. THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 9.13 ARE A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR THE AGENT AND EACH
OF THE LENDERS TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.
 



9.14 Jurisdiction and Venue. All actions or proceedings with respect to, arising
directly or indirectly in connection with, out of, related to or from this
Agreement or any other Loan Document may be litigated, at the sole discretion
and election of the Agent, in courts having situs in New York, New York County,
New York. In such regard, each Borrower hereby submits to the jurisdiction of
any local, state or federal court located in New York, New York County, New
York, and hereby waives any rights it may have to transfer or change the
jurisdiction or venue of any litigation brought against it by the Agent or any
Lender in accordance with this Section 9.14.

 

 - 81 -

  

 

9.15 Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents constitute the
entire agreement among the parties hereto and thereto with respect to the
subject hereof and thereof and shall supersede any prior agreement among the
parties hereto and thereto, whether written or oral, relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof, including any term sheet or summary of principal
terms provided to the Borrowers by Arena Investors, LP, the Agent or any Lender.
Furthermore, in this regard, this Agreement and the other written Loan Documents
represent, collectively, the final agreement among the parties thereto and may
not be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral
agreements of such parties. There are no unwritten oral agreements among such
parties.

 

9.16 Waiver of Punitive and Consequential Damages. Each Borrower, the Agent and
each Lender hereby knowingly, voluntarily, intentionally and irrevocably (a)
waives, to the maximum extent it may lawfully and effectively do so, any right
it may have to claim or recover, in any Dispute based hereon or directly or
indirectly at any time arising out of, under or in connection with the Loan
Documents or any transaction contemplated thereby or associated therewith,
before or after maturity, any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential

and all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same
Agreement. In this regard, each of the parties hereto acknowledges that a
counterpart of this Agreement containing a set of counterpart execution pages
reflecting the execution of each party hereto shall be sufficient to reflect the
execution of this Agreement by each party hereto.

 

9.18 USA Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender and the Agent (for itself and not on
behalf of any Lender) hereby notifies each Borrower that, pursuant to the
requirements of the USA Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record
information that identifies each Borrower, which information includes the name
and address of the relevant Borrower and other information that will allow such
Lender or the Agent, as applicable, to identify each Borrower in accordance with
the USA Patriot Act.

 

9.19 Tax Shelter Regulations. None of the Borrowers intend to treat the Term
Loan and related transactions hereunder and under the other Loan Documents as a
“reportable transaction” (within the meanings under current Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6011‑4 and Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4, promulgated
on November 1, 2006). In the event the Borrowers determines to take any action
inconsistent with the foregoing statement, it will promptly notify the Agent
thereof. If the Borrowers so notifies the Agent, the Borrowers acknowledge that
one or more of the Lenders may treat its Percentage Share of the Term Loan and
the related transactions hereunder and under the other Loan Documents as part of
a transaction that is subject to current Treasury Regulation Section 301.6112-1
or Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 301.6112-1, promulgated on November 1,
2006, and, in such case, such Lender or Lenders, as applicable, will maintain
the lists and other records required, if any, by such Treasury Regulations.

   

9.20 Contribution and Indemnification. In the event that the Borrowers pay
(whether through direct payments or as a result of providing Collateral for the
Obligations) any amounts on the Obligations in excess of the relevant Borrowers’
Obtained Benefit (the “Excess Payments”), the relevant Borrower shall be
entitled to make demand on the other Borrowers for such Excess Payments, and to
receive from each other Borrowers that received an Obtained Benefit, such
Borrowers’ Contribution Percentage of the Excess Payment. If any party obligated
to make such a payment is unable to pay the Contribution Percentage of the
Excess Payment, each other Borrowers agrees to make a contribution to the party
entitled to such payment to the extent necessary so that each Borrowers shares
equally the liability for such Excess Payment in relation to the relative
Obtained Benefit received by such Borrowers. In such regard, to the maximum
extent permitted by law, each Borrowers shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the other Borrowers from and against such Borrowers’ Contribution
Percentage of any and all liability, claims, costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) arising with respect to the Obligations
and exceeding such other Borrowers’ Obtained Benefit as provided herein. Any
amount due under this Section 9.20 shall be due and payable within ten days of
demand therefor by the party entitled to payment and shall be made to the party
entitled thereto at the address for notices to the Borrowers under this
Agreement, in immediately available funds, not later than 2:00 p.m., Eastern
Standard or Daylight Time, on the date on which such payment shall come due. The
remedies available to the Borrowers pursuant to the provisions of this Section
9.20 are not exclusive. All rights and claims of contribution, indemnification
and reimbursement under this Section 9.20 shall be subordinate in right of
payment to the prior payment in full of all principal of and interest on the
Term Loan and all fees payable hereunder. The provisions of this Section 9.20
shall, to the extent expressly inconsistent with any provision in any Loan
Document, supersede such inconsistent provision.

 

9.21 Inconsistencies with Other Documents. In the event there is a conflict or
inconsistency between this Agreement and any other Loan Document, the terms of
this Agreement shall control; provided that any provision of the Security
Documents which imposes additional burdens on the Borrowers or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or further restricts the rights of Borrowers or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or gives the Agent or Lenders additional rights
shall not be deemed to be in conflict or inconsistent with this Agreement and
shall be given full force and effect.
