AMENDED AND RESTATED SERVICING AGREEMENT (as amended, modified or supplemented
from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof, the “Agreement” or the
“Servicing Agreement”) dated as of March 3, 2020, among WILLIS ENGINE STRUCTURED
TRUST V (formerly known as Willis Engine Securitization Trust II), a Delaware
statutory trust (“WEST”), WILLIS LEASE FINANCE CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation incorporated under the laws of Delaware, in its capacity as Servicer
(together with its successors and permitted assigns, the “Servicer”) and as the
Administrative Agent, and each member of the Serviced Group from time to time
party hereto.
WHEREAS, WEST, the Servicer and other members of the Serviced Group set forth on
the signature pages hereto entered into a servicing agreement, dated as of
September 17, 2012, pursuant to which the Serviced Group appointed the Servicer,
and the Servicer accepted such appointment (as amended, supplemented and
otherwise modified from time to time prior to the date hereof, the “Original
Servicing Agreement”);
WHEREAS, in connection with the issuance of the Notes on the date hereof under
the Indenture, by this Agreement, the parties hereto desire to amend and restate
the Original Servicing Agreement in its entirety as set forth herein;
NOW, THEREFORE, for the consideration set forth herein and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, each of the
parties hereto, and each Person that becomes a party hereto pursuant to a
Serviced Group Member Supplement, hereby agrees as follows:
ARTICLE 1
DEFINITIONS
SECTION 1.01.    Definitions. The terms used herein have the meaning assigned to
them in Appendix A hereto. Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized
terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to such terms in
the Indenture.
ARTICLE 2

APPOINTMENT; SERVICES
SECTION 2.01.    Appointment.
(a)    Each Person within the Serviced Group hereby appoints the Servicer as the
exclusive provider of the Services (as defined in Section 2.02(a) below) to each
such Person in respect of the Assets on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement.
(b)    The Servicer hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to perform the
Services on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.
In connection with the provision of the Services with respect to the Assets, the
Servicer generally shall, where and to the extent practicable and in the case of
Services that are not performed by the Servicer directly, contract for or
otherwise obtain goods and services from third party providers in the name of,

as disclosed agent for, the relevant Person within the Serviced Group. If the
Servicer shall not have contracted for or otherwise obtained such goods and
services in the name of, or as disclosed agent for, the relevant Person within
the Serviced Group, the Servicer shall use its reasonable efforts to cause WEST
or such Subsidiary to be in a position to have direct recourse against any such
third party provider providing goods and services for WEST or such Subsidiary
for any breaches by such third party provider related to the provision of such
goods and services.
(c)    WEST hereby warrants and represents to the Servicer that it and each
Subsidiary has appointed or will appoint the Administrative Agent to act as its
representative with respect to any matter in respect of which any Person within
the Serviced Group is required or permitted to take any action pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement. Accordingly, in connection with the performance of the
Services, unless an Administrative Agent Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, or unless earlier notified by WEST that the appointment of
the Administrative Agent to act on behalf of each Person within the Serviced
Group has not become effective or has been revoked or terminated, the Servicer
shall in all cases be entitled to rely on the instructions (or other actions) of
the Administrative Agent as representative of each Person within the Serviced
Group other than the actions specified in Section 7.06(a)(i) and 7.06(a)(iv).
SECTION 2.02.    Services.
(a)    The services to be provided by the Servicer in respect of the Assets (the
“Services”) are as set forth in Schedule 2.02(a) and under this Agreement.
(b)    Except with respect to the obligations expressly provided herein, in
connection with the performance of the Services, the Servicer shall in all cases
only be obligated to act upon, and shall be entitled to rely on, the
instructions of WEST or, as provided above in Section 2.01(c), the
Administrative Agent, on behalf of each Person within the Serviced Group. The
Servicer shall not be liable to WEST, any Subsidiary, the Indenture Trustee or
any other Person for any act or omission to act taken in accordance with such
instructions, except to the extent provided in Section 3.03.
SECTION 2.03.    Limitations.
(a)    Neither the Servicer nor any of its Affiliates (other than each Person
within the Serviced Group) shall assume any WEST Liabilities. In connection with
the performance of the Services and its other obligations hereunder, the
Servicer shall not be obligated to take or refrain from taking any action which
is reasonably likely to (A) violate any Applicable Law, (B) lead to an
investigation by any Governmental Authority or (C) expose the Servicer to any
liabilities for which, in the Servicer’s good faith opinion, adequate bond or
indemnity has not been provided.
(b)    Each Person within the Serviced Group shall at all times retain full
legal and equitable title to the Assets, notwithstanding the management thereof
by the Servicer hereunder.

ARTICLE 3

STANDARD OF CARE; CONFLICTS OF INTEREST; STANDARD OF
LIABILITY
SECTION 3.01.    Standard of Care. The Servicer shall perform the Services with
reasonable care and diligence at all times as is customary in the engine
operating leasing industry and, for so long as there are any Assets that are
Airframes, the aircraft operating leasing industry, as if it were the owner of
each such Engine or Airframe, as applicable (the “Standard of Care”). The
Standard of Care shall be implemented in a manner which is consistent with the
reasonable commercial practices of leading international Aircraft Engine
operating lessors and, for so long as there is any Asset that that is an
Airframe, leading international aircraft operating lessors, and is consistent
with the Indenture.
SECTION 3.02.    Conflicts of Interest.
(a)    Each Person within the Serviced Group acknowledges and agrees that (i) in
addition to managing the Assets under this Agreement, the Servicer may manage,
and shall be entitled to manage, from time to time, the separate assets owned by
it or its Affiliates (other than each Person within the Serviced Group) and
third parties (“Other Assets”); (ii) in addition to the management of the Assets
and the Other Assets, the Servicer shall, and shall be entitled to, carry on its
commercial businesses, including the financing, purchase or other acquisition,
leasing and sale of Other Assets; (iii) in the course of conducting such
activities, the Servicer may from time to time have conflicts of interest in
performing its duties on behalf of the various entities to whom it provides
management services and with respect to the various assets in respect of which
it provides management services; and (iv) the Controlling Trustees of WEST have
approved the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and desire that such
transactions be consummated and, in giving such approval, the Controlling
Trustees of WEST have expressly recognized that such conflicts of interest may
arise and that when such conflicts of interest arise the Servicer shall perform
the Services in accordance with the Standard of Care and the Servicer Conflicts
Standard set forth below in Section 3.02(b)
(b)    If conflicts of interest arise regarding the management or remarketing of
any Asset, on the one hand, and any Other Asset, on the other hand, the Servicer
shall promptly notify WEST and the Indenture Trustee (but in no later than the
date on which the next Monthly Report is delivered). The Servicer shall perform
the Services in good faith and to the extent such Asset and such Other Asset are
substantially similar in terms of objectively identifiable characteristics
relevant for purposes of the particular Services to be performed, the Servicer
shall not discriminate between such Asset and such Other Asset on an
unreasonable basis (the standard set forth in this Section 3.02(b) shall be
referred to collectively as the “Servicer Conflicts Standard”).
SECTION 3.03.    Standard of Liability. The Servicer shall not be liable to any
Person within the Serviced Group for any Losses arising (i) as a result of an
Asset being sold, leased or purchased on less favorable terms than might have
been achieved at any time, provided such transactions were entered into on the
basis of an arm’s-length commercial decision of the

Servicer, or (ii) in respect of the Servicer’s obligation to apply the Servicer
Conflicts Standard in respect of its performance of the Services, except, in
either case, in the case of willful misconduct, negligence or fraud on the part
of the Servicer. The Servicer shall not be liable to any Person within the
Serviced Group for any Loss arising as a result of the performance of any of the
Servicer’s obligations as Servicer or as a result of any action which the
Servicer is requested to take or refrain from taking by WEST (or the
Administrative Agent), unless (A) such Loss has arisen as a result of the
willful misconduct, negligence or fraud of the Servicer, (B) such Loss has
directly resulted from a breach by the Servicer of the express terms and
conditions of this Agreement or (C) such Loss is a Loss for which the Servicer
has indemnified WEST and its Affiliates and arises as a result of any material
misstatements or omissions in any public filing or offering memorandum relating
to information on the Assets, the Servicer and the Services provided by the
Servicer for disclosure in such public filing or offering memorandum, provided
that the Servicer may reasonably rely on information from third parties without
incurring liability (the liability standards set forth in this Section 3.03, the
“Standard of Liability”).
SECTION 3.04.    Waiver of Implied Standard. Except as expressly stated above in
this Article 3, all other warranties, conditions and representations, express or
implied, statutory or otherwise, arising under Delaware or New York law or any
other Applicable Law in relation to either the skill, care, diligence or
otherwise in respect of any Service to be performed hereunder or to the quality
or fitness for any particular purpose of any goods are hereby to the fullest
extent permitted by Applicable Law excluded and the Servicer shall not be liable
in contract, tort or otherwise under Delaware or New York law or any other
Applicable Law for any Loss arising out of or in connection with the Services to
be supplied pursuant to this Agreement or any goods to be provided or sold in
conjunction with such Services.
ARTICLE 4

Serviced Group. Each Person within the Serviced Group represents and warrants to

agreement or other obligation to which the Servicer is a party or by which the
Servicer or any of its properties or assets may be bound.
(e)    There are no Proceedings or investigations to which the Servicer or any

request shall make available to the Serviced Group and their agents (including
auditors) (A) reports, ledgers, documents, and other records (including computer

applicable to the Servicer and with the laws, rules and regulations applicable

funds, (i) any funds of any Person within the Serviced Group or (ii) any
misdirected funds received from Lessees and others. Any such misdirected funds
shall be promptly redirected to a Bank Account. The Servicer hereby covenants
with the Serviced Group that it will conduct its business such that it is a
separate and readily identifiable business from, and independent of, each Person
within the Serviced Group (it being understood that the Servicer and any of its
Affiliates may publish financial statements that consolidate those of the
Serviced Group, if to do so is required by any Applicable Law or GAAP and the
Servicer and any of its Affiliates may, if applicable file consolidated,
combined or unitary tax returns with any Person within the Serviced Group) and
further covenants that, during the term of this Agreement:
(a)    it will observe all corporate formalities necessary to remain a legal
entity separate and distinct from, and independent of, each Person within the

(g)    it will not pay or become liable for any debt of any Person within the
Serviced Group, other than to make payments in the form of indemnity as required
by the express terms of this Agreement;

Person within the Serviced Group in order that such third party will be induced
to contract with it;
(j)    it will not enter into any transaction between it and any Person within

than an agreement that the parties would have been able to enter into at such
time on an arm’s-length basis with a non-affiliated third party, other than any
Related Document in effect on the Initial Closing Date (it being understood that
the parties hereto do not intend by this covenant to ratify any self-dealing
transaction); and
(k)    it will observe all corporate formalities necessary to treat each Person
within the Serviced Group as a legal entity separate from each other Subsidiary.

which constitutes a Servicer Termination Event, Early Amortization Event or an
Event of Default, or any event which, with the lapse of time or the giving of
notice or both, would constitute a Servicer Termination Event, Early
Amortization Event or an Event of Default and which, in each case, has not been
waived in writing by the Controlling Party, the Servicer shall deliver to each
Person within the Serviced Group and the Indenture Trustee a written notice
describing the nature of such event and period of existence and, in the case of
a Servicer Termination Event, the action the Servicer is taking or proposed to
take with respect thereto.
SECTION 5.07.    Ownership Placards. The Servicer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause each Lessee to affix an ownership placard on each
related Airframe and Engine stating that such Airframe or Engine is owned by the
applicable Asset Trust.

of this document has been filed separately with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.


SECTION 6.02.    No Representation with Respect to Third Parties. WEST and each
other Person within the Serviced Group agree that as between the Servicer, on
the one hand, and any Person within the Serviced Group, on the other hand, no
representation is made as to the financial condition and affairs of any Lessee
of, or purchaser of, any Asset or any manufacturer, representative, maintenance

the Servicer shall have no liability with respect to such third parties.
SECTION 6.03.    Related Document Amendments. Neither WEST nor any other Person
in the Serviced Group shall amend, without the prior consent of the Servicer in
each instance, any Related Document in such a manner that would increase in any
respect the scope, nature or level of the Services to be provided under this
Agreement nor change the Standard of Liability without the Servicer’s prior
written consent, which consent may be conditioned upon, among other things, a
proper adjustment in the compensation payable to the Servicer in order to take
into account the increased Services to be provided by the Servicer.
SECTION 6.04.    Other Servicing Arrangements. Without the prior written consent
of the Servicer, neither WEST nor any other Person in the Serviced Group shall
(a) enter into, or cause or permit any Person (other than the Servicer) to enter
into on their behalf, any transaction for the lease or sale of any Asset in
respect of which the Servicer is at such time performing Services, or (b) employ
any Person other than the Servicer to perform any of the Services with respect
to the Assets, except as provided in Article 10 of this Agreement.
SECTION 6.05.    Communications. WEST and each other Person within the Serviced

RESPONSIBILITY OF SERVICED GROUP;
BUDGETS; DIRECTIONS
SECTION 7.01.    Responsibility of Serviced Group. Notwithstanding the
appointment of the Servicer to perform the Services and the related delegation
of authority and responsibility to the Servicer pursuant to this Agreement, each
Person within the Serviced Group shall remain responsible for all matters
related to its business, operations, assets and liabilities.
SECTION 7.02.    Instructions by WEST. WEST may at any time, other than
following the delivery of a Default Notice pursuant to Section 4.02 of the
Indenture (that has not been withdrawn or rescinded), in which case the
Indenture Trustee may, direct the Servicer to limit or terminate any action
being taken by it under this Agreement or to take any action authorized or
contemplated by this Agreement (including sale or disposal of any Asset) or the
applicable Lease and the Servicer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
comply with such directions.
SECTION 7.03.    Request for Authority. If the Servicer wishes to take or
approve any action which it is not authorized under this Agreement to take or
approve, it shall request authority from WEST to take or approve the action.
SECTION 7.04.    Overall Business Objectives with Respect to Asset. The Servicer
will perform the Services with a view towards maximizing the present value of
the cash flows over the life of the Assets from leasing and re-leasing or
selling or otherwise disposing of Assets, taking into account the then-existing
and anticipated market conditions affecting the operating leasing of used
aircraft and Aircraft Engines and the commercial aviation industry generally and
any restrictions within the Indenture.
SECTION 7.05.    Operating Budget; Asset Expenses Budget.
(a)    WEST, on its own behalf and on behalf of each other Person in the
Serviced Group, shall adopt with respect to the period from the Initial Closing
Date through December 31, 2020 (the “Initial Period”) and, thereafter, each one
Year period during the term of this Agreement (a “One Year Period”):
(A)    an operating budget with respect to the Assets (an “Operating Budget”);
and
(B)    a budget with respect to Asset Expenses related to the Assets (an “Asset
Expenses Budget”).
The initial Operating Budget and the initial Asset Expenses Budget for the
Initial Period (together, the “Initial Budgets”) shall be adopted by each Person
within the Serviced Group by the Initial Closing Date in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Operating

Commission.


Budget and Asset Expenses Budget for each One Year Period during the term of
this Agreement shall be adopted by each Person within the Serviced Group in
accordance with Section 7.05(c). The Servicer shall, in the course of providing
the Services hereunder, use reasonable efforts to achieve the Initial Budgets
during the Initial Period and to achieve the Operating Budget and the Asset
Expenses Budgets for and during each One Year Period. The Initial Budgets and
the Operating Budgets and Asset Expenses Budgets are collectively referred to
herein as the “Budgets.”
(b)    To assist the Administrative Agent in the preparation and review of a
proposed Operating Budget and a proposed Asset Expenses Budget for each One Year
Period, the Servicer shall provide the Administrative Agent, by the November 1
immediately preceding such One Year Period, information in a form to be agreed
from time to time relating to (i) lease rates, (ii) utilization rate,
(iii) expected technical expenditures (including any costs to be capitalized)
relating to the Assets, (iv) planned sales, (v) costs relating to insurance,
legal, consulting and other similar expenses, including anticipated litigation
expenses and (vi) such other information related to Asset Expenses as may be
requested by the Administrative Agent for purposes of the preparation and review
of such budgets, in each case including the assumptions relating thereto.
(c)    Based on the information provided by the Servicer to the Administrative
Agent in accordance with Section 7.05(b), the Administrative Agent shall prepare
and deliver to the Servicer and WEST by the November 30 immediately preceding
each One Year Period, a proposed Operating Budget and Asset Expenses Budget for
such One Year Period, together with reasonably detailed supporting information
and the assumptions underlying such proposed Operating Budget and Asset Expenses
Budget.
(d)    Following the receipt by the Servicer and WEST of the proposed Operating
Budget and Asset Expenses Budget for a One Year Period as provided in Section
7.05(c), the Servicer and the Administrative Agent, on behalf of each Person
within the Serviced Group, shall consult with each other to agree on a final
Operating Budget and a final Asset Expenses Budget for such One Year Period, and
taking into account such consultation, WEST shall approve and deliver to the
Servicer, by the December 20 immediately preceding the commencement of each One
Year Period, a final Operating Budget and Asset Expenses Budget for such One
Year Period.
(e)    If at any time the Servicer reasonably believes that an incurrence of
Asset Expenses is reasonably likely to cause actual aggregate Asset Expenses in
the Initial Period or any One Year Period, as the case may be, to exceed 125% of
the budgeted amount of aggregate Asset Expenses for such period as set forth in
the applicable Budget, the Servicer shall not incur such Asset Expense without
prior approval by WEST, and such excess payment and approval thereof shall be
reported in the Annual Report for the relevant Initial Period or One Year
Period, as the case may be.
SECTION 7.06.    Transaction Approval Requirements.
(a)    The Servicer shall not do any of the following without the express prior
written approval of WEST:

(i)    Except as required in accordance with the terms of any Lease or any other
agreement with the Lessee or an Acquisition Agreement, and in any event in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the Related Documents, sell (or
enter into any commitment or agreement to sell) or otherwise transfer or dispose
of any Asset (excluding any sale or exchange of spare parts or ancillary
equipment or devices furnished therewith) forming part of the Assets; provided,
however, that, the Servicer may transfer title or another interest in an Asset,
or cause an Asset to be subject to a Lease:
(A)    to or in favor of a trust or an entity for the purpose of addressing tax,

ownership of such Asset;

(C)    within or among the Persons in the same Issuer Group without limitation
(provided that a Person in such Issuer Group retains the beneficial or economic
ownership of such Asset and related Lease);

Event of Default has occurred (or has been notified in writing that such Event
of Default has been waived or has otherwise ceased to exist), the Servicer may

components or for the swapping of engines, if determined by the Servicer in good
faith to be in the best interests of maximizing returns in respect of such
Asset, subject always to the limitations on parting-out and consignments set
forth in the Indenture.
(ii)    Enter into any new Lease (or any renewal or extension of an existing
Lease or other agreement with a Lessee) of any Asset if the Lease does not
comply with the requirements of the Indenture or amend any existing Lease in a
manner that does not comply with the requirements of the Indenture.
(iii)    Unless provided for in the then applicable Budgets, enter into any
contract for the modification or maintenance of any Asset if the costs to be
incurred thereunder by the relevant Person within the Serviced Group are not
economically justifiable in light of then current and reasonably anticipated

any Person within the Serviced Group, any capital commitment or confirm any

into any such capital commitment or order or commitment to acquire a Replacement
Asset or spare parts for an Asset so long as the same is provided for in the
then applicable Budgets.
(v)    Issue any guarantee on behalf of, or otherwise pledge the credit of any
Person within the Serviced Group, other than any guarantee of any Subsidiary
obligation by WEST.

must be approved by a majority of the Controlling Trustees, including the

only be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto and with the written
consent of the Indenture Trustee (acting at the direction of the Controlling

delegation to the Servicer of the level of autonomy, authority and
responsibility contemplated by the Transaction Approval Requirements with

(i)    If the Termination Notice is provided by WEST or the Controlling Party to
the Servicer based on an event described in Section 10.02(b)(i) or (b)(ii) (each
a “Curable Termination Event”), then no later than the fifth Business Day
following the delivery of the Termination Notice (the “Effectiveness Date”), the
Servicer shall advise WEST or the Controlling Party, as applicable, in writing
whether the Servicer (A) intends to cure the basis for such Termination Notice
and, if so, the action the Servicer intends to take to effectuate such cure or
(B) does not intend to cure the basis for such Termination Notice (it being
understood that failure of the Servicer to deliver such written advice by such
day shall be deemed to constitute notice that it does not intend to cure the
basis for termination). In the event (x) that the Servicer notifies (or is
deemed to have notified) WEST or the Controlling Party, as applicable, that it
does not intend to cure the basis for such termination, and (y) of a Termination
Notice from (I) the Servicer based on any event described in Section 10.02(a) or
(II) WEST or the Controlling Party based on any event described in Section
10.02(b) other than a Curable Termination Event, then this Agreement shall
terminate, subject to Section 10.03(c)(ii), immediately or on such later date
that WEST or the Controlling Party, as applicable, shall have indicated in the
Termination Notice. In the event that the Servicer notifies WEST or the
Controlling Party, as applicable, by the applicable Effectiveness Day that it
intends to cure the basis for any Curable Termination Event, then the Servicer
shall (1) have ninety (90) days from such Effectiveness Date to effectuate such
cure to the satisfaction of WEST or the Controlling Party, as applicable, or
(2) if such cure cannot reasonably be expected to be effectuated within a 90-day
period, (x) demonstrate to the satisfaction of WEST or the Controlling Party, as
applicable, that substantial progress is being made toward the effectuation of
such cure and (y) effectuate such cure to the reasonable satisfaction of WEST or
the Controlling Party, as applicable, no later than the one hundred twentieth
day following such Effectiveness Date. Upon the failure of the Servicer to
effectuate a cure in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall terminate on the latest of (I) the day immediately following the
expiration of such 90 or 120-day period, as the case may be, (II) such later
date as shall be indicated in the Termination Notice and (III) the date on which
a Replacement Servicer has been engaged to perform the Services with respect to
the Assets and has accepted such appointment in accordance with the provisions
of Section 10.03(c).
(d)    The Servicer and WEST acknowledge and agree that the Independent
Controlling Trustee of WEST has been authorized by WEST to exercise all rights
and powers of WEST under this Agreement, including the right to deliver a
Termination Notice on behalf of WEST and to exercise all rights of WEST under
Section 10.03 upon the expiration or termination of this Agreement. The Servicer
shall provide at all times (upon reasonable notice) WEST with access to the
books and records of the Servicer relating to the Assets and the Leases and to

(a)    Each Person within the Serviced Group (excluding any Asset Trustee) do
hereby assume liability for, and do hereby agree to indemnify, reimburse and
hold harmless on an After-Tax Basis, the Servicer from any and all Losses, to
the extent that the Losses exceed recoveries under insurance policies maintained
by WEST or the Servicer, that arise (A) as a result of the Servicer’s
performance of any of its obligations as Servicer, and (B) as a result of any
action which the Servicer is requested to take or requested to refrain from
taking by WEST; provided that such indemnity shall not extend to (i) any Loss
which arises as a result of the willful misconduct, negligence or fraud of the
Servicer, (ii) any Loss which results from a material breach by the Servicer of
the express terms and conditions of this Agreement, (iii) any Loss arising as a
result of any material misstatement or omissions in any public filing or
offering memorandum relating to written information on the Assets and the
Servicer provided by the Servicer for disclosure in such public filing or
offering memorandum, (iv) any Loss arising from the violation by Servicer of the
Standards of Liability, (v) any Tax imposed on net income by the revenue

performance of the Services, or (vi) any Taxes imposed on net income of the

Commission.


(c)    The Servicer agrees to give WEST prompt notice of any action, claim,
demand, discovery of fact, proceeding or suit for which the Servicer intends to
assert a right to indemnification under this Agreement; provided, however, that
failure to give such notification shall not affect the Servicer’s entitlement to
indemnification under this Section 11.01 unless and only to the extent such
failure results in actual material prejudice to any Person within the Serviced
Group with respect to the action, claim, demand, discovery of fact, proceeding
or suit for which a right of indemnification is asserted.
(d)    For the avoidance of doubt, all payments owed to the Servicer pursuant to
this Article 11 shall be paid from amounts available therefor under Section 3.09
of the Indenture and any recoveries pursuant to insurance policies maintained by
WEST or the Servicer in respect of such amounts (after payment of such amounts
to the Servicer) shall be deposited in the Collections Account.
(e)    The Servicer does hereby assume liability for, and does hereby agree to
indemnify, reimburse and hold harmless on an After-Tax Basis, each Person within
the Serviced Group from any and all Losses, to the extent that the Losses exceed
recoveries under insurance policies maintained by WEST or the Servicer, that
arise (A) as a result of the willful misconduct, negligence or fraud of the
Servicer, (B) any Loss which results from a material breach by the Servicer of
the express terms and conditions of this Agreement, (C) any Loss arising as a
result of any material misstatement or omissions in any public filing or
offering memorandum relating to written information on the Assets and the
Servicer provided by the Servicer for disclosure in such public filing or
offering memorandum, (D) any Loss arising from the violation by Servicer of the
Standards of Liability; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the maximum amount of indemnifiable Losses which
may be recovered from the Servicer arising out of or resulting from the causes
enumerated in this Section 11.01(e) shall be an amount equal to the sum of the
Servicing Fees actually received by the Servicer.
SECTION 11.02.    Procedures for Defense of Claims.
(a)    If a Third Party Claim is made against the Servicer, the Servicer shall
promptly notify WEST of such claim, and the Servicer or WEST (as agreed between
them) will undertake the defense thereof. The failure to notify WEST promptly
shall not relieve it of its obligations under this Article 11 unless such
failure results in actual material prejudice to any Person within the Serviced
Group with respect to the action, claim, demand, discovery of fact, proceeding
or suit for which a right of indemnification is asserted.
(b)    If agreed and accepted by WEST and the Servicer, WEST shall within thirty
(30) days undertake the conduct and control, through counsel of its own choosing
and at the sole risk and expense of each Person within the Serviced Group, of
the good faith settlement or defense of such claim, and the Servicer shall
cooperate fully with WEST in connection therewith; provided that (i) at all
times the Servicer shall be entitled to participate in such settlement or
defense through counsel chosen by it, and the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be borne by the Servicer, and (ii) no Person within the Serviced Group
shall be entitled to settle such claims unless it shall have confirmed in
writing the obligation of such Person to indemnify the Servicer for the
liability asserted in such claim.

(c)    So long as WEST is reasonably contesting any such claim in good faith,
the Servicer shall fully cooperate with WEST in the defense of such claim as
reasonably required by WEST, and WEST shall reimburse the Servicer for
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim and the
availability on a mutually convenient basis of directors, officers and employees
to provide additional information. The Servicer shall not settle or compromise
any claim without the written consent of WEST unless the Servicer agrees in
writing to forego any and all claims for indemnification from each Person within
the Serviced Group with respect to such claims.
SECTION 11.03.    Reimbursement of Costs. The costs and expenses, including fees
and disbursements of counsel (except as provided in Section 11.02(b)(i)) and
expenses of investigation, incurred by the Servicer in connection with any Third
Party Claim, shall be reimbursed on each Payment Date by WEST upon the
submission of evidence reasonably satisfactory to WEST that such expenses have
been incurred in the preceding month, without prejudice to WEST’s right to
contest the Servicer’s right to indemnification and subject to refund in the
event that each Person within the Serviced Group are ultimately held not to be
obligated to indemnify the Servicer.

prior written consent of each of the other parties; provided, however, the
foregoing provisions on assignment and delegation shall not limit the ability of
the Servicer to contract with any Person, including any of its Affiliates, for
Services in respect of Assets in accordance with Section 2.01(c) so long as the
Servicer remains primarily liable for the performance of such Services;
provided, further, that (x) the Servicer may assign substantially all of its
obligations under this Agreement (subject to a Rating Agency Confirmation) so
long as it will remain primarily liable for the performance of such obligations
and (y) WEST may assign its rights hereunder to the Indenture Trustee pursuant

(excluding any collateral assignment and any third party providers) by
assignment or otherwise of any Person within the Serviced Group or the Servicer
(or any of their respective successors) in accordance with this Section 12.01

APPENDIX A

DEFINITIONS
“Administrative Agent Event of Default” means the occurrence of one of the
events set forth in Section 8.02(d) of the Administrative Agency Agreement.
“After-Tax Basis” means on a basis such that any payment received, deemed to
have been received or receivable by any Person shall, if necessary, be
supplemented by a further payment to that Person so that the sum of the two
payments shall, after deduction of all U.S. federal, state, local or foreign
Taxes and other charges resulting from the receipt (actual or constructive) or
accrual of such payments imposed by or under any U.S. federal, state, local or
other foreign law or Governmental Authority (after taking into account any
current deduction to which such Person shall be entitled with respect to the
amount that gave rise to the underlying payment), be equal to the payment

cause the Lessee and any other party (other than the Servicer or WEST) under
such Lease to perform their respective obligations owed to the Lessor by such
Lessee and such other parties under such Lease and under such ancillary
agreements. Following any default by a Lessee under the applicable Lease, the
Servicer will provide notice thereof to the Controlling Trustees and will take
all steps as it deems reasonably necessary or appropriate to preserve and
enforce the rights of the Lessor under the applicable Lease and the Security
Trustee, including entering into negotiations with such Lessee with respect to

new Lease to be entered into after the date hereof, would, on their own, cause
the entering into of such new Lease to require the approval of WEST pursuant to
Section 7.06(a)(ii) of the Agreement. Such amendments or modifications may be
made without regard to whether there is a default by the Lessee or other party
under or with respect to any such Lease.
