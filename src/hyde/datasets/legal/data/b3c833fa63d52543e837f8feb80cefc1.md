new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been
organized and acquired on the first date of its existence by the holders of its
equity interests at such time.

ARTICLE 2 - LOANS

Section 2.1 The Term Loans. The Lenders agree severally, and not jointly, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, to lend to the
Borrower on the Agreement Date an amount equal to (i) in the aggregate, the
Commitments of all Lenders and, (ii) individually, the sum of such Lender’s Term
Loan Commitment and such Lender’s Incremental Term Loan Commitment. Amounts
borrowed under this Section 2.1 and repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.

Section 2.2 Manner of Advance and Disbursement.

(a) Choice of Interest Rate, Etc. The Advances hereunder shall, at the option of
the Borrower, be made as one or more Base Rate Advances or LIBOR Advances;
provided, however, that at such time as there shall have occurred and be
continuing a Default hereunder, the Borrower shall not have the right to
Continue a LIBOR Advance or to Convert a Base Rate Advance to a LIBOR Advance.
Any notice given to the Administrative Agent in connection with a requested
Advance or Conversion hereunder shall be given to the Administrative Agent prior
to 11:00 a.m. (New York, New York time) in order for such Business Day to count
toward the minimum number of Business Days required.

(b) Base Rate Advances.

(i) Advances. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent in the case of
Base Rate Advances irrevocable prior telephonic notice followed immediately by a
Request for Advance by 9:00 A.M. (New York, New York time) on the date of such
proposed Base Rate Advance; provided, however, that the Borrower’s failure to
confirm any telephonic notice with a Request for Advance shall not invalidate
any notice so given if acted upon by the Administrative Agent. Upon receipt of
such notice from the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
each Lender by telephone, followed promptly by email or telecopy of the contents
thereof.

(ii) Conversions. The Borrower may, without regard to the applicable Payment
Date and upon at least three (3) Business Days’ irrevocable prior telephonic
notice by 11:00 A.M. (New York, New York time) followed by a Request for
Advance, Convert all or a portion of the principal of a Base Rate Advance to a
LIBOR Advance. On the date indicated by the Borrower, such Base Rate Advance
shall be so Converted. The failure to give timely notice hereunder with respect
to the Payment Date of any Base Rate Advance shall be considered a request for a
Base Rate Advance.

(c) LIBOR Advances. Upon request, the Administrative Agent, whose determination
in absence of manifest error shall be conclusive, shall determine the available
LIBOR Basis and shall notify the Borrower of such LIBOR Basis to apply for the
applicable LIBOR Advance.

 

-19-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i) Advances. The Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent in the case of
LIBOR Advances at least three (3) Business Days’ irrevocable prior telephonic
notice followed immediately by a Request for Advance; provided, however, that
the Borrower’s failure to confirm any telephonic notice with a Request for
Advance shall not invalidate any notice so given if acted upon by the
Administrative Agent. Upon receipt of such notice from the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender by telephone, email or
telecopy of the contents thereof.

(ii) Conversions and Continuations. At least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Payment Date for each LIBOR Advance, the Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent telephonic notice followed by written notice specifying
whether all or a portion of such LIBOR Advance (A) is to be Continued in whole
or in part as one or more LIBOR Advances, (B) is to be Converted in whole or in
part to a Base Rate Advance, or (C) is to be repaid. The failure to give such
notice shall be considered a request to Continue such Advance as a LIBOR Rate
Advance with a one month Interest Period. Upon such Payment Date such LIBOR
Advance will, subject to the provisions hereof, be so Continued, Converted or
repaid, as applicable.

(d) Notification of Lenders. Upon receipt of irrevocable prior telephonic notice
in accordance with Section 2.2(b) or (c) hereof or a Request for Advance, or a
notice of Conversion or Continuation from the Borrower with respect to any
outstanding Advance prior to the Payment Date for such Advance, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly but no later than the close of business on
the day of such notice notify each Lender having the applicable Commitment or
holding a Loan subject to such request for an Advance by telephone, followed
promptly by written notice or telecopy, of the contents thereof and the amount
of such Lender’s portion of the Advance. Each Lender having the applicable
Commitment or holding a Loan subject to such request for an Advance shall, not
later than 12:00 noon (New York, New York time) on the date of borrowing
specified in such notice, make available to the Administrative Agent at the
Administrative Agent’s Office, or at such account as the Administrative Agent
shall designate, the amount of its portion of any Advance that represents a
borrowing hereunder in immediately available funds.

(e) Disbursement.

(i) Prior to 2:00 p.m. (New York, New York time) on the date of an Advance
hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Article 3 hereof, disburse the amounts made available to
the Administrative Agent by the Lenders in like funds by (A) transferring the
amounts so made available by wire transfer pursuant to the Borrower’s
instructions, or (B) in the absence of such instructions, crediting the amounts
so made available to the account of the Borrower maintained with the
Administrative Agent.

(ii) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
holding a Loan subject to such request for an Advance prior to 12:00 noon (New
York, New York time) on the date of a requested Advance that such Lender will
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s ratable portion of
such Advance, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made or
will make

 

-20-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

such portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Advance
and the Administrative Agent may in its sole discretion and in reliance upon
such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding
amount. If and to the extent a Lender does not make such ratable portion
available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to repay to the
Administrative Agent on demand such corresponding amount together with interest
thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at
the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate reasonably determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank
compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily
charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing.

(iii) If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding
amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Lender’s portion of the
Advances for purposes of this Agreement. If such Lender does not repay such
corresponding amount immediately upon the Administrative Agent’s demand therefor
and the Administrative Agent has made such corresponding amount available to the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower, and the Borrower
shall immediately pay such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent,
with interest at the Federal Funds Rate from the date the Administrative Agent
made such amount available to the Borrower. The Borrower shall not be obligated
to pay, and such amount shall not accrue, any interest or fees on such amount
other than as provided in the immediately preceding sentence. The failure of any
Lender to fund its portion of any Advance shall not relieve any other Lender of
its obligation, if any, hereunder to fund its respective portion of the Advance
on the date of such borrowing, but no Lender shall be responsible for any such
failure of any other Lender.

Section 2.3 Interest.

(a) On Base Rate Advances. Interest on each Base Rate Advance computed pursuant
to clause (b) of the definition of Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 365/366 days and interest computed pursuant to clause (a) of the
definition of Base Rate shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year, in
each case for the actual number of days elapsed and shall be payable at the Base
Rate Basis for such Advance, in arrears on the applicable Payment Date. Interest
on Base Rate Advances of the Loans then outstanding shall also be due and
payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date.

(b) On LIBOR Advances. Interest on each LIBOR Advance shall be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed and shall be
payable at the LIBOR Basis for such Advance, in arrears on the applicable
Payment Date, and, in addition, if the Interest Period for a LIBOR Advance
exceeds three (3) months, interest on such LIBOR Advance shall also be due and
payable in arrears on every three (3) month anniversary of the beginning of such
Interest Period. Interest on LIBOR Advances then outstanding shall also be due
and payable on the Term Loan Maturity Date.

(c) [Intentionally Omitted.]

 

-21-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d) Interest Upon Event of Default. Immediately upon the occurrence of an Event
of Default under Section 8.1(b), (f) or (g) hereunder and following a request
from the Majority Lenders upon the occurrence of any other Event of Default
hereunder, the outstanding principal balance of the Loans shall bear interest at
the Default Rate. Such interest shall be payable on demand by the Majority
Lenders and shall accrue until the earlier of (i) waiver or cure of the
applicable Event of Default, (ii) agreement by the Majority Lenders (or, if
applicable to the underlying Event of Default, the Lenders) to rescind the
charging of interest at the Default Rate or (iii) payment in full of the
Obligations.

(e) LIBOR Contracts. At no time may the number of outstanding LIBOR Advances
hereunder exceed ten (10).

(f) Applicable Margin. With respect to any Loans, the Applicable Margin shall be
equal to, in the case of Base Rate Advances, 0.75% per annum and, in the case of
LIBOR Advances, 1.75% per annum.

Section 2.4 Fees. The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent certain
fees in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement as provided
in the fee letters delivered in connection herewith.

Section 2.5 [Intentionally Omitted].

Section 2.6 Prepayments and Repayments.

(a) Prepayment. The principal amount of any Base Rate Advance may be prepaid in
full or ratably in part at any time, without premium or penalty and without
regard to the Payment Date for such Advance. The principal amount of any LIBOR
Advance may be prepaid in full or ratably in part, upon three (3) Business Days’
prior written notice, or telephonic notice followed immediately by written
notice, to the Administrative Agent, without premium or penalty; provided,
however, that, to the extent prepaid prior to the applicable Payment Date for
such LIBOR Advance, the Borrower shall reimburse the applicable Lenders, on the
earlier of (A) demand by the applicable Lender or (B) the Term Loan Maturity
Date, for any loss or out-of-pocket expense incurred by any such Lender in
connection with such prepayment, as set forth in Section 2.9 hereof; and
provided further, however, that (i) the Borrower’s failure to confirm any
telephonic notice with a written notice shall not invalidate any notice so given
if acted upon by the Administrative Agent and (ii) any notice of prepayment
given hereunder may be revoked by the Borrower at any time. Any prepayment
hereunder shall be in amounts of not less than $2,000,000.00 and in an integral
multiple of $1,000,000.00. Amounts prepaid shall be paid together with accrued
interest on the amount so prepaid.

(b) Repayments. The Borrower shall repay the Loans, together with accrued
interest and fees with respect thereto, in full on the Term Loan Maturity Date.

Section 2.7 Notes; Loan Accounts.

(a) The Loans shall be repayable in accordance with the terms and provisions set
forth herein. If requested by a Lender, one (1) Note duly executed and delivered
by one or

 

-22-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

more Authorized Signatories of the Borrower, shall be issued by the Borrower and
payable to such Lender in an amount equal to such Lender’s Commitment.

(b) Each Lender may open and maintain on its books in the name of the Borrower a
loan account with respect to its portion of the Loans and interest thereon. Each
Lender which opens such a loan account shall debit such loan account for the
principal amount of its portion of each Advance made by it and accrued interest
thereon, and shall credit such loan account for each payment on account of
principal of or interest on its Loans. The records of a Lender with respect to
the loan account maintained by it shall be prima facie evidence of its portion
of the Loans and accrued interest thereon absent manifest error, but the failure
of any Lender to make any such notations or any error or mistake in such
notations shall not affect the Borrower’s repayment obligations with respect to
such Loans.

Section 2.8 Manner of Payment.

(a) Each payment (including, without limitation, any prepayment) by the Borrower
on account of the principal of or interest on the Loans and any other amount
owed to the Lenders or the Administrative Agent or any of them under this
Agreement or the Notes shall be made not later than 1:00 p.m. (New York, New
York time) on the date specified for payment under this Agreement to the
Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s Office, for the account of
the Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, in lawful money of
the United States of America in immediately available funds. Any payment
received by the Administrative Agent after 1:00 p.m. (New York, New York time)
shall be deemed received on the next Business Day. Receipt by the Administrative
Agent of any payment intended for any Lender or Lenders hereunder prior to 1:00
p.m. (New York, New York time) on any Business Day shall be deemed to constitute
receipt by such Lender or Lenders on such Business Day. In the case of a payment
for the account of a Lender, the Administrative Agent will promptly, but no
later than the close of business on the date such payment is deemed received,
thereafter distribute the amount so received in like funds to such Lender. If
the Administrative Agent shall not have received any payment from the Borrower
as and when due, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify the applicable
Lenders accordingly. In the event that the Administrative Agent shall fail to
make distribution to any Lender as required under this Section 2.8, the
Administrative Agent agrees to pay such Lender interest from the date such
payment was due until paid at the Federal Funds Rate.

(b) The Borrower agrees to pay principal, interest, fees and all other amounts
due hereunder or under the Notes without set-off or counterclaim or any
deduction whatsoever, except as provided in Section 10.3 hereof.

(c) Prior to the acceleration of the Loans under Section 8.2 hereof, if some but
less than all amounts due from the Borrower are received by the Administrative
Agent with respect to the Obligations, the Administrative Agent shall distribute
such amounts in the following order of priority, all on a pro rata basis to the
Lenders: (i) to the payment on a pro rata basis of any fees or expenses then due
and payable to the Administrative Agent or expenses then due and payable to the
Lenders; (ii) to the payment of interest then due and payable on the Loans on a
pro rata basis and of fees then due and payable to the Lenders on a pro rata
basis; (iii) to the payment of all other amounts not otherwise referred to in
this Section 2.8(c) then due and

 

-23-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

payable to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, or any of them, hereunder
or under the Notes or any other Loan Document; and (iv) to the payment of
principal then due and payable on the Loans on a pro rata basis.

(d) Subject to any contrary provisions in the definition of Interest Period, if
any payment under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is specified
to be made on a day which is not a Business Day, it shall be made on the next
Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in
computing interest and fees, if any, in connection with such payment.

Section 2.9 Reimbursement.

(a) Whenever any Lender shall sustain or incur any losses or reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses in connection with (i) the failure by the Borrower to
borrow, Continue or Convert any LIBOR Advance after having given notice of its
intention to borrow, Continue or Convert such Advance in accordance with
Section 2.2 or 2.6 hereof (whether by reason of the Borrower’s election not to
proceed or the non-fulfillment of any of the conditions set forth in Article 3
hereof, but not as a result of a failure of such Lender to make a Loan in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement), or (ii) the prepayment other than
on the applicable Payment Date (or failure to prepay after giving notice
thereof) of any LIBOR Advance in whole or in part for any reason, the Borrower
agrees to pay to such Lender, upon such Lender’s demand, an amount sufficient to
compensate such Lender for all such losses and out-of-pocket expenses. Such
Lender’s good faith determination of the amount of such losses or out-of-pocket
expenses, as set forth in writing and accompanied by calculations in reasonable
detail demonstrating the basis for its demand, shall be presumptively correct
absent manifest error.

(b) Losses subject to reimbursement hereunder shall include, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
any Lender or any participant of such Lender permitted hereunder in connection
with the re-employment of funds prepaid, paid, repaid, not borrowed, or not
paid, as the case may be, but not losses resulting from lost Applicable Margin
or other margin. Losses subject to reimbursement will be payable whether the
Term Loan Maturity Date is changed by virtue of an amendment hereto (unless such
amendment expressly waives such payment) or as a result of acceleration of the
Loans.

(c) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant
to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.9 shall not constitute a waiver of
such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided that the Borrower
shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section for any losses or expenses incurred more than six
(6) months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the
circumstances giving rise to such losses or expenses and of such Lender’s
intention to claim compensation therefor.

Section 2.10 Pro Rata Treatment.

(a) [Intentionally Omitted.]

(b) Payments. Except as provided in Article 10 hereof, each payment and
prepayment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans shall be made to the
Lenders pro rata on

 

-24-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the basis of their respective unpaid principal amounts outstanding under the
applicable Loans immediately prior to such payment or prepayment.

(c) Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right
of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any
principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such
Lender’s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans
and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided
herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the
Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments
as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared
by the Lenders ratably, provided that:

(i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the
payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded
and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without
interest; and

(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (y) any
payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with
the express terms of this Agreement or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as
consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its
Loans to any assignee or participant.

The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a participation from another
Lender pursuant to this Section 2.10(b) may, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, exercise all its rights of payment (including, without limitation, the
right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such
purchasing Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.

Section 2.11 Capital Adequacy. If after the date hereof, the adoption of any
Applicable Law regarding the capital adequacy or liquidity of banks or bank
holding companies, or any change in Applicable Law (whether adopted before or
after the Agreement Date) or any change in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, including any such change
resulting from the enactment or issuance of any regulation or regulatory
interpretation affecting existing Applicable Law, or compliance by such Lender
(or the bank holding company of such Lender) with any directive regarding
capital adequacy or liquidity (whether or not having the force of law) of any
such governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would
have the effect of reducing the rate of return on any Lender’s capital as a
consequence of its obligations hereunder with respect to the Loans to a level
below that which it could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies with respect to
capital adequacy or liquidity immediately before such adoption, change or
compliance and assuming that such Lender’s (or the bank holding company of such
Lender) capital was fully utilized prior to such adoption, change or compliance)
by an amount reasonably deemed by such Lender to be material, then, upon demand
by such Lender, the Borrower shall promptly pay to such Lender such additional
amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate such Lender (on an after-tax basis
and without duplication of amounts paid by the Borrower pursuant

 

-25-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to Section 10.3) for such reduced return which is reasonably allocable to this
Agreement, together with interest on such amount from the fourth (4th) Business
Day after the date of demand or the Term Loan Maturity Date, as applicable,
until payment in full thereof at the Default Rate; provided that notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives
thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules,
guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements,
the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar
authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case
pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case be deemed to be enacted, adopted or
issued after the date hereof, regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.
A certificate of such Lender setting forth the amount to be paid to such Lender
by the Borrower as a result of any event referred to in this paragraph and
supporting calculations in reasonable detail shall be presumptively correct
absent manifest error. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.11,
no Lender shall demand compensation for any increased cost or reduction referred
to above if it shall not at the time be the general policy or practice of such
Lender to demand such compensation in similar circumstances under comparable
provisions of other credit agreements. Failure or delay on the part of any
Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.11 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such
compensation, provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a
Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased
costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six (6) months prior to the date
that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the circumstances giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim
compensation therefor (except that, if the circumstances giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six (6) month period
referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof).

Section 2.12 Lender Tax Forms. (i)Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption
from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any
Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the
time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made
without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any
Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent,
shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender
is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the
completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such
documentation set forth in paragraphs (ii)(a) and (ii)(b) of this Section) shall
not be required if in the Lenders’ reasonable judgment such completion,
execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed
cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position
of such Lender.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

(a) On or prior to the Agreement Date and on or prior to the first Business Day
of each calendar year thereafter, to the extent it may lawfully do so at such
time, each

 

-26-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lender which is a Non-U.S. Person shall provide each of the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower (A) if such Lender is a “bank” under Section 881(c)(3)(A) of
the Code, with a properly executed original of Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN (or W-8BEN-E, as applicable) or W-8ECI (or any successor form) prescribed
by the Internal Revenue Service or other documents satisfactory to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, certifying (i) as to such
Lender’s status as exempt from United States withholding taxes with respect to
all payments to be made to such Lender hereunder and under the Notes or
(ii) that all payments to be made to such Lender hereunder and under the Notes
are subject to such taxes at a rate reduced to zero by an applicable tax treaty,
or (B) if such Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A)
of the Code and intends to claim exemption from U.S. Federal withholding tax
under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to payments of
“portfolio interest”, a Form W-8BEN (or W-8BEN-E, as applicable), or any
subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto (and, if such Lender delivers
a Form W-8BEN (or W-8BEN-E, as applicable), a certificate representing that such
Lender is not a bank for purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a
ten-percent (10%) shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the
Code and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the Borrower (within
the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code)), properly completed and duly
executed by such Lender, indicating that such Lender is entitled to receive
payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any United
States Federal income taxes as permitted by the Code. If a payment made to a
Lender under this Agreement would be subject to withholding Tax imposed under
FATCA if such Lender fails to comply with the applicable reporting requirements
of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code,
as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times
reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower, such
documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (included as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation
reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower as may be
necessary for the Administrative Agent or the Borrower to comply with its
obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender has complied with such
Lender’s obligations under FATCA, or to determine the amount to deduct and
withhold from such payment.

(b) On or prior to the Agreement Date, and to the extent permitted by applicable
U.S. Federal law, on or prior to the first Business Day of each calendar year
thereafter, each Lender which is a U.S. Person shall provide the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower a duly completed and executed copy of the Internal
Revenue Service Form W-9 or successor form to the effect that it is a U.S.
Person.

Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered
becomes inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or
promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its
legal inability to do so. In addition, each Lender agrees that if any form or
certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete, upon written
request by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such Lender shall update
such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

Section 2.13 Incremental Term Loans. The Borrower may, upon five (5) Business
Days’ notice to the Administrative Agent, request a commitment for an additional
term loan

 

-27-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

from the Lenders or by adding one or more lenders, determined by the Borrower in
its sole discretion, subject to the consent of the Administrative Agent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld), which lender or lenders are willing to
commit to such increase (each such lender, a “New Lender,” and such commitment,
an “Incremental Term Loan Commitment”); provided, however, that (i) the Borrower
may not request an Incremental Term Loan Commitment after the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, including, without limitation,
any Event of Default that would result after giving effect to any Incremental
Term Loan, (ii) each Incremental Term Loan Commitment shall be in an amount not
less than $10,000,000 or an integral multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof
and (iii) the aggregate amount of all Incremental Term Loan Commitments shall
not exceed $750,000,000. Such notice to the Administrative Agent shall describe
the amount and intended disbursement date of the Incremental Term Loan to be
made pursuant to such Incremental Term Loan Commitments. An Incremental Term
Loan Commitment shall become effective upon (a) the execution by each applicable
New Lender of a counterpart of this Agreement and delivering such counterpart to
the Administrative Agent and (b) receipt by the Administrative Agent of a
certificate of a responsible officer of the Borrower, dated as of the date such
Incremental Term Loan Commitments are proposed to take effect, certifying that
as of such date each of the representations and warranties in Article 4 hereof
are true and correct in all material respects, except for those representations
and warranties that are qualified by materiality or Materially Adverse Effect,
which shall be true and correct, and no Default then exists. Over the term of
the Agreement the Borrower may request Incremental Term Loan Commitments no more
than four (4) times. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Lender
shall be required to provide an Incremental Term Loan Commitment pursuant to
this Section 2.13.

Section 2.14 Defaulting Lender.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no
longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, such
Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in
Section 11.11.

(b) If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing in their sole
discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a
Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto,
whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that except
to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change
hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release
of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a
Defaulting Lender.

thereto, which, if unpaid, might become a Lien or charge upon any of their
properties (other than Liens permitted pursuant to Section 7.2 hereof);
provided, however, that no such tax, assessment, charge, levy or claim need be

lieu of the foregoing, for any such date occurring after a Qualified Acquisition
(as defined below) and on or prior to the last day of the fourth full fiscal
quarter of the Borrower after the consummation of such Qualified Acquisition,
the Borrower will not permit such ratio as of such date to exceed 7.00 to 1.00.

“Qualified Acquisition” means an Acquisition by the Borrower or any Subsidiary
which has been designated to the Lenders by an authorized officer of the

giving effect to such Acquisition, the ratio of Total Debt to Adjusted EBITDA as
of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter of the Borrower (for
which financial statements have been delivered pursuant to Section 6.1 or 6.2)

Section 6.1 or 6.2) prior to the consummation of such Acquisition was no greater
than 5.50 to 1.00, (ii) the aggregate consideration for such Acquisition

shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, at any time engage
in any transaction with an Affiliate, other than between or among the Borrower
and/or any Subsidiaries of the Borrower or in the ordinary course of business,
or make an assignment or other transfer of any of its properties or assets to
any Affiliate, in each case on terms less advantageous in any material respect
to the Borrower or such Subsidiary than would be the case if such transaction
had been effected with a non-Affiliate.

Section 7.9 Restrictive Agreements. The Borrower shall not, nor shall the
Borrower permit any of its Material Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
enter into, incur or permit to exist any agreement or other arrangement that

connection with or in contemplation of such acquisition), which encumbrance or
restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any
Person, other than the Person or the property or assets of the Person so
acquired, and any amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, increases,
supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of those instruments;
provided that the encumbrances or restrictions contained in any such amendments,
modifications, restatements, renewals, increases, supplements, refundings,
replacements or refinancings, taken as whole, are not materially more
restrictive than the encumbrances or restrictions contained in instruments as in
effect on the date of acquisition, (iv) the foregoing shall not apply to
restrictions and conditions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by
customers or lessors under contracts or leases entered into in the ordinary
course of business, (v) the foregoing shall not apply to restrictions and

would result in the violation of any Sanctions Laws and Regulations applicable
to any party hereto.

discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly
contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent

herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent
shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of
its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is
contrary to any Loan Document or Applicable Law; and

(c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that
is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent
or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken
by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Majority Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the
Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the
circumstances as provided in Sections 11.11 and 8.2) or (ii) in the absence of
its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall
be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice
describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent in writing by the
Borrower or a Lender.

The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in

confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.

Section 9.4 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any
notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other
writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting
or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed,
sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability
for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to
the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of
a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is
satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The
Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the
Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall
not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the
advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

Section 9.5 Resignation of Administrative Agent. (a) The Administrative Agent
may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower.
Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Majority Lenders shall have
the right to appoint a successor, which shall (i) be a bank with (A) an office
in the United States, or an Affiliate of a bank with an office in the United
States, and (B) combined capital and reserves in excess of $250,000,000 (clauses
(A) and (B) together, the “Agent Qualifications”) and (ii) so long as no Event
of Default is continuing, be reasonably acceptable to Borrower. If no such
successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent
gives notice of its resignation (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the
retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of
the Lenders and in consultation with the Borrower, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent meeting the Agent Qualifications. Whether or not a
successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in
accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.

(a) If the Person serving as Administrative Agent has, (i) become the subject of
a voluntary proceeding under any bankruptcy or other debtor relief law, (ii) had
a receiver, conservator, trustee, administrator, assignee for the benefit of
creditors or similar Person charged with reorganization or liquidation of its
business or a custodian appointed for it, or (iii) taken any action in
furtherance of, or indicated its consent to, approval of or acquiescence in any
voluntary

 

-48-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

or involuntary proceeding under any bankruptcy or other debtor relief law or any
such appointment, the Majority Lenders may, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such
Person as Administrative Agent and appoint a successor Administrative Agent
meeting the Agent Qualifications and which, so long as no Event of Default is
continuing, is reasonably acceptable to Borrower. If no such successor shall
have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within thirty (30) days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by
the Majority Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall
nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal
Effective Date.

(b) With effect from, as applicable, the Resignation Effective Date or the
Removal Effective Date (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
(except that in the case of any collateral security held by the Administrative
Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring
Administrative Agent shall continue to hold such collateral security until such
time as a successor Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) all payments,
communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the
Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until
such time as the Majority Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as
provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s
appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to
and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative
Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or
under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided
above in this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor
Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor
unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the
retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents, the provisions of this Article and Sections 11.2 and 11.5 shall
continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its
sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken
or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent
was acting as Administrative Agent.

Section 9.6 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and
based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

Section 9.7 Indemnification. The Lenders severally, and not jointly, agree to
indemnify the Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower
but without affecting the Borrower’s obligations with respect thereto) pro rata,
from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses (other than the
loss of principal, interest and fees hereunder in the event of a bankruptcy or
out-of-court ‘work-out’ of the Loans), damages, penalties, actions,

 

-49-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

judgments, suits, or reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses (including,
without limitation, fees and disbursements of experts, agents, consultants and
counsel), or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent in any way relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any other
document contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any action
taken or omitted by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any other
Loan Document, or any other document contemplated by this Agreement, except that
no Lender shall be liable to the Administrative Agent for any portion of such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
or reasonable out-of-pocket costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent as determined
by a final, non-appealable judicial order of a court having jurisdiction over
the subject matter.

Section 9.8 No Responsibilities of the Agents. Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary contained elsewhere herein or in any other Loan Document, the
Co-Syndication Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers and the Joint Bookrunners (as
set forth on the cover page hereof) shall not have any duties or
responsibilities, nor shall the Co-Syndication Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers
or Joint Bookrunners have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with
any Lender or participant, and no implied covenants, functions,
responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise exist against the
Co-Syndication Agents, the Joint Lead Arrangers or Joint Bookrunners.

Section 9.9 Lender ERISA Matters. Each Lender represents and warrants as of the
date hereof to the Administrative Agent and each Joint Lead Arranger and their
respective Affiliates, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, for the benefit of
the Borrower, that such Lender is not and will not be (i) an employee benefit
plan subject to Title I of ERISA, (ii) a plan or account subject to Section 4975
of the Internal Revenue Code; (iii) an entity deemed to hold “plan assets” of
any such plans or accounts for purposes of ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code
that is using “plan assets” of any such plans or accounts to fund or hold Loans
or perform its obligations under this Agreement; or (iv) a “governmental plan”
within the meaning of ERISA.

ARTICLE 10 - CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

AFFECTING LIBOR ADVANCES AND INCREASED COSTS

Section 10.1 LIBOR Basis Determination Inadequate or Unfair.

(1) If with respect to any proposed LIBOR Advance for any Interest Period,
(a) the Majority Lenders notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar
Rate for any Interest Period for such Advance will not adequately reflect the
cost to such Lenders of making, funding or maintaining their LIBOR Advances for
such Interest Period, or (b) the Administrative Agent determines after
consultation with the Lenders that adequate and fair means do not exist for
determining the LIBOR Basis, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give
notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders, whereupon until the
Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to
such situation no longer exist, the obligations of any affected Lender to make
its portion of such LIBOR Advances shall be suspended and each affected Lender
shall make its portion of such LIBOR Advance as a Base Rate Advance.

 

-50-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) If at any time the Administrative Agent determines (which determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (i) the circumstances set forth
in clause (1)(b) have arisen and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary
or (ii) the circumstances set forth in clause (1)(b) have not arisen but either
(w) the supervisor for the administrator of LIBOR has made a public statement
that the administrator of LIBOR is insolvent (and there is no successor
administrator that will continue publication of LIBOR), (x) the administrator of
LIBOR has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR
will permanently or indefinitely cease to be published by it (and there is no
successor administrator that will continue publication of LIBOR), (y) the
supervisor for the administrator of LIBOR has made a public statement
identifying a specific date after which LIBOR will permanently or indefinitely
cease to be published or (z) the supervisor for the administrator of LIBOR or a
governmental authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has
made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR may no
longer be used for determining interest rates for loans, then the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower shall endeavor to establish an alternate rate of interest
to LIBOR that gives due consideration to the then prevailing market convention
for determining a rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at
such time, and shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such
alternate rate of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as
may be applicable; provided that, if such alternate rate of interest as so
determined would be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the
purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 11.11, such amendment shall become effective without any further action
or consent of any other party to this Agreement so long as the Administrative
Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date such
amendment is provided to the Lenders, a written notice from the Majority Lenders
stating that such Majority Lenders object to such amendment. Until an alternate
rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with this clause (2) (but, in
the case of the circumstances described in clause (ii)(w), clause (ii)(x) or
clause (ii)(y) of the first sentence of this Section 10.1(2), only to the extent
LIBOR for such Interest Period is not available or published at such time on a
current basis), (x) any Request for Advance requesting a Conversion of any Base
Rate Advance to, or continuation of any Base Rate Advance as, a LIBOR Advance
shall be ineffective and (y) if any Request for Advance requests a LIBOR
Advance, such Advance shall be made as an Base Rate Advance.

Section 10.2 Illegality. If, after the date hereof, the adoption of any
Applicable Law, or any change in any Applicable Law (whether adopted before or
after the Agreement Date), or any change in interpretation or administration
thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender
with any directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or
impossible for any Lender to make, maintain or fund its portion of such LIBOR
Advances, such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, and the
Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders
and the Borrower. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant
to this Section 10.2, such Lender shall designate a different lending office if
such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice and will not, in the
sole reasonable judgment of such Lender, be otherwise materially disadvantageous
to such Lender. Upon receipt of such notice,

 

-51-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

notwithstanding anything contained in Article 2 hereof, the Borrower shall
Convert such LIBOR Advance to a Base Rate Advance on either (a) the last day of
the then current Interest Period applicable to such affected LIBOR Advance if
such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund its portion of such LIBOR
Advance to such day or (b) immediately if such Lender may not lawfully continue
to fund and maintain its portion of such affected LIBOR Advance to such day.

Section 10.3 Increased Costs and Additional Amounts.

(a) If after the date hereof, the adoption of any Applicable Law, or any change
in any Applicable Law (whether adopted before or after the Agreement Date), or
any interpretation or change in interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof or compliance by any Lender with any
directive issued after the Agreement Date (whether or not having the force of
law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable agency:

(i) shall subject any Lender to any Tax with respect to its obligation to make
its portion of LIBOR Advances, or its portion of other Advances, or shall change
the basis of taxation of payments to any Lender of the principal of or interest
on its portion of LIBOR Advances or in respect of any other amounts due under
this Agreement, or its obligation to make its portion of Advances (except for
changes with respect to Taxes imposed on the revenues or net income of such
Lender, and except for any Taxes referred to in Section 10.3(b) hereof); or

(ii) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without
limitation, any imposed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
but excluding any included in an applicable Eurodollar Reserve Percentage),
special deposit, capital adequacy or liquidity, assessment or other requirement
or condition against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or
commitments or credit extended by, any Lender or shall impose on any Lender or
the London interbank borrowing market any other condition affecting its
obligation to make its portion of such LIBOR Advances or its portion of existing
Advances;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender of
making or maintaining any of its portion of such LIBOR Advances, or to reduce
the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender under this Agreement
or under its Note, if any, with respect thereto, then, within ten (10) days
after demand by such Lender, the Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender on an after-tax
basis for such increased costs; provided that notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives thereunder or issued in
connection therewith and (y) all requests, rules, guidelines or directives
promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States
or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in
each case be deemed to be enacted, adopted or issued after the date hereof,
regardless of the date enacted, adopted or issued.

 

-52-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b) Except as required by Applicable Law, all payments made by the Borrower
under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or
withholding for or on account of, any present or future income or other similar
taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings
(“Taxes”), now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by
any governmental authority, excluding any Taxes imposed on a Lender by reason of
any connection between the Lender and the taxing jurisdiction other than a
connection that is solely attributable to executing, delivering, performing or
enforcing this Agreement and receiving payments hereunder. If any such
non-excluded Taxes (collectively, the “Non-Excluded Taxes”) are required to be
withheld or deducted from any such payment, the Borrower shall pay such
additional amounts as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually
received by a Lender after such withholding or deduction is equal to the amount
that the Lender would have received had no such withholding or deduction been
required; provided, however, that the Borrower shall not be required to increase
any such amounts payable to any Lender if such Lender fails to comply with the
requirements of Section 2.12 hereof, provided, further, that the Borrower shall
not be required to pay any additional amounts in respect of Taxes imposed under
FATCA, provided, further, that the Borrower shall not be required to pay any
U.S. withholding Taxes imposed on amounts payable to or for the account of any
Lender with respect to an applicable interest in a Loan or Commitment pursuant
to a law in effect on the date on which (i) such Lender acquires such interest
in the Loan or Commitment or (ii) such Lender changes its lending office,
except, in each case, to the extent that, pursuant to this Section 10.3, amounts
with respect to such Taxes were payable either to such Lender’s assignor
immediately before such Lender became a party hereto or to such Lender
immediately before it changed its lending office. Whenever any Non-Excluded
Taxes are payable by the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the
Borrower shall send to the Administrative Agent for its own account or for the
account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original
official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the
Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority or fail to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or
other documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may
become payable by the Administrative Agent or any Lender as result of any such
failure. The Borrower shall make any payments required pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after receipt of written
demand therefor from the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be.
The agreements set forth in this Section 10.3 shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and the payment of the Obligations. Each Lender will promptly
notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of any event of which it has
knowledge, occurring after the date hereof, which will entitle such Lender to
compensation pursuant to this Section 10.3 and will designate a different
lending office if such designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount
of, such compensation and will not, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender
made in good faith, be otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.

(c) Any Lender claiming compensation under this Section 10.3 shall provide the
Borrower with a written certificate setting forth the additional amount or
amounts to be paid to it hereunder and calculations therefor in reasonable
detail. Such certificate shall be presumptively correct absent manifest error.
In determining such amount, such Lender may use any reasonable averaging and
attribution methods (it being understood that no Lender shall be required to
disclose (i) any confidential or price sensitive information or (ii) any
information to

 

-53-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the extent prohibited by applicable law). Failure or delay on the part of any
Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 10.3 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such
compensation, provided that, other than in respect of Taxes, the Borrower shall
not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of
this Section if the circumstances giving rise to such compensation occurred more
than six (6) months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of
such circumstances and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor
(except that, if such circumstances are retroactive, then the six (6) month
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive
effect thereof). If any Lender demands compensation under this Section 10.3, the
Borrower may at any time, upon at least five (5) Business Days’ prior notice to
such Lender, Convert into a Base Rate Advance such Lender’s portion of the then
outstanding LIBOR Advances, and pay to such Lender the accrued interest and fees
thereon to the date of Conversion, along with any reimbursement required under
Section 2.9 hereof and this Section 10.3.

(d) The Borrower shall pay any present or future stamp, transfer or documentary
Taxes or any other excise or property Taxes that may be imposed in connection
with the execution, delivery or registration of this Agreement or any other Loan
Documents.

(e) If any party receives a refund of any Taxes for which it has been
indemnified pursuant to this Section 10.3, it shall pay to the indemnifying
party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity
payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such
refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified
party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant
governmental authority with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party,
upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified
party the amount paid over pursuant to this paragraph (e) (plus any penalties,
interest or other charges imposed by the relevant governmental authority) in the
event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such
governmental authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
paragraph (e), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any
amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (e) the payment of
which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax
position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to
indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld
or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with
respect to such Tax had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed
to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other
information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the
indemnifying party or any other Person.

Section 10.4 Effect On Other Advances. If notice has been given pursuant to
Section 10.1, 10.2 or 10.3 hereof suspending the obligation of any Lender to
make its portion of any LIBOR Advance, or requiring such Lender’s portion of
LIBOR Advances to be Converted, then, unless and until such Lender notifies the
Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such Conversion no longer apply,
all amounts which would otherwise be made by such Lender as its portion of LIBOR
Advances shall be made instead as Base Rate Advances, unless otherwise notified
by the Borrower.

 

-54-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 10.5 Claims for Increased Costs and Taxes; Replacement Lenders. In the
event that any Lender shall (y) decline to make LIBOR Advances pursuant to
Sections 10.1 and 10.2 hereof, or (z) have notified the Borrower that it is
entitled to claim compensation pursuant to Section 10.3, 2.8, 2.9 or 2.11 hereof
or is unable to complete the form required or is subject to withholding on
account of any Tax (each such lender being an “Affected Lender”), the Borrower
at its own cost and expense may designate a replacement lender (a “Replacement
Lender”) to purchase the outstanding Loans of such Affected Lender and such
Affected Lender’s rights hereunder and with respect thereto, and within ten
(10) Business Days of such designation the Affected Lender shall (a) sell to
such Replacement Lender, without recourse upon, warranty by or expense to such
Affected Lender, by way of an Assignment and Assumption substantially in the
form of Exhibit F attached hereto, for a purchase price equal to (unless such
Lender agrees to a lesser amount) the outstanding principal amount of the Loans
of such Affected Lender, plus all interest accrued and unpaid thereon and all
other amounts owing to such Affected Lender hereunder, including without
limitation, payment by the Borrower of any amount which would be payable to such
Affected Lender pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof (provided that the administrative
fee set forth in Section 11.4(b)(iv) shall not apply to an assignment described
in this clause (a)), and (b) upon such assumption and purchase by the
Replacement Lender, such Replacement Lender shall be deemed to be a “Lender” for
purposes of this Agreement and such Affected Lender shall cease to be a “Lender”
for purposes of this Agreement and shall no longer have any obligations or
rights hereunder (other than any obligations or rights which according to this
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement).

Administrative Agent and the Borrower, provided that the foregoing shall not
apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Article 2 if such Lender has notified

Administrative Agent’s transmission of Borrower Materials through the Internet,
except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses
are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have
any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for indirect,
special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or
actual damages).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d) Change of Address, Etc. Each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
may change its address, telecopier or telephone number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. Each other
Lender may change its address, telecopier or telephone number for notices and
other communications hereunder by notice to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent. In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Administrative Agent from
time to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent has on record (i) an
effective address, contact name, telephone number, telecopier number and
electronic mail address to which notices and other communications may be sent
and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such Lender. Furthermore, each Public
Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of such Public

designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in order to enable
such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such Public Lender’s
compliance procedures and Applicable Law, including United States Federal and
state securities laws, to make reference to Borrower Materials that are not made
available through the “Public Side Information” portion of the Platform and that
may contain material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its
securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws.

(e) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative Agent and
the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices purportedly given
by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in a
manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any
other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood
by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall
indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Related Parties of each
of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the
reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the
Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other telephonic communications with the
Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of
the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.

Section 11.2 Expenses. The Borrower will promptly pay, or reimburse:

for the Administrative Agent and one counsel for all Lenders.

Section 11.3 Waivers. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be
cumulative and not

 

-57-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have. No failure
or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Majority Lenders and the Lenders, or
any of them, in exercising any right, shall operate as a waiver of such right.
No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries therefrom shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be permitted by Section 11.11, and then such waiver or
consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for
which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a
Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether
the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default at the time.

Section 11.4 Assignment and Participation.

(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender and no Lender
may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder
except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of subsection (b) of
this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the provisions of
subsection (d) of this Section, (iii) by way of pledge or assignment of a
security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection (e) of this Section,
or (iv) to an SPC in accordance with the provisions of subsection (f) of this
Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto
shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall
be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants to the extent
provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.

(b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more
assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that
any such assignment shall be subject to the following conditions:

(i) Minimum Amounts.

(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the Loans at
the time owing to the assigning Lender or in the case of an assignment to a
Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, no minimum amount need be assigned; and

(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the
aggregate amount of the principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the
assigning Lender subject to each such assignment, determined as of the date the
Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent or, if “Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and
Assumption, as of the Trade Date, shall not be less than

 

-58-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$1,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an
assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and
obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans assigned;

(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except
to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:

(A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender
or an Affiliate of a Lender; and

(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is
not a Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender;

(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with
a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however,
that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such
processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if
it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative
questionnaire in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent.

(v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to
the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or (B) to a natural person.

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant
to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to
this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 10.2, 10.3 and 10.5 with respect to
facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such
assignment. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and
deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
subsection (d) of this Section.

 

-59-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an
agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax purposes), shall
maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and
Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders, and the principal amounts of the Loans owing to each
Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. This Section 11.4(c) shall be construed so that the Obligations are at
all times maintained in “registered form” within the meaning of Sections 163(f),
871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code and any related regulations (and any other
relevant or successor provisions of the Code or Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder). The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower and
any Lender, as to its Commitments only, at any reasonable time and from time to
time upon reasonable prior notice.

(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or
notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any
Person (other than a natural person or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s
Affiliates) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights
and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of the Loans
owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to deal solely
and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and
obligations under this Agreement.

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in clauses (ii)(A), (B)
or (C) of Section 11.11(a) that affects such Participant. Subject to the
following paragraph, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled
to the benefits of Section 10.3 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and
had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this
Section.

A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 10.3 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with
respect to the participation sold to such Participant. A Participant that would
be a foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 2.12 unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such
Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to
comply with Section 2.12 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a
participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of
the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of
each participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement
(the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation
to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person
(including the identity of any participant or any information relating to a
participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans, or its other obligations under

 

-60-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

any Loan Document) except each Lender that sells a participation shall make a
copy of the Participant Register available for the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to
establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered form
under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries
in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the
Borrower, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation
for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

(e) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including
under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other
central banking authority; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall
release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such
pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any Lender (a
“Granting Lender”) may grant to a special purpose funding vehicle (an “SPC”)
sponsored by such Granting Lender, identified as such in writing from time to
time by the Granting Lender to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, the
option to provide to the Borrower all or any part of any Advance that such
Granting Lender would otherwise be obligated to make to the Borrower pursuant to
this Agreement; provided that (i) nothing herein shall constitute a commitment
by any SPC to make any Advance and (ii) if an SPC elects not to exercise such
option or otherwise fails to provide all or any part of such Advance, the
Granting Lender shall be obligated to make such Advance pursuant to the terms
hereof. The Loans by an SPC hereunder shall be Loans of the Granting Lender to
the same extent, and as if, such Loans were made by such Granting Lender. Each
party hereto hereby agrees that no SPC shall be liable for any indemnity or
similar payment obligation under this Agreement (all liability for which shall
remain with the Granting Lender). In furtherance of the foregoing, each party
hereto hereby agrees (which agreement shall survive the termination of this
Agreement) that, prior to the date that is one year and one day after the
payment in full of all outstanding commercial paper or other senior indebtedness
of any SPC, it, solely in its capacity as a party hereto and to any other Loan
Document, will not institute against, or join any other person in instituting
against, such SPC any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or
liquidation proceedings under the laws of the United States or any State
thereof. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 11.4, any SPC may (i) with notice to, but without the prior written
consent of, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent and without paying any
processing fee therefor, assign all or a portion of its interests in any Advance
to the Granting Lender or to any financial institutions (consented to by the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent) providing liquidity and/or credit support
to or for the account of such SPC to support the funding or maintenance of
Advance and (ii) disclose on a confidential basis any non-public information
relating to its Loans to any rating agency, commercial paper dealer or provider
of any surety, guarantee or credit or liquidity enhancement to such SPC. This
Section 11.4(f) may not be amended without the written consent of any SPC which
has been designated in writing as provided in the first sentence hereof and
holds any outstanding Loans. The designation by a Granting Lender of an SPC to
fund Advances shall be deemed to be a representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement by such Granting Lender to the Borrower and all other parties
hereunder

 

-61-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

that (A) the funding and maintaining of such Advances by such SPC shall not
constitute a “prohibited transaction” (as such term is defined in Section 406 of
ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code), and (B) such designation, funding and
maintenance would not result in any interest requiring registration under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or qualification under any state securities
law. The SPC shall from time to time provide to the Borrower the tax and other
forms required pursuant to Section 2.12 hereof with respect to such SPC as
though such SPC were a Lender hereunder. In no event shall the Borrower or any
Lender other than the Granting Lender be obligated hereunder to pay any
additional amounts under any provision of this Agreement (pursuant to Article 10
hereof or otherwise) by reason of a Granting Lender’s designation of an SPC or
the funding or maintenance of Advances by such SPC, in excess of amounts which
the Borrower would have been obligated to pay if such Granting Lender had not
made such designation and such Granting Lender were itself funding and
maintaining such Advances. The Administrative Agent shall register the interest
of any SPC in an Advance from time to time on the Register maintained pursuant
to Section 11.4(c) hereof.

Section 11.5 Indemnity. The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Lender, the Administrative Agent and each of their respective Related Parties
(any of the foregoing shall be an “Indemnitee”) from and against any and all
claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, actions, reasonable and
documented external attorneys’ fees and expenses (as such fees and expenses are
reasonably incurred), penalties, judgments, suits, reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket costs and demands by any third party, including the costs of
investigating and defending such claims, whether or not the Borrower or the
Person seeking indemnification is the prevailing party (a) resulting from any
breach or alleged breach by the Borrower of any representation or warranty made
hereunder or under any Loan Document; or (b) otherwise arising out of (i) this
Agreement, any Loan Document or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby,
including, without limitation, the use of the proceeds of Loans hereunder in any
fashion by the Borrower or the performance of its obligations under the Loan
Documents, (ii) allegations of any participation by a Lender, the Administrative
Agent or any of them, in the affairs of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries,
or allegations that any of them has any joint liability with the Borrower for
any reason and (iii) any claims against the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or
any of them, by any shareholder or other investor in or lender to the Borrower,
by any brokers or finders or investment advisers or investment bankers retained
by the Borrower or by any other third party, arising out of or under this
Agreement, except to the extent that (A) the Person seeking indemnification
hereunder is determined in such case to have acted with gross negligence or
willful misconduct, in any case, by a final, non-appealable judicial order of a
court of competent jurisdiction or (B) such claims are for lost profits,
foreseeable and unforeseeable, consequential, special, incidental or indirect
damages or punitive damages. Upon receipt of notice in writing of any actual or
prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding for which
indemnification is provided pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence (a
“Relevant Proceeding”), the recipient shall promptly notify the Administrative
Agent (which shall promptly notify the other parties hereto) thereof, and the
Borrower and the Lenders agree to consult, to the extent appropriate, with a
view to minimizing the cost to the Borrower of its obligations hereunder. The
Borrower shall be entitled, to the extent feasible, to participate in any
Relevant Proceeding and shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof with
counsel of the Borrower’s choice; provided, however, that such counsel shall be
reasonably satisfactory to such of the Indemnitees as are parties thereto;
provided, further, however, that, after the Borrower has assumed the defense of
any Relevant Proceeding, it will not settle,

 

-62-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

compromise or consent to the entry of any order adjudicating or otherwise
disposing of any claims against any Indemnitee (1) if such settlement,
compromise or order involves the payment of money damages, except if the
Borrower agrees, as between the Borrower and such Indemnitee, to pay such money
damages, and, if not simultaneously paid, to furnish such Indemnitee with
satisfactory evidence of its ability to pay the same, and (2) if such
settlement, compromise or order involves any relief against such Indemnitee
other than the payment of money damages, except with the prior written consent
of such Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
Notwithstanding the Borrower’s election to assume the defense of such Relevant
Proceeding, such of the Indemnitees as are parties thereto shall have the right
to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such action or
proceeding at the expense of such Indemnitee. The obligations of the Borrower
under this Section 11.5 are in addition to, and shall not otherwise limit, any
liabilities which the Borrower might otherwise have in connection with any
warranties or similar obligations of the Borrower in any other Loan Document.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 11.5 shall not apply with respect to
Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising
from any non-Tax claim.

Section 11.6 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such
separate counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instrument. The
words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in this
Agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of
records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect,
validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature or the use of a
paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as
provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures
in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures
and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic
Transactions Act; provided, further, that, without limiting the foregoing, upon
the request of the Administrative Agent, any electronic signature shall be
promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart.

Section 11.7 Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

(a) Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the internal laws of the State of New York applicable to
agreements made and to be performed the State of New York.

(b) Jurisdiction. The Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that it
will not commence any action, litigation or proceeding of any kind or
description, whether in law or equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Administrative Agent, any Lender, or any Related Party of
the foregoing in any way relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
or the transactions relating hereto or thereto, in any forum other than the
courts of the State of New York sitting in New York County, and of the United
States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate
court from any thereof, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the jurisdiction of such courts and agrees that all
claims in respect of any such action, litigation or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, in such federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any such action,

 

-63-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

litigation or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law.
Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall affect any right
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document
against the Borrower or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

(c) Waiver of Venue. The Borrower irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any objection that it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document in any court referred
to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding
in any such court.

(d) Service of Process. Each party hereto irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 11.1. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any party hereto to serve process in any
other manner permitted by applicable law.

Section 11.8 Severability. To the extent permitted by law, any provision of this
Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof in that jurisdiction or affecting
the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

Section 11.9 Interest.

(a) In no event shall the amount of interest due or payable hereunder or under
the Notes exceed the maximum rate of interest allowed by Applicable Law, and in
the event any such payment is inadvertently made by the Borrower or
inadvertently received by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, then such
excess sum shall be credited as a payment of principal, unless, if no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, in writing, that it elects to have such
excess sum returned forthwith. It is the express intent hereof that the Borrower
not pay and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders not receive, directly or
indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that which may
legally be paid by the Borrower under Applicable Law.

(b) Notwithstanding the use by the Lenders of the Base Rate and the Eurodollar
Rate as reference rates for the determination of interest on the Loans, the
Lenders shall be under no obligation to obtain funds from any particular source
in order to charge interest to the Borrower at interest rates related to such
reference rates.

Section 11.10 Table of Contents and Headings. The Table of Contents and the
headings of the various subdivisions used in this Agreement are for convenience
only and shall not in any way modify or amend any of the terms or provisions
hereof, nor be used in connection with the interpretation of any provision
hereof.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 11.11 Amendment and Waiver.

(a) Neither this Agreement nor any Loan Document nor any term hereof or thereof
may be amended orally, nor may any provision hereof or thereof be waived orally
but only by an instrument in writing signed by or at the written direction of:

(i) except as set forth in (ii) and (iii) below, the Majority Lenders and, in
the case of any amendment, by the Borrower;

(ii) with respect to (A) any increase in the amount of any Lender’s portion of
the Commitments or any extension of the Lender’s Commitments, (B) any reduction
in the rate of, or postponement in the payment of any interest or fees due
hereunder or the payment thereof to any Lender without a corresponding payment
of such interest or fee amount by the Borrower, (C) (1) any waiver of any
Default due to the failure by the Borrower to pay any sum due to any of the
Lenders hereunder or (2) any reduction in the principal amount of the Loans
without a corresponding payment, (D) any release of the Borrower from this
Agreement, except in connection with a merger, sale or other disposition
otherwise permitted hereunder (in which case, such release shall require no
further approval by the Lenders), (E) any amendment to the pro rata treatment of
the Lenders set forth in Section 8.3 hereof, (F) any amendment of this Section
11.11, of the definition of Majority Lenders, or of any Section herein to the
extent that such Section requires action by all Lenders, (G) any subordination
of the Loans in full to any other Indebtedness, or (H) any extension of the Term
Loan Maturity Date, the affected Lenders and in the case of an amendment, the
Borrower, (it being understood that, for purposes of this Section 11.11(a)(ii),
changes to provisions of the Loan Documents that relate only to one or more of
the Loans shall be deemed to “affect” only the Lenders holding such Loans); and

(iii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Administrative Agent in addition to the Lenders required above to take such
action, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall
have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent
hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the
consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent
of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) the
Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the
consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring
the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any
Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the
consent of such Defaulting Lender.

(c) In connection with any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or
termination (a “Proposed Change”) requiring the consent of all Lenders, if the
consent of Majority Lenders is obtained, but the consent of the other Lenders
whose consent is required is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is not
obtained being referred to as a “Non-

 

-65-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Consenting Lender”), then, at the Borrower’s request (and at the Borrower’s sole
cost and expense), a Replacement Lender selected by the Borrower and reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent, shall have the right to purchase from
such Non-Consenting Lenders, and such Non-Consenting Lenders agree that they
shall, upon the Borrower’s request, sell and assign to such Person, all of the
Loans of such Non-Consenting Lenders for an amount equal to the principal
balance of all Loans held by the Non-Consenting Lenders and all accrued interest
and fees and other amounts due (including without limitation amounts due to such
Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to Section 2.9 hereof) or outstanding to such
Non-Consenting Lender through the date of sale, such purchase and sale to be
consummated pursuant to an executed Assignment and Assumption substantially in
the form on Exhibit F attached hereto. Upon execution of any Assignment and
Assumption pursuant to this Section 11.11(b), (i) the Replacement Lender shall
be entitled to vote on any pending waiver, amendment or consent in lieu of the
Non-Consenting Lender replaced by such Replacement Lender, (ii) such Replacement
Lender shall be deemed to be a “Lender” for purposes of this Agreement and
(iii) such Non-Consenting Lender shall cease to be a “Lender” for purposes of
this Agreement and shall no longer have any obligations or rights hereunder
(other than any obligations or rights which according to this Agreement shall
survive the termination of the Loans).

Section 11.12 Entire Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the other documents described or
contemplated herein or therein will embody the entire agreement and
understanding among the parties hereto and thereto and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

Section 11.13 Other Relationships; No Fiduciary Relationships. No relationship
created hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall in any way affect the
ability of the Administrative Agent and each Lender to enter into or maintain
business relationships with the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof beyond the
relationships specifically contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. The Borrower agrees that in connection with all aspects of the
transactions contemplated hereby and any communications in connection therewith,
the Borrower, its Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates, on the one hand,
and the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and their respective Affiliates, on
the other hand, will have a business relationship that does not create, by
implication or otherwise, any fiduciary duty on the part of the Administrative
Agent, any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates, and no such duty will
be deemed to have arisen in connection with any such transactions or
communications.

Section 11.14 Directly or Indirectly. If any provision in this Agreement refers
to any action taken or to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is
prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action
is taken directly or indirectly by such Person, whether or not expressly
specified in such provision.

Section 11.15 Reliance on and Survival of Various Provisions. All covenants,
agreements, statements, representations and warranties made by the Borrower
herein or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall (a) be deemed to
have been relied upon by the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders
notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter made by them and
(b) survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and shall continue in
full force and effect so long as any Loans are outstanding and unpaid. Any right
to

 

-66-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

indemnification hereunder, including, without limitation, rights pursuant to
Sections 2.9, 2.11, 10.3, 11.2 and 11.5 hereof, shall survive the termination of
this Agreement and the payment and performance of all Obligations.

Section 11.16 Senior Debt. The Obligations are intended by the parties hereto to
be senior in right of payment to any Indebtedness of the Borrower that by its
terms is subordinated to any other Indebtedness of the Borrower.

Section 11.17 Obligations. The obligations of the Administrative Agent and each
of the Lenders hereunder are several, not joint.

Section 11.18 Confidentiality. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall
hold confidentially all non-public and proprietary information and all other
information designated by the Borrower as confidential, in each case, obtained
from the Borrower or its Affiliates pursuant to the requirements of this
Agreement in accordance with their customary procedures for handling
confidential information of this nature and in accordance with safe and sound
lending practices; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders may make disclosure of any such information (a) to their examiners,
Affiliates, outside auditors, counsel, consultants, appraisers, agents, other
professional advisors, any credit insurance provider relating to the Borrower
and its obligations and any direct or indirect contractual counterparty in swap
agreements or such counterparty’s professional advisor in connection with this
Agreement or as reasonably required by any proposed syndicate member or any
proposed transferee or participant in connection with the contemplated transfer
of any Note or participation therein (including, without limitation, any pledgee
referred to in Section 11.4(e) hereof), in each case, so long as any such Person
(other than any examiners) receiving such information is advised of the
provisions of this Section 11.18 and agrees to be bound thereby, (b) as required
or requested by any governmental authority or self-regulatory body or
representative thereof or in connection with the enforcement hereof or of any

Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any
such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected
Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such
liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers
of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and

authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held,
and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing, by such Lender
or any such Affiliate, to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower
against any and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or its
Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender or Affiliate shall have
made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although
such obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a
branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different from the branch, office or
Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness; provided that
in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff,
(x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Administrative
Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.14
and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from
its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to
the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the
Advances owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of
setoff. The rights of each Lender and their respective Affiliates under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of
setoff) that such Lender or its

Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such
setoff and application.
