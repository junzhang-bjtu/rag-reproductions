Conflicting Dedication.
(b)    Certain Conflicting Dedications contain rights of first refusal or other
provisions that (i) entitle Producer to a release of acreage from such
Conflicting Dedication if Producer dedicates the released acreage to a Third
Party or (ii) expressly prohibit Producer from dedicating such released acreage
to an Affiliate of Producer. As used herein, the term “Conflicting Dedication”

Co that continues for a period of 120 Days or more;
(v)    Producer’s election, in its sole discretion or to the extent required by
applicable Law, to forego the Services with respect to certain volumes of
Product and instead recycle such Product on its own behalf or utilize Third
Party services to recycle such Product; provided, however, that Producer shall
(i) provide Midstream Co with at least 90 Days prior written notice of such
election (which notice shall include the volume of Product subject to such
election together with the schedule for the removal of such Product from the
Dedicated Production) and (ii) Producer shall promptly pay to Midstream Co all
fees (including the Individual First Phase Fee and the Individual Second Phase

Producer may deliver any Dedicated Production permanently released from the
Dedications pursuant to this Section 2.4(a) to such other gatherers as it shall
determine.
(b)    Temporary Release. Midstream Co shall temporarily release from the
Dedications: (i) any Dedicated Production from any Well, Dedicated Properties,
or Spacing Unit to the extent affected by one or more of the Interruption
Conditions, (ii) any Dedicated Production that would have been delivered to a
Separator Facility to the extent affected by one or more of the Interruption
Conditions, (iii) any Dedicated Properties to the extent affected by one or more
of the Interruption Conditions, and (iv) any Purchased Dedicated Production that
would have been delivered to a Individual System to the extent affected by one
or more of the Interruption Conditions. The temporary release shall take effect
upon written notice from Producer to Midstream Co of the occurrence of any
Interruption Condition, unless expressly provided otherwise below. “Interruption
Conditions” are:
(i)    Midstream Co’s failure to have a Completed Connection by the applicable
On-Line Deadline (other than due to Producer’s non-compliance with this
Agreement);
(ii)    the occurrence and continuation of an uncured material default by
Midstream Co;
(iii)    Midstream Co’s interruption or curtailment of receipts and deliveries
of Product pursuant to Section 5.5 that continues for a period of 30 consecutive
Days;
(iv)    until a permanent release is required under Section 2.4(a) or Section
13.2, Midstream Co’s suspension of Services pursuant to Section 13.2(a) (and, if
Section 13.2(a)(i) applies, such temporary release shall continue at the
discretion of Midstream Co, subject to the time limits set forth in Section
13.2(a)(i)).
(c)    Arrangements in Respect of Temporary Release: Limitations of
Curtailments. Producer may make alternative arrangements for the gathering of
any Dedicated Production temporarily released from the Dedications pursuant to
Section 2.4(b). To the extent that an interruption or curtailment can be limited
to a Facility Segment, Midstream Co shall so limit such interruption or
curtailment, and to the extent that Midstream Co does so limit such curtailment
or interruption, the temporary release permitted by Section 2.4(b) shall only
apply to the affected Facility Segment. Such temporary release shall continue
until the first Day of the Month after the Month during which Midstream Co cures
the applicable default or the interruption, curtailment, or suspension of
Services terminates; provided that, if Producer obtained temporary services from
a Third Party (pursuant to a contract that does not give rise to a default under
this Agreement) during the pendency of such default, interruption, curtailment,
or suspension, such release shall continue until the earlier of (A) the first
Day of the Month that is six Months after the event or condition that gave rise
to the interruption, curtailment or other temporary cessation has been corrected
and (B) the first Day of the Month after the termination of the applicable
contract with such Third Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the temporary
services that Producer may obtain under Section 3.3 shall not constitute a
release under the terms of this Agreement; provided that, if Producer cannot
obtain such temporary services without a temporary release, Midstream Co may in
its discretion grant or refuse to grant a temporary release on such terms as
reasonably required by Midstream Co (including, for example, conditioning the
grant of a temporary release on the establishment of a termination date for such
temporary release).

(d)    Evidence of Release. At the request of Producer, the Parties shall
execute a release agreement reasonably acceptable to all Parties (which, in the
case of a permanent release, shall be in recordable form) reflecting any release
of Dedicated Production or Dedicated Properties pursuant to this Section 2.4 or
pursuant to the termination of this Agreement.
Section 2.5    Covenants Running with the Land. Subject to the provisions of
Section 2.3, Section 2.4, and Article 16, each of the Dedications (a) is a
covenant running with the Dedicated Properties (including any rights described
in Section 3.5(f)), (b) touches and concerns Producer’s interests in the
Dedicated Properties (including any rights described in Section 3.5(f)), and
(c) shall be binding on and enforceable by Midstream Co and its successors and
assigns. Except as set forth in Article 16, (i) in the event Producer sells,
transfers, conveys, assigns, grants or otherwise disposes of any or all of its
interest in the Dedicated Properties, then any such sale, transfer, conveyance,
assignment, grant or other disposition shall be made subject to this Agreement
and (ii) in the event Midstream Co sells, transfers, conveys, assigns, grants or
otherwise disposes of any or all of its interest in the Individual System, then
any such sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment, grant or other disposition
shall be made subject to this Agreement. The Real Property Dedication is not an
executory contract under Section 365 of Title 11 of the United States Code (11
U.S.C. § 365).
Section 2.6    Recording of Agreement. Producer hereby authorizes Midstream Co
to record a memorandum of the Agreement and each Agreement Addendum in the form
set forth on Exhibit D in the real property records of the counties in which the
Dedication Area is located. Midstream Co and Producer agree that until Midstream
Co provides notice to the contrary, all payment terms and pricing information
shall remain confidential and be redacted from any filings in the real property
records.

provide services with respect to the Dedicated Production and Dedicated
Properties that are anticipated to be serviced by the new, modified, or enhanced
facilities if the term of such contract does not exceed six Months, and such
contract may be renewed in six-Month increments until such time as Midstream Co
has provided written notice to Producer that Midstream Co has completed the
applicable facilities and that such facilities are ready for service under this
Agreement; provided, however, that if any such contract is in effect with
respect to any Well or Separator Facility on the date that Midstream Co provides
such notice to Producer, Producer will not be obligated to deliver any Product
from such Well or Separator Facility to the System until the first Day of the
first full Month following expiration of such contract.
(b)    At any time Producer makes alternative arrangements with a Third Party
for the provision of services with respect to the Dedicated Properties or the
Dedicated Production as permitted under Section 3.3(a), Producer shall (i) if
Midstream Co commits in writing to provide Services hereunder within a period of
time that is shorter than six Months, use reasonable efforts to enter into a
contract with a term that expires on or around the date on which Midstream Co
has committed to being able to provide Services hereunder; and (ii) notify
Midstream Co of the term of such contract promptly after execution thereof.
Prior to requiring Producer to begin using, or resume using, as applicable,
Services hereunder, Midstream Co shall provide notice to Producer of the date on
which Midstream Co expects to be ready, willing and able to begin providing
Services to Producer no later than 45 Days prior to the expiration of the Third

using, as applicable, Services on a Day other than the first Day of a Month once
Midstream Co is fully capable of performing the Services.
(c)    If at any time, (i) Producer fails to deliver a Development Report on or
before the applicable deadline set forth in Section 3.1(a), (ii) a Development
Report delivered by Producer failed to describe any Well, or (iii) the average
rate of production at any Receipt Point described in the then-applicable
Development Report exceeds Producer’s forecast for such Receipt Point set forth
in such Development Report, and as a result, Midstream Co has not completed any
new, modified, or enhanced facilities necessary to allow Midstream Co to accept
all of the Product Tendered by Producer at a Receipt Point, then (x) within a
reasonable time after Midstream Co becomes aware of the need for such new,
modified, or enhanced facilities, Midstream Co shall elect, in its sole
discretion, whether to proceed with the development and completion of such
facilities by providing notice to Producer, and (y) if Midstream Co elects to
proceed with the development and completion of such facilities, (1) Midstream Co
shall cause such facilities to be completed within a reasonable time after such

Producer, Midstream Co shall promptly provide to Producer copies of all Permits
obtained by Midstream Co in order to construct and install any Facility Segment
(or portion of a Facility Segment) of the System or any other Modifications.
Section 3.5    Grant of Access; Real Property Rights.
(a)    Producer’s Grant of Access. Producer hereby grants to Midstream Co,
without warranty of title, either express or implied, to the extent that it may
lawfully and is contractually permitted to do so without the incurrence of
additional expense, the rights of ingress and egress with respect to, and the
right to access, all lands constituting Dedicated Properties for the purpose of
using, maintaining, servicing, inspecting, repairing, and operating all or any
portion of the applicable Individual System, including all pipelines, meters and
other equipment necessary for the performance by Midstream Co of this Agreement.
Such right of access shall not include any right to install, replace,
disconnect, or remove all or any portion of the applicable Individual System,
which rights may only be granted pursuant to a separate instrument entered into
pursuant to Section 3.5(f).
(b)    Producer Does Not Have Obligation to Maintain. Producer shall not have a
duty to maintain in force and effect any underlying agreements (such as any
lease, easement, or surface use agreement) that the grant of access by Producer
to Midstream Co under Section 3.5(a) is based upon, and such grant will
terminate if Producer loses its rights to the applicable property, regardless of
the reason for such loss of rights.
(c)    Midstream Co’s Grant of Access. Midstream Co hereby grants to Producer,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        


owners in fee with respect to the applicable lands, and such rights will be
exercised in material compliance with all applicable Laws and the safety and
other reasonable access requirements of the granting Party. Each Party obtaining
a right of access pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall have the status of
“licensee,” except when such Party is accessing the applicable real property by
way of a right-of-way, easement, or other similar real property right granted
pursuant to a separate instrument.
(f)    Real Property Rights. Each Party shall acquire and maintain all
easements, rights of way, surface use, surface access agreements, and other real
property rights from Third Parties necessary to perform its obligations
hereunder. To the extent a Party has the contractual right and title to do so
(including, with respect to Producer and its Affiliates, any and all rights
granted under the Dedicated Properties’ oil, gas and mineral leases, mineral fee
interests and other granting instruments with respect to easements,
rights-of-way and other similar rights for purposes of laying, constructing,
installing, maintaining, servicing, inspecting, repairing, or operating
pipelines, meters and other equipment necessary for the receipt, treating,

therefrom), such Party shall provide to the other Party the right of co-usage on
the easements, sub-easements, rights of way, surface use, and other real
property rights held by such Party covering lands for which the other Party
requires real property rights to perform its obligations hereunder, all at no
cost to the providing Party and on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to
the Parties in their reasonable discretion. Where a Party does not have the
contractual right to do so, such Party shall provide reasonable assistance to
the other Party in obtaining the real property rights with respect to such lands
as necessary or desirable to perform its obligations hereunder.
Article 4
Measurement Devices
Section 4.1    Measurement Devices.
(a)    Except as provided in Section 4.1(d) below, Midstream Co shall construct,
install, own, and operate (or cause to be constructed, installed, and operated)
the Measurement Devices located at the Measurement Points. Midstream Co may, in
its discretion, construct, install, own, and operate (or cause to be
constructed, installed, and operated) Measurement Devices located at or upstream
of the Delivery Points or at or downstream of any Receipt Point.
(b)    Midstream Co shall cause all Measurement Devices that are owned by
Midstream Co to be constructed, installed, and operated in accordance with
applicable industry standards and applicable Laws, and as set forth in the
current System Plan.
(c)    Each Party shall have the right, at its sole expense, to install, own and
operate (or cause to be constructed, installed and operated) “check meter”
Measurement Devices located at the Measurement Points, Receipt Points and
Delivery Points for which the other Party is responsible for the controlling
Measurement Device (i.e., the Measurement Device on which Monthly settlement
statements will be based). Each Party shall cause its “check meter” Measurement
Devices to be installed, subsequent to providing a minimum of 72 hours’ notice
to the other Party, so as not to interfere with the other Party’s Measurement
Devices and shall take steps that are reasonable and customary in the industry
to mitigate or prevent any problems that may interfere with the other Party’s
Measurement Devices at the Measurement Points.


- 25 -
Third Amended and Restated
Produced Water Services Agreement



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        


(d)    Midstream Co may elect to use a Producer Meter as the Measurement Device
for a Measurement Point in lieu of constructing, installing, owning, and
operating a Measurement Device located at such Measurement Point by providing
notice to Producer (including by detailing such election in the applicable
System Plan). If Midstream Co elects to use such Producer Meter as the
Measurement Device for a Measurement Point, Producer shall provide Midstream Co
reasonable access to such Producer Meter, including prior advance notice of, and
the ability to witness, the calibration of such Producer Meter.
(e)    Producer and Midstream Co shall cause Measurement Devices owned by such
Party to be constructed, installed and operated in a manner which is agreeable
to all parties involved and satisfies local and state regulation.
(f)    Midstream Co may (but shall not be obligated to) replace or make any
alterations to the Measurement Devices necessary to comply with any subsequent
amendments, revisions or modifications of applicable Law. With respect to
Producer Meters that Midstream Co has elected to use, Producer may (but shall
not be obligated to) replace or make any alterations to the Measurement Devices
necessary to comply with subsequent amendments, revisions or modifications of
applicable Law.
(g)    The accuracy of all Measurement Devices at the Measurement Points and
Delivery Points, and of all Measurement Devices that serve as “check meters” for
any such Measurement Point or Delivery Point Measurement Devices will be
verified by the owner of such Measurement Device (the “Owner”) at Monthly
intervals and, if requested, in the presence of a representative of the other
Party (the “Beneficiary”). The Owner shall verify the accuracy of any owned
Measurement Device before the next Monthly verification required by the
preceding sentence if the Beneficiary makes a written request for a special test
as described below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, when Daily deliveries of
Product at any Measurement Point or Delivery Point average 100 Barrels per Day
or less during any Month, the Owner may request from the Beneficiary that the
accuracy of the Measurement Devices at such Measurement Point or Delivery Point
be verified quarterly. If, upon any test, any Measurement Device is found to be
inaccurate by 2% or less, previous readings of such Measurement Device will be
considered correct in computing the deliveries of Product under this Agreement.
If, upon any test, any Measurement Device is found to be inaccurate by more than
2% (excessive meter factor deviation), such Measurement Device will immediately
be removed from service, adjusted, calibrated, repaired or replaced to record
accurately (within the manufacturer’s allowance for error) and reproved prior to
returning to service. If the excessive meter factor deviation can be explained
by changing conditions (gravity, temperature or flow-rate) no corrective action
may be taken if mutually agreed upon by both the Owner and the Beneficiary. Any
previous recordings of such Measurement Device with an excessive meter factor
deviation will be corrected by using the arithmetic average of the malfunction
factor and the previous factor shall be applied to the production measured
through the meter between the date of the previous factor and the date of the
malfunction factor. The proving report must clearly indicate the meter’s
malfunction factor and all remarks associated with the repairs or adjustments.
If the Beneficiary desires a special test of any Measurement Device, at least 72
hours’ advance written notice will be given to the Owner, and the Parties will
cooperate to secure a prompt test of the accuracy of such Measurement Device. If
the Measurement Device so tested is found to be inaccurate by 2% or less, the
Owner will have the right to bill the Beneficiary for the costs incurred due to
such special test, including any labor and transportation costs, and the
Beneficiary will pay such costs promptly upon invoice therefor.

(h)    If requested by the Beneficiary, the Measurement Devices owned by Owner
shall include a sufficient number of data ports, and Owner shall permit
Beneficiary to connect to such data ports, as shall be required to provide to
Beneficiary on a real-time basis all measurement data generated by such
measurement equipment. Beneficiary shall be responsible at its own cost for
obtaining equipment and services to connect to such data ports and receive and
process such data.
(i)    Each Party shall make the charts and records by which measurements are
determined available for the use of the other Party in fulfilling the terms and
conditions thereof. Each Party shall, upon written request of the other Party,
mail, email or deliver for checking and calculation all measurement data,
including flowing parameters, characteristics, constants, configurations and
events in its possession and used in the measurement of Product delivered under
this Agreement within 30 Days after the last chart for each billing period is
removed from the meter. Such data shall be returned within 90 Days after the
receipt thereof.
(j)    Each Party shall preserve or cause to be preserved for mutual use all
test data or other similar records in accordance with the applicable rules and
regulations of regulatory bodies having jurisdiction, if any, with respect to
the retention of such records, and, in any event, for at least 24 Months.
(k)    So long as the Parties to this Agreement are also parties to a
Transaction Document that covers Crude Oil, the requirements for Measurement
Devices in respect of Recovered Oil shall be covered by such Transaction
Document. If at any time the Parties to this Agreement are not also party to
another Transaction Document that covers Crude Oil, the Parties shall set forth
in the Agreement Addendum or an appropriate amendment to this Agreement the
requirements for Measurement Devices pertaining to Recovered Oil; absent such
agreement, Midstream Co shall install and maintain measuring equipment at the
Delivery Points that is in accordance with applicable API standards.
Section 4.2    Measurement Procedures. Midstream Co shall use the Measurement
Devices owned by Midstream Co (or if Midstream Co’s rights under Section 4.1(d)
are exercised, then the Measurement Devices owned by Producer) at the
Measurement Points to determine the volumes of Product passing through the
Individual System for purposes of Article 6 and Article 10. Midstream Co shall
cause (or if Midstream Co’s rights under Section 4.1(d) are exercised, then
Producer shall cause) the measurements of the quantity and quality of all
Product measured at the Measurement Points (and at each Receipt Point or
Delivery Point at which measurements are taken) to be conducted in accordance
with industry standards (referenced below):

System is shut down (i) because of maintenance, repairs, or Force Majeure, (ii)
because such shutdown is necessary to avoid injury or harm to Persons or
property, to the environment or to the integrity of all or any portion of the
Individual System or (iii) because providing Services hereunder has become
uneconomic as further described in Section 13.2, Midstream Co may interrupt or
curtail receipts of Producer’s Product, provided that any such interruption or
curtailment of Original Producer’s volumes must be done in accordance with the
priority provisions in Section 5.3(c). In such cases, Midstream Co shall have no
liability to Producer (subject to Section 11.1(b)) for its failure to receive
Product, except to the extent such shutdown is caused by the negligence, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Midstream Co. If Midstream Co is required to
so interrupt or curtail receipts of Product, Midstream Co will advise (by
telephone, following up by writing, which writing may be in the form of
electronic mail) Producer of such interruption or curtailment as soon as
practicable or in any event within 24 hours after the occurrence of such event.
(b)    Planned Curtailments and Interruptions.
(i)    Midstream Co shall have the right to curtail or interrupt receipts and
deliveries of Product for brief periods to perform necessary maintenance of and
repairs or modifications (including modifications required to perform its
obligations under this Agreement) to the Individual System; provided, however,
that to the extent reasonably practicable, Midstream Co shall coordinate its
maintenance, repair and modification operations with the operations of Producer
and, in any case, will use its reasonable efforts to schedule maintenance,
repair and modification operations so as to avoid or minimize to the greatest
extent possible service curtailments or interruptions.

(ii)    Midstream Co shall provide Producer (x) with 30 Days prior notice of any
upcoming normal and routine maintenance, repair and modification projects that
Midstream Co has planned that would result in a curtailment or interruption of
Producer’s deliveries and the estimated time period for such curtailment or
interruption and (y) with six Months prior notice of any maintenance (A) of
which Midstream Co has knowledge at least six Months in advance and (B) that is
anticipated to result in a curtailment or interruption of Producer’s deliveries
for five or more consecutive Days.
Section 5.6    Transportation and Disposal. As between the Parties, Midstream Co
shall be solely responsible, and shall make all necessary arrangements for the
receipt, further transportation, and disposal of Producer’s owned and Controlled
Product from the Receipt Points, to the Internal Transfer Points and ending at
the Delivery Points. Except to the extent expressly provided otherwise in this
Agreement, Midstream Co shall have no liability for any operations or activities
upstream or downstream of the Individual System, and Producer shall be solely
responsible, and shall make all necessary arrangements at and downstream of the
Delivery Points, for the receipt, further transportation, and marketing of
Producer’s owned and Controlled Product.
Article 6    
Fees
Section 6.1    Fees. Producer shall pay Midstream Co each Month in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement for all Services provided by Midstream Co with
respect to Dedicated Production received by Midstream Co from Producer or for
Producer’s account during such Month, an amount, for each Individual System,
equal to the sum of (i) the product of (x) the aggregate quantity of such
Product, stated in Barrels, received by Midstream Co from Producer or for
Producer’s account at the applicable Receipt Point for such Product within the
applicable Individual System during such Month, multiplied by (y) the applicable
Individual First Phase Rate (the “Individual First Phase Fee”), (ii) the product
of (x) the aggregate quantity of such Product, stated in Barrels, delivered by
Midstream Co to the Internal Transfer Point during such Month multiplied by (y)
the applicable Individual Second Phase Rate (the “Individual Second Phase Fee”)
and (iii) an amount equal to Producer’s allocated portion of the actual costs
incurred by Midstream Co for electricity required to provide Services, such
allocation to be based upon the aggregate volumes of Product received by
Midstream Co.
Section 6.2    Fee Adjustments.
(a)    Redetermination.
(i)    Redetermination Proposal. Between November 1 and December 31 of any Year,
Midstream Co shall prepare and deliver to Producer for its review and comment a
written proposal (each, a “Redetermination Proposal”) to redetermine each
Individual Fee (unless the Parties mutually agree not to redetermine any
particular Individual Fee) in accordance with this Section 6.2(a). Each
Redetermination Proposal shall include relevant supporting documentation based
upon the latest updated Development Report and System Plan and shall take into
account future items including, projected production volumes, operating revenue
projections, and budgeted amounts for capital expenditures and all estimated
operating expenses that Midstream Co believes will be necessary to


- 31 -
Third Amended and Restated
Produced Water Services Agreement



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        


provide the applicable Services as contemplated by the latest updated
Development Report and System Plan; provided that a redetermined Individual Fee
as agreed to by the Parties (a “Redetermined Individual Fee”) shall not recoup
the difference between (A) estimated operating expenses or revenues and (B)
actual operating expenses or revenues for periods prior to the effective date of
such Redetermined Individual Fee. The Parties may agree to redetermine a
particular Individual Fee without obligation to agree to redetermine any other
Individual Fee.
(i)    Subsequent Redetermination Timing. Any Redetermined Individual Fee agreed
to by the Parties on or prior to the last Business Day of February of the
applicable Adjustment Year (“Redetermination Deadline”) shall become effective
as of the first Day of the Month following the Month in which agreement has been
reached. If the Parties fail to agree upon a redetermination of any Individual
Fee set forth in the applicable Redetermination Proposal on or prior to the
Redetermination Deadline, such Individual Fee shall remain in effect without
redetermination pursuant to this Section 6.2(a). For purposes of this Section
6.2(a)(ii), the Year immediately after the Year during which a Redetermination
Proposal is delivered is herein the “Adjustment Year”.
(b)    Annual Escalation. Effective as of July 1 of each Year, each Individual
Fee will be increased by multiplying the then applicable Individual Fee (as
increased for prior Years pursuant to this Section 6.2(b) or otherwise adjusted
pursuant to this Agreement) by the Escalation Percentage; provided that
Reimbursed Amounts shall not be subject to this Section 6.2(b). Such annual
increase to the Individual Fee shall become effective on July 1 of the
applicable Year, even if such Individual Fee was redetermined pursuant to
Section 6.2(a), with an effective date during the same Year.


Section 6.3    Treatment of Byproducts, System Gains/Losses, Fuel and Related
Matters. No separate fee shall be chargeable by Midstream Co and no refund or
reduction in the Individual First Phase Fee or the Individual Second Phase Fee
shall be chargeable by or owed to Producer for the hydrocarbons or services
described in this Section 6.3.
(a)    Reserved.
(b)    Recovered Oil. Midstream Co shall deliver to Producer, each Month, all
Recovered Oil allocated to Producer or for Producer’s account by delivering such
Recovered Oil into the Crude Oil Gathering System. At all times during the Term,
the Parties shall set forth in the Agreement Addendum or an appropriate
amendment to this Agreement the methodology for Midstream Co to deliver
Recovered Oil to Producer and any fee applicable thereto. Midstream Co shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to limit the amount of Crude Oil remaining in
Product at the applicable Delivery Point to 0.5% or less of the total Product
volume (the “Remaining Crude Oil Limit”); provided that, except as provided
otherwise in this Section 6.3(b), Producer shall pay all costs and expenses in
connection with the implementation of any modifications necessary to achieve the
Remaining Crude Oil Limit (the “Crude Recovery Costs”) and Producer shall
release, protect, indemnify and hold harmless Midstream Co from and against all
other liabilities and claims directly or indirectly resulting from, arising out
of, or relating to the implementation of such modifications. Prior to the
implementation of any such modifications, Midstream Co shall provide Producer
with written notice of its good faith estimate of the Crude Recovery Costs for
such modifications, and Producer shall,


- 32 -
Third Amended and Restated
Produced Water Services Agreement



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        


within 30 Days of receiving such notice, provide Midstream Co with written
notice of whether Midstream Co should proceed with the implementation of such
modifications. If Producer fails to respond to such notice or elects that
Midstream Co should not proceed with such modifications, then Producer will have
no obligation to pay the associated Crude Recovery Costs and Midstream Co will
have no obligation to implement such modifications or incur any costs or
expenses in connection with achieving the Remaining Crude Oil Limit.
(c)    System Gains/Losses.
(i)    Midstream Co will perform a Monthly material balance for each Individual
System based on comparison of Product delivered and the amount of Product
calculated to have been delivered into the Individual System (after removal of
Recovered Oil) (in conjunction with determining the theoretical Crude Oil volume
under any Transaction Document to which Midstream Co is a Party covering crude
oil gathering services) received into the Individual System at Receipt Points.
Actual gains or losses in an Individual System from the material balance will be
allocated back to Producer’s Receipt Points to determine allocated quantities of
Product received at Receipt Points for each Month.
(ii)    If, during any Month, System Gains/Losses on an Individual System
allocated to Producer in accordance with this Agreement exceeds 2.00% of the
total quantities of Producer’s owned or Controlled Product delivered to the
Individual System in such Month, then Midstream Co will, for the respective
Individual System, obtain updated test data (i.e. sample results, meter proves,
etc.) from Receipt Points involved in calculating the amount of Product
determined to have been delivered into the Individual System (after removal of
Recovered Oil) (in conjunction with determining the theoretical Crude Oil volume
under any Transaction Document relating to the provision of crude oil gathering
services by Midstream Co) and conduct a field-wide (on an Individual System
basis) meter inspection and proving, if necessary, followed by an updated
balance. If Midstream Co determines that a repair to the Individual System is
needed to reduce the System Gains/ Losses below 2.00%, Midstream Co shall
undertake such repairs in a commercially reasonable manner and as soon after
making such determination as is commercially reasonable.
(iii)    Midstream Co shall provide Producer with prior notice of, and
reasonable access to observe, any such field-wide meter balance.
(d)    Other System Fuel. Midstream Co shall account for the Other System Fuel
used by Midstream Co in the operation of the Individual System. If during any
Month, the Producer does not deliver to Midstream Co Gas under any Transaction
Document to which Midstream Co is a party, then Midstream Co shall calculate the
value of the Other System Fuel used during the applicable Month based on the
price of Gas received by Producer during such Month and such amount shall appear
as an additional fee owed by Producer to Midstream Co on an invoice delivered to
Producer within 90 Days after the end of the applicable Month.

Article 7
Quality Specifications
Section 7.1    Quality Specification. Subject to Section 7.2, at no time shall
Midstream Co be required to accept Product that is not produced from a Well
within the Dedication Area. Subject to Section 7.2, Producer shall cause all
Product delivered at the Receipt Points to Midstream Co to meet the quality
specifications of the applicable Downstream Facility. If Producer’s Product
delivered to the Receipt Points complies with such quality specifications, then
all Product redelivered at the Delivery Points by Midstream Co to Producer shall
meet the quality specifications of the applicable Downstream Facility. Producer
shall not have the right to consent to any changes to the quality specifications
of the applicable Downstream Facility or the quality specifications of any
Downstream Facility not in existence as of the Effective Date. Midstream Co may
commingle Product received into the Individual System with other Product
shipments, and subject to Midstream Co’s obligation to redeliver to Producer at
the Delivery Points Product that satisfies the applicable quality specifications
of the Delivery Points, (i) such Product shall be subject to such changes in
quality, composition and other characteristics as may result from such
commingling and the removal of Recovered Oil (if any), and (ii) Midstream Co
shall have no other obligation to Producer associated with changes in quality of
Product as a result of such commingling and Recovered Oil removal. If Producer
Tenders any Product which fails to conform to the applicable quality
specifications stated in this Section 7.1, Producer shall cause such Product to
conform to the applicable quality specifications at its sole cost.


Section 7.2    Failure to Meet Specifications.
(a)    If any Product Tendered by Producer to the Individual System fails at any
time to conform to the applicable specifications, then Midstream Co will have
the right to immediately discontinue receipt of such non-conforming Product and
shall notify Producer of the specifications violation within 24 hours after such
discontinuation. Such notification may be verbal initially followed by written
confirmation in accordance with the notice requirements set forth in Section
17.2. If Producer disputes Midstream Co’s determination that any Product fails
to conform to the applicable specifications, then Producer shall (i) notify
Midstream Co thereof within 24 hours after receiving such notice from Midstream
Co, (ii) submit the applicable Product to a mutually agreed upon Third Party
laboratory, and (iii) cause such laboratory to analyze the Product within 72
hours after Producer’s receipt of Midstream Co’s notice of non-conformance. If
the results of such analysis provide that the applicable Product is
non-conforming, the costs and expenses associated with such analysis shall be
borne by Producer; if the results of such analysis provide that the applicable
Product conforms to the specifications, then Midstream Co shall reimburse
Producer for all reasonable and documented costs and expenses incurred by
Producer to cause such Third Party laboratory to perform such analysis.
(b)    Midstream Co shall have the right, to be exercised in Midstream Co’s sole
discretion, to use commercially reasonable efforts to blend and commingle any or
all of such non-conforming Product with other Product in the Individual System
so that it meets the applicable specifications. Midstream Co may charge Producer
a reasonable fee to compensate Midstream Co for its use of commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such Product Tendered by Producer to conform to the
applicable specifications. Producer will promptly undertake commercially
reasonable measures to eliminate the cause of such non-conformance.

performance of the Services.
Section 9.2    Custody. From and after Producer’s delivery of its owned or
Controlled Product to Midstream Co at the Receipt Points, and until Midstream
Co’s disposal of Product or redelivery of such Product to or for Producer’s
account at the applicable Delivery Points, as between the Parties, Midstream Co
shall have custody and control of, and be responsible for, such Product. In all
other circumstances, as between the Parties, Producer shall be deemed to have
custody and control of, and be responsible for, such Product.
Article 10
Billing and Payment
Section 10.1    Statements.
(a)    Ordinary Course. Midstream Co shall submit invoices to Producer on or
before the 25th Day after the end of each Month (the “Invoice Month”). Each
invoice shall be accompanied by supporting information for all amounts charged
by such invoice. All amounts owed for Services provided during an Invoice Month
shall be reflected on the applicable invoice for such Invoice Month; provided
that to the extent any amount appearing on an invoice is in respect of an amount
paid by Midstream Co to a Third Party (collectively, the “Reimbursed Amount”) or
the calculation of such amount is contingent on information provided by a Third
Party (collectively, the “Conditional Amount”), such Reimbursed Amount and
Conditional Amount shall be reflected on an invoice within 90 Days after the end
of the Month in which such Reimbursed Amount was paid by Midstream Co.
(b)    Other. If actual measurements of volumes of Dedicated Production are not
available by the date stated in Section 10.1(a), then Midstream Co may prepare
and submit an invoice based on Midstream Co’s good faith estimate of the volumes
of Dedicated Production received in the applicable Invoice Month. If Midstream
Co submits an invoice based on estimated volumes, Midstream Co shall prepare and
submit to Producer an invoice based on actual measurements on or before the
close of business on the 40th Day after the applicable Invoice Month, together
with a reconciliation to the invoice submitted based on Midstream Co’s estimate.
(c)    Detail. Midstream Co shall cause its invoices and supporting information
to include information reasonably sufficient to explain and support any
estimates and charges reflected therein, the reconciliation of any estimates
made in a prior Month to the actual measurements for such Month, and any
adjustments to prior period volumes and quantities.
(d)    Monthly Loss/ Gain Report. For each Invoice Month, Midstream Co shall
deliver a Monthly Loss/Gain Report to Producer, on or before the close of
business on the third applicable Business Day following the later of (i) the end
of such Invoice Month, or (ii) the Day on which Producer has delivered all data
reasonably required by Midstream Co to generate such Monthly Loss/ Gain Report
with respect to such Invoice Month. If Midstream Co elects, it may deliver such
Monthly Loss/ Gain Report concurrently with the applicable invoice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        


(e)    One Invoice; Netting. To the extent that Midstream Co and Producer are
party to this Agreement and one or more other Transaction Documents, one invoice
may be delivered in respect of all amounts owing under such Transaction
Documents. The Parties shall net all undisputed amounts due and owing or past
due and owing arising under the Transaction Documents to which Producer and
Midstream Co are parties such that the Party owing the greater amount shall make
a single payment of the net amount to the other Party. No amounts owing to or by
any Midstream Co may be set off against amounts owing to or by any other
Midstream Co. No amounts owing to or by any Producer may be set off against
amounts owing to or by any other Producer. To the extent possible, all fee
adjustments set forth in Article 6 shall be accomplished by setoff or netting.
Section 10.2    Payments.
(a)    Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, all invoices under this Agreement
shall be due and payable in accordance with each invoice’s instructions on or
before the later of the 30th Day of each Month and the 10th Day after receipt of
the invoice or, if such Day is not a Business Day, then on the next Business
Day. All payments by Producer under this Agreement shall be made by electronic
funds transfer to the account designated by Midstream Co. Any amounts not paid
by the due date will be deemed delinquent and, with respect to amounts owed to
Midstream Co, will accrue interest at the Interest Rate, such interest to be
calculated from and including the due date but excluding the date the delinquent
amount is paid in full.
(b)    If Producer, in good faith, disputes the amount of any invoice of
Midstream Co, Producer will pay Midstream Co such amount, if any, that is not in
dispute and shall provide Midstream Co notice, no later than 30 Days after the
date that payment of such invoice would be due under Section 10.2(a), of the
disputed amount accompanied by reasonable documentation to support Producer’s
dispute. If Producer fails to provide notice of dispute within such 30-Day
period, then Producer shall be deemed to have waived its right to dispute the
applicable invoice, except for a dispute following an audit conducted in
accordance with Section 10.4. Following Midstream Co’s receipt of such dispute
notice, Producer and Midstream Co shall endeavor in good faith to resolve such
dispute, and if the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute within a
reasonable time, such dispute may be resolved in accordance with Section 17.6 of
this Agreement. Upon resolution of the dispute, any required payment shall be
made within 15 Days after such resolution, and, if such amount shall be paid to
Midstream Co, such amount shall be paid along with interest accrued at the
Interest Rate from and including the due date but excluding the date paid
Section 10.3    Adequate Assurances. If (a) Producer fails to pay according to
the provisions hereof and such failure continues for a period of 5 Business Days
after written notice of such failure is provided to Producer, (b) Producer is
not the Original Producer or (c) Midstream Co has reasonable grounds for
insecurity regarding the performance by Producer of any obligation under this
Agreement, then Midstream Co, by notice to Producer, may, singularly or in
combination with any other rights it may have, demand Adequate Assurance of
Performance from Producer. “Adequate Assurance of Performance” means, at the
option of Producer, any of the following, (x) advance payment in cash by
Producer to Midstream Co for Services to be provided under this Agreement in the
following Month or (y) delivery to Midstream Co by Producer of an irrevocable
standby letter of credit or a performance bond, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Midstream Co, issued by a Credit-Worthy Person, in an amount equal
to not less than the aggregate


- 37 -
Third Amended and Restated
Produced Water Services Agreement



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        


proceeds due from Producer under Section 10.1 for the prior 2-Month period.
Promptly following the termination of the condition giving rise to Midstream
Co’s reasonable grounds for insecurity or payment in full of amounts
outstanding, as applicable, Midstream Co shall release to Producer the cash,
letter of credit, bond or other assurance provided by Producer (including any
accumulated interest, if applicable, and less any amounts actually applied to
cover Producer’s obligations hereunder).
Section 10.4    Audit. Each Party has the right, at its sole expense and during
normal working hours, to examine the records of the other Party to the extent
reasonably necessary to verify the accuracy of any statement, charge or
computation made pursuant to the provisions of the Transaction Documents. The
scope of such examination will be limited to the 24 Months preceding the date
such notice of audit, statement, charge or computation was presented. No Party
may conduct more than one audit (taking all Transaction Documents to which
Producer is a party together) of another Party during any Year (except that, if
a Party is in default hereunder, additional audits may be conducted during the
continuance of such default). If any such examination reveals any inaccuracy in
any statement or charge, the necessary adjustments in such statement or charge
and the payments necessitated thereby shall be made within 60 Days after
resolution of the inaccuracy. This provision of this Agreement will survive any
termination of this Agreement for the later of (a) a period of 24 Months from
the end of the Year in which the date of such termination occurred or (b) until
a dispute initiated within the 24 Month period is finally resolved, in each case
for the purpose of such statement and payment objections.
Article 11
Remedies
Section 11.1    Suspension of Performance; Temporary Release from
Dedication    .
(a)    Suspension by Midstream Co as Remedy for Payment Default. If Producer
fails to pay any invoice rendered under Article 10, such failure is not due to a
good faith dispute by Producer in accordance with Section 10.2(b) and such
failure is not remedied within five Business Days after Producer’s receipt of
written notice of such failure from Midstream Co, Midstream Co shall have the
right, at its sole discretion, to (i) suspend performance (including withholding
any payments that are owed by Midstream Co to Producer, and such withheld
amounts shall not be subject to setoff under Section 10.1(e)) under this
Agreement until such amount, including interest at the Interest Rate, is paid in
full or (ii) continue performing the Services under this Agreement, and, acting
in a commercially reasonable manner, sell any Product delivered by Producer to
the Receipt Points on Producer’s behalf, and use the proceeds therefrom to
reimburse Midstream Co for any amounts due and owing to Midstream Co, and, at
Producer’s election, either (y) remit any excess amounts received under such
sale to Producer or (z) reduce the Services Fee due from Producer to Midstream
Co for the following Month by the amount of such excess.
(b)    Additional Suspensions as Remedies. If a Party fails to perform or comply
with any material warranty, covenant or obligation (other than as addressed in
Section 11.1(a) or Section 2.4(a)(i)) and such failure has not been remedied
within 60 Days after its receipt of written notice from the other Party of such
failure, then the non-defaulting Party shall have the right to suspend
performance of its obligations under this Agreement that are affected by such
failure or non-compliance (including withholding any payments that are owed to
the other Party, and such withheld amounts shall not be subject to netting or
setoff under


- 38 -
Third Amended and Restated
Produced Water Services Agreement



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        


Section 10.1(e)); provided that Producer may not withhold any payments that are
owed to Midstream Co for Services actually performed by Midstream Co.
(c)    Specific Performance and Declaratory Judgments. Damages in the event of
breach of this Agreement by a Party hereto may be difficult, if not impossible,
to ascertain. Therefore, each Party, in addition to and without limiting any
other remedy or right it may have, will have the right to seek a declaratory
judgment and will have the right to an injunction or other equitable relief in
any court of competent jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach, and enforcing
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, and each of the Parties hereto
hereby waives any and all defenses it may have on the ground of lack of
jurisdiction or competence of the court to grant such an injunction or other
equitable relief. The existence of this right will not preclude any Party from
pursuing any other rights and remedies at law or in equity that such Party may
have.
Section 11.2    No Election. In the event of a default by a Party under this
Agreement, the other Party shall be entitled in its sole discretion to pursue
one or more of the remedies set forth in this Agreement, or such other remedy as
may be available to it under this Agreement, at Law or in equity, subject,
however, to the limitations set forth in Section 11.3 and Article 15. No
election of remedies shall be required or implied as the result of a Party’s
decision to avail itself of a remedy under this Agreement.
Section 11.3    DIRECT DAMAGES. A PARTY’S DAMAGES RESULTING FROM A BREACH OR
VIOLATION OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, COVENANT, AGREEMENT OR CONDITION
CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ACT OR OMISSION ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE LIMITED TO ACTUAL DIRECT DAMAGES AND SHALL NOT INCLUDE
ANY OTHER LOSS OR DAMAGE, INCLUDING INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL,
INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, PRODUCTION,
OR REVENUES, AND EACH PARTY RELEASES THE OTHER PARTY FROM ALL SUCH CLAIMS FOR
LOSS OR DAMAGE OTHER THAN ACTUAL DIRECT DAMAGES; PROVIDED THAT THIS LIMITATION
TO DIRECT DAMAGES SHALL NOT LIMIT THE PARTIES’ INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER
Section 3.5(c), Section 7.3, AND Article 15.
Article 12
Force Majeure
Section 12.1    Force Majeure. If either Midstream Co or Producer is rendered
unable by an event of Force Majeure to carry out, in whole or part, its
obligations under this Agreement and such Party gives notice (which notice may
initially be delivered orally so long as written notice is delivered as soon as
reasonably practicable thereafter) and reasonably full details of the event
(including the nature, extent, effect, and likely duration of the event or
circumstances constituting the Force Majeure event) to the other Party as soon
as practicable after the occurrence of the event, then, during the pendency of
such Force Majeure, but only during that period, the obligations of the Party
affected by the event shall be canceled or suspended, as applicable, to the
extent required; provided, however, that notwithstanding anything in the
foregoing to the contrary, no Party shall be relieved from any indemnification
obligation or any obligation to make payments, as the result of Force Majeure,
regardless of which Party is affected; provided further that if the Force
Majeure impacts only a particular Facility Segment or Individual System, then
the suspension of obligations described in this sentence shall apply only to the
applicable Facility Segment or Individual System and not to the


- 39 -
Third Amended and Restated
Produced Water Services Agreement



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        


obligations owing in connection with the rest of the System. The Party affected
by Force Majeure shall use commercially reasonable efforts to remedy the Force
Majeure condition with all reasonable dispatch, shall give notice to the other
Party of the termination of the Force Majeure, and shall resume performance of
any suspended obligation promptly after termination of such Force Majeure.
Section 12.2    Extension Due to Force Majeure    . If a Party is unable to meet
any deadline set forth herein as a result of a Force Majeure, then provided that
such Party complies with the provisions of Section 12.1, such deadline shall be
extended for a period of time equal to the period of time during which such
Party is delayed due to the Force Majeure.
Article 13
Change in Law; Uneconomic Service
Section 13.1    Changes in Applicable Law.
(a)    If any new Laws are enacted or amended or any new interpretations in
respect of previously existing Laws are issued after the T&C Effective Date that
require Midstream Co to make capital expenditures with respect to the System,
then Midstream Co may propose an increase to the applicable Individual Fee as
may be necessary or appropriate to preserve and continue for the Parties the
rights and benefits originally contemplated for the Parties by this Agreement;
provided, however, that no increase to the applicable Individual Fee pursuant to
this Section 13.1 shall be applicable unless and until, in the reasonable
judgment of Midstream Co, Midstream Co would be required to make capital
expenditures with respect to the System in order to comply with such new Law
that materially and adversely affects the economics of the Services provided,
fees received, or the other economic benefits of this Agreement for Midstream
Co.
(b)    Producer shall accept or reject, in its sole discretion, Midstream Co’s
proposed increase to the Individual Fee within 30 Days after receiving such
proposal from Midstream Co. If Producer fails to provide notice of such
acceptance or rejection within such 30-Day period, then Producer shall be deemed
to have accepted such increase. The Parties will amend, update, or revise the
applicable Agreement Addendum in accordance with this Agreement to reflect any
changes in the applicable Individual Fee agreed to in accordance with this
Section 13.1. If Producer rejects the amount of the proposed increase, then
Producer shall elect to either (x) cause Midstream Co to release the Wells,
Separator Facilities, Receipt Points, Spacing Units, and Dedicated Production
that would have been affected by such increase in accordance with Section
2.4(a)(vii) or (y) at Producer’s sole cost and expense, cause Midstream Co make
such capital expenditures with respect to the System in order to comply with
such new Law and such capital expenditures shall be included on the monthly
invoice and paid in accordance with Section 10.1 and Section 10.2. In the event
Producer makes an election under clause (y) above, (i) the Individual Fee shall
not be increased pursuant to this Section 13.1 and (ii) the Parties shall meet
and cooperate in good faith to ensure any facilities constructed under this
clause (b) comply with customary engineering, construction and operating
specifications in the industry and such facilities will become part of the
Individual System and the property of Midstream Co.
(c)    Producer and Midstream Co shall use their commercially reasonable efforts
to comply with new and amended applicable Laws and new interpretations of
existing Laws.

Section 13.2    Unprofitable Operations and Rights of Termination.
(a)    Cessation of Services. If, in the sole discretion of Midstream Co, (x)
the gathering of Product from any Wells, Separator Facilities or Receipt Points,
(y) the delivery of Product to any Delivery Points or (z) the provision of any
other Service under this Agreement, is or becomes uneconomical due to its
volume, quality, or for any other cause, then Midstream Co shall not be
obligated to provide the applicable Services so long as such condition exists.
(i)    If Midstream Co suspends Services under this Section 13.2(a) as a result
of Producer’s (A) negligence, willful misconduct, or breach of this Agreement,
(B) delivery of Product that fails to meet the quality specifications required
by Section 7.1, or (C) execution of a plan of development that deviates from the
then-applicable Development Report, then Midstream Co may resume providing such
Services at any time, upon two Months’ advance written notice delivered to
Producer, and the affected Wells, Separator Facilities, Receipt Points, Spacing
Units, Dedicated Properties and Dedicated Production shall only be permanently
released as a result of suspension under this clause (i) by mutual agreement of
the Parties under Section 2.4(a)(iii).
(ii)    If Midstream Co suspends Services under this Section 13.2(a) for any
reason other than as specified in clause (i) above and (x) such suspension
continues for six consecutive Months or (y) Midstream Co delivers notice to
Producer that such suspension shall be permanent, then the applicable Wells,
Separator Facilities, Receipt Points, Spacing Units and Dedicated Production
shall be permanently released as specified in Section 2.4(a)(viii).
(b)    Election not to Connect a Planned Well or Planned Separator Facility. If
Midstream Co determines, in its discretion, that the connection of an Individual
System to any Planned Well or Planned Separator Facility operated by Original
Producer, as described in Section 3.1(c) hereof, would be uneconomical, then
upon Midstream Co’s delivery of a System Plan (marked as “Final”) indicating
that a requested expansion would be uneconomical pursuant to Section 13.2(e):
(i)    No more than 30 Days after delivery of the System Plan pursuant to
Section 13.2(b) above, Midstream Co shall provide Original Producer Midstream
Co’s proposed terms and conditions under which it would connect the Individual
System to the Planned Well or Planned Separator Facility and transport Product
under the terms of this Agreement, including estimated construction costs.
Original Producer shall have 30 Days to accept or reject Midstream Co’s terms
and conditions. If Original Producer accepts Midstream Co’s proposed terms and
conditions, then Midstream Co shall, within 30 Days thereof, provide Original
Producer with an updated System Plan detailing the connection of the Individual
System to such Planned Well or Planned Separator Facility and such connection
shall be governed by Section 3.1(c). If Original Producer does not respond to
Midstream Co’s terms and conditions within such 30-Day period, it shall be
deemed to have rejected Midstream Co’s proposed terms and conditions.
(ii)    If Original Producer rejects Midstream Co’s terms and conditions under
clause (A) above, then Original Producer may, at its sole cost and expense,
simultaneously elect in writing to cause Midstream Co to design, construct and
install the facilities necessary to connect the Planned

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        


Well or Planned Separator Facility to the Individual System, such facilities
will become part of the Individual System and the property of Midstream Co. The
Parties shall meet and cooperate in good faith to ensure any facilities
constructed under this clause (ii) have the capacity to handle the estimated
Dedicated Production in the Development Report and to comply with customary
engineering, construction and operating specifications in the industry. Within
30 Days of Original Producer’s election hereunder, Midstream Co shall provide
Original Producer with an updated System Plan detailing the connection of the
Individual System to such Planned Well or Planned Separator Facility, any costs
and expenses shall be included on the monthly invoice and paid in accordance
with Section 10.1 and Section 10.2 and such connection shall otherwise be
governed by Section 3.1(d). Beginning on the first Day Midstream Co receives
Dedicated Production Tendered by Original Producer from any Well or Separator
Facility connected in accordance with this clause (ii), then the Individual Fee
paid on the Product received from the applicable Well or Separator Facility will
be reduced by 30% until such time as the benefit received by Original Producer
from the reduced Individual Fee equals 115% of the actual costs incurred by
Producer to design, construct and install such facilities.
(c)    Election not to Expand System.
(i)    If Midstream Co determines, in its discretion, that an expansion of the
Individual System to satisfy the needs of Producer (other than Original
Producer), as described in Section 3.1(c) hereof, would be uneconomical, then
Midstream Co shall neither be obligated to undertake such expansion nor to
provide the applicable Services. Producer shall be entitled to a release of the
applicable Planned Wells, Planned Separator Facilities and Dedicated Production
pursuant to Section 2.4(a)(viii) immediately upon Midstream Co’s delivery of a
System Plan (marked as “Final”) indicating that a requested expansion would be
uneconomical pursuant to Section 13.2(e).
(ii)    If Midstream Co determines, in its discretion, that an expansion of the
Individual System to satisfy the needs of Original Producer (other than
connections of any Planned Well or Planned Separator Facility operated by
Original Producer), as described in Section 3.1(c) hereof, then upon Midstream
Co’s delivery of a System Plan (marked as “Final”) indicating that a requested
expansion would be uneconomical pursuant to Section 13.2(e):
(A)    No more than 30 Days after delivery of the System Plan pursuant to
Section 13.2(c)(ii) above, Midstream Co shall provide Original Producer
Midstream Co’s proposed terms and conditions under which it would expand the
Individual System and transport Product under the terms of this Agreement,
including estimated construction costs. Original Producer shall have 30 Days to
accept or reject Midstream Co’s terms and conditions. If Original Producer
accepts Midstream Co’s proposed terms and conditions, then Midstream Co shall,
within 30 Days thereof, provide Original Producer with an updated System Plan
detailing the expansion of the Individual System and such expansion shall be
governed by Section 3.1(c). If Original Producer does not respond to Midstream
Co’s terms and conditions within such 30-Day period, it shall be deemed to have
rejected Midstream Co’s proposed terms and conditions.

(B)    If Original Producer rejects Midstream Co’s terms and conditions under
clause (A) above, then Original Producer may, at its sole cost and expense,
simultaneously elect in writing to cause Midstream Co to design, construct and
install the facilities necessary to expand the Individual System, such
facilities will become part of the Individual System and the property of
Midstream Co. The Parties shall meet and cooperate in good faith to ensure any
facilities constructed under this clause (B) have the capacity to handle the
estimated Dedicated Production in the Development Report and to comply with
customary engineering, construction and operating specifications in the
industry. Within 30 Days of Original Producer’s election hereunder, Midstream Co
shall provide Original Producer with an updated System Plan detailing the
expansion of the Individual System, any costs and expenses shall be included on
the monthly invoice and paid in accordance with Section 10.1 and Section 10.2
and such expansion shall otherwise be governed by Section 3.1(d). Beginning on
the first Day Midstream Co receives Dedicated Production Tendered by Original
Producer from any expansion of the Individual System in accordance with this
clause (B), then the Individual Fee paid on the incremental Product received
from the Individual System will be reduced by 30% until such time as the benefit
received by Original Producer from the reduced Individual Fee equals 115% of the
actual costs incurred by Producer to design, construct and install such
facilities.
(d)    Start of Suspension of Services. Midstream Co shall cause any suspension
of Services permitted by this Section 13.2 to commence on the first Day of a
Month and not on any other Day.
(e)    Supporting Documentation. As soon as Midstream Co determines that an
expansion of the Individual System or connection of a Planned Well or Planned
Separator Facility to the System will not be economic or that continuing to
provide Services at existing facilities has been rendered uneconomic, Midstream
Co shall communicate the same to Producer. With respect to existing facilities,
such notice shall be delivered to Producer at least 60 Days in advance of any
proposed curtailment under this Section 13.2 and such notice shall be
accompanied by documentation supporting its claim that certain Services have
become uneconomical. With respect to planned facilities, Midstream Co shall
indicate that providing Services to Planned Wells or Planned Separator
Facilities is uneconomical by failing to include the necessary expansion or
connection projects in the applicable System Plan and shall provide supporting
documentation for its determination or connection that such expansion would be
uneconomical, if requested by Producer. If Midstream Co delivers a System Plan
(marked as “Final”) describing the necessary expansion or connection projects,
such delivery shall be deemed to be a commitment by Midstream Co to complete
such expansion or connection without exercising its rights under Section 13.2(b)
or Section 13.2(c), as applicable, so long as conditions (including anticipated
throughput, pricing, the ability to obtain rights-of-way, Producer’s continued
execution of the Development Report, and any other factors deemed material by
Midstream Co) do not materially change; provided, however that upon the
initiation of Services through such expansion or connection project or through a
component part of such expansion or connection project, such expansion,
connection or applicable portion thereof shall be considered “existing
facilities” for purposes of this Section 13.2 and Midstream Co shall have all of
the rights set forth herein with respect to existing facilities that


- 43 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        


become uneconomical. Nothing in this Section 13.2(e) shall give Producer a right
to consent to a suspension under this Section 13.2.
(f)    No Obligation to Drill or Operate. Without limiting the right of Producer
to revise the Development Report to eliminate any proposed Wells or Separator
Facilities, nothing herein shall be construed to require Producer to drill any
Well, to continue to operate any Well, to place any new Separator Facility into
service or to maintain the operation of any Separator Facility that a prudent
operator would not in like circumstances drill or continue to operate.

WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT, CONCURRENT,
COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY, ACTIVE, PASSIVE, OR OTHERWISE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR
OTHER FAULT, OF ANY MEMBER OF MIDSTREAM CO GROUP OR THE PRODUCER GROUP, WITHOUT
REGARD TO THE CAUSE OR CAUSES THEREOF AND WITHOUT LIMITATION OF SUCH LOSS AND

Section 15.2    Indemnification Regarding Third Parties    . Each Party shall
release, protect, defend, indemnify and hold the other Party harmless against
any Loss by a Third Party that is not a member of the Producer Group or

the insured Party’s indemnification obligations hereunder, and (ii) written and
endorsed to include waivers of all subrogation rights of the insurers against
Midstream Co and its Group (in the case of Producer’s insurance) or Producer and
its Group (in the case of Midstream Co’s insurance). Unless Producer is Original
Producer, Producer shall also cause the insurance carried and maintained by it
pursuant to this Section 15.4 to be endorsed to name Midstream Co and its Group
as additional insureds or provide blanket additional insured status that covers
Midstream Co and its Group as additional insureds, except in the case of
worker’s compensation insurance. Any insurance provided by OpCo on behalf of
Midstream Co that comports with this Section 15.4 shall be deemed to satisfy
these requirements.
Article 16

Section 16.1    Assignment of Rights and Obligations under this Agreement.
(a)    Assignment. Except as specifically otherwise provided in this Agreement,
no Party nor OpCo shall have the right to assign its rights and obligations
under this Agreement (in whole or in part) to another Person except with the
prior consent of Midstream Co (in the case of an assignment by Producer) or
Producer (in the case of an assignment by OpCo or Midstream Co), which consent
may be withheld at such Party’s sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Producer may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any
Person to whom Producer assigns or transfers an interest in any of the Dedicated
Properties insofar as this Agreement relates to such Dedicated Properties
without the consent of Midstream Co; provided that (A) such Person assumes in
writing the obligations of Producer under this Agreement insofar as it relates
to the portion of the Dedicated Properties so assigned or transferred, such
writing shall take the form of an Agreement Addendum, executed by the applicable
Midstream Co and the Producer Assignee (and others, if appropriate) and such
writing shall be recorded in the real property records of the counties in which
the Dedication Area is located, (B) such assignment is made subject to this
Agreement, (C) if such assignment or transfer is made to an Affiliate of
Producer, the Original Producer shall not be released from any of its

Producer Assignee (a “Third Party Assignment”): (1) the Original Producer shall
be released from its obligations under this Agreement with respect to the
Dedicated Properties so assigned or transferred, (2) at least thirty (30) Days
prior to the closing date of the Third Party Assignment (or, if the period

to deliver an updated Development Report to Midstream Co and (3) prior to or on
the closing date of the Third Party Assignment, the Producer Assignee shall
deliver to Midstream Co (x) a copy of the writing pursuant to which the Third
Party Assignment is occurring, and (y) documentation of any Conflicting
Dedication affecting any Product of the Producer Assignee that would otherwise
be considered Dedicated Production.
(b)    Notice; Binding Effect. Within 30 Days prior to the date of execution of
a permitted assignment by Producer, Producer shall give Midstream Co notice of
any assignment of this Agreement or Dedicated Properties. Midstream Co shall
give Producer written notice of any assignment of this Agreement within 30 Days
after the date of execution of such permitted assignment. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the respective permitted successors
and assigns of the Parties. Any attempted assignment made without compliance
with the provisions set forth in this Section 16.1 shall be null and void ab
initio.
(c)    Releases not Assignments. Any release of any of the Dedicated Properties
from the Dedications pursuant to Section 2.4 shall not constitute an assignment
or transfer of such Dedicated Properties for the purposes of this Article 16.
Section 16.2    Pre-Approved Assignments.
(a)    Each Party shall have the right without the prior consent of the others
to (a) mortgage, pledge, encumber or otherwise impress a lien or security
interest upon its rights and interest in and to this Agreement, and (b) make a
transfer pursuant to any security interest arrangement described in clause (a)
above, including any judicial or non-judicial foreclosure and any assignment
from the holder of such security interest to another Person.
(b)    Original Producer (but not any subsequent Producer or Producer Assignee)
may Transfer Dedicated Properties free of the terms, conditions and obligations
of this Agreement in a Transfer (a “Proposed Transaction”), subject to Original
Producer’s compliance with the following:
(i)     Where such Transfer is an exchange of Net Acres of undeveloped Dedicated
Properties (the “Outbound Acreage”) for equivalent Net Acres of properties of a
Third Party located in the Dedication Area, which such properties become subject
to the Dedication under this Agreement (the “Inbound Acreage”), as determined by
Original Producer in good faith taking into account (v) the number of Net Acres
in the Outbound Acreage compared to the Inbound Acreage (which must be within
plus or minus 10%), (w) the location and proximity to of the Inbound Acreage to
an Individual System, including anticipated costs and expenses to install,
build, construct or otherwise place into service infrastructure for the Outbound
Acreage compared to the Inbound Acreage (x) the production reserves, development
plan and timing to bring such production online of the Outbound Acreage compared
to the Inbound Acreage, (y) the value of the Outbound Acreage vs. the Inbound
Acreage (disregarding any benefit that is expected to accrue to Original
Producer and its Affiliates, but including any value that Midstream Co could
reasonably be expected to gain through the Proposed Transaction), and (z) such
other operational and financial considerations as would be taken in similar
transactions in accordance with generally accepted industry practice (including
by way of

Producer is trading non-operated acreage for operated acreage); then:
(A)
Original Producer shall give Midstream Co at least 60 Days’ prior written notice
of the Proposed Transaction, which notice shall be by email from an authorized
officer of Producer holding an office of vice president or more senior and shall
include (1) descriptions of the Inbound Acreage (including section, township and
range (or similar information), an estimate of the number of gross acres in a
lease multiplied by the lessor’s mineral interest (“Lease Acres”), Net Acres,
Lease Acres multiplied by the applicable net revenue interest (“Net Revenue

it would operate, if it acquires such acreage), (2) descriptions of the Outbound
Acreage (including section, township and range (or similar information), an
estimate of the number of Lease Acres, Net Acres, Net Revenue Acres, and the
portion of such Lease Acres that Producer anticipates it would have operated,
had it not assigned such acreage) and reasonably detailed supporting
documentation of Producer’s analysis pursuant to clauses “(v)” through “(z)”
above, (3) name of the entity or entities that are counterparties to the
Proposed Transaction, if not confidential, (4) a detailed description of the
Services that would be provided on the Outbound Acreage vs. the Inbound Acreage,

Producer if it disputes that the Outbound Acreage and Inbound Acreage are
equivalent, together with reasonably detailed supporting documentation; and

(D)
Producer shall reimburse Midstream Co in full for all actual costs and expenses
incurred by Midstream Co to install, build, construct or otherwise place into
service infrastructure for the Outbound Acreage, so long as Midstream Co had
informed Producer of its intention to install, build, construct or otherwise
place into service the applicable infrastructure by inclusion of same in a
System Plan delivered prior to the closing of the applicable Transfer.

(c)    Upon Producer or its Affiliate (as applicable) providing reasonable
documentation to show that it has satisfied, or will satisfy upon the closing of
a Proposed Transaction, the applicable requirements of Section 16.2(b) above,
then, subject to such satisfaction of the applicable requirements of Section
16.2(b) above, Producer and/or its Affiliate (as applicable) shall be entitled
to a permanent release from the Dedications of its relevant interests in the
Dedicated Properties and the production attributable thereto, effective as of
the closing of the Proposed Transaction. If Producer or its Affiliate is
entitled to a release from the Dedications pursuant to this Section 16.2,
Midstream Co shall, within 10 Days following Producer’s written request, execute
and deliver to Producer a release agreement, reasonably acceptable to all
Parties and in recordable form, that reflects such release from the Dedications.
If the Proposed Transaction does not occur within 120 Days of the satisfaction
of the requirements of this Section 16.2, Producer or its Affiliate will not
consummate the Proposed Transaction without again complying with this Section
16.2.
Section 16.3    Change of Control. Except as provided in Section 16.1, nothing
in this Article 16 shall prevent Producer’s members or owners from transferring
their respective interests (whether equity or otherwise and whether in whole or
in part) in Producer and nothing in this Article 16 shall prevent Midstream Co’s
members or owners from transferring their respective interests (whether equity
or otherwise and whether in whole or in part) in Midstream Co. However, if a
change of control of a Party gives rise to a reasonable basis for insecurity on
the part of the other Party, such change of control may be the basis for a
request of Adequate Assurance of Performance. Each member or owner of Producer
or Midstream Co, as applicable, shall have the right to assign and transfer such
member’s or owner’s interests (whether equity or otherwise and whether in whole
or in part) in Producer or Midstream Co, as applicable, without restriction
contained in this Agreement.
Article 17
Other Provisions

Addendum together with the terms set forth in these Agreement Terms and
Conditions. The signatories of one Agreement Addendum shall not be bound to or
otherwise in privity of contract with the signatories of any other Agreement

shall be held in the English language in the State, and the decision of the
arbitration panel shall include a statement of the reasons for such decision,
and the award shall be final and binding on Producer and Midstream Co or OpCo,
as applicable. Awards shall be final and binding on Producer and Midstream Co or
OpCo, as applicable, from the date they are made and judgment upon any award may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall apply the Laws
of the State, excluding any conflicts of Law rule or principle that might refer
construction of such provisions to the Laws of another jurisdiction.
Section 17.7    Parties in Interest. Except for parties indemnified hereunder,
nothing in this Agreement shall entitle any Person other than the Parties and
OpCo to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind.
Section 17.8    Preparation of Agreement. The Parties and OpCo and their
respective counsel participated in the preparation of this Agreement. In the
event of any ambiguity in this Agreement, no presumption shall arise based on
the identity of the draftsman of this Agreement.
Section 17.9    Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless
remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any adverse manner to
any Party or OpCo. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, Producer and Midstream Co or
OpCo, as applicable, shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of Producer and Midstream Co or OpCo, as
applicable, as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. A ruling
of invalidity, illegality or unenforceability as to one Agreement shall only be
applicable to that Agreement, not all the Agreements covered by these Agreement
Terms and Conditions.
Section 17.10    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, and each such counterpart hereof shall be deemed to be an original
instrument, but all of such counterparts shall constitute for all purposes one
agreement. Any signature hereto delivered by a Party or OpCo by electronic mail
shall be deemed an original signature hereto; provided that the originals of any
such electronically provided signatures shall be provided by the signatory, if
requested by the other Party (or OpCo) within a week of exchanging signatures.

Section 17.11    Confidentiality. All data and information exchanged by the
Parties and OpCo (other than the terms and conditions of this Agreement) and all
pricing terms shall be maintained in strict and absolute confidence and no Party
nor OpCo shall disclose, without the prior consent of the other Parties and
OpCo, any such data, information or pricing terms unless the release thereof is
required by Law (including any requirement associated with an elective filing
with a Governmental Authority) or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange
on which any securities of the Parties, OpCo, or any Affiliates thereof are
traded. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Parties or OpCo from
disclosing whatever information in such manner as may be required by applicable
Law; nor shall any Party or OpCo be prohibited by the terms hereof from
disclosing information acquired under this Agreement to any financial
institution or investors providing or proposing financing to a Party, OpCo, or
to any Person proposing to purchase the equity in any Party or OpCo or the
assets owned by any Party or OpCo. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
restrictions in this Section 17.11 will not apply to data or information that
(i) is in the possession of the Person receiving such information prior to
disclosure by the other Party or OpCo, (ii) is or becomes known to the public
other than as a result of a breach of this Agreement or (iii) becomes available
to a Party or OpCo a non-confidential basis from a source other than the other
Party or OpCo, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality
agreement with, or other fiduciary obligations of confidentiality to, the other
Party or OpCo. This Section will survive any termination of this Agreement for a
period of 24 Months from the end of the Year in which the date of such
termination occurred.
