Purchaser, only the following Liabilities, without duplication and only to the
extent not paid prior to the Closing (collectively, the “Assumed Liabilities”):

(a) all Liabilities of Sellers under the Assigned Contracts that become due from
and after the Closing, other than any Liability as a result of any pre-Closing

to the extent not cured by the payment of the Cure Cost in respect thereof;

 

4



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b) all cure costs required to be paid pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code in connection with the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts
(the “Cure Costs”);

1.4 Excluded Liabilities. Purchaser shall not assume, be obligated to pay,
perform or otherwise discharge or in any other manner be liable or responsible
for any Liabilities whatsoever of, or Action against, Sellers or relating to the
Acquired Assets or the Acquired Business, of any kind or nature whatsoever,
whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, liquidated or unliquidated,
due or to become due, known or unknown, currently existing or hereafter arising,
matured or unmatured, direct or indirect, and however arising, whether existing
on the Closing Date or arising thereafter, other than the Assumed Liabilities
(all such Liabilities that are not Assumed Liabilities being referred to
collectively herein as the “Excluded Liabilities”). For the avoidance of doubt,
Excluded Liabilities shall include any and all Liabilities and obligations for
(i) Taxes relating to the Business, the Acquired Assets, or the Assumed
Liabilities for any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to
the Closing Date (as determined and paid in accordance with the principles set
forth in Section 9.4), (ii) any Taxes of any Seller for any taxable period,
(iii) gift cards, rewards points or loyalty rewards issued by any Seller,
(iv) any Seller’s retail store leases, and (v) amounts due to employees,
independent contractors, consultants or Advisors of Sellers (other than any such
amounts owed under any Assigned Contract after the Closing).

1.5 Assumption/Rejection of Certain Contracts.

(a) Assumption and Assignment of Executory Contracts. Sellers shall provide
timely and proper written notice of the motion seeking entry of the Sale Order
to all parties to any executory Contracts to which any Seller is a party that
are Assigned Contracts and take all other actions reasonably necessary to cause
such Contracts to be assumed by Sellers and assigned to Purchaser pursuant to
section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code to the extent that such Contracts are
Assigned Contracts at Closing. The Sale Order shall provide that as of and
conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing, Sellers shall assign or cause to
be assigned to Purchaser, as applicable, the Assigned Contracts, each of which
shall be identified by the name or appropriate description and date of the
Assigned Contract (if available), the other party to the Assigned Contract and
the address of such party for notice purposes, all included on an exhibit
attached to either a notice filed in connection with the motion for approval of
the Sale Order or a separate motion for authority to assume and assign such
Assigned Contracts. Such exhibit shall also set forth Sellers’ good faith
estimate of the amounts necessary to cure any defaults under each of the
Assigned Contracts as determined by Sellers based on Sellers’ books and records
or

 

5



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

as otherwise determined by the Bankruptcy Court. Schedule 1.5(a) sets forth
Sellers’ good faith estimate, as of the date hereof, of the amounts necessary to
cure any such defaults. At the Closing, Sellers shall, pursuant to the Sale
Order and the Assignment and Assumption Agreement(s), assume and assign to
Purchaser (the consideration for which is included in the Purchase Price), all
Assigned Contracts that may be assigned by any such Seller to Purchaser pursuant
to sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, subject to adjustment pursuant
to Section 1.5(b). At the Closing, Purchaser shall (i) pay all Cure Costs and
(ii) assume each Assigned Contract pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code.

(b) Excluding or Adding Assigned Contracts Prior to Closing. Purchaser shall
have the right to notify Sellers in writing of any Assigned Contract that it
does not wish to assume or a Contract to which any Seller is a party that
Purchaser wishes to add as an Assigned Contract up to one (1) Business Day prior
to the Bid Deadline (as defined in the Bidding Procedures Order), and (i) any
such previously considered Assigned Contract that Purchaser no longer wishes to
assume shall be automatically deemed removed from the Schedules related to
Assigned Contracts and automatically deemed added to the Schedules related to
Excluded Contracts, in each case, without any adjustment to the Purchase Price,
and (ii) any such previously considered Excluded Contract that Purchaser wishes
to assume as an Assigned Contract shall be automatically deemed added to the
Schedules related to Assigned Contracts, automatically deemed removed from the
Schedules related to Excluded Contracts, and assumed by Sellers to sell and
assign to Purchaser, in each case, without any adjustment to the Purchase Price.
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the payment, performance and discharge
when due of the Liabilities under the Assigned Contracts arising or that are
otherwise payable from the time of and after the Closing.

(c) Non-Assignment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Contract shall not be an
Assigned Contract hereunder and shall not be assigned to, or assumed by,
Purchaser to the extent that such Contract (i) terminates or expires by its
terms, on or prior to such time as it is to be assumed by Purchaser as an
Assigned Contract hereunder and is not continued or otherwise extended upon
assumption or (ii) requires a Consent or Governmental Authorization (other than,
and in addition to, that of the Bankruptcy Court) in order to permit the sale or
transfer to Purchaser of the applicable Seller’s rights under such Contract, and
such Consent or Governmental Authorization has not been obtained prior to such
time as it is to be assumed by Purchaser as an Assigned Contract hereunder. In
addition, a Permit shall not be assigned to, or assumed by, Purchaser to the
extent that such Permit requires a Consent or Governmental Authorization (other
than, and in addition to, that of the Bankruptcy Court) in order to permit the
sale or transfer to Purchaser of the applicable Seller’s rights under such
Permit, and no such Consent or Governmental Authorization has been obtained
prior to the Closing. In the event that any Assigned Contract is deemed not to
be assigned pursuant to clause (ii) of the first sentence of this
Section 1.5(b), the Closing shall nonetheless take place subject to the terms
and conditions set forth herein and, thereafter, through the earlier of such
time as such Consent or Governmental Authorization is obtained and twelve
(12) months following the Closing (or the remaining term of such Contract or the
closing of the Bankruptcy Case, if shorter), Sellers and Purchaser shall (A) use
reasonable best efforts to secure such Consent or Governmental Authorization as
promptly as practicable after the Closing and (B) cooperate in good faith in any
lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement reasonably proposed by Purchaser,
including subcontracting, licensing, or sublicensing to Purchaser any or all of
any Seller’s rights and

 

6



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

obligations with respect to any such Assigned Contract, under which
(1) Purchaser shall obtain (without infringing upon the legal rights of such
third party or violating any Law) the economic rights and benefits under such
Assigned Contract with respect to which the Consent and/or Governmental
Authorization has not been obtained and (2) Purchaser shall be responsible for
any related burden and obligation (including performance) with respect to such
Assigned Contract. Upon satisfying any requisite Consent or Governmental
Authorization requirement applicable to such Assigned Contract after the
Closing, such Assigned Contract shall promptly be transferred and assigned to
Purchaser in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Sale Order and the
Bankruptcy Code.

ARTICLE II

CONSIDERATION; CLOSING

2.1 Consideration; Payment.

(a) The aggregate consideration (collectively, the “Purchase Price”) to be paid
by Purchaser for the purchase of the Acquired Assets shall be equal to: (i) the
assumption of Assumed Liabilities, plus (ii) a cash payment of the amount equal
to $20,075,000, and plus or minus, as applicable, (iii) the Tax Apportionment
Amount (the “Cash Payment”).

(b) At the Closing, Purchaser shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
Company the Cash Payment less the Deposit (the “Closing Date Payment”). The
Closing Date Payment and any payment required to be made pursuant to any other
provision hereof shall be made in cash by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to such bank account as shall be designated in writing by the applicable
Party to (or for the benefit of) whom such payment is to be made at least two
(2) Business Days prior to the date such payment is to be made.

2.2 Deposit.

(a) Purchaser has, on or prior to the date hereof, made an earnest money deposit
with SRS Acquiom, Inc. (the “Escrow Agent”) in the amount of $2,007,500 (the
“Deposit”), by wire transfer of immediately available funds for deposit into a
separate escrow account (the “Deposit Escrow Account”), established pursuant to
the escrow agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and among the Company,
Purchaser and the Escrow Agent, substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit C (the “Escrow Agreement”). The Deposit shall not be subject to any
lien, attachment, trustee process, or any other judicial process of any creditor
of any of Sellers or Purchaser and shall be applied against payment of the Cash
Payment on the Closing Date.

(b) If this Agreement has been terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(f) or 8.1(h), then the Company shall retain the Deposit together
with all received investment income, if any (the “Retained Amount”). In such
event, Purchaser shall have no further Liability hereunder and shall not be
subject to Section 10.12. Each of the Parties expressly acknowledges and agrees
that in the event that the Retained Amount is retained by the Company pursuant
to this Section 2.2(b), (x) the Company’s right to receive payment of such
amount shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller Parties
against the Purchaser

 

7



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Group for all losses and damages in respect of the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated thereby; and (y) none of the Seller Parties shall be
entitled to commence or pursue any Action against any member of the Purchaser
Group arising out of or in connection with the Transaction Documents (including
the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby). The maximum
aggregate liability of the Purchaser Group for losses in connection with the
Transaction Documents shall be limited to the Retained Amount, and no Seller
Party shall seek or obtain, nor shall it cause or direct any of its
representatives or Advisors or any other Person on its or their behalf to seek
or obtain, any recovery or award or any losses of any kind (including damages
for the loss of the benefit of the bargain, opportunity cost, loss of premium,
time value of money or otherwise, or any consequential, special, expectancy,
indirect or punitive damages), in the aggregate, in excess of the Retained
Amount against the Purchaser Group, collectively.

(c) If this Agreement has been terminated by any Party, other than as
contemplated by Section 2.2(b), then the Deposit, together with all received
investment income, if any, shall be returned to Purchaser within five (5)
Business Days after such termination.

(d) The Parties agree that the Company’s right to retain the Deposit, as set
forth in Section 2.2(b), is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in a
reasonable amount that will compensate Sellers for their respective efforts and

financial condition, results of operations, assets, liabilities, properties,
contracts, or prospects of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the
quality, quantity or condition of the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ assets, in
each case, are specifically disclaimed by Sellers, and that neither Purchaser,
Guarantor nor any member of the Purchaser Group has relied on any such
representations, warranties or statements. Each of Purchaser and Guarantor
acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Purchaser Group,
that it has conducted to its full satisfaction an independent investigation and
verification of the business, financial condition, results of operations,
assets, liabilities, properties, contracts and prospects of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and, in making its determination to proceed with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser and Guarantor have relied solely on
the results of the Purchaser Group’s own independent investigation and
verification, and has not relied on, is not relying on, and will not rely on,
the Information Presentation, any Projections or any information, statements,
disclosures, documents, projections, forecasts or other material made available
to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Advisors in the Dataroom or otherwise,
in each case, whether written or oral, made or provided by, or as part of, any
of the foregoing or the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates or Advisors, or any failure of any of the foregoing to disclose or
contain any information, except to the extent express set forth in the Express
Representations (it being understood that Purchaser, Guarantor and the Purchaser
Group have relied only on the Express Representations). Nothing in this
Section 4.9, however, shall relieve the Seller Parties from any Liability on
account of Fraud.

ARTICLE V

BANKRUPTCY COURT MATTERS

5.1 Bankruptcy Actions.

(a) The Company shall pursue diligently the entry of the Sale Order. Purchaser
shall promptly take all actions as are reasonably requested by the Company to
assist in obtaining the Bankruptcy Court’s entry of the Sale Order and any other
Order reasonably necessary in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including furnishing affidavits,
financial information, or other documents or information for filing with the
Bankruptcy Court and making such employees and Advisors of Purchaser and its
Affiliates available to testify before the Bankruptcy Court for the purposes of,
among other things providing necessary assurances of performance by Purchaser
under this Agreement and the Plan, and demonstrating that Purchaser is a “good
faith” purchaser under section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, as well as
demonstrating Purchaser’s ability to pay and perform or otherwise satisfy any
Assumed Liabilities following the Closing. In the event that the entry of the
Sale Order is appealed or a stay pending appeal is sought, the Company shall
oppose the appeal or the stay pending appeal and seek the dismissal of any
appeal (including a petition for certiorari, motion for rehearing, re-argument,
reconsideration or revocation). Notwithstanding the foregoing, any resulting
changes to this Agreement or any other agreement or document contemplated hereby
or resulting changes to the Plan or the Sale Order shall be subject to the
approval of Purchaser in its discretion.

(b) The Company has, pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order, received the
applicable consent to provide the following Bid Protections to the Purchaser:

 

19



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i) a break-up fee payable to Purchaser upon and pursuant to the events set
forth in the Bidding Procedures Order in an amount equal to $400,000
(the “Break-Up Fee”); and

(ii) documented expense reimbursement payable to Purchaser upon and pursuant to
the events set forth in the Bidding Procedures Order, not to exceed $100,000
(the “Expense Reimbursement”).

(c) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, and in any event no later

Horse Bidder (as defined in the Bidding Procedures Order).

(d) The Company shall (i) provide Purchaser with drafts of any and all pleadings
and proposed orders to be filed or submitted in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, and such pleadings and proposed orders
shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and (ii) make
reasonable efforts to consult and cooperate with Purchaser regarding any
discovery taken in connection with seeking entry of the Bidding Procedures Order
and the Sale Order (including any depositions).

(e) The Company and Purchaser acknowledge that this Agreement and the sale of
the Acquired Assets are subject to higher and better bids and Bankruptcy Court
approval. The Company and Purchaser acknowledge that Sellers must take
reasonable steps to demonstrate that they have sought to obtain the highest or
otherwise best price for the Acquired Assets, including giving notice thereof to
the creditors of Sellers and other interested parties, providing information
about the Company to prospective bidders, entertaining higher and better offers
from such prospective bidders, and, in the event that additional qualified
prospective bidders desire to bid for the Acquired Assets, conducting an
Auction. The bidding procedures to be employed with respect to this Agreement
and any Auction shall be those approved in the Bidding Procedures Order.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers and their Affiliates and Advisors are and
may continue soliciting inquiries, proposals, or offers for the Acquired Assets
in connection with any Alternative Transaction.

under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code for the Assigned Contracts. Purchaser
agrees that it will take all actions reasonably required to assist in obtaining
a Bankruptcy Court finding that there has been an adequate demonstration of
adequate assurance of future performance under the Assigned Contracts, such as
furnishing affidavits, non-confidential financial information, and other
documents or information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court and making
Purchaser’s Advisors available to testify before the Bankruptcy Court.

(h) Nothing in this Section 5.1 shall prevent Sellers from modifying the bidding
procedures as necessary or appropriate to maximize value for Sellers’ estates in
accordance with each Seller’s fiduciary obligations.

 

20



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5.2 Cure Costs. Subject to entry of the Sale Order, Purchaser shall, on or prior
to the Closing (or, in the case of any Contract that is to be assigned following
the Closing pursuant to Section 1.5, on or prior to the date of such
assignment), pay the Cure Costs and cure any and all other defaults and breaches
under the Assigned Contracts as required for such Contracts to be assumed by the
applicable Seller and assigned to Purchaser in accordance with the provisions of
section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and this Agreement.

5.3 The Sale Order. The Sale Order shall, among other things, (a) approve and
direct, pursuant to sections 105, 363, and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, (i) the
execution, delivery and performance by Sellers of this Agreement, (ii) the sale
of the Acquired Assets to Purchaser on the terms set forth herein and free and
clear of all Encumbrances (other than Encumbrances expressly included in the
Assumed Liabilities and Permitted Encumbrances), and (iii) the performance by
Sellers of their respective obligations under this Agreement; (b) authorize,
empower and direct Sellers to assume and assign to Purchaser the Assigned
Contracts; (c) find that Purchaser is a “good faith” buyer within the meaning of

responsibility for any Liability or other obligation of any Seller arising under
or related to the Acquired Assets other than as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, including successor or vicarious Liabilities of any kind or
character, including any theory of antitrust, successor, or transferee

Purchaser has provided adequate assurance (as that term is used in section 365
of the Bankruptcy Code) of future performance in connection with the assumption
of the Assigned Contracts; (f) find that Purchaser shall have no Liability for
any Excluded Liability; and (g) find that there was no violation of section
363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code. Purchaser agrees that it will promptly take such
actions as are reasonably requested by the Company to assist in obtaining
Bankruptcy Court approval of the Sale Order, including furnishing affidavits or
other documents or information for filing with the Bankruptcy Court for
purposes, among others, of (x) demonstrating that Purchaser is a “good faith”
purchaser under section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, and (y) establishing
adequate assurance of future performance within the meaning of section 365 of
the Bankruptcy Code.

5.4 Approval. Sellers’ obligations under this Agreement and in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby are subject to entry of and, to the extent
entered, the terms of any Orders of the Bankruptcy Court (including entry of the
Sale Order). Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company or its
Affiliates to give testimony to or submit a motion to the Bankruptcy Court that
is untruthful or to violate any duty of candor or other fiduciary duty to the
Bankruptcy Court or its stakeholders.

6.2 Access to Information.

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing (or the earlier termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Article VIII), the Sellers will (x) provide Purchaser and
its authorized Advisors with reasonable access to, and upon reasonable advance
notice and during regular business hours, furnish reasonably promptly, such
information concerning the Acquired Business, the Acquired Assets and/or the

for access will be directed to Ray McKown or such other Person(s) as the Company
may designate in writing from time to time and (iv) nothing herein will require
the Company to provide access to, or to disclose any information to, Purchaser
if such access or disclosure (A) would waive any legal privilege or (B) would be
in violation of applicable Laws or the provisions of any agreement to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound or would violate any fiduciary duty;
provided that, in the event that the Company withholds access or information in
reliance on the foregoing clause (A) or (B), the Company shall provide (to the
extent possible without waiving or violating the applicable agreement, legal
privilege or Law) notice to Purchaser that such access or information is being
so withheld and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such access
or information in a way that would not risk waiver of such legal privilege or
applicable Law.

(b) The information provided pursuant to this Section 6.2 will be used solely
for the purpose of effecting the transactions contemplated hereby, and will be
governed by all the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which
Confidentiality Agreement shall not terminate upon the execution of this
Agreement notwithstanding anything to the contrary therein; provided that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate upon the Closing in accordance with
its terms. Purchaser will, and will cause its Advisors to, abide by the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to such access and any information
furnished to Purchaser or any of its Advisors. Neither the Company nor any of
Sellers makes any representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any
information, if any, provided pursuant to this Section 6.2, and Purchaser may
not rely on the accuracy of any such information, in each case, other than the
Express Representations.

notice, to books and records relating to the Acquired Business, Acquired Assets
and Assumed Liabilities with respect to periods or occurrences prior to the
Closing Date. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Company, Purchaser
will not, for a period of three (3) years following the Closing Date, destroy,
alter or otherwise dispose of any such books and records without first offering
to surrender to the Company such books and records or any portion thereof that
Purchaser may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of. From and after the
Closing, Purchaser will, and will cause its employees to provide Sellers with
reasonable assistance, support and cooperation with Sellers’ wind-down and
related activities (e.g., helping to locate documents or information related to
preparation of Tax Returns or prosecution); provided that any out-of-pocket cost
and expense incurred by Purchaser as a result of providing such assistance,
support and cooperation shall be at the sole cost and expense of Sellers;
provided further that Purchaser shall inform Sellers of, and obtain Sellers’
written consent prior to incurring, any such cost and expense and, in the
absence of the receipt of such prior written consent from Sellers, shall not be
deemed to have breached its obligation under this sentence solely by virtue of
not having provided the requested assistance, support or cooperation to which
Sellers have not consented.

 

23

(d) Purchaser will not, and will not permit any member of the Purchaser Group
to, contact any officer, manager, director, employee, customer, supplier,
lessee, lessor, lender, licensee, licensor, distributor, noteholder or other
material business relation of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries, their business or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the prior written consent
(which may be via email) of Ray McKown or such other Person(s) as the Company
may designate in writing from time to time. The Company shall use good faith
efforts to introduce Purchaser to third party vendors in respect of the
Company’s loyalty/rewards and credit cards programs.

(e) Without limiting Section 6.2(c), from and after the Closing Date, the
Company shall not and shall cause the other Seller Parties not to, directly or
indirectly, disclose, reveal, divulge or communicate to any Person other than
authorized officers, directors, managers, Advisors and employees of Purchaser or
its Affiliates or use or otherwise exploit for its own benefit or for the
benefit of anyone other than Purchaser or its Affiliates, any Confidential
Information or Trade Secret, in each case which is used exclusively in the
Acquired Business or, if not used exclusively in the Acquired Business, any such
disclosure, revealing, divulgence, or communication shall be only in the
ordinary course of business of the Excluded Business or the Going Out of
Business Sale. The Seller Parties shall not have any obligation to keep
confidential any Confidential Information if and to the extent disclosure
thereof is specifically required by applicable Law. To the extent practical and
legally permissible, the applicable Person shall notify Purchaser of its
intention to make such disclosure and provide a list of the Confidential
Information that such Person intends to disclose prior to making such
disclosure. The Company and its Subsidiaries agree to cooperate with Purchaser
so that Purchaser may seek, at its sole cost and expense, an appropriate
protective order.

transactions contemplated herein to be effected as soon as practicable, but in
any event on or prior to the Outside Date, in accordance with the terms hereof
and to cooperate with each other Party and its Advisors in connection with any
step required to be taken as a part of its obligations hereunder. The
“reasonable best efforts” of the Company or Purchaser will not, except as
expressly required hereunder, require the Company, Purchaser or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, Affiliates or Advisors to expend any money, to remedy
any breach of any representation or warranty, to commence any Action, to waive
or surrender any right, to modify any Contract or to waive or forego any right,
remedy or condition hereunder.

Section 6.4, shall be subject to any Orders entered, or approvals or
authorizations granted or required, by or under the Bankruptcy Court or the
Bankruptcy Code (including in connection with the Bankruptcy Case), the DIP
Facility, and each of Sellers’ obligations as a debtor-in-possession to comply
with any Order of the Bankruptcy Court (including the Bidding Procedures Order
and the Sale Order) and Sellers’ duty to seek and obtain the highest or
otherwise best price for the Acquired Assets as required by the Bankruptcy Code.

communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(ii) any notice or other communication from any Governmental Body related to or
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and
(iii) promptly upon discovery thereof, any variances from, or the existence or
occurrence of any event, fact or circumstance arising after the execution of
this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to cause, any of the
representations and warranties contained in Article III to be untrue or
inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 7.2(b) not to be
satisfied. If the subject matter of any such notification required by the
previous sentence requires any change in the Schedules, the Company shall
deliver to Purchaser prior to the Closing a supplement to such Schedule (the
“Updated Schedules”) with such change; provided that in no event will any
Updated Schedule serve to amend, supplement or modify the Schedules for purposes
of Section 7.2(b); provided further that if the Closing occurs, the Updated
Schedules will be considered and deemed to be part of the Schedules for all
purposes under this Agreement, and each reference in this Agreement to a
particular Schedule will mean such Schedule in, or as updated by, the Updated
Schedules.

(b) Purchaser will promptly notify the Company of: (i) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may
be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

Actions relating to or involving or otherwise affecting Purchaser or its
Affiliates that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 4.6 or that relate to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) any breach or inaccuracy
of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement at any time during
the term hereof that could reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set
forth in Article VII not to be satisfied; provided that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.5(a) will not limit the remedies available to
Sellers under or with respect to this Agreement.

 

25



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.6 Further Assurances. From time to time, as and when requested by any Party
and at such requesting Party’s expense, any other Party will execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and will take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as such requesting Party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to
evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
addition, at no cost to Purchaser, Seller shall deliver the Acquired Assets set
forth on Schedule 6.6 to Purchaser not later than twenty (20) Business Days
after the Closing Date (the “Transition Period”).

6.7 Insurance Matters. Purchaser acknowledges that, upon Closing, all
nontransferable insurance coverage provided in relation to Sellers and the
Acquired Assets that is maintained by any Seller or its Affiliates (whether such

Affiliates) shall cease to provide any coverage to Purchaser and the Acquired
Assets and no further coverage shall be available to Purchaser or the Acquired
Assets under any such policies.

6.8 Receipt of Misdirected Assets. From and after the Closing, if any Seller or
any of its respective Affiliates receives any right, property or asset that is
an Acquired Asset, the applicable Seller shall promptly transfer or cause such
of its Affiliates to transfer such right, property or asset (and shall promptly
endorse and deliver any such asset that is received in the form of cash, checks
or other documents) to Purchaser, and such asset will be deemed the property of
Purchaser held in trust by such Seller for Purchaser until so transferred. From
and after the Closing, if Purchaser or any of its Affiliates receives any right,
property or asset that is an Excluded Asset, Purchaser shall promptly transfer
or cause such of its Affiliates to transfer such asset (and shall promptly
endorse and deliver any such right, property or asset that is received in the
form of cash, checks, or other documents) to the Company, and such right,
property or asset will be deemed the property of the Company held in trust by
Purchaser for the Company until so transferred.

6.9 Acknowledgment by Purchaser.

(a) Each of Purchaser and Guarantor acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf
and on behalf of the Purchaser Group, that it has conducted to its full
satisfaction an independent investigation and verification of the business,
financial condition, results of operations, assets, Liabilities, properties,
Contracts and prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries and the Acquired
Assets and the Assumed Liabilities, and, in making its determination to proceed
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Purchaser, Guarantor and
the Purchaser Group have relied solely on the results of the Purchaser Group’s
own independent investigation and verification and have not relied on, are not
relying on, and will not rely on, any information, statements, disclosures,

disclose, any information including in the Dataroom, Information Presentation,
Projections, meetings, calls or correspondence with management of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, any of the Seller Parties or any other Person on behalf of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of the Seller Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates or Advisors and (2) the historical, current or future
business, financial condition, results of operations, assets, Liabilities,

not existing as of the Closing. Each of the GOB Licensees acknowledges and
agrees that, as of the Closing, the GOB Trademarks shall be the exclusive
property of the Purchaser (subject to the rights of the GOB Licensees pursuant
to Sections 6.10-6.16), and that any and all goodwill arising in connection with
the use of the GOB Trademarks inures solely to Purchaser. The GOB Licensees
shall use the GOB Trademarks in accordance with quality control requirements
regarding the character and quality of the goods, services and promotional

character and quality substantially equivalent to or better than the quality of
those provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries in the twelve (12) month
period prior to the Closing or not of a character or quality that would impair
in any material respect the value of or goodwill associated with the applicable
GOB Trademark. At the end of the GOB Period, the license to the GOB Trademarks

respect to the Wind-Down shall terminate, and each of the GOB Licensees shall
cease, and cause all others operating under or pursuant to any license of the
GOB Trademarks granted in this Section 6.10 to cease, all usage of the GOB

WIND-DOWN OPERATIONS, (II) AUTHORIZING THE DEBTORS TO CONDUCT STORE CLOSING, AND
(III) GRANTING RELATED RELIEF [Docket 744], and (ii) the GOB Licensees’ and the
Consultant’s respective Affiliates, service providers, vendors and platforms, in
each case solely in support of the Going Out of Business Sale and subject to the
limits of this Agreement.

6.11 Going Out of Business Sale Domain Name and Subdomain Support and
Preservation. In conjunction with the Going Out of Business Sale and the
Wind-Down and the rights and licenses granted in Sections 6.10-6.16, (i) during

to search by zip code and find their desired location of the Going Out of
Business Sale during the GOB Period, and with a “look and feel” and other
content, in all cases as reasonably directed by Purchaser, provided such “look
and feel” and other content are consistent with those historically used by the
Sellers and other GOB Licensees or customarily used in connection with going out
of business sales of the type envisioned by this Agreement and (c) a separate
webpage containing such “Store Finder” and with a “look and feel” and content
(including discount information), in all cases as reasonably directed by

related banners, and the “Store Finder,” will be deleted from the GOB Domains
and GOB Social Media Accounts at the end of the GOB Period.

6.12 Going Out of Business Sale Social Media Accounts Support and Preservation.
In conjunction with the Going Out of Business Sale during the GOB Period and the
licenses and rights granted in Sections 6.10-6.16, Purchaser: (i) hereby grants
to the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their designees) during the GOB Period
the non-exclusive right to post to each of the Social Media Accounts set forth
on Schedule 6.12 (the “GOB Social Media Accounts”) and the SMS short code set
forth on Schedule 6.12 (the “GOB Short Code”), content associated with the Going
Out of Business Sale during the GOB Period and Purchaser shall, at the Closing,
provide the Company (or its designee) with access (including usernames and
passwords and the

 

30



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

use of any other tools or platforms utilized by Purchaser or its Affiliates) to
such GOB Social Media Accounts sufficient to permit them to so post or send
content, and cooperation and assistance with respect thereto; (ii) shall not
(and shall not permit any Person to) sell, assign, license, transfer, convey,
lease, surrender, relinquish, abandon, let lapse, fail to maintain or otherwise
dispose of, during the GOB Period, any GOB Social Media Accounts or GOB Short
Code; and (iii) shall not permit any Person other than the GOB Licensees, the
Consultants or the Purchaser to post content to the GOB Social Media Accounts,
and shall comply with the obligations and restrictions on Schedule 6.12 in
connection with the GOB Social Media Accounts during the GOB Period. In
addition, at Company’s request and direction, Purchasers shall purchase for the
Company and place ads using the GOB Social Media Accounts, subject to Company’s
payment in advance of any related costs.

6.13 Wind-Down Use of The Customer Data, User Data, and PI Databases. In support
of the Going Out of Business Sale, and only during the GOB Period and in
conjunction with the licenses and rights licenses granted in Sections 6.10-6.16,
Purchaser hereby grants the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their designees)
during the GOB Period the right to send up to seven (7) emails per week and
(pursuant to Section 6.12) up to two (2) text messages on the GOB Short Code per
week, using (and per Person in) the Customer Data, User Data, and PI Databases
included in the Acquired Assets (the “Lists”), subject to any opt-out decisions
of any customer or target of any such communications and other legal
requirements applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company may,
during the GOB Period, maintain control of a copy of the Lists to send such
emails and texts. Purchaser shall not (and not permit any Person to) interfere
with the rights granted hereunder, provided such emails and text messages
consistent with communications historically made by the Sellers and other GOB
Licensees or customarily used in connection with going out of business sales of
the type envisioned by this Agreement. Purchaser shall, during the GOB Period,
cooperate with Company and refrain from, sending more than three (3) emails per
week and two (2) text messages per week, using (and per Person in) the Lists,
including to promote Pier1.com, subject to any opt-out decisions of any customer
or target of any such communications and other legal requirements applicable to
Purchaser. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that it is in the best interest of
the Purchaser and the Company that the GOB Trademarks be used in connection with
the promotion and advertisement of both Pier1.com and the Going Out of Business
Sale as historically used by the Sellers and other GOB Licensees or as retailer
trademarks have been customarily used in connection with going out of business
sales of the type envisioned by this Agreement, to enhance the value and
awareness of the GOB Trademarks. For the avoidance of doubt, an email or text
message, as referred to in this Section 6.13, means a substantially similar
email or text message sent (including in batches) to some or all of the Persons
in the Lists (and not one email to one Person). Each of Purchaser and the
Company shall, during the GOB Period, (i) before the end of each day,
electronically send to the other a file containing the List user ID of any
Person who has “opted out” during such day, and (ii) thereafter refrain from
sending any emails to the email address associated with such user IDs. Purchaser
and Company shall, prior to Closing, agree to the manner in which they will
exchange such user IDs. Company shall, at the Closing, provide the Purchaser
with access (including usernames and passwords and the use of any other tools or
platforms utilized by the Company) sufficient to permit them to send text
messages using the GOB Short Code, and cooperation and assistance with respect
thereto, and the Purchaser shall be responsible and liable for all texts that it
sends pursuant to this Agreement and shall indemnify and hold harmless the GOB
Licensees for any third party claims arising out of or related to any such
texts.

in Sections 6.10-6.16, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser hereby grants
to the GOB Licensees and the Consultants as part of the Going Out Of Business
Sale, and the GOB Licensees as part of the Wind-Down, a limited, non-exclusive,
royalty-free, fully paid-up, irrevocable license to the Intellectual Property
included in the Acquired Assets (other than with respect to Intellectual
Property referenced in clauses (ii), (iv), or (viii) of the definition of
Intellectual Property and excluding any use of the Lists except to the extent
(with prior notice to Purchaser the extent reasonably practicable) required or
requested by a Governmental Body or applicable Law) and used in the operation of
the GOB Licensees as of the Closing, solely in connection with the Going Out Of
Business Sale until the end of the GOB Period and, and solely in connection with
the Wind-Down until the end of the Wind-Down Period.

6.15 Messaging; Cooperation; Character; Encumbrance.

(a) Purchaser shall not (and shall not permit any other Person to) issue any
press release or other public statement that states, or could reasonably be
construed by a reasonable consumer to mean, that any GOB Licensee is no longer
conducting “going out of business” or “store closing” sales at their stores, or
otherwise interfere with or undermine any promotion that states that any GOB
Licensee is conducting “going out of business” or “store closing” sales at their
stores. Upon the Company’s request, Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate and
assist GOB Licensees and the Consultants in connection with the implementation
and execution of their advertising program with respect to the Going Out of
Business Sale, provided that any out of pocket costs of Purchaser shall be borne
by the Sellers.

(b) For purposes of this Article 6, and anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, association of a GOB Trademark with the Bankruptcy Case, Going
Out of Business Sale, or Wind-Down as historically used by the Sellers and other
GOB Licensees or as retailer trademarks have been customarily used in connection
with going out of business sales of the type envisioned by this Agreement shall
not be considered to be an impairment to the value or goodwill thereof, and the
use of a GOB Trademark for the Going Out of Business Sale or Wind-Down as
historically used by the Sellers and other GOB Licensees or as retailer
trademarks have been customarily used in connection with going out of business
sales of the type envisioned by this Agreement shall not be considered to be of
a different character than the character of the use of such GOB Trademark prior
to the Closing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller and its
Affiliates (i) shall, in addition to the rights granted in Sections 6.10-6.15,
have the right to continue to grant the rights and licenses previously granted
pursuant to each agreement set forth on Schedule 6.15(c), provided that Seller
shall not amend any such agreement to the extent such amendment would be adverse
to the Transferred Trademarks, or take any action to lower the quality standards
applicable to, or extend the scope or duration of, any such agreement; and
(ii) shall have no obligation to cease use of (or cause others to cease use of)
GOB Trademarks for fair use, for any necessary governmental filings, or in a
manner not constituting trademark infringement or dilution.

GOB Domains and GOB Short Code to permit the activities contemplated in
Section 6.13, which shall include updating such privacy policy to permit (i) the
GOB Licensees and Consultants to assist Purchaser in e-commence operations,
manage a database of customer information, hosting the sites at the GOB Domains,
send special offers or perform other administrative services, and conduct other
services design to assist in maximizing business potential, (ii) the disclosure
and transfer of Personal Information to a subsequent owner, co-owner or operator
of any site (including social media accounts or SMS short codes) or retail store
branded with or operated using a Transferred Trademark or other Acquired Asset.

6.17 Purchaser Parent Guaranty. Guarantor, the majority parent owner of
Purchaser, guarantees absolutely and unconditionally to Sellers (a) the due and
punctual performance, when and as due, of all obligations, covenants and
agreements of Purchaser arising under or pursuant to this Agreement (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the punctual payment of all sums, if any, now and
hereafter owed by Purchaser hereunder) and (b) the accuracy of Purchaser’s
representations and warranties set forth herein. Guarantor hereby makes the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.8 and 4.9
as to itself, and such representations and warranties shall apply mutatis
mutandis as if the Guarantor were substituted for Purchaser therein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTICLE IX

TAXES

9.1 Transfer Taxes. Any sales, use, purchase, transfer, franchise, deed, fixed
asset, stamp, documentary stamp, use, or other Taxes and recording charges
payable by reason of the sale of the Acquired Assets or the assumption of the
Assumed Liabilities under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(the “Transfer Taxes”) shall be borne and timely paid by Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall timely file all Tax Returns related to any Transfer Taxes.
Sellers and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts and cooperate in
good faith to exempt all such transactions from any Transfer Taxes to the extent
allowed under applicable Law.

9.2 Allocation of Purchase Price. For U.S. federal and applicable state and
local income Tax purposes, Purchaser, Sellers, and their respective Affiliates
shall allocate the Purchase Price (and any Assumed Liabilities or other items
treated as part of the purchase price for applicable income Tax purposes) first
among the Sellers in accordance with the Acquired Assets being sold by each
Seller, and then such amounts shall be further fallocated among the Acquired
Assets sold by each Seller. As soon as commercially practicable, but no later
than forty-five (45) days following the determination of the final Purchase
Price, Purchaser shall provide a proposed allocation to Sellers setting forth
the allocation of the Purchase Price (and other amounts treated as Purchase
Price for U.S. federal income Tax purposes) among the Acquired Assets (the
“Allocation”). If Sellers deliver a written objection within thirty (30) days
after receipt of the draft Allocation proposed by Purchaser, then Purchaser and
Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objection, and, if
Sellers and Purchaser cannot resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days of
Purchaser’s receipt of Sellers’ objection, then a nationally recognized
accounting firm mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Sellers shall resolve such
dispute and the resolution of such dispute shall be final and binding on the
Parties. The Parties and their respective Affiliates shall file all Tax Returns
in accordance with such Allocation (as finally determined under this
Section 9.2) and not take any Tax related action inconsistent with the
Allocation, in each case, unless otherwise required by a “determination” within
the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code.

9.3 Cooperation. Purchaser and Sellers shall reasonably cooperate, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the filing of
Tax Returns and any Action, audit, litigation, or other proceeding with respect
to Taxes.

9.4 Tax Apportionment. Any real property, personal property, or similar Taxes
that are applicable to the Acquired Assets, the Business, the Assumed
Liabilities, or the Excluded Liabilities described in clause (i) of the
definition thereof (other than Transfer Taxes) for a taxable period that
includes but does not end on the Closing Date shall be apportioned to the
Pre-Closing Tax Period based on the number of days in the portion of such
taxable period that ends on and includes the Closing Date, divided by the number
of days in the entire taxable period (the “Pre-Closing Apportioned Taxes,” and
the remaining Taxes for such taxable period, the “Post-Closing Apportioned
Taxes”). At least five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver
an estimate (the “Tax Apportionment Estimate”) of the Pre-Closing Apportioned
Taxes and Post-Closing Apportioned Taxes, along with reasonable support
therefore, based on amounts reported on the most recent Tax Returns prepared
and/or filed by Sellers relating to such Taxes.

 

37



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Tax Apportionment Estimate shall be subject to Purchaser’s review and if
Purchaser reasonably disputes any amount therein, the parties shall work in good
faith to resolve such disputes before the Closing. At the Closing, if a positive
number, the Sellers shall pay to the Purchaser an amount (the “Tax Apportionment
Amount”) equal to the difference between: (i) any such Pre-Closing Apportioned
Taxes that are to be payable by the Purchaser, minus (ii) any such Post-Closing
Apportioned Taxes that are to be payable by the Sellers. If the Tax
Apportionment Amount is a negative number, then the Purchaser shall pay to the
Sellers the positive difference at the Closing. In each case, such payments
shall be adjustments to the Closing Date Payment, and for all applicable Tax
purposes, shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price hereunder. Such
payments shall be in full and final satisfaction of any obligations between the
Purchaser and Sellers with respect to Taxes for any Straddle Period (other than
in respect of Transfer Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 9.1), including
in respect of Section 1.3(c) and Section 1.4(i).

9.5 Preparation of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes.

(a) Except as otherwise provided by Section 9.1, Sellers shall prepare and
timely file (i) all Tax Returns for any Tax period ending on or before the date
hereof and (ii) all income Tax Returns of Sellers. Except to the extent any Tax
reflected on a return required to be prepared and filed by Sellers pursuant to
this Section 9.5 is otherwise reflected as an adjustment to Purchase Price or
constitutes an Assumed Liability, Sellers shall be responsible for paying any
Taxes reflected on any Tax Return that Sellers are obligated to prepare and file
under this Section 9.5(a).

(b) Purchaser shall prepare and timely file all other Tax Returns with respect
to the Acquired Assets that are not addressed by Section 9.5(a). With respect to
any Straddle Period, Purchaser shall prepare such Tax Returns consistent with
past practice, and shall provide Sellers with a draft of such Tax Returns at
least thirty (30) days prior to the filing of any such Tax Return. Purchaser
shall incorporate any changes reasonably requested by Sellers with respect to
such Tax Returns if such Tax Returns could materially and adversely affect the
Sellers or their Affiliates in a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Purchaser shall be
responsible for paying any Taxes reflected on any Tax Return that Purchaser is
obligated to prepare and file under this Section 9.5(b), except to the extent
such Taxes constitute an Excluded Liability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.5 Amendment and Waiver. Any provision of this Agreement or the Schedules or
exhibits hereto may be (a) amended only in a writing signed by Purchaser and the
Company or (b) waived only in a writing executed by the Person against which
enforcement of such waiver is sought. No waiver of any provision hereunder or
any breach or default thereof will extend to or affect in any way any other
provision or prior or subsequent breach or default.

10.6 Third Party Beneficiaries. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed to give any
Person other than the Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, or claim
under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement.

10.7 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Action
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement may only be brought
against, the Persons that are expressly named as parties to this Agreement.
Except to the extent named as a party to this Agreement, and then only to the
extent of the specific obligations of such parties set forth in this Agreement,
no past, present or future shareholder, member, partner, manager, director,
officer, employee, Affiliate, agent or Advisor of any Party or any Subsidiary of
Sellers will have any liability (whether in Contract, tort, equity or otherwise)
for any of the representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other
obligations or Liabilities of any of the parties to this Agreement or for any
Action based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement.

10.8 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable Law,
but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid
under applicable Law in any jurisdiction, such provision will be ineffective
only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity in such jurisdiction,
without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions
of this Agreement or in any other jurisdiction.

10.9 Construction. The language used in this Agreement will be deemed to be the
language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction will be applied against any Person. The headings of the
sections and paragraphs of this Agreement have been inserted for convenience of
reference only and will in no way restrict or otherwise modify any of the terms
or provisions hereof.

10.10 Schedules. Each section of the Schedules will be deemed to incorporate by
reference all information disclosed in any other section of the Schedules to the
extent it is readily apparent on its face, without further inquiry or knowledge
of the contents of any document disclosed in the Schedules, that such
information disclosed is applicable to such other section of the Schedules.
Capitalized terms used in the Schedules and not otherwise defined therein have
the meanings given to them in this Agreement. Matters reflected in the Schedules
are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be
reflected in the Schedules. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes only and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. No information set forth in the Schedules will be deemed to
broaden in any way the scope of the parties’ representations and warranties. Any
description of any agreement, document, instrument, plan, arrangement or other
item set forth on any Schedule is a summary only and is qualified in its
entirety by the terms of such agreement, document, instrument, plan,
arrangement, or item which terms will be deemed disclosed for all purposes of

 

41



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this Agreement to the extent provided to Purchaser prior to the date hereof. The
information contained in this Agreement, in the Schedules and exhibits hereto is
disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information contained
herein or therein will be deemed to be an admission by any Party to any third
party of any matter whatsoever, including any violation of Law or breach of
Contract.

10.11 Complete Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement and any other agreements expressly referred to herein or therein,
contains the entire agreement of the parties respecting the sale and purchase of
the Acquired Assets and the Assumed Liabilities and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements among the
Parties respecting the sale and purchase of the Acquired Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises with respect to this
Agreement, the terms and provisions of the execution version of this Agreement
will control and prior drafts of this Agreement and the documents referenced
herein will not be considered or analyzed for any purpose (including in support
of parol evidence proffered by any Person in connection with this Agreement),
will be deemed not to provide any evidence as to the meaning of the provisions
hereof or the intent of the Parties with respect hereto and will be deemed joint
work product of the Parties.

10.12 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage, for which
monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur
in the event that any provision of this Agreement is not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or is otherwise breached, including if any of the
Parties fails to take any action required of it hereunder to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that
(a) the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts described
in Section 10.13 without proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, and (b) the
right of specific performance and other equitable relief is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither
Sellers nor Purchaser would have entered into this Agreement. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that any Party pursuing an injunction or injunctions or
other Order to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 10.12
will not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with
any such Order. The remedies available to Sellers pursuant to this Section 10.12
will be in addition to any other remedy to which they were entitled at law or in
equity, and the election to pursue an injunction or specific performance will
not restrict, impair or otherwise limit any Seller from seeking to collect or
collecting damages. If, prior to the Outside Date, any Party brings any action,
in each case in accordance with Section 10.12, to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the Outside
Date will automatically be extended (y) for the period during which such action
is pending, plus ten (10) Business Days or (z) by such other time period
established by the court presiding over such action, as the case may be. In no
event will this Section 10.12 be used, alone or together with any other
provision of this Agreement, to require any Seller to remedy any breach of any
representation or warranty of any Seller made herein.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.13 Jurisdiction and Exclusive Venue. Each of the Parties irrevocably agrees
that any Action that may be based upon, arising out of, or related to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby brought by any other Party or its successors or
assigns will be brought and determined only in (a) the Bankruptcy Court and any
federal court to which an appeal from the Bankruptcy Court may be validly taken
or (b) if the Bankruptcy Court is unwilling or unable to hear such Action, in
the Delaware Chancery Court and any state court sitting in the State of Delaware
to which an appeal from the Delaware Chancery Court may be validly taken (or, if
the Delaware Chancery Court declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the state of Delaware) ((a) and (b),
the “Chosen Courts”), and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for itself and with respect to its
property, generally and unconditionally, with regard to any such Action arising
out of or relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each of the Parties agrees not to commence any Action relating thereto except in
the Chosen Courts, other than Actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to
enforce any Order, decree or award rendered by any Chosen Court, and no Party
will file a motion to dismiss any Action filed in a Chosen Court on any
jurisdictional or venue-related grounds, including the doctrine of forum
non-conveniens. The Parties irrevocably agree that venue would be proper in any
of the Chosen Courts, and hereby irrevocably waive any objection that any such
court is an improper or inconvenient forum for the resolution of such Action.
Each of the Parties further irrevocably and unconditionally consents to service
of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 10.3. Nothing in this
Agreement will affect the right of any Party to this agreement to serve process
in any other manner permitted by Law.

10.14 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial.

(a) Except to the extent the mandatory provisions of the Bankruptcy Code apply,
this Agreement, and any Action that may be based upon, arising out of or related
to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
agreements executed and performed entirely within such State without regards to
conflicts of law principles of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction
that would cause the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware
to apply.

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT, THE DOCUMENTS AND AGREEMENTS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED
AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND THEREFORE HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION BASED ON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY DOCUMENT OR
AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND
THEREBY. EACH OF THE PARTIES AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH ACTION WILL BE
DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE PARTIES THIS AGREEMENT MAY
FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY

 

43



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES TO THE IRREVOCABLE
WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. EACH PARTY (I) CERTIFIES THAT NO ADVISOR
OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER AND (II) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

10.15 No Right of Set-Off. Purchaser, on its own behalf and on behalf the
Purchaser Group and its and their respective successors and permitted assigns,
hereby waives any rights of set-off, netting, offset, recoupment, or similar
rights that Purchaser, any member of the Purchaser Group or any of its or their
respective successors and permitted assigns has or may have with respect to the
payment of the Cash Payment or any other payments to be made by Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement or any other document or instrument delivered by
Purchaser in connection herewith.

10.16 Counterparts and PDF. This Agreement and any other agreements referred to
herein or therein, and any amendments hereto or thereto, may be executed in
multiple counterparts, any one of which need not contain the signature of more
than one party hereto or thereto, but all such counterparts taken together will
constitute one and the same instrument. Any counterpart, to the extent signed
and delivered by means of a facsimile machine, .PDF or other electronic
transmission, will be treated in all manner and respects as an original Contract
and will be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if it were the
original signed version thereof delivered in person. Minor variations in the
form of the signature page to this Agreement or any agreement or instrument
contemplated hereby, including footers from earlier versions of this Agreement
or any such other document, will be disregarded in determining the effectiveness
of such signature. At the request of any party or pursuant to any such Contract,
each other party hereto or thereto will re-execute original forms thereof and
deliver them to all other parties. No party hereto or to any such Contract will
raise the use of a facsimile machine, .PDF or other electronic transmission to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or Contract was transmitted
or communicated through the use of facsimile machine, .PDF or other electronic
transmission as a defense to the formation of a Contract and each such party
forever waives any such defense.

10.17 Publicity. Neither the Company nor Purchaser shall issue any press release
or public announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of the other
Party, which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in
the reasonable judgment of Purchaser or the Company, disclosure is otherwise
required by applicable Law or by the Bankruptcy Court with respect to filings to
be made with the Bankruptcy Court in connection with this Agreement or by the
applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Purchaser or the Company lists
securities, provided that the Party intending to make such release shall use its
best efforts consistent with such applicable Law or Bankruptcy Court requirement
to consult with the other Party with respect to the text thereof; provided
further that following the Closing, Purchaser shall be permitted to make one or
more public statements that it has acquired the Acquired Business, the Acquired
Assets and the Assumed Liabilities.

 

44



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.18 Bulk Sales Laws. The Parties intend that pursuant to section 363(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code, the transfer of the Acquired Assets shall be free and clear of
any Encumbrances in the Acquired Assets including any liens or claims arising
out of the bulk transfer Laws, and the Parties shall take such steps as may be
necessary or appropriate to so provide in the Sale Order. In furtherance of the
foregoing, each Party hereby waives compliance by the Parties with the “bulk
sales,” “bulk transfers” or similar Laws and all other similar Laws in all
applicable jurisdictions in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

10.19 Fiduciary Obligations. Nothing in this Agreement, or any document related
to the transactions contemplated hereby, will require any Seller or any of their
respective directors, officers or members, in each case, in their capacity as
such, to take any action, or to refrain from taking any action, to the extent
inconsistent with their fiduciary obligations. For the avoidance of doubt,
Sellers retain the right to pursue any transaction or restructuring strategy
that, in Sellers’ business judgment, will maximize the value of their estates.

or delivered hereunder.

(a) Accounting terms which are not otherwise defined in this Agreement have the
meanings given to them under GAAP consistently applied. To the extent that the
definition of an accounting term defined in this Agreement is inconsistent with
the meaning of such term under GAAP, the definition set forth in this Agreement
will control.

(b) The terms “hereof,” “herein” and “hereunder” and terms of similar import are
references to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. Section, clause, schedule and exhibit references contained in
this Agreement are references to sections, clauses, schedules and exhibits in or

annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a part
of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. Any capitalized terms used in
any Schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall be defined as
set forth in this Agreement.

(c) Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this
Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.”
Where the context permits, the use of the term “or” will be equivalent to the
use of the term “and/or.”

(d) The words “to the extent” shall mean “the degree by which” and not “if.”

question will end on the next succeeding Business Day.

(f) Words denoting any gender will include all genders, including the neutral
gender. Where a word is defined herein, references to the singular will include

currency unless otherwise specifically provided.

of the representations and warranties set forth herein with respect to any
violation of or non-compliance, or alleged violation of or non-compliance, with
any Code section or Law, the reference to such Code section or Law means such
Code section or Law as in effect at the time of such violation or non-compliance
