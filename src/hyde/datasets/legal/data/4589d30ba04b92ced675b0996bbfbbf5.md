The Collateral Trustee and its successors and assigns under this Agreement will

capacity) will remain enforceable in accordance with their terms.

obligations arising under this Agreement or any Security Document that are then

SECOND, to the repayment of obligations, other than the Secured Obligations,
secured by a Permitted Prior Lien on the Collateral sold or realized upon to the

such obligation is discharged (in whole or in part) in connection with such
sale;

THIRD, to the respective Secured Debt Representatives, Hedge Providers and
Banking Services Providers on a pro rata basis for each Series of Secured Debt,
Hedging Obligations and Banking Services Obligations that are secured by such
Collateral (or, where such Hedging Obligations or Banking Services Obligations
are represented by a Secured Debt Representative, to such Secured Debt
Representative on their behalf) for application to the payment of all such
outstanding Secured Debt and any such other Secured Obligations that are then
due and payable and so secured (for application in such order as may be provided
in the Secured Debt Documents applicable to the respective Secured Obligations)
in an amount sufficient to pay in full in cash all outstanding Secured Debt and
all other Secured Obligations that are then due and payable (including all
interest and fees accrued thereon after the commencement of any Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding at the rate, including any applicable post-default rate,

Grantor, as the case may be, its successors or assigns, or to such other Persons
as may be entitled to such amounts under applicable law or as a court of
competent jurisdiction may direct.

Obligations of that Series thereafter shall not be entitled to share in the
proceeds of any such Collateral.

supplied by the relevant Secured Debt Representative, Hedge Provider and Banking

amounts outstanding with respect to its respective Secured Debt and any other
Secured Obligations and any amounts under any Hedge Agreements included in the
Secured Obligations. In calculating the amount of Secured Obligations owed to
any Hedge Provider, the Secured Obligations owed to such Hedge Provider shall be
determined by the relevant Hedge Provider in accordance with the terms of the
relevant Hedge Agreement; provided that, notwithstanding anything herein or in
any Secured Debt Document to the contrary, in the event that any such Hedge
Agreement consists of more than one confirmation or trade or in the event that
the relevant Hedge Provider is a party to any other Hedge Agreement, solely for
purposes of calculating the Secured Obligations owed to such Hedge Provider
under this Agreement, such calculation shall setoff and net all Obligations
owing to such Hedge Provider or owed by such Hedge Provider under each such
confirmation or trade and/or additional Hedge Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing or the other terms of this Agreement, the
Collateral Trustee will apply the proceeds of any collection, sale, foreclosure
or other realization upon, or exercise of any right or remedy with respect to

subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, as requested in any lawful
directions given to it from time to time in respect of any matter by an Act of
Required Secured Parties.

delivered by the Collateral Trustee in its capacity as such.

Section 3.7    For Sole and Exclusive Benefit of the Secured Parties. The

Agreement Joinder and delivers the same to the Collateral Trustee; provided
that, if such Funded Debt is issued under an existing Secured Debt Document for

this Agreement with respect to such Funded Debt.

(b)    Parent will be permitted to designate as Secured Debt hereunder any
Funded Debt that is incurred by any Grantor after the date of this Agreement in

Representative; provided that the failure to do so shall not affect the status

or Liens if prohibited by the terms of any Secured Debt Documents.

execution of this Agreement) hereby agrees to, and authorizes the Collateral
Trustee to enter into, any such technical amendments, modifications and/or
supplements (and additional Security Documents). Each Grantor hereby further
agrees that, if there are any recording, filing or other similar fees payable in
connection with any of the actions to be taken pursuant to this Section 3.8(c)
or Section 3.8(d), all such amounts shall be paid by, and shall be for the
account of, the Grantors, on a joint and several basis.

(d)    Without limitation of the foregoing, each Grantor agrees to take the
following actions with respect to any real property Collateral with respect to
all Additional Secured Debt:

(1)    each applicable Grantor shall enter into, and deliver to the Collateral
Trustee a mortgage modification (each such modification, a

documentary stamp taxes and other taxes, charges and fees, if any, necessary for
filing or recording in the recording office of each jurisdiction where such real
property to be encumbered thereby is situated; and

(2)    in connection with any Modification required under clause (1) above,

Instruments (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement as of the date
hereof) as reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent.

(a)    The Collateral Trustee will, as collateral trustee hereunder, also
perform its undertakings set forth in Section 3.1(a) with respect to any Hedging
Obligations or Banking Services Obligations under a Hedge Agreement or agreement
giving rise to Banking Services Obligations, as applicable, that are incurred
after the date hereof.

(b)    With respect to any Hedging Obligations, Parent and each of the other
Grantors agrees to take such actions (if any) as necessary or as otherwise may

(b)    A Grantor shall be automatically released from its obligations under this
Agreement and the other Security Documents and the Collateral Trustee’s Liens

interests of such Grantor shall be automatically released if such Grantor
(x) ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary (as defined in each applicable Secured
Debt Document) or (y) becomes an Excluded Subsidiary (as defined in each
applicable Secured Debt Document); provided that Parent has elected for such
Excluded Subsidiary to be released in accordance with the Credit Agreement.

(c)    The Collateral Trustee agrees for the benefit of Parent and the other

acknowledgements and/or notarizations as are required), deliver and provide
Parent or such Grantor (or its designee or counsel) authorization to file (if
applicable) such releases and such other documents (including UCC termination

or such Grantor and (ii) take such other actions (including return of any

request in connection with such release, in each case, on or prior to the later
of (x) the date specified in such request for such release and (y) the fifth
Business Day after the date of receipt of the items required by this
Section 4.1(c) by the Collateral Trustee.

(d)    The Collateral Trustee hereby agrees that in the case of any release
pursuant to clause (2) of Section 4.1(a), if the terms of any such sale,
transfer or other disposition require the payment of the purchase price to be
contemporaneous with the delivery of the applicable release, then, at the
written request of and at the expense of Parent or other applicable Grantor, the
Collateral Trustee will deliver the release under customary escrow or other
arrangements that permit such contemporaneous payment and delivery of the
release.

anything herein to the contrary, in addition to any release pursuant to
Section 4.1 hereof, the Collateral Trustee’s Priority Lien will no longer secure
the Notes outstanding under the Indenture or any other Obligations under the

benefits and proceeds of the Collateral Trustee’s Priority Lien on the
Collateral will automatically terminate and be discharged:

(1)    upon satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture as set forth under
Article 11 of the Indenture;

such Series of Secured Debt.

Discharge of Secured Obligations with respect to any Series of Secured Debt

ARTICLE V

IMMUNITIES OF THE COLLATERAL TRUSTEE

Section 5.1    No Implied Duty. The Collateral Trustee will not have any
fiduciary duties or other implied duties nor will it have responsibilities or
obligations other than those expressly assumed by it in this Agreement and the
other Security Documents. The Collateral Trustee will not be required to take
any action that is contrary to applicable law or any provision of this Agreement
or the other Security Documents. It is understood and agreed that the use of the
term “trustee” herein or in any other Security Document (or any other similar
term) with reference to a Collateral Trustee is not intended to connote any
fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency or
trustee doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of
market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between contracting parties

Section 5.2    Appointment of Agents and Advisors. The Collateral Trustee may
execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or perform any duties hereunder
either directly or by or through agents, attorneys, accountants, appraisers or
other experts or advisors selected by it in good faith as it may reasonably
require and will not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part
of any of them.

 

23



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 5.3    Other Agreements.

(a)    The Collateral Trustee has accepted its appointment as Collateral Trustee
hereunder. The Collateral Trustee is authorized and directed (i) to execute and
deliver the Security Documents executed by the Collateral Trustee as of the date
of this Agreement as well as any additional Security Documents from time to time
that are required hereunder or reasonably requested by a Grantor or a Secured
Debt Representative and is (or will be) bound by all such Security Documents
upon effectiveness thereof and the Collateral Trustee shall execute all such
Security Documents and (ii) in order to perfect the security interest to the
Collateral Trustee on behalf of the Secured Parties granted by the Grantors on
the Collateral held by such Grantors and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, to execute, deliver and/or file or record (if applicable) any such
Security Documents, instruments, financing statements or other documents with
the applicable government body; provided, however, that such additional Security
Documents do not adversely affect the rights, privileges, benefits and
immunities of the Collateral Trustee. The Collateral Trustee will not otherwise
be bound by, or be held obligated by, the provisions of any credit agreement,
indenture or other agreement governing Secured Debt (other than this Agreement
and the other Security Documents to which it is a party). In acting under any
Security Document, the Collateral Trustee shall enjoy all the rights,
protections, immunities and indemnities granted to it hereunder. To the extent
applicable, the Collateral Trustee shall enjoy the same rights, protections,
immunities and indemnities afforded to it under the Secured Debt Documents as
agent of (or otherwise being appointed to act for the benefit of) the related
Secured Debt Representative or Secured Parties in acting hereunder.

(b)    Upon receipt of a Collateral Trust Agreement Joinder, the Collateral
Trustee shall execute the same.

Section 5.4    Solicitation of Instructions.

(a)    As to any matter not expressly provided for by this Agreement or the
other Security Documents, the Collateral Trustee may at any time solicit written
confirmatory instructions, in the form of an Act of Required Secured Parties, an
Officer’s Certificate or an order of a court of competent jurisdiction, as to
any action that it may be requested or required to take, or that it may propose
to take, in the performance of any of its obligations under this Agreement or
the other Security Documents.

(b)    No written direction given to the Collateral Trustee by an Act of
Required Secured Parties that in the sole judgment of the Collateral Trustee
imposes, purports to impose or might reasonably be expected to impose upon the
Collateral Trustee any obligation or liability not set forth in or arising under
this Agreement and the other Security Documents will be binding upon the
Collateral Trustee unless the Collateral Trustee elects, at its sole option, to
accept such direction. For the avoidance of doubt, Sections 7.9 and 7.10 shall
apply with regard to any action taken by the Collateral Trustee in compliance
with such request or direction.

Section 5.5    Limitation of Liability. The Collateral Trustee will not be
responsible or liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it
hereunder or under any other Security Document, except for its own negligence or
willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
and nonappealable judgment. In no event shall the Collateral Trustee be
responsible or liable for punitive, special, indirect, or consequential loss or
damage of any kind whatsoever (including loss of profit) arising out of or in
connection with this

 

24



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agreement or any other Security Document or any agreement or transaction
contemplated hereby irrespective of whether the Collateral Trustee has been
advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of
actions; provided that such limitation of liability shall not be available to
the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses
are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Collateral Trustee or any of its Affiliates. The Collateral Trustee shall in no
event be responsible or liable for any failure or delay in the performance of
its obligations hereunder arising out of or caused by, directly or indirectly,
forces beyond its control, including, without limitation, strikes, work
stoppages, accidents, acts of war or terrorism, civil or military disturbances,
nuclear or natural catastrophes or acts of God, and interruptions, loss or
malfunctions of utilities, communications or computer (software and hardware)
services.

Section 5.6    Documents in Satisfactory Form. The Collateral Trustee will be
entitled to require that all agreements, certificates, opinions, instruments and
other documents at any time submitted to it, including those expressly provided
for in this Agreement, be delivered to it in a form and with substantive
provisions reasonably satisfactory to it; provided that in no event shall the
Collateral Trustee be deemed to be making a representation as to the accuracy,
adequacy or sufficiency of such document.

Section 5.7    Entitled to Rely. The Collateral Trustee may seek and
conclusively rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, any
judicial order or judgment, upon any advice, opinion or statement of legal
counsel, independent consultants and other experts selected by it in good faith
and upon any certification, instruction, notice or other writing delivered to it
by Parent or any other Grantor in compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement or delivered to it by any Secured Debt Representative as to the
Secured Parties for whom it acts, without being required to determine the
authenticity thereof or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the
propriety or validity of service thereof. The Collateral Trustee may act in
reliance upon any instrument comporting with the provisions of this Agreement or
any signature reasonably believed by it to be genuine and may assume that any
Person purporting to give notice or receipt or advice or make any statement or
execute any document in connection with the provisions hereof or the other
Security Documents has been duly authorized to do so. To the extent an Officer’s
Certificate is required or permitted under this Agreement to be delivered to the
Collateral Trustee in respect of any matter, the Collateral Trustee may rely
conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate as to such matter and such Officer’s
Certificate shall be full warranty and protection to the Collateral Trustee for
any action taken, suffered or omitted by it under the provisions of this
Agreement and the other Security Documents with respect to the transaction
specified in such Officer’s Certificate.

Section 5.8    Secured Debt Default . The Collateral Trustee will not be
required to inquire as to the occurrence or absence of any Secured Debt Default
and will not be affected by or required to act upon any notice or knowledge as
to the occurrence of any Secured Debt Default unless and until it is directed by
an Act of Required Secured Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Collateral Trustee shall
not be subject to, or bound by, the terms and provisions of any documents to
which it is not a party, and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of the terms
and provisions of any document to which it is not a party.

 

25



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 5.9    Actions by Collateral Trustee. As to any matter not expressly
provided for by this Agreement or the other Security Documents, the Collateral
Trustee will act or refrain from acting as directed by an Act of Required
Secured Parties and will be fully protected if it does so, and any action taken,
suffered or omitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall be binding on the Secured
Parties.

Section 5.10    Security or Indemnity in favor of the Collateral Trustee. The
Collateral Trustee will not be required to advance or expend any funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of its duties or the
exercise of its powers or rights hereunder unless it has been provided with
security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any and all
liability, loss, fee or expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking
or continuing to take such action.

Section 5.11    Rights of the Collateral Trustee. In the event of any conflict
between any terms and provisions set forth in this Agreement and those set forth
in any other Security Document, the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
supersede and control the terms and provisions of such other Security Document
with respect to the priority of the Liens created by the Security Documents and
the rights and remedies of the Collateral Trustee. In the event there is any
bona fide, good faith disagreement between the other parties to this Agreement
or any of the other Security Documents resulting in adverse claims being made in
connection with Collateral held by the Collateral Trustee and the terms of this
Agreement or any of the other Security Documents do not unambiguously mandate
the action the Collateral Trustee is to take or not to take in connection
therewith under the circumstances then existing, or the Collateral Trustee is in
doubt as to what action it is required to take or not to take hereunder or under
the other Security Documents, it will be entitled to refrain from taking any
action (and will incur no liability for doing so) until directed otherwise in
writing by a request signed jointly by the parties hereto entitled to give such
direction or by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Section 5.12    Limitations on Duty of Collateral Trustee in Respect of
Collateral.

(a)    Beyond the exercise of reasonable care in the custody of Collateral in
its possession, the Collateral Trustee will have no duty as to any Collateral in
its possession or control or in the possession or control of any agent or bailee
or any income thereon or as to preservation of rights against prior parties or
any other rights pertaining thereto and the Collateral Trustee will not be
responsible for filing any financing or continuation statements or recording any
documents or instruments in any public office at any time or times or otherwise
perfecting or maintaining the perfection of any Liens on the Collateral;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral Trustee
will execute, file or record UCC-3 continuation statements and other documents
and instruments to preserve, protect or perfect the security interests granted
to the Collateral Trustee (subject to the priorities set forth herein) if it
shall receive a specific written request to execute, file or record the
particular continuation statement or other specific document or instrument by
any Secured Debt Representative. The Collateral Trustee shall deliver to each
other Secured Debt Representative a copy of any such written request. The
Collateral Trustee will be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the
custody of the Collateral in its possession if the Collateral is accorded
treatment substantially equal to that which it accords its own property, and the
Collateral Trustee will not be liable or responsible for any loss or diminution
in the value of any of the Collateral by reason of the act or omission of any
carrier, forwarding agency or other agent or bailee selected by the Collateral
Trustee in good faith.

 

26



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)    Except as provided in Section 5.12(a), the Collateral Trustee will not be
responsible for the existence, genuineness or value of any of the Collateral or
for the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of the Liens in any of
the Collateral, whether impaired by operation of law or by reason of any action
or omission to act on its part hereunder, except to the extent such action or
omission constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the
Collateral Trustee as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
and nonappealable judgment, for the validity or sufficiency of the Collateral or
any agreement or assignment contained therein, for the validity of the title of
any Grantor to the Collateral, for insuring the Collateral or for the payment of
taxes, charges, assessments or Liens upon the Collateral or otherwise as to the
maintenance of the Collateral. The Collateral Trustee hereby disclaims any
representation or warranty to the current and future holders of the Secured
Obligations concerning the perfection of the security interests granted to it or
in the value of any Collateral.

Section 5.13    Assumption of Rights, Not Assumption of Duties. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein:

(1)    each of the parties thereto (other than the Collateral Trustee) will
remain liable under each of the Security Documents (other than this Agreement)
to the extent set forth therein to perform all of their respective duties and
obligations thereunder to the same extent as if this Agreement had not be
executed;

(2)    the exercise by the Collateral Trustee of any of its rights, remedies or
powers hereunder will not release such parties from any of their respective
duties or obligations under the other Security Documents; and

(3)    the Collateral Trustee will not be obligated to perform any of the
obligations or duties of any of the parties to the Security Documents other than
the obligations and duties of the Collateral Trustee.

Section 5.14    No Liability for Clean-Up of Hazardous Materials. In the event
that the Collateral Trustee is required to acquire title to an asset for any
reason, or take any managerial action of any kind in regard thereto, in order to
carry out any fiduciary or trust obligation for the benefit of another, which in
the Collateral Trustee’s sole discretion may cause the Collateral Trustee to be
considered an “owner or operator” under any environmental laws or otherwise
cause the Collateral Trustee to incur, or be exposed to, any environmental
liability or any liability under any other federal, state or local law, the
Collateral Trustee reserves the right, instead of taking such action, either to
resign as Collateral Trustee or to arrange for the transfer of the title or
control of the asset to a court appointed receiver. The Collateral Trustee will
not be liable to any Person for any environmental liability or any environmental
claims or contribution actions under any federal, state or local law, rule or
regulation by reason of the Collateral Trustee’s actions and conduct as
authorized, empowered and directed hereunder or relating to any kind of
discharge or release or threatened discharge or release of any hazardous
materials into the environment.

 

27



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 5.15    Act of Required Secured Party, etc.

(a)    At the request of the Collateral Trustee, each Secured Debt
Representative shall provide any information requested by the Collateral Trustee
in order to determine whether any act, direction or vote of holders of Secured
Debt meets the definition of “Act of Required Secured Parties”. Each such
Secured Debt Representative shall be required to determine whether any Secured
Debt is held by Parent or any Affiliate of a Grantor for purposes of clauses
(i) and (ii) of the definition of “Act of Required Secured Parties.”

(b)    The Collateral Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any
Discharge of Secured Obligations unless and until written notice thereof is
delivered to the Collateral Trustee pursuant to Section 7.7.

(c)    The Collateral Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the
information provided by each such Secured Debt Representative pursuant to this
Section 5.15.

Section 6.3    Succession. When the Person so appointed as successor Collateral
Trustee accepts such appointment:

obligations hereunder;

promptly transfer all Liens and collateral security and other property of the
Trust Estate within its possession or control to the possession or control of
the successor Collateral Trustee and will execute instruments and assignments as

Collateral Trustee to transfer to the successor Collateral Trustee all Liens,
interests, rights, powers and remedies of the predecessor Collateral Trustee in
respect of the Security Documents or the Trust Estate; and

(3)    the predecessor Collateral Trustee will transfer its rights under the

Person into which the Collateral Trustee may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Collateral Trustee shall be a party, or

successor of the Collateral Trustee pursuant to Section 6.3; provided that
(i) without the execution or filing of any paper with any party hereto or any
further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, except where an instrument
of transfer or assignment is required by law to effect such succession, anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, such Person satisfies the eligibility
requirements specified in clauses (1) through (4) of Section 6.2 and (ii) prior
to any such merger, conversion or consolidation, the Collateral Trustee shall
have notified Parent and each Secured Debt Representative thereof in writing.

 

29

Document will be effective without the approval of the Collateral Trustee

connection with any of the following, without the approval of the parties
specified therein (which approval should be deemed provided upon such parties
delivery of an executed counterpart of such amendment):

Secured Debt Document in the case of a merger or consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of such Grantor to the extent not prohibited by

(which shall sign the same promptly upon receipt) by Parent or any other
applicable Grantor party thereto and (y) executed by the Collateral Trustee in
accordance with the foregoing clause (x);

(2)    no amendment, supplement or waiver that reduces, impairs or adversely
affects the right of any Secured Party:

rights of the Collateral Trustee or any Secured Debt Representative,
respectively, in its capacity as such will become effective without the consent
of the Collateral Trustee or such Secured Debt Representative, respectively.

(b)    The Collateral Trustee will not enter into any amendment, supplement or
waiver unless it has received an Officer’s Certificate to the effect that such

covenant contained in any of the Secured Debt Documents; provided that this
clause (b) shall not apply to any Collateral Trust Agreement Joinder delivered
pursuant to Section 7.18.

hereof, the Security Documents and any related documents may be amended,
supplemented and/or waived at the request of Parent or at the direction of the

applicable Secured Debt Documents without obtaining an Act of Required Secured
Parties if such amendment or waiver is to (x) comply with local law or advice of
local counsel, (y) fix ambiguities, omissions or defects or (z) cause this
Agreement, such Security Documents or such other agreements or documents to be
consistent with this Agreement and/or one or more Secured Debt Documents, as
applicable.

(d)    For the avoidance of doubt, a Collateral Trust Agreement Joinder (and any
amendments or supplements to the Security Documents required in connection with
such Collateral Trust Agreement Joinder) shall not constitute an amendment,
supplement or waiver for purposes of this Section 7.1.

Section 7.2    Voting. In connection with any matter under this Agreement
requiring a vote of holders of Secured Debt, each Series of Secured Debt will
cast its votes in accordance with the Secured Debt Documents governing such
Series of Secured Debt. The amount of Secured Debt to be voted by a Series of
Secured Debt will equal (1) the aggregate principal amount of Secured Debt held
by such Series of Secured Debt (including outstanding letters of credit whether
or not then available or drawn), plus (2) other than in connection with an
exercise of remedies, the aggregate unfunded commitments to extend credit which,
when funded, would constitute Funded Debt of such Series of Secured Debt.
Following and in accordance with the outcome of the applicable vote under its
Secured Debt Documents, the Secured Debt Representative of each Series of
Secured Debt will cast all of its votes under that Series of Secured Debt as a
block in respect of any vote under this Agreement.

acts and things that may be required, or that the Collateral Trustee from time
to time may reasonably request, to assure and confirm that the Collateral
Trustee holds, for the benefit of the Secured Parties, duly created and
enforceable and perfected Liens upon the Collateral (including any property or
assets that are acquired or otherwise become, or are required by any Secured
Debt Document to become, Collateral after the date hereof), in each case as
contemplated by, and with the Lien priority required under, the Secured Debt
Documents.

 

31



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)    Upon the reasonable request of the Collateral Trustee at any time and
from time to time, each Grantor will promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver
such security documents, instruments, certificates, notices and other documents,
and take such other actions as may be reasonably required, or that the
Collateral Trustee may reasonably request, to create, perfect, protect, assure
or enforce the Liens and benefits intended to be conferred, in each case as
contemplated by the Secured Debt Documents or Security Documents for the benefit
of the Secured Parties.

Section 7.4    Successors and Assigns.

(a)    Except as provided in Section 5.2, the Collateral Trustee may not, in its
capacity as such, delegate any of its duties or assign any of its rights
hereunder, and any attempted delegation or assignment of any such duties or
rights will be null and void. All obligations of the Collateral Trustee
hereunder will inure to the sole and exclusive benefit of, and be enforceable

Secured Obligations, each of whom will be entitled to enforce this Agreement as
a third-party beneficiary hereof, and all of their respective successors and

third-party beneficiary hereof, and all of their respective successors and
assigns.

with respect to the exercise of, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or
remedy arising under this Agreement or any of the other Security Documents will

or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy will preclude any other
or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.
The remedies herein are cumulative and are not exclusive of any remedies

Section 7.8    Entire Agreement. This Agreement states the complete agreement of
the parties relating to the undertaking of the Collateral Trustee set forth
herein and supersedes all oral negotiations and prior writings in respect of
such undertaking.

Section 7.9    Compensation; Expenses. The Grantors agree to pay, promptly upon
demand:

(a)    such compensation to the Collateral Trustee and its agents as Parent and
the Collateral Trustee may agree in writing on the date hereof; and

(b)    jointly and severally, no later than fifteen (15) days after written
demand therefor:

(1)    all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by

preparation, closing, administration, performance or enforcement of this
Agreement and the other Security Documents (or any consent, amendment, waiver or
other modification relating hereto or thereto and any other document or matter
requested by Parent or any other Grantor), (ii) the transactions contemplated
thereby and (iii) the exercise of rights or performance of obligations of the
Collateral Trustee thereunder; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Grantors be obligated to pay fees and expenses for more than one primary counsel
to the Collateral Trustee (and up to one local counsel in each applicable
jurisdiction and regulatory counsel);

(3)    all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by
the Collateral Trustee and its agents in creating, perfecting, preserving,
releasing or enforcing the Collateral Trustee’s Liens on the Collateral,
including filing and recording fees, expenses and taxes, stamp or documentary
taxes, search fees, and title insurance premiums;

(4)    subject to the proviso in clause (2), after the occurrence of any Secured
Debt Default, all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses

of any claim based upon the Secured Obligations in any Insolvency or Liquidation
Proceeding, including all reasonable, documented out-of-pocket fees and
disbursements of attorneys, accountants, auditors, consultants, appraisers and
other professionals engaged by the Collateral Trustee and its agents.

The agreements in this Section 7.9 will survive repayment of all other Secured
Obligations and the removal or resignation of the Collateral Trustee.

Section 7.10    Indemnity.

(a)    The Grantors jointly and severally agree to defend, indemnify, pay and
hold harmless the Collateral Trustee and its Affiliates and each and all of the
directors, officers, partners, trustees, employees, attorneys and agents, and
(in each case) their respective heirs, representatives, successors and assigns
(each of the foregoing, an “Indemnitee”) from and against any and all
Indemnified Liabilities, regardless of whether such claim is asserted by any
Secured Party, Secured Debt Representative or Grantor; provided that no
Indemnitee will be entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to any
Indemnified Liability to the extent such Indemnified Liability is found by a
final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

 

35



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)    All amounts due under this Section 7.10 will be payable not later than
fifteen (15) days upon written demand therefore.

(c)    To the extent that the undertakings to defend, indemnify, pay and hold
harmless set forth in Section 7.10(a) may be unenforceable in whole or in part
because they violate any law or public policy, each of the Grantors will
contribute the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under
applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities
incurred by Indemnitees or any of them.

(d)    To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Grantor shall ever assert,
and each Grantor hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory
of liability, for any lost profits or special, indirect or consequential damages
or (to the fullest extent a claim for punitive damages may lawfully be waived)
any punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of, any Security Documents or any agreement or
instrument or transaction contemplated hereby or relating in any respect to any
Indemnified Liability.

(e)    The agreements in this Section 7.10 will survive repayment of all other
Secured Obligations and the removal or resignation of the Collateral Trustee.

Section 7.11    Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto shall
endeavor in good-faith negotiations to replace any invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which
comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provisions.

Section 7.12    Section Headings. The section headings and Table of Contents
used in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to
affect the construction hereof or be taken into consideration in the
interpretation hereof.

Section 7.13    Obligations Secured. All obligations of the Grantors set forth

by all Liens granted by the Security Documents.

Section 7.14    Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the law of the State of New York.

Section 7.15    Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process.

(a)    Each Grantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits for
themselves and their property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United
States District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate
court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each
of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all
claims in

 

36



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such New
York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each of
the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement or
any shall affect any right that any party hereto or Secured Party may otherwise
have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement against any
Grantor or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

(b)    Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process
in the manner provided for notices in Section 7.6. Nothing in this Agreement
will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by law.

Section 7.16    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Section 7.17    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including
by facsimile or other electronic imaging means), and all of said counterparts
taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.
Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic transmission (e.g. “pdf” or “tif” format) shall be effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.

Section 7.18    Additional Grantors. Parent will cause each Subsidiary of Parent
that hereafter becomes a Grantor or is required by any Secured Debt Document to
become a party to this Agreement to become a party to this Agreement, for all
purposes of this Agreement, by causing such Subsidiary to execute and deliver to
the Collateral Trustee a Collateral Trust Agreement Joinder, whereupon such
Subsidiary will be bound by the terms hereof to the same extent as if it had
executed and delivered this Agreement as of the date hereof.

Section 7.19    Continuing Nature of this Agreement. This Agreement will be
reinstated if at any time any payment or distribution in respect of any of the
Secured Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned in an Insolvency
or Liquidation Proceeding or otherwise by any Secured Party or Secured Debt
Representative or any representative of any such party (whether by demand,
settlement, litigation or otherwise).

Section 7.20    Insolvency. This Agreement will be applicable both before and
after the commencement of any Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding by or against
any Grantor.

 

37



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The relative rights, as provided for in this Agreement, will continue after the
commencement of any such Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding on the same basis
as prior to the date of the commencement of any such case, as provided in this
Agreement.

Section 7.21    Rights and Immunities of Secured Debt Representatives. The
Administrative Agent will be entitled to all of the rights, protections,
immunities and indemnities set forth in the Credit Agreement, the Indenture
Trustee will be entitled to all of the rights, protections, immunities and
indemnities set forth in the Indenture and any future Secured Debt
Representative will be entitled to all of the rights, protections, immunities
and indemnities set forth in the credit agreement, indenture or other agreement
governing the applicable Secured Debt with respect to which such Person will act
as representative, in each case as if specifically set forth herein. In no event
will any Secured Debt Representative be liable for any act or omission on the
part of the Grantors or the Collateral Trustee hereunder.

Section 7.22    Modification of Secured Debt Documents. Parent and any other
Grantor shall be permitted to amend, replace, refinance, increase, substitute or
modify any other Secured Debt Document or enter into any additional Secured Debt
or the applicable Secured Debt Documents, in each case in accordance with the
terms of the Secured Debt Documents.

Section 7.23    Confidentiality.

The Collateral Trustee agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information
(as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed:

(a)    to its Affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors
(it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be
informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep
such Information confidential);

(b)    to the extent required or requested by any regulatory authority
purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Affiliates (including

(c)    to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any
subpoena or similar legal process;

(d)    to any other party to this Agreement;

(e)    in connection with the exercise of any remedies under the Security

(f)    subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as

and their obligations;

 

38



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(g)    with the prior written consent of Parent; or

(h)    to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than
as a result of a breach of this Section by the disclosing party or its
Affiliates or (ii) becomes available to the Collateral Trustee on a
nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Grantors.

(i)    For the purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information
received from (or on behalf of) Parent or its Subsidiaries relating to Parent,
its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, other than any such information
that is available to the Collateral Trustee on a nonconfidential basis prior to

Section 7.24    Jurisdiction Specific Provisions.

(a)    Dutch Law Provisions.

The Collateral Trustee is hereby authorized to execute and deliver any documents
necessary or appropriate to create and perfect the rights of pledge for the
benefit of the Secured Parties under Security Documents governed by the laws of
the Netherlands (the “Dutch Security Documents”). Without prejudice to the
provisions of this Agreement and the other Secured Debt Documents, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree with the creation of parallel debt obligations of
Parent or any relevant Subsidiary as will be described in the Dutch Security
Documents (the “Parallel Debt”), including that any payment received by the
Collateral Trustee in respect of the Parallel Debt will, conditionally upon such
payment not subsequently being avoided or reduced by virtue of any provisions or
enactments relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, preference, liquidation or
similar laws of general application, be deemed a satisfaction of a pro rata
portion of the corresponding amounts of the Secured Obligations, and any payment
to the Secured Parties in satisfaction of the Secured Obligations shall,
conditionally upon such payment not subsequently being avoided or reduced by
virtue of any provisions or enactments relating to bankruptcy, insolvency,
preference, liquidation or similar laws of general application, be deemed as
satisfaction of the corresponding amount of the Parallel Debt. The parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that, for purposes of the Dutch Security Documents,
any resignation by the Collateral Trustee is not effective until its rights
under the Parallel Debt are assigned to the successor Collateral Trustee.

(b)    Canadian Law Provisions.

For greater certainty, and without limiting the powers of the Collateral
Trustee, each Hedge Provider, each Banking Services Provider and each other
Secured Party acting through its respective Secured Debt Representative hereby
acknowledge that the Collateral Trustee is also acting as hypothecary
representative of the Secured Parties as contemplated under Article 2692 of the
Civil Code of Quebec in order to hold hypothecs and security granted by any
Grantor on property pursuant to the laws of the Province of Quebec. The
execution by the Collateral Trustee as hypothecary representative prior to this
appointment of any deeds of hypothec or other security documents is hereby
ratified and confirmed. The appointment of the Collateral Trustee,

 

39



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

acting as hypothecary representative, shall be deemed to have been ratified and
confirmed by each Person accepting the benefits of the Security Documents. The
resignation or removal of the Collateral Trustee and appointment of a successor
Collateral Trustee, shall also include its resignation or removal, and
appointment, as the case may be, as hypothecary representative without further
formality, except the filing of a notice of replacement of hypothecary
representative pursuant to Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Quebec.

 

40
