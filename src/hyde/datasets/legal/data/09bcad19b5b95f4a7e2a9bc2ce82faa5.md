with the Private Placement Bonds pursuant to contractual provisions similar to
such Section 7.16 or consistent with Section 7.20, shall not result in the
Indebtedness under this Agreement, or the Private Placement Bonds being deemed
Secured Indebtedness hereunder, with the Indebtedness under this Agreement and
the Private Placement Bonds under such circumstances continuing to be deemed
Unsecured Indebtedness for the purposes of this Agreement.”
(k)A new Section 1.5 is hereby inserted at the end of Article I as follows:

that give the holders of the Private Placement Bonds the right not to accept
such offer to prepay), (b) any amounts not applied to prepay the Private
Placement Bonds (including because a holder thereof refuses the Borrower's offer
to prepay) shall instead be applied to prepay the Facility as a prepayment of

(c) if the amount of Net Cash Proceeds from any particular disposition,
incurrence of Indebtedness or Equity Issuance is less than $10,000,000.00 (after
giving effect to the initial $100,000,000.00 exclusion for asset dispositions

for purposes of this Section 6.1(l) and Section 5.2, (i) during the Covenant
Relief Period only, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak disclosed by the
Borrower to the Lenders shall be disregarded, and (ii) after the Covenant Relief
Period, the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak shall be considered a material
adverse change, as described above, only if such material adverse change is

(o)Section 6.1 of the Existing Credit Agreement is hereby amended by inserting a
new clause (aa) at the end thereof as follows:


“(aa)    Beneficial Ownership Certification. The information included in each
Beneficial Ownership Certification is true and correct as of the date thereof.

“(b)    If, (x) after the Agreement Date, a Guaranty Trigger Event occurs with

representations and warranties (subject in all cases to all materiality
qualifiers and other exceptions in such representations and warranties)
contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to the extent they

(q)Section 7.16 of the Existing Credit Agreement is hereby deleted in its
entirety and replaced with the following:

equity interest pledge shall be granted to the Agent, as Collateral Agent on
behalf of (x) the Lenders, to secure the Obligations, and (y) the holders of the
Private Placement Bonds, to secure the obligations of the Borrower to such
holders in connection with the Private Placement Bonds, which Unencumbered
Properties will be representative (on a pro rata value basis) of the various
asset classes owned by the Borrower, with the aggregate Unencumbered Asset Value
of such Unencumbered Properties at least equal to the Required Value. The
proposed schedule of Unencumbered Properties shall be subject to the approval of
the Required Lenders in their reasonable discretion, together with any approval
of the holders of the Private Placement Bonds required under the Approved Bonds
Amendment. In the event the Required Lenders, in their reasonable discretion, do
not approve such schedule, the Required




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Lenders shall have the right to revise the schedule of Unencumbered Properties
to reflect, in the reasonable determination of the Required Lenders, a fair
representation (on a pro rata value basis) of the various asset classes owned by
the Borrower, with the aggregate Unencumbered Asset Value of such revised
schedule of Unencumbered Properties to be as close as practicable to (but not
less than) the Required Value. Upon approval (or revision) by the Required
Lenders (and, if applicable, upon any similar approval required under the
Approved Bonds Amendment) of such list of Unencumbered Properties (such final
list, the “Pledged Properties”), the Borrower shall cause each owner of Equity
Interests of the Unencumbered Property Owner Subsidiaries that own such Pledged
Properties to (i) execute and deliver to the Agent, as Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Lenders and the holders of the Private Placement Bonds, within
ten (10) Business Days after the approval (or revision) of the Pledged
Properties schedule, a pledge agreement in the form of Exhibit “A” annexed
hereto (or joinder to any existing pledge agreement if already in effect
pursuant to this Section 7.16) and appropriate certificates and powers or
Uniform Commercial Code financing statements, pledging all ownership interests
in each such Unencumbered Property Owner Subsidiary with respect to the Pledged
Properties, in form and substance satisfactory to Agent, and (ii) the
organizational documents, certificates of good standing, resolutions and, if
requested by the Agent, a legal opinion regarding Borrower and such
Subsidiaries, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent and
consistent with the corresponding items delivered by the Borrower under Section
5.1(a) of this Agreement. Any such pledge shall also require, as determined by
the Agent, delivery of an intercreditor agreement in the form of Exhibit “B”
attached hereto establishing the ratable priority of the liens granted to the
Agent with any liens held by any holder of the Bonds or other creditors that are
granted a lien on such pledged collateral. Thereafter, if (i) the Required Value
should increase as a result of an increase in the sum of (A) the Outstanding
Amounts due under this Agreement and (B) the outstanding principal amount of the
Private Placement Bonds, the above process shall be repeated as of the date of
any such increase, or (ii) there is an increase or decrease in the aggregate
Unencumbered Asset Value of the Pledged Properties as a result of a Lease
Modification (as hereinafter defined), the above process shall be repeated as of
the date of delivery of the financial statements next required to be delivered
pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.1(b) after the date of such Lease
Modification, in each case with respect to the pledge of equity interests in
respect of additional Unencumbered Properties (which shall then be deemed
Pledged Properties) such that the aggregate Unencumbered Asset Value of all of
the Pledged Properties shall be as close as practicable to (but not less than)
the Required Value. For the purposes of this Section 7.16, the Unencumbered
Asset Value of each Pledged Property shall mean (I) for any Pledged Property
(other than any AMC Pledged Property) owned by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
on March 31, 2020, the Unencumbered Asset Value of such Pledged Property as of
such date, (II) for an AMC Pledged Property owned by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries on March 31, 2020, 80% of the Unencumbered Asset Value of such AMC
Pledged Property as of such date (except as otherwise provided in clause (IV)
below), (III) for any Pledged Property (including any AMC Pledged Property)
owned by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and acquired after March 31, 2020,
the cost of such Pledged Property determined in accordance with GAAP and (IV)
for any Pledged Property (including any AMC Pledged Property) that has undergone
a lease modification after March 31, 2020 where the rent has been permanently
adjusted (a “Lease Modification”), the Unencumbered Asset Value of such Pledged
Property determined after giving effect to the new rent charged (for purposes of
this clause (IV), a termination of a lease or the vacating by the tenant of a
Pledged Property shall be deemed to be a permanent adjustment of the rent to $0
until such time as such Pledged Property is re-leased, at which time such
Pledged Property shall have an Unencumbered Asset Value based on the new lease);
provided that, (x) for purposes of clauses (I) and (IV) immediately above, the
capitalization rate used to value any Topgolf Real Estate shall be 8% rather
than 7.5% (such 8% capitalization rate being the capitalization rate for Topgolf
Real Estate under the Note Purchase Agreement for the Private Placement Bonds,
as amended through the Approved Bonds Amendment), and (y) for the avoidance of
doubt, a COVID-19 related deferral of rent or similar payments shall not
constitute a Lease Modification.
(b) At such time as the Covenant Relief Period shall have been terminated or
expired in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, provided any Subsidiary
Guaranty described in Section 7.15(b) and any pledges described under Section
7.16(a) granted to any other creditor above have been or are simultaneously
being released and terminated, the Agent shall similarly release each such
Subsidiary Guaranty and the pledges

(r)Section 7.20 of the Existing Credit Agreement is hereby deleted in its
entirety and replaced with the following:


Section 7.20 Most Favored Nations. If, during the continuation of the Covenant
Relief Period, the Approved Bonds Amendment, or any future amendment or
modification of any of the Private Placement Bonds (a “Material Credit
Facility”), shall include any financial or other material covenant that is not
contained in Section 9.1 or in this Agreement is more restrictive than the
analogous provision contained in Section 9.1 or otherwise in this Agreement (any
such covenant, together with any related definitions (including any components
of such definitions) (including, without limitation, any term defined therein
with reference to the application of GAAP, as identified in such applicable
Material Credit Facility), an “Additional or More Restrictive Covenant”;
provided that the different methodology in calculating the financial covenants
under the Private Placement Bonds in effect prior to the execution of the
Approved Bonds Amendment shall not constitute an Additional or More Restrictive
Covenant), then the Borrower shall promptly, and in any event within 10 Business
Days thereof, provide a written notice to the Agent (a “Most Favored Lender
Notice”) with respect to each such Additional or More Restrictive Covenant.
Thereupon, unless waived in writing by the Required Lenders within 10 days of
the Agent’s receipt of such notice, such Additional or More Restrictive Covenant
shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Agreement, mutatis mutandis,
as if set forth fully herein, effective as of the earliest date when such
Additional or More Restrictive Covenant became effective under such Material
Credit Facility. Any Additional or More Restrictive Covenant incorporated into
this Agreement pursuant to this provision, (1) shall be deemed automatically
waived herein to reflect any waiver of such Additional or More Restrictive
Covenant under the applicable Material Credit Facility, (2) shall be deemed
automatically amended herein to reflect any subsequent amendments agreed and
implemented in relation to such Additional or More Restrictive Covenant under
the applicable Material Credit Facility; and (3) shall be deemed deleted from
this Agreement at such time as such Additional or More Restrictive Covenant is
deleted or otherwise removed from or is no longer in effect under or pursuant to
each Material Credit Facility; provided that in no event shall the effect of any
event contemplated by clause (1), (2) or (3) above result in any covenant set
forth in Section 9.1 being less restrictive than it was on Amendment No. 1
Effective Date; provided further in each case that any consideration paid or
provided to any holder of Indebtedness under any Material Credit Facility in
connection with an event contemplated by clause (1), (2) or (3) above (other
than reimbursement of expenses and repayment in full of such Material Credit
Facility in connection with its termination) is paid to each Lender at the same
time and on equivalent terms; and provided further that no Additional or More
Restrictive Covenant shall be so deemed automatically waived, amended or deleted
during any time that a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing. In determining whether a breach of any financial covenant
incorporated by reference into this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.20
shall constitute an Event of Default, the period of grace, if any, applicable to
such Additional or More Restrictive Covenant in the applicable Material Credit
Facility shall apply.
(s)Article VII of the Existing Credit Agreement is hereby modified by inserting
a new Section 7.22 at the end thereof as follows:

the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any
Derivatives Contract or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such
support, “QFC Credit Support”, and each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the
parties acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act (together with the regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special
Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support
(with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents
and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the
State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United
States):

“Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution
Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit
Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such
QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or
such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same
extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution
Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest,
obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United
States or a state of the United States.

In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes
subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights
under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any
QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are
permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be
exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the
Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the
United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed
that rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender

under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.
“Covered Entity” means any of the following: (i) a “covered entity” as that term
is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b); (ii) a

the Collateral Agent) duly executed by such Pledgor, and take the actions
required by this subsection (a) in respect of the additional Pledged Interests
which are to be pledged pursuant to this Agreement, and confirming the
attachment of the Lien hereby created on and in respect of such additional
Pledged Interests. Each Pledgor hereby authorizes the Collateral Agent to attach
each such pledge amendment to this Agreement and agrees




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




that all Pledged Interests listed on any such supplement delivered to the
Collateral Agent by any Pledgor shall for all purposes hereunder be considered
Collateral;
(ii)    Any sums paid upon or in respect of the Pledged Interests upon the
liquidation or dissolution of any Issuer shall be paid over to the Collateral
Agent to be held by it hereunder as additional collateral security for the
Senior Indebtedness, and in case any distribution of capital shall be made on or
in respect of such Pledged Interests or any property shall be distributed upon
or with respect to such Pledged Interests pursuant to the recapitalization or
reclassification of the capital of any Issuer or pursuant to the reorganization
thereof, the property so distributed shall, unless otherwise subject to a
perfected security interest in favor of the Collateral Agent or as permitted
under the Loan Agreements, be delivered to the Collateral Agent to be held by it
hereunder as additional collateral security for the Senior Indebtedness. If any
sums of money or property so paid or distributed in respect of any Pledged
Interests shall be received by such Pledgor, such Pledgor shall, until such
money or property is paid or delivered to the Collateral Agent, unless otherwise
subject to a perfected security interest in favor of the Collateral Agent or as
permitted under the Loan Agreements, hold such money or property in trust for
the Collateral Agent, segregated from other funds of such Pledgor, as additional
collateral security for the Senior Indebtedness;
(iii)    Such Pledgor shall, promptly after the receipt thereof by or on behalf
of a Pledgor, deliver to the Collateral Agent all certificates and instruments
constituting or representing Pledged Interests. Prior to delivery to the
Collateral Agent, all such certificates constituting or representing Pledged
Interests shall be held in trust by such Pledgor separate from the property of
such Pledgor for the benefit of the Collateral Agent pursuant hereto. All such
certificates constituting or representing Pledged Interests shall be delivered
in suitable form for transfer by delivery or shall be accompanied by duly
executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Collateral Agent;
(iv)    If any of the Pledged Interests are at any time not evidenced by
certificates of ownership, then each applicable Pledgor shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and upon the request of the Collateral Agent, cause
such pledge to be recorded on the equity holder register or the books of the
issuer, cause the issuer thereof to execute an Acknowledgment and Consent in the
form of Exhibit A attached hereto, execute customary pledge forms or other
documents necessary or reasonably requested to complete the pledge, and give the
Collateral Agent the right to transfer such Pledged Interests under the terms
hereof; provided that the Collateral Agent shall not exercise such transfer
right unless an Event of Default exists; and
(v)    Such Pledgor shall cause any Pledged Interest that is issued by an Issuer
that is a corporation and that is represented by a certificate to continue to be
represented by a certificate (or, if such Pledged Interest is not represented by
a certificate, to be represented by a certificate if so requested by the
Collateral Agent) and such Pledgor shall take the actions required by Section
4(a)(iii) above with respect to such Pledged Interests and certificates.
(vi)    Such Pledgor shall not permit any Pledged Interests issued by an Issuer
that is not a corporation to be (1) credited to a “securities account” (within
the meaning of Section 8-501(a) of the UCC), (2) dealt in or traded on
securities exchanges or securities markets, (3) “investment company securities”
within the meaning of Section 8-103 of the UCC, or (4) otherwise treated as a
“security” for purposes of Article 8 of the UCC of the jurisdiction of
organization of the Issuer of such Pledged Interests unless, the applicable
Pledgor shall have given not less than ten (10) Business Day’s prior written
notice to the Collateral Agent of such event and, concurrently with such event,
the applicable Pledgor shall (A) in the case of (1) above, cause such securities
account to be maintained with a securities intermediary that is reasonably
acceptable to the Collateral Agent and deliver a control agreement with respect
to such securities account in form and substance satisfactory to the Collateral
Agent, and (B) in any other case of (2) - (4) above, (x) cause the
organizational documents of such Issuer to be amended to provide that such
Pledged Interest will be a “security” as defined in and governed by




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, (y) if requested by the Collateral
Agent, cause the applicable Issuer to issue certificates evidencing such Pledged
Interests, and (z) satisfy the requirements of Section 4(a)(iii) above with
respect to such Pledged Interests and certificates.
(b)    Maintenance of Collateral and Perfected Security Interest.
(i)    Each Pledgor shall keep the Collateral owned by it free and clear of all
liens, encumbrances, attachments, security interest pledges and charges, other
than in favor of Collateral Agent under this Agreement or Permitted Liens, shall
maintain the security interests of the Collateral Agent created by this
Agreement as perfected security interests having at least the priority described
in Section 3(b)(iv), and shall defend such security interests against the claims
and demands of all Persons whomsoever (other than a holder of a Permitted Lien),
subject to the rights of such Pledgor under the Loan Agreements to dispose of
the Collateral, in each case, at its own cost and expense;
(ii)    Except as permitted by the Loan Agreements, such Pledgor shall not sell,
transfer, or otherwise dispose of the Collateral owned by it or any interest
therein to any other Person. If any Collateral, or any part thereof, is sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of in violation of this Section 4(b)(ii), the
security interest of the Collateral Agent shall continue in the Collateral
notwithstanding such sale, transfer or other disposition, and such Pledgor will
deliver any proceeds thereof to the Collateral Agent to be held as Collateral
hereunder (it is acknowledged and agreed that the delivery of any such proceeds
shall not be deemed a waiver of any Event of Default arising as a result of the
sale, transfer or other disposal of the Collateral in violation of this Section
4(b)(ii));
(iii)    If any amount payable under or in connection with any of the Collateral
shall be or become evidenced by any promissory note, other instrument or chattel
paper, such note, instrument or chattel paper shall be promptly delivered to the
Collateral Agent, duly endorsed in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Collateral Agent, to be held as Collateral pursuant to this Agreement;
(iv)    Such Pledgor shall, at such Pledgor’s own expense, promptly execute all
such instruments, documents and papers, and will do all such acts as Collateral
Agent may reasonably request in writing from time to time to carry into effect
the provisions and intent of this Agreement including, without limitation, the
providing of notification in connection with book-entry securities or general
intangibles, and the providing of instructions to the issuers of uncertificated
securities, and will do all such other acts as Collateral Agent may reasonably
request with respect to the perfection and protection of the pledge and security
interest granted herein and the assignment effected hereby; and
(v)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Pledged Interests of
any Issuer that is a corporation (i) will continue to be “securities” within the
meaning of Sections 8-102(a)(15) and 8-103 of the Uniform Commercial Code as in
effect in the Issuer’s state of organization, (ii) will continue to be
“financial assets” (within the meaning of Section 8-102(a)(9) of the UCC as in
effect in the applicable Issuer’s state of organization), (iii) will not be
credited to a “securities account” (within the meaning of Section 8-501(a) of
the UCC), and (iv) are not and will not be dealt in or traded on securities
exchanges or securities markets, and the terms of the Pledged Interests are not
and will not be “investment company securities” within the meaning of Section
8-103 of the UCC.
(c)    Governing Agreements.
(i)    Such Pledgor shall not without the prior written consent of Collateral
Agent in each instance, which consent may be withheld, granted, or conditionally
granted, in Collateral Agent’s reasonable discretion, vote the Collateral in
which it holds an interest, in favor of or consent to any resolution or action
which, as determined by the Collateral Agent in its reasonable discretion,
would:
(1)
impose any restrictions upon the sale, transfer or disposition of the Collateral
other than restrictions, if any, in existence on the date hereof or on the date
such Pledged





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Interests become subject to this Agreement (and not created in contemplation
hereof), the application of which is waived to the full satisfaction of
Collateral Agent as to the Collateral; or
(2)
result in the issuance of any additional interest in any Issuer, or of any class
of security, which issuance would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect the value of the Collateral or could otherwise reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

(3)
vest additional powers, privileges, preferences or priorities to any other class
of interest in any Issuer to the detriment of the value of or rights accruing to
the Collateral; or

(4)
result in an involuntary lien or encumbrance being placed upon or attaching to
any of the Collateral which lien or encumbrance is not discharged within thirty
(30) days (or such longer period as the Collateral Agent may agree in its sole
discretion); or

(5)
materially and adversely affect the validity, perfection or priority of the
Collateral Agent’s security interest in the Collateral or would otherwise
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

(ii)    Such Pledgor shall, if not prohibited by this Agreement or applicable
law, comply with all of its obligations under any shareholders agreement,
operating agreement, partnership agreement, voting trust, proxy agreement or
other agreement or understanding (each a “Pledged Collateral Agreement”, and
collectively, the “Pledged Collateral Agreements”) related to the Collateral to
which it is a party and shall, if not prohibited by this Agreement or applicable
law, enforce all of its rights thereunder; and
(iii)    Such Pledgor shall not itself or on behalf of any Issuer or the
Borrower take any action or refrain from taking any action which would cause or
result in a violation of any provisions of the Loan Agreements.
5.
Payments on Account of Collateral.

(a)    Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each
Pledgor shall be permitted to receive all Distributions paid in respect of its
Collateral to the extent permitted under the Loan Agreements. Upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default (unless the
applicable Secured Parties have waived such Event of Default under each Loan
Agreement), subject to terms of the Loan Agreements, (i) all Distributions due
on account of the Collateral, whether or not such payments are ordinary and
regular cash distributions, shall be paid to Collateral Agent or, at Collateral
Agent’s option, to Collateral Agent’s nominee, and (ii) all Distributions
received by any Pledgor consisting of cash, checks, and other near-cash items
shall be held by such Pledgor in trust for the Collateral Agent, segregated from
other funds of such Pledgor, and shall, forthwith upon receipt by such Pledgor,
be turned over to the Collateral Agent in the exact form received by such
Pledgor (duly indorsed by such Pledgor to the Collateral Agent, if required).
(b)    Each Pledgor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer that is the
issuer of any Pledged Interests pledged by such Pledgor hereunder to (i) comply
with any instruction received by it from the Collateral Agent in writing that
(A) states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (B) is
otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or
further instructions from such Pledgor, and such Pledgor agrees that each Issuer
shall be fully protected in so complying, and (ii) upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, pay any dividends or other
payments with respect to the Collateral directly to the Collateral Agent.
6.
Voting Rights.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




(a)    Except during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Pledgor may
exercise all Voting Rights subject to the terms of this Agreement. Upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, all rights of each
Pledgor to exercise such Voting Rights shall cease and the Collateral Agent
shall have the right to exercise, in person or by its nominees or proxies, all
such Voting Rights assigned to it hereunder and the Collateral Agent shall
exercise such Voting Rights in such manner as the Collateral Agent in its sole
discretion shall deem to be in the best interests of the Secured Parties
(subject to the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Agreements and also
provided that the Collateral Agent shall be liable for its gross negligence, bad
faith and willful misconduct). Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, each Pledgor shall effect the directions of the Collateral
Agent in connection with any such exercise in accordance with this Agreement.
(b)    In connection with the Collateral Agent’s exercise of the Voting Rights,
the Pledgors shall cause each Issuer to rely on a notice from the Collateral
Agent stating that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under any
Loan Agreement, in which event no further direction from any Pledgor shall be
required to effect the assignment of Voting Rights hereunder from such Pledgor
to the Collateral Agent, and such Issuer shall immediately permit the Collateral
Agent to exercise all of the Voting Rights in respect of the business and
affairs of such Issuer. If the applicable Event of Default is no longer
continuing, such Pledgor shall again automatically have all of the rights to
exercise the Voting Rights and the Collateral Agent promptly shall so notify
such Pledgor and the applicable Issuer in writing in confirmation thereof.
(c)    Solely with respect to any action, decision, determination or election by
any Issuer, Pledgor, or any of their respective partners or members that any of
their membership interests or other equity interests constituting Collateral, as
applicable, be, or cease to be, a “security” as defined in and governed by
Article 8 of the UCC, and all other matters related to any such action,
decision, determination or election (collectively, the “Article 8 Matters”),
each Pledgor hereby irrevocably grants and appoints the Collateral Agent, so
long as any Event of Default exists, as such Pledgor’s true and lawful proxy,
for and in such Pledgor’s name, place and stead to vote the Pledged Interests,
whether directly or indirectly, beneficially or of record, now owned or
hereafter acquired, with respect to such Article 8 Matters. The proxy granted
and appointed in this Section 6(c) shall include the right to sign such
Pledgor’s name (as a member or other applicable equity holder) to any consent,
certificate or other document relating to an Article 8 Matter and the Pledged
Interests that applicable law may permit or require, to cause the Pledged
Interests to be voted in accordance with the preceding sentence. Each Pledgor
hereby represents and warrants that there are no other proxies and powers of
attorney with respect to an Article 8 Matter and the Pledged Interests that such
Pledgor may have granted or appointed that are still in effect. Other than as
required herein for the benefit of the Collateral Agent, each Pledgor will not
give a subsequent proxy or power of attorney or enter into any other voting
agreement with respect to the Pledged Interests with respect to any Article 8
Matter and any attempt to do so with respect to an Article 8 Matter shall be
void and of no effect. The proxies and powers granted by the each Pledgor
pursuant to this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are given to secure
the performance of such Pledgor’s obligations.
7.
Rights After Event of Default.

(a)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default
(unless Collateral Agent has waived such Event of Default by written instrument
signed by a duly authorized officer of the Collateral Agent, the Collateral
Agent shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured party upon default
under the UCC in addition to which the Collateral Agent may sell or otherwise
dispose of the Collateral and/or enforce and collect the Collateral for
application towards (but not necessarily in complete satisfaction of) the Senior
Indebtedness in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement
for further application pursuant to the Loan Agreement. Without limitation to
the foregoing, upon the occurrence of during the continuance of an Event of
Default, (i) the Collateral Agent shall have the right (A) to endorse, assign or
otherwise transfer to or to register in the name of the Collateral Agent or any
of its nominees or endorse for negotiation any or all of the Collateral, without
any indication that such Collateral is subject to the security interest
hereunder, (B) to receive any and all cash dividends, payments or other Proceeds
paid in respect of the Collateral of each Pledgor and make application thereof
in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, (C) to exchange uncertificated
Pledged Interests for certificated Pledged Interests and to exchange
certificated Pledged Interests




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




for certificates of larger or smaller denominations, for any purpose consistent
with this Agreement (in each case to the extent such exchanges are permitted
under the applicable Pledged Collateral Agreements or otherwise agreed upon by
the Issuer that is the issuer of such Pledged Interests), and (D) if requested
by the Collateral Agent, to be (or have its nominee or assignee be) admitted by
each Issuer as a member or limited partner of such limited liability company or
partnership, and (ii) each Pledgor shall, if requested by the Collateral Agent,
promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to the
Collateral Agent all such proxies, dividend payment orders and other instruments
as the Collateral Agent may from time to time reasonably request (including
stock powers registering any Pledged Interests in the name of the Collateral
Agent or its nominee), and the Collateral Agent or its nominee may thereafter
exercise (A) all voting, corporate and other rights pertaining to any Pledged
Interests at any meeting of shareholders of the relevant issuer or otherwise and
(B) any and all rights of conversion, exchange and subscription and any other
rights, privileges or options pertaining to any Pledged Interests as if it were
the absolute owner thereof (including, without limitation, the right to exchange
at its discretion any and all of any Pledged Interests upon the merger,
consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in
the corporate or other organizational structure of any Issuer, or upon the
exercise by a Pledgor or the Collateral Agent of any right, privilege or option
pertaining to such Pledged Interests, and in connection therewith, the right to
deposit and deliver any and all of such Collateral with any committee,
depositary, transfer Collateral Agent, registrar or other designated agency upon
such terms and conditions as the Collateral Agent may determine), all without
liability except to account for property actually received by it, but the
Collateral Agent shall have no duty to the Pledgor to exercise any such right,
privilege or option and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or
delay in so doing.
(b)    [intentionally omitted]
(c)    Unless any Collateral threatens to decline speedily in value, or is of a
type customarily sold on a recognized market (in which event Collateral Agent
shall give Pledgors such notice as may be practicable under the circumstances),
Collateral Agent shall give Pledgors at least the greater of the minimum notice
required by law, or ten (10) days, prior written notice of the date, time and
place of any public sale thereof, or of the time after which any private sale or
any other intended disposition is to be made.
(d)    Each Pledgor and the Collateral Agent acknowledges that, notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, any exercise by Collateral Agent of
Collateral Agent’s and any Secured Party’s rights upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default will be subject to compliance by
Collateral Agent and Secured Parties with the applicable statutes, regulations,
ordinances, directives and orders of any federal, state, municipal or other
governmental authority. Collateral Agent in its sole discretion at any such sale
or in connection with any such disposition may restrict the prospective bidders
or purchasers as to their number, nature of business, investment intention, or
otherwise, including, without limitation a requirement that the persons making
such purchases represent and agree to the satisfaction of Collateral Agent that
they are purchasing the Collateral, or some portion thereof, for their own
account, for investment and not with a view towards the distribution or a sale
thereof, or that they otherwise fall within some lawful exemption from
registration under applicable laws.
(e)    The proceeds of any collection or of any sale or disposition of any
Collateral, or any portion thereof, held pursuant to this Agreement shall be
applied in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. Borrower and any Pledgor
that is a guarantor of or otherwise liable for any Senior Indebtedness shall
remain liable to Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties for any deficiency
remaining following such application.
(f)    The Collateral Agent may buy or otherwise acquire any part or all of the
Collateral at any public sale or other disposition and if any part or all of the
Collateral is of a type customarily sold or otherwise disposed of in a
recognized market or is of the type which is the subject of widely-distributed
standard price quotations, the Collateral Agent may buy or otherwise acquire at
private sale or other disposition and may make payments thereof by any means.
The Collateral Agent shall apply the cash proceeds actually received from any
sale or other disposition in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. Only
after such applications, and after




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




payment by the Collateral Agent of any amount required by §9-608(a)(1)(C) or
§9-615(a)(3) of the UCC, need the Collateral Agent account to the applicable
Pledgor for any surplus.
(g)    Each Pledgor and the Collateral Agent recognizes that the Collateral
Agent may be unable to effect a public sale or other disposition of the Pledged
Interests by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), federal banking laws, and other
applicable Laws, but may be compelled to resort to one or more private sales
thereof to a restricted group of purchasers. Each Pledgor agrees that any such
private sales may be at prices and other terms less favorable to the seller than
if sold at public sales and that such private sales shall not by reason thereof
be deemed not to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The
Collateral Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the
Pledged Interests for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer of such
securities to register such securities for public sale under the Securities Act,
or such other federal banking or other applicable Laws, even if the applicable
Issuer would agree to do so. Subject to the foregoing, the Collateral Agent
agrees that any sale of the Pledged Interests shall be made in a commercially
reasonable manner and in accordance with applicable securities laws, and each
Pledgor agrees to use its best efforts to cause the Issuers of the Pledged
Interests contemplated to be sold, to execute and deliver, and cause the
directors and officers of such Issuer to execute and deliver, all at such
Pledgor’s expense, all such instruments and documents, and to do or cause to be
done all such other acts and things as may be necessary or, in the reasonable
opinion of the Collateral Agent, advisable to exempt such Pledged Interests from
registration under the provisions of the Securities Act, and to make all
amendments to such instruments and documents which, in the opinion of the
Collateral Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission applicable thereto. Each Pledgor further
agrees to use its best efforts to cause such Issuer or Issuers to comply with
the provisions of the securities or “Blue Sky” laws of any jurisdiction which
the Collateral Agent shall designate and, if required, to cause such Issuer or
Issuers to make available to its security holders, as soon as practicable, an
earnings statement (which need not be audited) which will satisfy the provisions
of §11(a) of the Securities Act. In no event shall any Issuer be obligated to
register any securities under the Securities Act or under any other federal or
state securities laws.
(h)    Each Pledgor further agrees to do or cause to be done all such other acts
and things as may be reasonably necessary to make any sales of any portion or
all of the Pledged Interests pursuant to this Section 7 valid and binding and in
compliance with any and all applicable Laws (including, without limitation, the
Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable thereto and all
applicable state securities or “Blue Sky” laws), regulations, orders, writs,
injunctions, decrees or awards of any and all courts, arbitrators or
governmental instrumentalities, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over
any such sale or sales, all at such Pledgor’s expense. Each Pledgor further
agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Section 7 will
cause irreparable injury to the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties, that
the Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties have no adequate remedy at law in
respect of such breach and, as a consequence, agrees that each and every
covenant contained in this Section 7 shall be specifically enforceable against
such Pledgor by the Collateral Agent and each Pledgor hereby waives and agrees
not to assert any defenses against an action for specific performance of such
covenants.
8.
Actions By Collateral Agent. Each Pledgor hereby designates Collateral Agent, or
any attorney, agent or other Person designated by Collateral Agent, so long as
any Event Default exists, as the attorney-in-fact of such Pledgor to (a) endorse
in favor of Collateral Agent any of the Collateral; (b) cause the transfer of
any of the Collateral in such name as Collateral Agent may from time to time
determine; (c) renew, extend or roll over any Collateral; and (d) make, demand
and initiate actions to enforce any of the Collateral or rights therein.
Collateral Agent may take such action with respect to the Collateral as
Collateral Agent may reasonably determine to be necessary to protect and
preserve its interest in the Collateral. Collateral Agent shall also have and
may exercise at any time all rights, remedies, powers, privileges and
discretions of each Pledgor with respect to and under the Collateral; provided,
however, Collateral Agent shall have no right to exercise any Voting Rights or
to foreclose or otherwise realize on any Collateral in each case except in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, including as otherwise provided in the preceding sentence,
all of the rights, remedies, powers, privileges and discretions included in this
Section





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




8 may be exercised by Collateral Agent whether or not any of the Senior
Indebtedness is then due and whether or not an Event of Default has occurred.
The within designation and grant of power of attorney is coupled with an
interest, is irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated by a written
instrument executed by a duly authorized officer of Collateral Agent. The power
of attorney shall not be affected by subsequent disability or incapacity of any
Pledgor. Collateral Agent and Secured Parties shall not be liable for any act or
omission to act pursuant to this Section 8, except for any act or omission to
act which is in actual bad faith, willful misconduct or constituting the gross
negligence of such party.
9.
Rights and Remedies. The rights, remedies, powers, privileges and discretions of
Collateral Agent and the Secured Parties hereunder (hereinafter, the “Rights and
Remedies”) shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies,
powers, privileges or discretions which it or they may otherwise have. No delay
or omission by Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party in exercising or
enforcing any of its rights and remedies shall operate as, or constitute, a
waiver thereof. No waiver by Collateral Agent or any Secured Party of any
Default or any Event of Default or of any default under any other agreement
shall operate as a waiver of any other default hereunder or under any other of
the Loan Agreements. No exercise of any of the Rights and Remedies and no other
agreement or transaction of whatever nature entered into between Collateral
Agent, any Secured Party and Pledgor at any time shall preclude any other
exercise of the Rights and Remedies. No waiver by Collateral Agent or any other
Secured Party of any of the Rights and Remedies on any one occasion shall be
deemed a waiver on any subsequent occasion nor shall it be deemed a continuing
waiver. All of the Rights and Remedies and all of Collateral Agent’s and each
other Secured Party’s rights, remedies, powers, privileges and discretions under
any other agreement or transaction are cumulative and not alternative or
exclusive and may be exercised by Collateral Agent and the other applicable
Secured Party(ies) at such time or times in such order of preference as
Collateral Agent or such other Secured Party(ies) in its or their sole and
absolute discretion may determine. All Rights and Remedies, insofar as the
enforcement of this Agreement is concerned, may be exercised only by the
Collateral Agent, and not by any Secured Party.

10.
Pledgor’s Consent and Waivers.

(a)    Each Pledgor agrees that Collateral Agent may enforce its rights as
against such Pledgor, the Collateral, or as against any other party liable for
the Senior Indebtedness, or as against any other collateral given for any of the
Senior Indebtedness, in any order or in such combination as Collateral Agent may
in its sole discretion determine, and each Pledgor hereby expressly waives all
suretyship defenses and defenses in the nature thereof, agrees to the release or
substitution of any collateral hereunder or otherwise, and consents to each and
all of the terms, provisions and conditions of the other Loan Agreements. Each
Pledgor further: (a) waives presentment, demand, notice and protest with respect
to the Senior Indebtedness and the Collateral; (b) waives any delay on the part
of Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party; (c) assents to any indulgence or
waiver which Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party may grant or give any
other Person liable or obliged to Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party
for or on account of the Senior Indebtedness; (d) authorizes Collateral Agent
and each other Secured Party to alter the obligations of any other person liable
or obligated to Collateral Agent or such Secured Party for or on account of the
Senior Indebtedness without notice to or further consent from such Pledgor; (e)
agrees that no release of any property securing the Senior Indebtedness shall
affect the rights of Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party with respect to
the Collateral hereunder which is not so released; and (f) to the fullest extent
that it is not unlawful to do so, waives the right to notice and/or hearing, if
it might otherwise be entitled thereto, prior to exercise of the Rights and
Remedies upon and during the continuance of an Event of Default.
(b)    All rights of the Collateral Agent and the other Secured Parties
hereunder, the grant of a security interest in the Collateral and all
obligations of each Pledgor hereunder, shall be absolute and unconditional
irrespective of (a) any lack of validity or enforceability of the Loan
Agreements or any other agreement or instrument relating to any Loan Agreement,
(b) any change in time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of,
all or any of the Senior Indebtedness, or any other amendment or waiver of or
any consent to any departure from the Note or any other agreement or instrument,
(c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any other collateral, or any
release or amendment or waiver of or consent to or departure from any guarantee,
for all or any of the Senior Indebtedness, or (d) any other circumstance which
might otherwise constitute a




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




defense available to (other than the defense of indefeasible payment), or a
discharge of, any Pledgor in respect of the Senior Indebtedness or in respect of
this Agreement.
(c)    So long as this Agreement is in effect, each Pledgor irrevocably waives
any and all of its rights under those provisions of the operating or partnership
agreements of each applicable Issuer that (a) prohibit, restrict, condition or
otherwise affect the grant hereunder of any lien on any of the Collateral or any
enforcement action which may be taken in respect of any such lien or (b)
otherwise conflict with the terms of this Agreement. To the extent that this
provision is inconsistent with the terms of the operating or partnership
agreement of any such Issuer, such operating or partnership agreement shall be
deemed to be amended or waived so as to be consistent with the terms of this
Section 10. Each Pledgor of any Pledged Interests of an Issuer that is a limited
liability company or a partnership hereby irrevocably consents to the Collateral
Agent or its nominee becoming a member of such limited liability company or a
partner of such partnership (including any management rights appurtenant
thereto) upon an exercise of remedies pursuant to Section 7 hereof.

granted to the Collateral Agent as provided for herein shall be automatically
released without any further notice or other formality. However, such release by

ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK (INCLUDING ANY FEDERAL COURT SITTING

UNCONDITIONALLY, THE NON EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS AND ANY RELATED
APPELLATE COURT AND IRREVOCABLY (i) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ANY JUDGMENT RENDERED
THEREBY WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND (ii) WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY OBJECTION ANY OF THEM MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE
AS TO THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT OR THAT SUCH A
COURT IS AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. THE PLEDGORS AND THE COLLATERAL AGENT FURTHER
AGREE THAT SERVICE OF PROCESS IN ANY SUCH SUIT MAY BE MADE UPON ANY PLEDGOR BY
MAIL AT THE BORROWER’S ADDRESS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 12.1 OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT
OR IN SECTION 17 OF THE NOTE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE. IN ADDITION TO
THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR ANY FEDERAL COURT SITTING THEREIN, THE
COLLATERAL AGENT MAY BRING ACTION(S) FOR ENFORCEMENT ON A NONEXCLUSIVE BASIS
WHERE ANY COLLATERAL OR ASSETS OF THE PLEDGORS EXIST AND EACH PLEDGOR CONSENTS
TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS AND THE SERVICE OF PROCESS IN
ANY SUCH SUIT BEING MADE UPON SUCH PLEDGOR BY MAIL AT THE BORROWER’S ADDRESS
SPECIFIED IN SECTION 12.1 OF THE CREDIT AGREEMENT OR IN SECTION 17 OF THE NOTE
PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE. EACH PLEDGOR EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT THE FOREGOING CHOICE OF NEW YORK LAW WAS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT TO
THE COLLATERAL AGENT ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT.
(k)    The initial Pledgors hereunder shall be each of the signatories hereto,

hereof, additional Subsidiaries of the Borrower may become parties hereto as
additional Pledgors (each an “Additional Pledgor”) by executing a joinder
agreement in the form of Exhibit B attached hereto or any other form as
Collateral Agent may approve (the form attached as Exhibit B hereto or any other
such form approved by Collateral Agent, a “Joinder Agreement”). Upon delivery of
any such Joinder Agreement to Collateral Agent, notice of which is hereby waived
by the Pledgors, each such Additional Pledgor shall be a Pledgor hereunder and

hereof and any such Joinder Agreement may amend or supplement Schedule II and/or
Schedule III attached hereto to reflect such Additional Pledgor and any
Collateral owned by it without the consent of any other Pledgor. Each Pledgor
expressly agrees that its obligations arising hereunder shall not be affected or
diminished by the addition or release of any other Pledgor hereunder, or by any
election by Collateral Agent not to cause any Subsidiary of Borrower to become
an Additional Pledgor hereunder. This Agreement shall be fully effective as to
any Pledgor that is or becomes a party hereto regardless of whether any other
person becomes or fails to become or ceases to be a Pledgor hereunder.

Letter of Credit Collateral Obligations shall be considered to have been paid to
the extent of any amount then on deposit in the Special Cash Collateral Account
provided for in paragraph (b) of this Section 5).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any collections or payments
received by any Senior Lender on or after the occurrence of a Sharing Event but
prior to the date of the occurrence of an Enforcement, (1) such collections and
payments shall be subject to the distribution provisions of clauses (i) through
(iv), above, only to the extent that the principal amount of the Senior
Indebtedness owed to such Senior Lender on the date of such Enforcement is less
than the principal amount of the Senior Indebtedness owed to such Senior Lender
on the date of such Sharing Event, and (2) the amount of any such collections
and payments subject to the distribution provisions of clauses (i) through (iv)
above in accordance with the foregoing clause (1) shall not be so distributed
until the date of the occurrence of such Enforcement. For the purposes of the
preceding sentence, any collection or payment received by the Bank Agent on
behalf of the Banks shall be considered to have been received by the Banks, and
applied to pay the Senior Indebtedness owed to the Banks to which such payment
or collection relates, whether or not distributed by the Bank Agent to the
Banks.
After the Senior Indebtedness has been finally paid in full in cash and all
Commitments have been terminated, the balance of proceeds of the Collateral, if
any, shall be paid to the Loan Parties, as applicable, or as otherwise required
by law.
(b)    Any payment pursuant to clause (a)(iv) above with respect to Letter of
Credit Collateral Obligations shall be paid to the Collateral Agent for deposit
in an account (the “Special Cash Collateral Account”) to be held as Collateral
for the Senior Indebtedness and disposed of as provided herein. On each date
after the occurrence of an Enforcement on which a payment is made to a
beneficiary pursuant to a draw on a Letter of Credit, the Collateral Agent shall
distribute to the Bank Agent from the Special Cash Collateral Account for
application to the payment of the reimbursement obligation due to the issuer of
such Letter of Credit an amount equal to the product of (i) the amount then on
deposit in the Special Cash Collateral Account, and (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the amount of such draw and the denominator of which is
the amount of the Outstanding Letters of Credit Exposure immediately prior to
such draw. On each date after the occurrence of an Enforcement on which a
reduction in the Outstanding Letters of Credit Exposure occurs other than on
account of a payment made to a beneficiary pursuant to a draw on a Letter of
Credit, then the Collateral Agent shall distribute from the Special Cash
Collateral Account an amount equal to the product of (1) the amount then on
deposit in the Special Cash Collateral Account and (2) a fraction the numerator
of which is the amount of such reduction and the denominator of which is the
amount of the Outstanding Letters of Credit Exposure immediately prior to such
reduction, which amount shall be distributed as provided in clause (a)(iv),
above. At such time as the amount of the Outstanding Letters of Credit Exposure
is reduced to zero, any amount remaining in the Special Cash Collateral Account,
after the distribution therefrom as provided above, shall be distributed as
provided in clause (a)(iv), above.
(c)    Each Loan Party, by its acknowledgment hereto, agrees that in the event
any payment is made with respect to any Senior Indebtedness that is delivered to
the Collateral Agent pursuant to this Section 5, (i) the Senior Indebtedness
discharged by such payment shall be the amount or amounts of the Senior
Indebtedness with respect to which such payment is distributed pursuant to this
Section 5 notwithstanding that the payment may have




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




initially been made by a Loan Party with respect to other Senior Indebtedness,
and (ii) such payment shall be deemed to reduce the Senior Indebtedness of any
Senior Lenders receiving any distributions from such payment under Section 5(a)
or (b) in the amount of such distributions and shall be deemed to restore and
reinstate the Senior Indebtedness of any Senior Lender making any such payment
under Section 5(a) in the amount of such payment; provided that if for any
reason such restoration and reinstatement shall not be binding against any Loan
Party, the Senior Lenders agree to take actions as shall have the effect as
placing them in the same relative positions as they would have been if such
restoration and reinstatement had been binding against the Loan Parties.
6.    Reserved.
7.    Reserved.
8.    Certain Credit Extensions and Amendments to Agreements by the Senior
Lenders; Actions Related to Collateral and Guaranty Agreements; Other Liens and
Security Interests.
(a)    The Bank Agent and each Bank agrees that, without the consent in writing
of the Required Holders, it will not (i) except for the Guaranty Agreements,
retain or obtain the primary or secondary obligations of any other obligor or
obligors with respect to all or any part of the Senior Indebtedness, or (ii)
from and after the institution of any Bankruptcy Proceeding involving any Loan
Party, as respects the Collateral enter into any agreement with such Loan Party
with respect to post-petition usage of cash collateral, post-petition financing
arrangements or adequate protection. Each Noteholder agrees that, without the
consent in writing of the Required Lenders, it will not (i) except for the
Guaranty Agreements, retain or obtain the primary or secondary obligations of
any other obligor or obligors with respect to all or any part of the Senior
Indebtedness, or (ii) from and after the institution of any Bankruptcy
Proceeding involving any Loan Party, as respects the Collateral enter into any
agreement with such Loan Party with respect to post-petition usage of cash
collateral, post-petition financing arrangements or adequate protection.
(b)    Each of the Bank Agent and each Senior Lender agrees that it will have
recourse to the Collateral only through the Collateral Agent, that it shall have
no independent recourse thereto and that it shall refrain from exercising any
rights or remedies under the Collateral Documents which have or may have arisen
or which may arise as a result of an Event of Default or an acceleration of the
maturities of the Senior Indebtedness, except that, upon the direction of the
Required Senior Lenders or the Supermajority Lenders as set forth in Section
2(b) above, the Bank Agent and any Senior Lender may setoff any amount of any
balances held by it for the account of any Loan Party or any other property held
or owing by it to or for the credit or for the account of any Loan Party,
provided that the amount set off is delivered to the Collateral Agent for
application pursuant to Section 5 hereof. Without such direction, neither the
Bank Agent nor any Senior Lender shall setoff any such amount. For the purposes
of perfection any setoff rights which may be available under applicable law, any
balances held by the Collateral Agent, the Bank Agent or any Senior Lender for
the account of any Loan Party or any other property held or owing by the
Collateral Agent, the Bank Agent or any Senior Lender to or for the credit or
account of any Loan Party shall be deemed to be held as agent for all Senior
Lenders.
(c)    Neither the Collateral Agent, the Bank Agent nor any Senior Lender shall
take or receive a security interest in or lien upon any of the property or
assets of any Loan Party as security for the payment of any indebtedness of any
Loan Party other than the Senior Indebtedness, nor shall the Collateral Agent,
the Bank Agent nor any Senior Lender take or receive a security interest in or a
lien upon any of the property or assets of any Loan Party as security for the
payment of any Senior Indebtedness other than liens and security interests
granted to the Collateral Agent in the Collateral pursuant to the Collateral
Documents and other than any judgment lien on any assets of the Loan Parties
other than the Collateral as contemplated by Section 8(d) and, if any such
security interest or lien is granted in violation of this paragraph (c), the
grantee of such security interest or lien agrees that such security interest or
lien shall be deemed to have been granted to the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Collateral Agent, the Bank Agent and the Senior Lenders. The
existence of a common law lien and setoff rights on deposit accounts shall not
be prohibited by the provisions of this paragraph (c); provided that any
realization on such lien or set off rights and the application of the proceeds
thereof shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement.




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




(d)    Nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i) prevent any Senior Lender
from imposing a default rate of interest in accordance with the Credit Agreement
or the Note Agreement or any Senior Notes, as applicable, or prevent a Senior
Lender from raising any defenses in any action in which it has been made a party
defendant or has been joined as a third party, except that the Collateral Agent
may direct and control any defense directly relating to the Collateral or any
one or more of the Collateral Documents as directed by the Required Senior
Lenders or the Supermajority Lenders as set forth in 2(b) above, which shall be
governed by the provisions of this Agreement, (ii) affect or impair the right
any Senior Lender may have under the terms and conditions governing the Senior
Indebtedness to accelerate and demand repayment of such Senior Indebtedness or
(iii) prevent any Senior Lender from agreeing to new or modified covenants and
other terms under, or otherwise amending, the Note Agreement, the Senior Notes,
the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Notes or the Term Notes (including for the
avoidance of doubt, entering in to any amendments, agreements or instruments
that relate to the Additional Bank Obligations). Subject only to the express
limitations set forth in this Agreement, each Senior Lender retains the right to
freely exercise its rights and remedies as a general creditor of the Loan
Parties in accordance with applicable law and agreements with the Loan Parties,
including without limitation the right to file a lawsuit and obtain a judgment
therein against the Loan Parties and to enforce such judgment against any assets
of the Loan Parties other than the Collateral, provided that the application of
the proceeds thereof shall be subject to the provisions of this Agreement.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as an amendment of, or a
waiver of a consent to the departure by any Loan Party from, any provision of
the Credit Agreement or the Note Agreement.
(e)    Subject to the provisions set forth in this Agreement, each Senior Lender
and its affiliates may (without having to account therefor to any Senior Lender)
own, sell, acquire and hold equity and debt securities of the Loan Parties and
lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Loan Parties
(as if, in the case of KeyBank National Association, it was not acting as
Collateral Agent), and, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Senior
Lenders and their affiliates may accept dividends, interest, principal payments,
fees and other consideration from the Loan Parties for services in connection
with this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the same to the
other Senior Lenders, provided that any such amounts which constitute Senior
Indebtedness are provided for in the Credit Agreement or the Note Agreement.
9.    Accounting; Adjustments.
(a)    The Collateral Agent, the Bank Agent and each Senior Lender agrees to
render an accounting to any of the others of the amounts of the outstanding
Senior Indebtedness, receipts of payments from the Loan Parties or from the
Collateral and of other items relevant to the provisions of this Agreement upon
the reasonable request from one of the others as soon as reasonably practicable
after such request, giving effect to the application of payments and the
proceeds of Collateral as provided in this Agreement.
(b)    Each party hereto agrees that (i) to the extent any amount distributed to
it hereunder is in excess of the amount due to be distributed to it hereunder,
it shall pay to the other parties hereto such amounts so that, after giving
effect to such payments, the amounts received by all parties hereto are equal to
the amounts to be paid to them hereunder, and (ii) in the event any payment made
to any party hereto is subsequently invalidated, declared fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required to be paid to a trustee, receiver, or any
other party under any bankruptcy act, state or federal law, common law or
equitable cause, then each of the other parties hereto shall pay to such party
such amounts so that, after giving effect to the payments hereunder by all such
other parties, the amounts received by all parties are not in excess of the
amounts to be paid to them hereunder as though any payment so invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid
had not been made.
10.    Notices. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any notice
required or desired to be served, given or delivered hereunder shall be in
writing, and shall be deemed to have been validly served, given or delivered
three (3) business days after deposit in the United States mails, with proper
postage prepaid, one business day after delivery to a courier for next day
delivery, upon delivery by courier or upon transmission by electronic mail,
telecopy or other similar electronic medium (provided that a copy of any such
notice sent by such transmission is also sent by one of the other means provided
hereunder within one day after the date sent by such transmission) to the
addresses set forth below the signatures hereto, with a copy to any person or
persons set forth below such signature




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




shown as to receive a copy, or to such other address as any party designates to
the others in the manner herein prescribed. Any party giving notice to any other
party hereunder shall also give copies of such notice to all other parties.
11.    Contesting Liens or Security Interests; No Partitioning or Marshalling of
Collateral; Contesting Senior Indebtedness.
(a)    Neither the Bank Agent, the Collateral Agent nor any Senior Lender shall
contest the validity, perfection, priority or enforceability of or seek to
avoid, have declared fraudulent or have put aside any lien or security interest
granted to the Collateral Agent as contemplated hereby, and each party hereby
agrees to cooperate in the defense of any action contesting the validity,
perfection, priority or enforceability of such liens or security interests. Each
party and, by its consent hereto, each Loan Party, shall also use its best
efforts to notify the other parties of any change in the location of any of the
Collateral or the business operations of any Loan Party or of any change in law
which would make it necessary or advisable to file additional financing
statements in another location as against any Loan Party with respect to the
liens and security interests intended to be created by the Collateral Documents,
but the failure of any party (other than any Loan Party) to do so shall not
create a cause of action against the party failing to give such notice or create
any claim or right on behalf of any other party hereto and any third party.
(b)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any
Collateral Document, neither the Bank Agent nor any Senior Lender shall have the
right to have any of the Collateral, or any security interest or other property
being held as security for all or any part of the Senior Indebtedness by the
Collateral Agent, partitioned, or to file a complaint or institute any
proceeding at law or in equity to have any of the Collateral or any such
security interest or other property partitioned, and each of the Bank Agent and
each Senior Lender hereby waives any such right. The Collateral Agent, the Bank
Agent and each Senior Lender hereby waive any and all rights to have the
Collateral, or any part thereof, marshalled upon any foreclosure of any of the
liens or security interests securing the Senior Indebtedness.
(c)    Neither the Bank Agent, the Collateral Agent nor any Senior Lender shall
contest the validity or enforceability of or seek to avoid, have declared
fraudulent or have set aside any Senior Indebtedness. In the event any Senior
Indebtedness is invalidated, avoided, declared fraudulent or set aside for the
benefit of any Loan Party, the Bank Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Senior
Lenders agree that such Senior Indebtedness shall nevertheless be considered to
be outstanding for all purposes of this Agreement.
12.    No Additional Rights for Loan Parties Hereunder; Senior Indebtedness Held
By Borrower and its Affiliates; Credit Bidding. Each Loan Party, by its consent
hereto, acknowledges that it shall have no rights under this Agreement. If the
Collateral Agent, the Bank Agent or any Senior Lender shall violate the terms of
this Agreement, each Loan Party agrees, by its consent hereto, that it shall not
use such violation as a defense to any enforcement by any such party against
such Loan Party nor assert such violation as a counterclaim or basis for setoff
or recoupment against any such party. Each of the parties hereto and, by its
consent hereto, each Loan Party agrees, that any Senior Indebtedness that may at
any time be held by any Loan Party or any Affiliate of any Loan Party shall not
be considered to be outstanding for any purpose under this Agreement, such Loan
Party or Affiliate shall not be a “Senior Lender”, “Bank” or “Noteholder” under
this Agreement and such Loan Party or Affiliate shall not be entitled to the
benefit of any provision of this Agreement. Each Loan Party further agrees that
it will not object to, contest or oppose (or cause any other Person to object
to, contest or oppose or support any other Person in objecting to, contesting or
opposing) in any manner any “credit bid” by the Collateral Agent, the Bank Agent
or any Senior Lender of any of all the Senior Indebtedness in any sale of assets
of any Loan Party pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code of 1978, as
amended (the “Bankruptcy Code”), a plan of reorganization under the Bankruptcy
Code or otherwise under any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code or in a
similar process in any proceeding under any bankruptcy, reorganization,
compromise, arrangement, insolvency, readjustment of debt, dissolution or
liquidation or similar law.
13.    Bankruptcy Proceedings. Nothing contained herein shall limit or restrict
the independent right of the Bank Agent or any Senior Lender to initiate an
action or actions in any Bankruptcy Proceeding in its individual capacity and to
appear or be heard on any matter before the bankruptcy or other applicable court
in any such proceeding, including, without limitation, with respect to any
question concerning the post-petition usage of




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Collateral and post-petition financing arrangements. The Collateral Agent is not
entitled to initiate such actions on behalf of the Bank Agent or any Senior
Lender or to appear and be heard on any matter before the bankruptcy or other
applicable court in any such proceeding as the representative of the Bank Agent
or any Senior Lender. The Collateral Agent is not authorized in any such
proceeding to enter into any agreement for, or give any authorization or consent
with respect to, any determination of adequate protection with respect to the
Senior Indebtedness or the post-petition usage of Collateral, unless such
agreement, authorization or consent has been approved in writing by the Required
Senior Lenders. This Agreement shall survive the commencement of any such
Bankruptcy Proceeding.
14.    Independent Credit Investigation. None of the Collateral Agent, the Bank
Agent or any Senior Lender, nor any of its respective directors, officers,
agents or employees, shall be responsible to any of the others for the solvency
or financial condition of any Loan Party or the ability of any Loan Party to
repay any of the Senior Indebtedness, or for the value, sufficiency, existence
or ownership of any of the Collateral, or for the perfection or vesting of any
lien or security interest, or for the statements of any Loan Party, oral or
written, or for the validity, sufficiency or enforceability of any of the Senior
Indebtedness, the Credit Agreement, the Note Agreement, the Guaranty Agreements,
any Collateral Document, any document or agreement executed or delivered in
connection with or pursuant to any of the foregoing, or for the liens or
security interests granted by the Loan Parties to the Collateral Agent in
connection therewith. Each of the Collateral Agent, the Bank Agent and each
Senior Lender has entered into its respective financial agreements with the Loan
Parties based upon its own independent investigation, and makes no warranty or
representation to the other, nor does it rely upon any representation by any of
the others, with respect to the matters identified or referred to in this
Section.
15.    Supervision of Obligations. Except to the extent otherwise expressly
provided herein, each of the Bank Agent and each Senior Lender shall be entitled
to manage and supervise the obligations of the Loan Parties to it in accordance
with applicable law and the Bank Agent’s or such Senior Lender’s practices in
effect from time to time without regard to the existence of any other Senior
Lender.
16.    Turnover of Collateral. If the Bank Agent or any Senior Lender acquires
custody, control or possession of any Collateral or any proceeds thereof other
than pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the Bank Agent or such Senior
Lender, as the case may be, shall promptly cause such Collateral or the proceeds
thereof to be delivered to or put in the custody, possession or control of the
Collateral Agent for disposition and distribution in accordance with the
provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement. Until such time as the Bank Agent or
such Senior Lender, as the case may be, shall have complied with the provisions
of the immediately preceding sentence, the Bank Agent or such Senior Lender, as
the case may be, shall be deemed to hold such Collateral and the proceeds
thereof in trust for the parties entitled thereto under this Agreement.
17.    Options to Purchase.
(a)    After the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Bank shall have the
option to purchase all (but not less than all) of the outstanding Senior
Indebtedness owed to the Noteholders at a purchase price equal to 100% of the
amount thereof on the date of purchase (including all interest thereon and any
Excess Leverage Fee to the date of purchase), plus an amount equal to the
Make-Whole Amount which would be payable under the Note Agreement if the Senior
Notes were prepaid pursuant to paragraph 8.2 of the Note Agreement on such date
of purchase.
(b)    After the occurrence of an Event of Default, each Noteholder shall have
the option to purchase all (but not less than all) of the outstanding Senior
Indebtedness owed to the Banks at a purchase price equal to 100% of the amount
thereof on the date of purchase (including all interest and LIBOR breakage costs
thereon to the date of purchase).
(c)    Any Senior Lender desiring to exercise its option to purchase under this
Section 17 may do so by giving notice to the Senior Lenders whose Senior
Indebtedness is to be purchased. The closing of the purchase and sale shall take
place on the fifth business day after such notice is given. At the closing the
buyer will pay the sellers the purchase price of the Senior Indebtedness being
purchased except that, as respects the purchase in Outstanding Letters of Credit
Exposure, the purchase shall be a risk participation therein payable at the same
time as the related Letter of Credit is drawn. Payment of such purchase price
shall be made in the same manner as specified in the Credit




--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Agreement for payments upon the Revolving Loans or in the Note Agreement for
payments on the Senior Notes, as the case may be. Any notice of exercise of any
such option to purchase shall be irrevocable. In the event more than one notice
of exercise of an option to purchase under this Section 17 is given, only the
notice first given shall be effective and the other notices given shall be
ineffective.
18.    Amendment. This Agreement and the provisions hereof may be amended,
modified or waived only by a writing signed by the Collateral Agent, the Bank
Agent and the Required Holders.
19.    Bank Agent Authorized to Act for Banks. The Bank Agent represents and
warrants to the other parties hereto that it is authorized pursuant to the
Credit Agreement to execute this Agreement on behalf of itself and each other
Bank and the execution, delivery and performance by the Bank Agent of this
Agreement will result in a valid and legally binding obligation of each Bank
enforceable in accordance with its terms.
20.    Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of each of the parties
hereof, including subsequent holders of the Senior Indebtedness and Persons
subsequently becoming parties to the Credit Agreement as a “Bank” thereunder or
becoming parties to the Note Agreement as a “holder of a Note” thereunder,
provided that (a) neither the Collateral Agent, the Bank Agent nor any Senior
Lender shall assign or transfer any interest in any Senior Indebtedness or
permit such Person to become such a party to the Credit Agreement or to become a
party to the Note Agreement unless such transfer or assignment is made subject
to this Agreement and such transferee, assignee or Person (i) executes and
delivers to the Collateral Agent, the Bank Agent and each other Senior Lender an
Assumption Agreement in the form of Exhibit A hereto under which such
transferee, assignee or Person assumes the obligations of the transferor or
assignor or the obligations of a “Bank” or a “Noteholder,” as the case may be,
hereunder from and after the time of such transfer or assignment or the time
such Person becomes a party to the Credit Agreement or the Note Agreement, as
the case may be, or (ii) otherwise confirms in any assignment and assumption or
other document evidencing such assignment or transfer that it is bound by the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (b) the appointment of any
replacement Collateral Agent shall be subject to the provisions of Section 2(h)
hereof.
21.    Limitation Relative to Other Agreements. Nothing contained in this
Agreement is intended to impair (a) as between the Noteholders and the Loan
Parties, the rights of the Noteholders and the obligations of the Loan Parties
under the Note Agreement and the Senior Notes, or (b) as between the Banks and
the Loan Parties, the rights of the Banks and the obligations of the Loan
Parties under the Credit Agreement or the Revolving Notes.
22.    Counterparts; Facsimile or Electronic Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in several counterparts and by each party on a separate counterpart,
each of which, when so executed and delivered, shall be an original, but all of
which together shall constitute but one and the same instrument. In proving this
Agreement, it shall not be necessary to produce or account for more than one
such counterpart signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by
facsimile or electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a
manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
23.    Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED AS TO VALIDITY,
INTERPRETATION, ENFORCEMENT AND EFFECT BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
(EXCLUDING ANY CONFLICTS OF LAW RULES WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE CAUSE THIS AGREEMENT
TO BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION).
