terms, conditions and limits of this Agreement, follow the fortunes of the
Cedant under the Subject Annuities, and the Reinsurer shall be bound, without
limitation, by all payments and settlements under the Subject Annuities entered
into by or on behalf of the Cedant, subject in each case to the Cedant’s duty to
discharge its obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
including with respect to the exercise of any defenses, set-offs and
counterclaims to which the Cedant would be entitled with respect to the
Reinsured Liabilities.

the recommendations of the Reinsurer. The Reinsurer will be permitted to provide
recommendations to the Cedant regarding the Discretionary Elements and, if so
provided, the Cedant shall not unreasonably take any actions that contravene
such recommendations and shall promptly incorporate such recommendations to the
extent they comply with applicable Law and the terms of the Subject Annuities;
provided, that it shall be deemed unreasonable for the Cedant to take any
actions that contravene, or to fail to incorporate, any such recommendation to
the extent that such recommendation provides for Discretionary Elements that are

amendment, modification or waiver of any provision or provisions of the Subject

reasonably determines that any such program executed by any of the Cedant’s
distribution channels has occurred, then the Reinsurer may provide notice to the
Cedant of the Reinsurer’s desire to reinsure annuity contracts issued pursuant
to any such program. Upon receipt of the Reinsurer’s notice thereof, the Cedant
shall discuss with the Reinsurer in good faith providing the opportunity for the
Reinsurer to reinsure any annuity contracts that are issued by the Cedant or any
of its Affiliates in replacement of, or in exchange for, a Subject Annuity or a
portion of a Subject Annuity in connection with any such program on terms

the Cedant shall have no obligation to monitor whether any such program is being
executed by any of the Cedant’s distribution channels.

Reconciliation Statement (a “Reconciliation Statement Objection”) prior to the
expiration of the Review Period, then the Reconciliation Statement shall be

(d)    Within ten (10) Business Days of the appointment of the Independent
Accountant, the Cedant shall provide the Independent Accountant with a copy of
the Reconciliation Statement (as modified by any adjustments agreed to in

Cedant shall each prepare and deliver to the Independent Accountant a written
report of such line item or items remaining in dispute, which report shall set
forth the specific dollar amount proposed by such party for each such item or
items and a detailed explanation of the basis and rationale for such party’s
positions.
(e)    The Independent Accountant shall thereafter finally determine the manner
in which such disputed item or items shall be treated in the Reconciliation
Statement and issue a written award including a reasonably detailed accounting
of any required change to the Reconciliation Statement. In making its
determination, the Independent Accountant shall (i) consider only those items
that are (A) identified in the Reconciliation Statement Objection as in dispute
and (B) were not resolved in writing by the Reinsurer and the Cedant, (ii) base
its determination solely on such reports submitted by the Reinsurer and the
Cedant and the Agreed Bases and not on the basis of an independent review,
(iii) not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either the Reinsurer in the Reconciliation Statement Objection
or the Cedant in the Reconciliation Statement, or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either the Reinsurer in the Reconciliation Statement
Objection or the Cedant in the Reconciliation Statement, as applicable, and
(iv) barring exceptional circumstances, make its determination within thirty
(30) days of its appointment; provided that the failure of the Independent
Accountant to make its determination in such thirty (30) day period shall not be
grounds to defend against or object to the enforcement of such determination.
(f)    Each of the Reinsurer and the Cedant agree to enter into a customary
engagement letter with the Independent Accountant. The Reinsurer and the Cedant
shall reasonably cooperate with the Independent Accountant and shall provide,

and documentation, including any actuaries’ or accountants’ work papers or
internal reserving papers, files and models, and make reasonably available to
the Independent Accountant personnel of the Cedant and its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and the Reinsurer and its Affiliates, on the other hand, in each case
that have been involved in the preparation of the Reconciliation Statement;
provided, however, that the independent actuaries or accountants of the
Reinsurer or the Cedant shall not be obligated to make any working papers
available to the Independent Accountant unless and until the Independent
Accountant has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement
relating to such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such independent actuaries or accountants, as applicable. Any such
information and documentation provided by the Reinsurer or the Cedant to the
Independent Accountant shall concurrently be provided to the other party to the
extent not already so provided; provided, however, that the independent
actuaries or accountants of the Reinsurer or the Cedant shall not be obligated
to make any working papers available to the other party unless and until the
other party has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement
relating to such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such independent actuaries or accountants, as applicable. Neither
party shall disclose to the Independent Accountant, and the Independent
Accountant shall not consider for any purpose, any settlement discussions or
settlement offer made by either party with respect to any objection under this
Section 3.05 unless otherwise agreed in writing by both parties.
(g)    The determination by the Independent Accountant of the Actual Initial
Premium and the Actual Ceding Commission shall be final and binding upon the
parties; provided, however, that within three (3) Business Days after the
transmittal of the Independent Accountant’s award, either party may request in
writing to the Independent Accountant, with a copy thereof provided to the other
party in accordance with Section 18.02, with such request solely limited to the
Independent Accountant correcting any clerical, typographical or arithmetic
errors in such award. The other party shall have three (3) Business Days to
respond to the Independent Accountant in writing to such request, with a copy
thereof provided to the other party in accordance with Section 18.02. The
Independent Accountant shall dispose of such request, if no response was
received during such three (3) Business Day period from the other party, within
five (5) Business Days after receiving such request or, if such a response was
received during such period, within three (3) Business Days of its receipt of
such a response. The determinations by the Independent Accountant shall be an
expert determination under Michigan Law governing expert determination and
appraisal proceedings. Either party hereto may petition any court identified in
Section 18.08 to reduce such decision to judgment. One-half of all fees, costs
and expenses of retaining the Independent Accountant shall be borne by the
Reinsurer and one-half of such fees, costs and expenses of retaining the
Independent Accountant shall be borne by the Cedant. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Independent Accountant shall act as an expert, not as an arbitrator, and
neither the determination of the Independent Accountant, nor this agreement to
submit to the determination of the Independent Accountant, shall be subject to
or governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., or any state
arbitration Law or regime.
(h)    The “Initial Premium Adjustment” shall be an amount equal to (i) (A) the
amount of the Actual Initial Premium, as finalized pursuant to the procedures

(ii) (A) the Actual Ceding Commission, as finalized pursuant to the procedures
set forth in this Section 3.05, minus (B) the Estimated Ceding Commission. If
the Initial Premium Adjustment is positive, then the Cedant shall deposit into

Adjustment within five (5) Business Days following the final determination of
the Actual Initial Premium in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 3.05, together with an amount of interest on the Initial Premium
Adjustment calculated at the Interest Rate for the period from the Closing Date
to, but not including, the date of payment. If the Initial Premium Adjustment is
negative, then the Cedant shall be permitted to withdraw from the Funds Withheld
Account an amount of cash or, if sufficient cash is not available in the Funds
Withheld Account, assets with a Fair Market Value equal to the absolute value of
the Initial Premium Adjustment within five (5) Business Days following the final
determination of the Actual Initial Premium in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 3.05, together with an amount of interest on the
absolute value of the Initial Premium Adjustment calculated at the Interest Rate
for the period from the Closing Date to, but not including, the date of payment.

fully paid derivatives for the purpose of hedging the index risk associated with
the Subject Annuities with a derivatives counterparty (each, a “Hedge
Counterparty”) with respect to which the Reinsurer and the Cedant have not
already entered into a Hedge Assignment Agreement, then the Reinsurer shall

this Agreement, according to their Statutory Book Value. In accordance with

investment management agreement in the form attached as Exhibit E (the
“Investment Management Agreement”). If the Cedant and the Reinsurer agree to any
amendments, modifications or changes to the Funds Withheld Investment

such amendments, modifications or changes in writing in accordance with the
terms of the Investment Management Agreement. The Cedant shall not propose any

which has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on
the Cedant or the Funds Withheld Account or (ii) the Investment Manager’s fraud,
gross negligence or willful misconduct in performing or failing to perform any
of its obligations under this Agreement. In the event that the Investment
Manager is removed in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence or
resigns, the Cedant shall appoint a replacement investment manager as designated

any sub-investment manager appointed in accordance with the Investment
Management Agreement) and any licensing fees to the extent solely relating to
the management of the assets maintained in the Funds Withheld Account. The
Cedant shall promptly forward to the Reinsurer any invoice it receives relating
to such costs and expenses.
(d)    The Cedant shall have the right to withdraw cash from the Funds Withheld
Account, and such cash so withdrawn shall be utilized and applied by the Cedant
(or any successor by operation of law of the Cedant, including any liquidator,
rehabilitator, receiver or conservator of the Cedant), without diminution
because of any insolvency, rehabilitation, conservatorship or comparable status
on the part of the Cedant or the Reinsurer, only as follows:
(i)    to pay or reimburse the Cedant for any Benefit Payments paid by the
Cedant;
(ii)    to pay any Net Settlement Amounts in accordance with Section 5.04(a);
and

accordance with Section 5.04(b).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the amount of cash to be withdrawn from the
Funds Withheld Account in accordance with this Section 6.02(d) is less than the
amount of cash maintained in the Funds Withheld Account as of such date, then
the Cedant shall notify the Reinsurer of such shortfall and the Reinsurer shall,
within two (2) Business Days of its receipt of notice from the Cedant, (A)
deposit additional cash into the Funds Withheld Account at least equal to such
shortfall or (B) pay to the Cedant an amount in cash equal to such shortfall.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.02(d), the Cedant
may, subject to and in accordance with Section 5.04(b)(ii), withdraw non-cash
assets from the Funds Withheld Account to pay any Funds Withheld Account
Adjustment to the Reinsurer.

assets, including investment income and other distributions received on such
assets, withdrawn in excess of the actual amounts required in paragraphs (i)
through (iii) immediately above or any amounts that are subsequently determined
not to be due under such paragraphs (such withdrawals, “Funds Withheld Excess
Withdrawals”). The Cedant shall also pay interest on any Funds Withheld Excess
Withdrawals, calculated at the Interest Rate from and including the date of
withdrawal to but excluding the date on which the Funds Withheld Excess
Withdrawal is returned to the Funds Withheld Account. Any Funds Withheld Excess
Withdrawals, including any investment income and other distributions and
interest in respect thereof, shall at all times be held by the Cedant (or any
successor by operation of law of the Cedant, including any liquidator,
rehabilitator, receiver or conservator of the Cedant) in trust for the benefit
of the Reinsurer and shall at all times be maintained separate and apart from
any assets of the Cedant, for the sole purpose of funding the payments and
reimbursements described in this Section 6.02.

respect to the Boxed Assets and the Transferred Notes, allocated to, the Funds
Withheld Account shall be made by the Cedant and shall be (i) based upon the
statutory rules and guidelines and the impairment policy used by the Cedant and
its auditors for purposes of calculating statutory impairments reflected in the
Cedant’s statutory financial statements and (ii) subject to consultation between
the Reinsurer and the Cedant. The Cedant shall promptly notify the Reinsurer in
writing if the Cedant determines that any assets maintained in or, with respect
to the Boxed Assets and the Transferred Notes, allocated to, the Funds Withheld
Account have become impaired for purposes of determining Statutory Book Value.
Such notice shall describe any such assets, the reason for the impairment and
the effect on the Statutory Book Value of such assets. The Cedant shall provide

interfere with the business and operations of the Cedant; provided, further,
however, that the Cedant shall not be required to make available to the
Reinsurer or its Representatives any document or information if the Cedant
determines, in its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable
Law or a contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a non-Affiliated
Person, jeopardize the protection of an attorney-client, attorney work product
or other similar protection, privilege or immunity, or expose such party to
liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information, it being
understood that the Cedant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
waivers or make other arrangements that would enable any such item to be
accessed by the Reinsurer or its Representatives without contravening applicable
Law or obligation, destroying such privilege or exposing the Cedant to such
liability. The Cedant shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to
reasonable follow-up requests with respect to such inspection or audit following
the conclusion of such inspection or audit. Without limitation of the foregoing,

connection with the administration of the Subject Annuities, the Cedant shall
provide (and ensure that such third-party administrator provides) the Reinsurer

third-party administrator to enable the Reinsurer or its Representatives to

extent not inconsistent with the Cedant’s audit rights as respects such
third-party administrator.
Section 7.02    Internal Controls. The Cedant shall establish and maintain an

Representatives of each of the parties is set forth on Schedule 8.02(a)(i),
which First Level Representatives may be changed from time to time upon notice

Representatives shall convene (in person, telephonically or by such other means
as may allow the First Level Representatives to hear and understand each other)
to discuss the Administrative Services performed by the Cedant (or any
third-party administrator or agent) (the “First Level Consultation and
Escalation Procedure”). To the extent any issue, question or concern is
identified by a First Level Representative of either the Cedant or the Reinsurer
during the First Level Consultation and Escalation Procedure, such First Level
Representative shall work in good faith with its counterpart at the other party
to seek to resolve the applicable issue, question or concern. To the extent that
the First Level Representatives of the Cedant and the Reinsurer are unable to
resolve such issue, question or concern within twenty (20) days of the
commencement of the First Level Consultation and Escalation Procedure, as
specified in the immediately preceding sentence,





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





either party may, upon delivery of notice to the other party, elevate the issue,
question or concern to a senior manager of each of the Cedant and the Reinsurer,
as applicable, in each case, with responsibility for administration (each, a
“Second Level Representative”). The initial Second Level Representatives of each
of the parties is set forth on Schedule 8.02(a)(ii), which Second Level
Representatives may be changed from time to time upon delivery of notice to the
other Party pursuant to Section 18.02. Such Second Level Representatives shall

of the type specified in the immediately preceding sentence, or at such other
time as such Second Level Representatives may mutually agree, and shall seek to
resolve such issue, question or concern in an expeditious and equitable manner
(the “Second Level Consultation and Escalation Procedure”). To the extent that
the Second Level Representatives of Cedant and Reinsurer are unable to resolve
such issue, question or concern within ten (10) days of the commencement of the
Second Level Consultation and Escalation Procedure, as specified in the
immediately preceding sentence and such issue, question or concern has resulted
in a pattern and practice of materially deficient performance of the
Administrative Services by the Cedant that has caused or would reasonably be
expected to cause the Reinsurer to sustain economic damages in an aggregate
amount together with economic damages in respect of all issues, questions or
concerns that remain unresolved under this Section 8.02(a) in excess of the
Minimum Threshold Amount, the Reinsurer may withhold the Withheld Expense
Allowance pursuant to Section 4.02.
(b)    If the parties are unable to reach resolution with respect to such
performance of Administrative Services within ten (10) days after the parties
have commenced the Second Level Consultation and Escalation Procedure, then
either party may submit the dispute to a neutral, mutually agreeable third party
that is a current or former officer of a life insurance or life reinsurance
company (other than the parties to this Agreement or their Affiliates) or other
professional with experience in life insurance or reinsurance; provided, that
such professional shall not have performed services for either party or their
respective Affiliates within the previous five (5) years (the “Independent
Expert”). The parties shall instruct the Independent Expert to (i) limit its
review to matters that are the subject of the Second Level Consultation and
Escalation Procedures and not resolved in accordance with Section 8.02(a) and
(ii) make its determination with thirty (30) days after such dispute is
submitted to the Independent Accountant. The decision of such Independent Expert
with respect to any such matters shall be in all cases final and binding on the
parties. The Cedant shall, at its sole cost and expense, as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Independent Expert’s determination thereof, implement
any requirements the Independent Expert determines are necessary in order to
resolve such dispute with respect to such performance of Administrative
Services.
(c)    The fees of such Independent Expert shall be borne equally by the
parties.
(d)    Each party agrees to enter into a customary engagement letter with the
Independent Expert. Each party shall reasonably cooperate with the Independent
Expert and shall provide, upon the request of the Independent Expert, any
non-privileged information and documentation, including any actuaries’ or
accountants’ work papers or internal actuarial or accounting records or
reserving papers, files and models, and make reasonably available to the
Independent Expert applicable personnel; provided, however, that the independent
actuaries or accountants of each party shall not be obligated to make any
working papers available to the Independent Expert unless and until the
Independent Expert has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless
agreement relating to such access to working papers in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to such independent actuaries or accountants, as
applicable. Any such information and documentation provided by the parties to
the Independent Expert shall concurrently be provided to the other party to the
extent not already so provided; provided, however, that the independent
actuaries or accountants of each party shall not be obligated to make any
working papers available to the other party unless and until the other party has
signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement relating to such
access to working papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such
independent actuaries or accountants, as applicable. Without limitation of the
foregoing, in connection with the any such dispute relating to any of the
foregoing, each party shall provide, and shall cause its Affiliates to provide,
to the other party, upon the request of such other party, reasonable access to
the Cedant Books and Records or the Reinsurer Books and Records (as applicable)
and all work papers and supporting detail prepared by such party and its
Representatives and advisors in connection with such dispute.

arbitration or defense of any Contested Claim, (ii) the Reinsurer will have no

Claim and (iii) the Reinsurer shall discharge its liability with respect to any
Contested Claim by paying to the Cedant the amount of such Contested Claim as
originally presented to the Cedant.

compromise, litigation, arbitration or defense of any Contested Claim by
delivering written notice thereof to the Cedant within fifteen (15) Business
Days following the Reinsurer’s receipt of notice of such Contested Claim. If the

litigation, arbitration or defense of any Contested Claim, (i) the Cedant will
promptly advise the Reinsurer of all significant developments, including notice
of legal or arbitral proceedings (including consumer complaints or Actions by
Governmental Authorities) initiated in connection with such Contested Claim,

contest, compromise, litigation, arbitration or defense of a Contested Claim,
and will share in the reduction of liability in the same proportion, and (iii)
if the Cedant obtains any recoveries in respect of a Contested Claim paid by it

documents that the Reinsurer may reasonably request in connection with its
review of such Regulatory Action, other than any such files, documents and other

Investments on deposit in the OC Account (as reflected in the Reinsurer
Quarterly Asset Report for such Quarterly Accounting Period) is greater than the
Required Trust Balance (as reflected in the Required Balance Statement for such
Quarterly Accounting Period), then the Reinsurer may, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Trust Agreement, withdraw assets from the OC Account
with an aggregate Statutory Book Value not greater than the excess determined
pursuant to this Section 9.03(b).
Section 9.04    OC Account Substitutions. In addition to the withdrawal rights
set forth above, the Reinsurer shall be permitted at any time to substitute all
or any part of the assets in the OC Account with other OC Account Permitted
Investments having an aggregate Statutory Book Value equal to or exceeding the
aggregate Statutory Book Value of the substituted assets; provided, however,
that at the time of any such substitution, the Fair Market Value of any OC
Account Permitted Investment being deposited into the OC Account in connection
with any substitution shall be equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value of
the substituted asset.
Section 9.05    Letters of Credit. The Reinsurer shall be permitted to satisfy
all or any portion of its overcollateralization requirement hereunder by
obtaining one or more letters of credit from any LOC Provider for the benefit of
the Cedant in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Cedant (each, a “Letter of
Credit”). Subject to Sections 9.06 and 9.08, all costs, expenses and fees
associated with Letters of Credit shall be borne by the Reinsurer. Cedant shall
not be permitted to draw upon a Letter of Credit except to the extent that both
(i) the Reinsurer fails to pay any amounts due under this Agreement within ten
(10) days following its receipt of written notice of non-payment from the Cedant
and (ii) the sum of (A) the then-current Fair Market Value of the assets held in
the OC Account plus (B) any excess withdrawals from the OC Account in excess of
the amount permitted under this Agreement has been reduced to zero (0). In the
event the Cedant is so permitted to draw upon a Letter of Credit, any such draw
shall be pro rata among all Letters of Credit; provided that if any LOC Provider
fails to fund its pro rata portion of such permitted draw (the “Unfunded LOC
Amount”), the Cedant shall be permitted to draw the Unfunded LOC Amount pro rata
among the Letters of Credit from other LOC Providers.
Section 9.06    Letter of Credit Reductions. Subject to Section 9.08, upon the
request of the Reinsurer, the Cedant shall cooperate with any reasonable request
by the Reinsurer to reduce the face amount of any Letter of Credit, on a
quarterly basis following the delivery of the Required Balance Statement, and
shall promptly take such actions as may be reasonably required by any LOC
Provider, including delivering any certificate, providing any consent or
acknowledgement and returning any then-current Letter of Credit to the
applicable LOC Provider in exchange for a new Letter of Credit reflecting such
reduced amount, to enable such reduction; provided, that if the Cedant does not
take such actions reasonably required by an LOC Provider to enable such
reduction, then the Cedant shall reimburse the Reinsurer for any fees and
commissions payable by the Reinsurer to any LOC Provider with respect to a
Letter of Credit that exceed the amount of fees and commissions that would have
been payable by the Reinsurer to such LOC Provider with respect to such Letter
of Credit if it had been so reduced; provided, further, that the Cedant shall
not be required to take any such actions if, after giving effect to such
reduction, the Statutory Book Value of the assets maintained in the OC Account
would be less than the Required Trust Balance.
Section 9.07    Excess Draws. The Cedant shall promptly return to the applicable
LOC Provider any amounts drawn on a Letter of Credit in excess of the actual
amounts permitted in Section 9.05 or any amounts that are subsequently
determined not to be due under Section 9.05 (“Letter of Credit Excess Draws”);
provided, that the Cedant shall return such Letter of Credit Excess Draws to the
Reinsurer if the Reinsurer notifies the Cedant that the Reinsurer has repaid
such Letter of Credit Excess Draws to such LOC Provider and provides evidence of
such repayment reasonably satisfactory to the Cedant. The Cedant shall also pay
interest on any Letter of Credit Excess Draws together with interest accrued at
the Interest Rate from and including the date of such Letter of Credit Excess
Draw to but excluding the date of return to the Reinsurer. Any amounts drawn on
a Letter of Credit, including any Letter of Credit Excess Draws, shall be held
by the Cedant or any successor in interest of the Cedant in trust for the
benefit of the Reinsurer and shall at all times be maintained separate and apart
from any assets of the Cedant, for the sole purposes described in Section 9.05.
Section 9.08    Additional Letter of Credit Amount.
(a)    The Reinsurer shall obtain, within five (5) Business Days following the
Closing Date, one or more Letters of Credit for the benefit of the Cedant in an
aggregate face amount at least equal to the Additional Letter of Credit Amount
in order to provide collateral in respect of the Reinsurer’s obligations to the
Cedant in respect of the Reinsured Liabilities. Thereafter, the Reinsurer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain such Letters of Credit in an
aggregate face amount at least equal to the Additional Letter of Credit Amount.
The Cedant shall be permitted to reduce the Additional Letter of Credit Amount
on a quarterly basis by providing the Reinsurer written notice thereof no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the end of each Quarterly Accounting
Period, which reduction shall be effective as of the first day of the
immediately succeeding Quarterly Accounting Period. In connection with any such
request, the Cedant shall cooperate with the Reinsurer to reduce any Letters of
Credit supporting the Additional Letter of Credit Amount in accordance with
Section 9.06.
(b)    In the event that there has been a reduction to the Additional Letter of
Credit Amount in accordance with Section 9.08(a), the Cedant shall be permitted
to request the Reinsurer to procure one or more Letters of Credit in an
aggregate face amount up to the excess of the Maximum Additional Letter of
Credit Amount over the outstanding Additional Letter of Credit Amount (the
amount of increase so requested, the “Additional LOC Increase Amount”) by
providing the Reinsurer written notice thereof (an “Additional LOC Increase
Request”). Upon receipt of any Additional LOC Increase Request, the Reinsurer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as promptly as reasonably
practicable one or more additional Letters of Credit to support the Additional
LOC Increase Amount at a cost acceptable to the Cedant; provided the Reinsurer
shall not enter into any Letter of Credit supporting the Additional LOC Increase
Amount without the prior written consent of the Cedant. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the Additional Letter of Credit Amount exceed the
Maximum Additional Letter of Credit Amount.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





(c)    The Cedant shall reimburse the Reinsurer on a quarterly basis, in
accordance with Section 5.04, for the Cedant’s share of the fees and expenses
payable by the Reinsurer in connection with any Letters of Credit supporting the
Additional Letter of Credit Amount (the “Additional LOC Costs”). The Additional
LOC Costs with respect to any Quarterly Accounting Period shall be an amount
equal to (i) with respect to all Additional Letters of Credit other than those
supporting the Additional LOC Increase Amount, seventy-five (75) basis points of
the Additional Letter of Credit Amount divided by four (4) and (ii) with respect
to the Letters of Credit supporting the Additional LOC Increase Amount, the fees
and expenses payable by the Reinsurer in connection with such Letters of Credit.
ARTICLE X
REINSURANCE CREDIT; TRIGGERING EVENTS
Section 10.01    Credit for Reinsurance. The parties intend that the Cedant be
able to obtain full statutory financial statement credit for the reinsurance
provided by this Agreement throughout the entire term of this Agreement. The
Reinsurer shall promptly notify the Cedant in writing of any event with respect
to the Reinsurer (including any change in the ratings of the Reinsurer) or
change in its Permits that, if continuing as of the end of any financial
statement period, would be reasonably likely to result in the Cedant being
unable to take full statutory financial statement credit in the Cedant
Domiciliary State for the reinsurance provided by this Agreement. The Cedant
shall promptly notify the Reinsurer in writing of the occurrence of any other
event or circumstance that has caused or will cause the Cedant to no longer
receive such credit for reinsurance, which notice shall describe in reasonable
detail the event or development requiring such notice. For purposes hereof, any
event, change or other circumstance that has caused or will cause the Cedant to
no longer receive such credit for reinsurance shall hereinafter be referred to
as a “Reinsurance Credit Event.” Upon the occurrence of any Reinsurance Credit
Event, the Reinsurer, at its own expense, shall, within twenty (20) Business
Days following the occurrence of such event or, if earlier, five (5) Business
Days prior to the end of the calendar quarter during which such event occurs,
take all steps necessary to comply with all applicable Laws so as to permit the
Cedant to obtain full credit for the reinsurance provided by this Agreement in
the Cedant Domiciliary State throughout the entire term of this Agreement to the
extent credit is not otherwise available under applicable Law, including the
posting of letters of credit, establishing a credit for reinsurance trust,
depositing additional assets in the Funds Withheld Account or providing other
acceptable security in accordance with the terms hereof, it being understood
that the Reinsurer shall have the sole discretion to elect among the methods
available to it in order to maintain such credit for reinsurance; provided,
however, that if such event occurs within five (5) Business Days prior to the
end of a calendar quarter, then the Reinsurer shall take such action not later
than the earlier of two (2) Business Days following the occurrence of such event
and the end of such calendar quarter. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, if any such event is the result of a downgrade of the Reinsurer’s
ratings, then the Reinsurer shall adjust the amount of security provided
hereunder to the extent necessary to satisfy the aggregate minimum collateral
requirements that are necessary for the Cedant to cure the applicable
Reinsurance Credit Event, which aggregate minimum collateral requirements as of
the date hereof are set forth on Schedule 10.01. The Reinsurer and the Cedant
shall cooperate in good faith to effectuate this provision. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Section 10.01 to the contrary, in the event that (a)
there is a repeal of or amendment or other modification to the provisions of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Pub.L. 111-203, H.R.
4173) that would authorize a Governmental Authority in any jurisdiction of the
United States where the Cedant is licensed to transact business (other than the
State of New York) to apply the applicable rules for credit for reinsurance in
such jurisdiction to the Cedant and (b) the Cedant reasonably determines
following consultation with the Reinsurer that it is obligated under applicable
Law to comply with such rules in order to receive statutory financial statement
credit in any such jurisdiction, then the Reinsurer shall take all steps
necessary to enable the Cedant to obtain full statutory financial statement
credit for the reinsurance provided by this Agreement in any such jurisdiction
in addition to, and to the same extent as, the Cedant Domiciliary State.
Section 10.02    Triggering Event. For purposes of the Agreement, “Triggering

report delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(c) is less than one hundred and
thirty-five percent (135%) as of the end of any Solvency Ratio Reporting Period
(an “ECR Triggering Event”) and such ECR Triggering Event is continuing at the
end of the next succeeding calendar quarter or (ii) the Reinsurer’s RBC Ratio as
set forth in the report delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(c) is less than two
hundred and fifty percent (250%) as of the end of any Solvency Ratio Reporting
Period (an “RBC Triggering Event”) and such RBC Triggering Event is continuing
at the end of the next succeeding calendar quarter;
(c)    a Reinsurance Credit Event occurs and is continuing (i) for more than
twenty (20) Business Days following the occurrence of such Reinsurance Credit
Event or, if earlier, (ii) (A) subject to clause (B), five (5) Business Days
prior to the end of the calendar quarter during which such Reinsurance Credit
Event occurred or (B) in the event that the Reinsurance Credit Event occurs
within the five (5) Business Days prior to the end of the calendar quarter
during which such Reinsurance Credit Event occurred, the earlier of (x) two (2)
Business Days following the occurrence of such Reinsurance Credit Event and (y)
the end of such calendar quarter;
(d)    the Reinsurer fails to fund the OC Account for any material undisputed
amounts required to be deposited therein by the Reinsurer in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement or the Trust Agreement or to pay the Cedant any material
undisputed amount due under this Agreement or the Trust Agreement and such
failure continues for thirty (30) days after written notice thereof from the
Cedant;
(e)    the Reinsurer’s breach of its covenants and obligations under Section
10.06; and
(f)    any Comparable Triggering Event.
Section 10.03    Notice of Triggering Event; Required Trust Balance Top Up.

(b)    Within five (5) Business Days following the occurrence of a Triggering
Event, if the aggregate Statutory Book Value of the OC Account Permitted
Investments on deposit in the OC Account as of the date of such Triggering Event
is less than the Required Trust Balance then in effect as a result of such
Triggering Event, then the Reinsurer shall deposit OC Account Permitted
Investments in the OC Account with an aggregate Statutory Book Value at least
equal to such shortfall.
Section 10.04    Cure of Triggering Event. A Triggering Event shall cease to be
continuing upon such time as such Triggering Event is cured by the Reinsurer as
set forth in this Section 10.04. Upon any such cure by the Reinsurer, the Cedant
shall deliver promptly deliver to the Trustee a “Triggering Event Cure
Certification” (as defined in the Trust Agreement). Following the occurrence of
a Triggering Event, such Triggering Event shall be deemed cured, as applicable,
upon the occurrence of the following, as applicable:

deliver the Notice of Cessation of Exclusive Control to the Securities
Intermediary pursuant to the terms of the Security and Control Agreement.
Section 10.05    ECR Ratio; RBC Ratio.
(a)    As used in this Agreement, (i) the term “ECR Ratio” means the Reinsurer’s
available statutory economic capital and surplus as a percentage of its enhanced
capital requirement under the Bermuda Insurance Act or the equivalent measure at
the applicable date of determination as determined under the applicable Law of
the Reinsurer’s jurisdiction of domicile then in effect and using the
Reinsurer’s existing methodologies in respect of the calculation thereof and
(ii) the term “RBC Ratio” means the Reinsurer’s company action level risk based
capital ratio or the equivalent measure at the applicable date of determination,
as determined using the Reinsurer’s methodologies used to calculate the
Reinsurer’s RBC Ratio as publicly disclosed by Athene Holding Ltd. in its annual
Form 10-K for the immediately preceding calendar year.
(b)    Within sixty (60) days following the end of each calendar quarter (each,
a “Solvency Ratio Reporting Period”), the Reinsurer shall provide the Cedant
with (i) an estimate of the Reinsurer’s ECR Ratio and (ii) an estimate of the
Reinsurer’s RBC Ratio, each together with reasonable supporting detail in

relating to the factors, formulae and framework used to calculate ECR Ratios or
RBC Ratios from those in effect at the Effective Time, the parties will work
together in good faith to adjust the ECR Ratios or RBC Ratios, as applicable,
reflected in the Triggering Event set forth in Section 10.02(b) and Recapture
Events set forth in Section 13.04(a) to ensure that they are reasonably
equivalent to those in effect as of the Effective Time, including in respect of
the buffer between such ratios and regulatory requirements.
Section 10.06    Comparable Triggering Events.
(a)    In the event that the Reinsurer consummates a reinsurance transaction
with a third party that is reasonably comparable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (a “Comparable Transaction”) in which it agrees
to a collateral or recapture triggering event related to its financial strength
or claims-paying ability rating assigned to the Reinsurer by a nationally
recognized statistical ratings organization (a “Comparable Triggering Event”),
such Comparable Triggering Event shall automatically be deemed to be included in
this Agreement, as set forth in Section 10.02(f) and Section 13.04(g), as
applicable, without any action by the parties hereto required. The Reinsurer
shall promptly notify the Cedant in the event that it consummates a Comparable

ERRORS AND OMISSIONS
Section 11.01    OversightsSection 11.01    Oversights2. Inadvertent delays,
oversights, errors or omissions made in connection with this Agreement or any
transaction hereunder shall not relieve either party from any liability which
would have attached had such delay, error or omission not occurred. The parties
shall nevertheless cooperate in good faith to rectify any such delay, oversight,
error or omission as soon as practicable after discovery. Subject to the
foregoing, if the failure of either party to comply with any provision of this
Agreement is unintentional or the result of a misunderstanding or oversight, the
parties shall cause such failure to be promptly rectified such that both parties
shall be restored as closely as possible to the positions that they would have
occupied had such error or oversight not occurred. Nothing in this Section 11.01
shall reduce the obligation of the Reinsurer with respect to any Reinsurer
Extra-Contractual Obligations or the Cedant with respect to any Cedant
Extra-Contractual Obligations.

successor on the basis of the liability of the Cedant under the Subject
Annuities reinsured hereunder without diminution because of any insolvency,
rehabilitation, conservatorship or comparable status of the Cedant, except to
the extent this Agreement specifically provides for another payee of such
reinsurance in the event of an insolvency of the Cedant.

of the Cedant, the liquidator, receiver or statutory successor of the Cedant
shall give written notice of the pendency of a claim against the Cedant in
connection with the Subject Annuities within a reasonable period of time after
such claim is filed in the Insolvency Proceedings and that, during the pendency
of such claim, the Reinsurer may investigate such claim and interpose, at its
own expense, in the proceeding where such claim is to be adjudicated, any
defense or defenses that it may deem available to the Cedant or its liquidator,
receiver or statutory successor. It is further understood that the expense thus
incurred by the Reinsurer shall be chargeable, subject to court approval,

proportionate share of the benefit which may accrue to the Cedant solely as a
result of the defense undertaken by the Reinsurer.
Section 12.02    Insolvency of Reinsurer. In the event of the insolvency of the
Reinsurer, all amounts due but not paid to the Reinsurer by the Cedant on such

under this Agreement may be retained by the Cedant and set off against the
amounts due by the Reinsurer under this Agreement, whether they were due before

Reinsurer BEAT Event or (B) a BEAT Event that is not a Reinsurer BEAT Event and
in respect of which the Reinsurer has breached its obligations set forth in

Closing Date, the Cedant shall deliver to the Reinsurer (i) a statement (such
statement, the “Estimated Recapture Payment Statement”) prepared in accordance
with Cedant SAP and in the same form as the pro forma recapture report in
respect of the Reinsured Liabilities ceded hereunder set forth on
Schedule 14.01(a) (the “Pro Forma Recapture Report”) setting forth the Cedant’s
estimate of the Recapture Payment Amount (as calculated in part based upon the
most recent Cedant Quarterly Report delivered pursuant to Article V) as of the
Recapture Effective Time (the “Estimated Recapture Payment”), (ii) a report
(such report, the “Estimated Recapture Asset Report”) prepared in accordance
with Cedant SAP, setting forth the Statutory Book Value of the assets in the
Funds Withheld Account (as calculated based in part upon the most recent Cedant
Quarterly Report delivered pursuant to Article V) and (iii) a Cedant Quarterly
Report setting forth the information required to be reported therein as of the

(b)    On the Recapture Closing Date, (i) the Net Settlement Amount and the
Funds Withheld Account Adjustment set forth in the Estimated Recapture Payment
Statement will be paid in accordance with Sections 5.04(a) and (b),
respectively, and (ii) after giving effect to the payment of such Net Settlement
Amount and Funds Withheld Account Adjustment, an amount equal to the Estimated
Recapture Payment shall be due from the Reinsurer to the Cedant. The Cedant
shall withdraw from the Funds Withheld Account assets with an estimated
aggregate Statutory Book Value equal to the Estimated Recapture Payment. If the
aggregate estimated Statutory Book Value assets in the Funds Withheld Account as

Reinsurer shall have sixty (60) days (the “Recapture Review Period”) to review
such Proposed Terminal Settlement Statement, Proposed Recapture Payment
Statement, Proposed Recapture Asset Report and Proposed Reinsurer Asset Report.
In connection with the review of the Proposed Terminal Settlement Statement,
Proposed Recapture Payment Statement, Proposed Recapture Asset Report and
Proposed Reinsurer Asset Report, the Cedant shall provide, and shall cause its
Affiliates to provide, the Reinsurer and its Representatives, upon the request
of the Reinsurer, reasonable access to the Cedant Books and Records and all work
papers and supporting detail prepared by the Cedant and its Representatives and
advisors in connection with the preparation of the Proposed Terminal Settlement

and the Proposed Reinsurer Asset Report and make reasonably available to the
Reinsurer and its Representatives personnel of the Cedant and its Affiliates
that have been involved in the preparation of the Proposed Terminal Settlement
Statement, Proposed Recapture Payment Statement, Proposed Recapture Asset Report
or the Proposed Reinsurer Asset Report. If the Reinsurer has accepted the

Proposed Recapture Asset Report and Proposed Reinsurer Asset Report in writing
or has not given written notice to the Cedant setting forth any objection to the
Proposed Terminal Settlement Statement, Proposed Recapture Payment Statement,
Proposed Recapture Asset Report or Proposed Reinsurer Asset Report (a “Statement
of Objection”) prior to the expiration of the Recapture Review Period, then the
Proposed Terminal Settlement Statement, Proposed Recapture Payment Statement,
Proposed Recapture Asset Report and Proposed Reinsurer Asset Report shall be
final and binding upon the parties. If the Reinsurer delivers a Statement of
Objection to the Proposed Terminal Settlement Statement, the Proposed





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Recapture Payment Statement, the Proposed Recapture Asset Report or the Proposed
Reinsurer Asset Report prior to the expiration of the Recapture Review Period,
then the parties shall attempt to amicably resolve any such objection within
thirty (30) days following receipt by the Cedant of the Statement of Objection.
(b)    If any such objections are resolved in writing by the parties, then such
resolutions shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be
incorporated into the Final Terminal Settlement Statement, Final Recapture
Payment Statement, Final Recapture Asset Report or Final Reinsurer Asset Report,
as applicable. If any such objections are not resolved in writing within thirty
(30) days following receipt by the Reinsurer of the Proposed Recapture Payment
Statement, the Proposed Recapture Asset Report and the Proposed Reinsurer Asset
Report, then the parties shall submit any such objections which remain
unresolved to the Independent Accountant.
(c)    Within ten (10) Business Days of the appointment of the Independent
Accountant, the Cedant shall provide the Independent Accountant with a copy of
the Proposed Terminal Settlement Statement, Proposed Recapture Payment
Statement, Proposed Recapture Asset Report or Proposed Reinsurer Asset Report,
as applicable (in each case as modified by any adjustments agreed to in writing
by the parties pursuant to Section 14.03(b)), and the Reinsurer and the Cedant
shall each prepare and deliver to the Independent Accountant a written report of
such line item or items remaining in dispute, which report shall set forth the
specific dollar amount proposed by such party for each such item or items and a
detailed explanation of the basis and rationale for such party’s positions.
(d)    The Independent Accountant shall thereafter finally determine the manner
in which such disputed item or items shall be treated in the Final Terminal
Settlement Statement, Final Recapture Payment Statement, Final Recapture Asset
Report or Proposed Reinsurer Asset Report, as applicable, and issue a written
award including a reasonably detailed accounting of any required change to the
Proposed Terminal Settlement Statement, Proposed Recapture Payment Statement,
Proposed Recapture Asset Report or Proposed Reinsurer Asset Report, as
applicable. In making its determination, the Independent Accountant shall
(i) consider only those items that are (A) identified in the Statement of
Objection as in dispute and (B) were not resolved in writing by the Reinsurer
and the Cedant, (ii) base its determination solely on such reports submitted by
the Reinsurer and the Cedant and Cedant SAP and not on the basis of an
independent review, (iii) not assign a value to any item greater than the
greatest value for such item claimed by either the Reinsurer in the Statement of
Objection or the Cedant in the Proposed Terminal Settlement Statement, Proposed
Recapture Payment Statement, Proposed Recapture Asset Report or Proposed
Reinsurer Asset Report, as applicable, or less than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either the Reinsurer in the Statement of Objection or the Cedant
in the Proposed Terminal Settlement Statement, Proposed Recapture Payment
Statement, Proposed Recapture Asset Report or Proposed Reinsurer Asset Report,
as applicable, and (iv) barring exceptional circumstances, make its
determination within thirty (30) days of its appointment; provided that the
failure of the Independent Accountant to make its determination in such thirty
(30) day period shall not be grounds to defend against or object to the
enforcement of such determination.
(e)    Each of the Reinsurer and the Cedant agree to enter into a customary
engagement letter with the Independent Accountant. The Reinsurer and the Cedant
shall reasonably cooperate with the Independent Accountant and shall provide,
upon the request of the Independent Accountant, any non-privileged information
and documentation, including any actuaries’ or accountants’ work papers or
internal reserving papers, files and models, and make reasonably available to
the Independent Accountant personnel of the Cedant and its Affiliates, on the
one hand, and the Reinsurer and its Affiliates, on the other hand, in each case
that have been involved in the preparation of the Proposed Terminal Settlement
Statement, the Proposed Recapture Payment Statement, the Proposed Recapture
Asset Report, the Proposed Reinsurer Asset Report or the Statement of Objection,
as applicable; provided, however, that the independent actuaries or accountants
of the Reinsurer or the Cedant shall not be obligated to make any working papers
available to the Independent Accountant unless and until the Independent
Accountant has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement
relating to such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such independent actuaries or accountants, as applicable. Any such
information and documentation provided by the Reinsurer or the Cedant to the
Independent Accountant shall concurrently be provided to the other party to the
extent not already so provided; provided, however, that the independent
actuaries or accountants of the Reinsurer or the Cedant shall not be obligated
to make any working papers available to the other party unless and until the
other party has signed a customary confidentiality and hold harmless agreement
relating to such access to working papers in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such independent actuaries or accountants, as applicable. Neither
party shall disclose to the Independent Accountant, and the Independent
Accountant shall not consider for any purpose, any settlement discussions or
settlement offer made by either party with respect to any objection under this
Section 14.03 unless otherwise agreed in writing by both parties.
(f)    The determination by the Independent Accountant shall be final and
binding upon the parties and shall be deemed the Final Terminal Settlement
Statement, the Final Recapture Payment Statement, the Final Recapture Asset
Report or the Final Reinsurer Asset Report, as applicable; provided, however,
that within three (3) Business Days after the transmittal of the Independent
Accountant’s award, either party may request in writing to the Independent
Accountant, with a copy thereof provided to the other party in accordance with
Section 18.02, with such request solely limited to the Independent Accountant
correcting any clerical, typographical or arithmetic errors in such award. The
other party shall have three (3) Business Days to respond to the Independent
Accountant in writing to such request, with a copy thereof provided to the other
party in accordance with Section 18.02. The Independent Accountant shall dispose
of such request, if no response was received during such three (3) Business Day
period from the other party, within five (5) Business Days after receiving such
request or, if such a response was received during such period, within three
(3) Business Days of its receipt of such a response. The determinations by the
Independent Accountant shall be an expert determination under Michigan Law
governing expert determination and appraisal proceedings. Either party hereto
may petition any court identified in Section 18.08 to reduce such decision to
judgment. One-half of all fees, costs and expenses of retaining the Independent
Accountant shall be borne by the Reinsurer and one-half of such fees, costs and
expenses of retaining the Independent Accountant shall be borne by the Cedant.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Independent Accountant shall act as an expert,
not as an arbitrator, and neither the determination of the Independent
Accountant, nor this agreement to submit to the determination of the Independent
Accountant, shall be subject to or governed by the Federal Arbitration Act,
9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., or any state arbitration Law or regime.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





(g)    The “Recapture Payment Adjustment” shall be an amount equal to (i) plus
(ii) plus (iii), where the values for (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be determined as
follows:
(i)    the Final Recapture Payment Amount minus Estimated Recapture Payment
Amount;
(ii)    the Statutory Book Value of the Funds Withheld Account assets withdrawn
from the Funds Withheld Account by the Cedant in accordance with Section
14.01(b) as set forth in the Estimated Recapture Asset Report minus the
Statutory Book Value of the Funds Withheld Account assets withdrawn from the
Funds Withheld Account by Cedant in accordance with Section 14.01(b) as set
forth in the Final Recapture Asset Report; and
(iii)    the Fair Market Value set forth in the Proposed Reinsurer Asset Report
minus the Fair Market Value set forth in the Final Reinsurer Asset Report.
(h)    No later than five (5) Business Days after the determination of the
Recapture Payment Adjustment pursuant to this Section 14.03, (i) if the
Recapture Payment Adjustment is positive, then the Reinsurer shall transfer cash
in an amount equal to such positive amount plus interest on such amount accrued
at the Interest Rate from the Recapture Closing Date to the date of payment and
(ii) if the Recapture Payment Adjustment is negative, then the Cedant shall
transfer cash in an amount equal to the absolute value of such negative amount
plus interest on such amount accrued at the Interest Rate on such amount from
the Recapture Closing Date to the date of payment.
(i)    All cash required to be transferred pursuant to this Article XIV shall be
transferred by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
ARTICLE XV
TAX
Section 15.01    Excise and Withholding Tax.
(a)    The Cedant and the Reinsurer agree that any excise Tax, including under
section 4371 of the Code or withholding Tax, including under sections 1441 or
1471 of the Code that, in each case, is required by Law (or in respect of which
the Cedant receives notice that such Tax has been assessed) in respect of any
amount paid to or accrued by the Reinsurer under this Agreement shall be
deducted or withheld from the applicable payment (or settled in accordance with
Article V), and any such amount shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Reinsurer. The Reinsurer shall indemnify
the Cedant for any excise or withholding Taxes assessed in respect of amounts
paid to or accrued by the Reinsurer under this Agreement, including interest and
penalties imposed in connection with such Taxes, but excluding any interest and
penalties imposed that are attributable to the Cedant’s failure to pay when due
any such Taxes that it has deducted or withheld from the Reinsurer. Any refunds
of such amounts shall be for the Reinsurer’s account. Cedant shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such refunds, provided that the
Reinsurer shall reimburse Cedant for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Cedant in seeking such refunds and provide Cedant with such information and
cooperation as the Cedant reasonably requests in connection therewith.
(b)    The Reinsurer has, on or before the date of this Agreement, delivered to
the Cedant (i) a correct, complete and executed W-8BEN-E establishing exemption
from withholding under Section 1471 of the Code and certifying that the
Reinsurer is a resident of the United Kingdom within the meaning of the income
tax treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom (the “Tax Treaty”)
and meets the limitation on benefits requirements of the Tax Treaty as of the
date hereof, and (ii) a copy of the closing agreement entered into between the
Reinsurer and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) pursuant to IRS
Revenue Procedure 2003-78, as amended by IRS Revenue Procedure 2015-46 (the
“Closing Agreement”), which Closing Agreement the Cedant is permitted to rely
upon for purposes of section 3 of IRS Revenue Procedure 2003-78. The Reinsurer
represents that, as of the date of this Agreement, the Reinsurer is eligible for
exemption from excise tax imposed under section 4371 of the Code pursuant to the
Tax Treaty with respect to payments of premium pursuant to this Agreement. The
Reinsurer shall provide or otherwise make available updated tax forms and
documentation, upon the Cedant’s reasonable request. In the event that the
Reinsurer determines that it fails to qualify for exemption from excise tax
pursuant to the Tax Treaty and the Closing Agreement, Reinsurer shall promptly
notify Cedant in writing.
(c)    The Cedant acknowledges and agrees that, assuming the Reinsurer delivers
the certifications and copy of the Closing Agreement and based on Reinsurer’s
representation in Section 15.01(b), the payments contemplated by this Agreement
are not subject to any excise or withholding tax as of the date hereof. If the
Cedant determines that a deduction or withholding for any Tax is required under
Law, (i) the Cedant shall promptly notify the Reinsurer of such determination,
(ii) the Cedant and the Reinsurer shall discuss in good faith whether any such
excise or withholding Tax is legally required to be withheld or deducted, (iii)
in the event a deduction or withholding is legally required, the Cedant and the
Reinsurer shall negotiate in good faith to determine mutually acceptable changes
to the terms of this Agreement (and any related transaction agreements), the
structure of the reinsurance contemplated by this Agreement, the identity of the
Reinsurer under this Agreement or any other commercially reasonable changes
within the control of the parties, in each case, that reduce or eliminate the
amount of such excise or withholding Tax required to be so withheld, provided
that in all cases the Cedant shall be entitled to withhold and pay any excise or
withholding Tax to the extent required by applicable Law.





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Section 15.02    Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax.
(a)    For purposes of this Section 15.02, “Control” as used in the defined term
“Affiliate” shall be presumed to exist only if any Person, directly or
indirectly, owns, controls, holds the power to vote or holds proxies
representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the voting securities of any other
Person.
(b)    The Reinsurer represents that, as of the date hereof, to its knowledge,
the Reinsurer, AGM and their Affiliates do not own any stock or other equity
interests in Brooke Holdco, either directly or by attribution under Section
59A(g)(3) of the Code (but in making such determination under Section 59A(g)(3)
of the Code, ignoring all attribution under Section 318 of the Code, other than
Section 318(a)(2)).
(c)    Each of the Reinsurer and the Cedant represents that, as of the date
hereof, to its knowledge, the Reinsurer is not a “related person” within the
meaning of Section 59A(g)(1) of the Code with respect to the Cedant.
(d)    For so long as this Agreement is in effect, the Reinsurer shall not, and
shall not permit its Affiliates, or permit any of AGM or its Affiliates when
acting on behalf of Reinsurer or its Affiliates, to: (A) acquire additional
shares of stock or other equity interests in Brooke Holdco, Prudential or the
registered issuer in any IPO involving Brooke Holdco, that when taken together
with the shares of Brooke Holdco acquired pursuant to the Investment Agreement,
would cause the Reinsurer or its Affiliates to own (directly or by attribution
under Section 59A(g)(3) of the Code), in the aggregate, stock or other equity
interests possessing 24% or more of the voting power or the value of Brooke
Holdco or (B) other than the transactions contemplated by the Investment
Agreement, make any investment, or enter into any transaction, (including
transactions entered into and investments made pursuant to the Investment
Management Agreement) if at the time the Reinsurer, AGM or their Affiliates
become bound to make such investment or enter into such transaction, the
Reinsurer, AGM or such Affiliate has actual knowledge that such investment or
transaction would cause the Reinsurer to be treated as a Related Party with
respect to the Cedant, including, in the case of investments in an entity
managed by AGM or its Affiliates, actual knowledge after reasonable review of
information actually within the possession of Reinsurer or AGM regarding such
potential investment.
(e)    In the event that the Cedant or the Reinsurer reasonably believes the
Reinsurer is, or is reasonably likely to be treated as, a Related Party with
respect to the Cedant that would require the Cedant (or with the passage of time
will require the Cedant) to make a material payment of a base erosion minimum
tax amount (as defined under Section 59A(b) of the Code) in respect of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the Cedant or its Affiliates, or the
Reinsurer or its Affiliates, as applicable, shall promptly provide the other
party notice of such conclusion and the basis therefor.
(f)    Following receipt of the notice provided by a party in Section 15.02(e),
the Reinsurer and the Cedant shall (i) work together in good faith to determine
(A) whether the Reinsurer is a Related Party with respect to the Cedant, and (B)
whether the structure or ownership interests or investments of the Reinsurer,
the Cedant or their Affiliates can be altered or the reinsurance arrangements
can be restructured or any other action can be taken that could reasonably be
expected to reduce the amount of the base erosion minimum tax amount imposed on
the Cedant under Section 59A of the Code to an immaterial amount or cause the
Reinsurer not to be treated as a Related Party with respect to the Cedant, and
(ii) (A) use, (B) cause each of its Affiliates to use, and (C) in the case of
Reinsurer, cause AGM and its Affiliates to use, commercially reasonable efforts
to carry out mitigation steps identified in sub-clause (B) of clause (i) hereof
as being reasonably likely to reduce the amount of the base erosion minimum tax
amount imposed on the Cedant under Section 59A of the Code to an immaterial
amount or cause the Reinsurer not to be treated as a Related Party with respect
to the Cedant.
(g)    The failure to take any action required pursuant to this Section 15.02
shall not constitute a default or acceleration of any obligations of the other
party under this Agreement, and the sole remedy of the Cedant or the Reinsurer
in respect of this Section 15.02 shall be the exercise of the recapture rights
relating to the Recapture Event described in Section 13.04(d) and the payment of
liquidated damages described in Section 13.07 unless Reinsurer elects to provide
indemnification pursuant to Section 13.04(d).
Section 15.03    Funds Withheld Investments. Within six (6) months following the
end of each tax year, the Cedant shall prepare a calculation of the net capital
gain or loss with respect to the assets held in or, with respect to the Boxed
Assets and the Transferred Notes, allocated to, the Funds Withheld Account for
U.S. federal income tax purposes (any such net capital loss, the “Funds Withheld
Loss”). The Reinsurer shall provide any information reasonably requested by the
Cedant in connection with calculating the Funds Withheld Loss. The Cedant shall
provide the Reinsurer with the details of such calculation and any supporting
work papers reasonably requested by the Reinsurer, and the parties shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve any disagreements. If the Funds Withheld Loss
for any tax year, reduced by (i) the amount of consolidated net capital gain
(within the meaning of Section 1.1502-22(a) of the Treasury Regulations) of the
affiliated group filing consolidated federal income tax returns of which the
Cedant is a member (calculated without regard to items of capital gain or loss
attributable to assets held in or, with respect to the Boxed Assets and the
Transferred Notes, allocated to, the Funds Withheld Account, and including only
those items of capital gain which are eligible to be offset by items of capital
loss attributable to the assets in or, with respect to the Boxed Assets and the
Transferred Notes, allocated to, the Funds Withheld Account for such year), and
(ii) prior year capital gains of such affiliated group against which any
consolidated net capital loss carryback that includes items comprising the Funds
Withheld Loss can be offset pursuant to applicable law, provided that items
described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be taken into account only to the extent
such items are available for offset, taking into account all other items of
income, gain, loss or deduction of such affiliated group, determined on a “with
and without basis,” (an “Excess Capital Loss”) is greater than $25 million, then
the Reinsurer shall make an additional payment to the Cedant in an amount equal
to the Excess Loss Payment. Any Excess Loss Payment will be amortized by annual
offsetting payments by the Cedant to the Reinsurer in equal installments for the
five (5) succeeding tax years. All Excess Loss Payments and related amortization
payments will be included in the relevant Net Settlement Amounts following each
determination. The Reinsurer and the Cedant will discuss in good faith the tax
profile of current and proposed investments





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





held in or allocated to or to be held in or allocated to the Funds Withheld
Account and potential dispositions thereof on a quarterly basis. The Cedant will
provide the Reinsurer with tax basis and other information reasonably requested
by the Reinsurer in connection with such discussions.

related derivatives transaction as of the date of such liquidation and unwind.

the Investment Manager the documentation described on Schedule 16.02(h) relating

expense) promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of any claim in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Article XVII, including any
pending or threatened claim or demand against the Indemnified Party by a third
party that the Indemnified Party has determined has given or could reasonably
give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement (including a
pending or threatened claim or demand asserted by a third party against the
Indemnified Party, a “Third Party Claim”), setting out the details of the claim,
the provisions under this Agreement on which such claim is based, its estimate
of the amount of Losses to the extent ascertainable which are, or are to be, the
subject of the claim and such other information (to the extent reasonably
available) as is reasonably necessary to enable the Indemnifying Party to assess
the merits of the potential claim; provided, however, that the failure to
provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article XVII or otherwise affect the rights of any
Indemnified Party except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure. The parties agree that (i) in this Article XVII they
intend to shorten, in the case of the limited survival periods specified in
Section 17.01, the applicable statute of limitations period with respect to
certain indemnification claims hereunder, (ii) notices for claims for
indemnification in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period specified in Section 17.01 for such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement and (iii) any claims for indemnification for which notice
is not delivered prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period set
forth in Section 17.01 shall be expressly barred and are hereby waived;
provided, further, that if, prior to such applicable date, a party hereto shall
have notified the other party hereto in accordance with the requirements of this
Section 17.04(a) of a claim for indemnification under this Article XVII (whether
or not formal legal action shall have been commenced based upon such claim),
such claim shall continue to be subject to indemnification in accordance with
this Article XVII notwithstanding the passing of such applicable date.
(b)    Cooperation by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate with and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining the
validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in defending
against a Third Party Claim.
(c)    The Indemnified Party shall not settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment with respect to any Third Party Claim or demand for which
it is seeking indemnification from the Indemnifying Party or admit to any
liability with respect to such Third Party Claim or demand without the prior
written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Article XVII, no Indemnifying Party shall have any liability
under this Article XVII for any Losses arising out of or in connection with any
Third Party Claim that is settled or compromised by an Indemnified Party without
the consent of such Indemnifying Party.
(d)    Assumption of Defense of a Third Party Claim. Upon receipt of a notice of
a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 17.04(a) in
respect of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may, by notice to the
Indemnified Party delivered within thirty (30) Business Days of the receipt of
notice of such Third Party Claim, assume the defense and control of any Third





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Party Claim, with its own counsel and at its own expense, but shall allow the
Indemnified Party to have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. The
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of counsel employed
by the Indemnified Party (i) for any period during which the Indemnifying Party
has not assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim and (ii) in connection with
any claim where, based on the advice of outside counsel, a conflict in interest
between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party exists. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), consent to a settlement, compromise or discharge of, or the entry of
any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, unless such settlement,
compromise, discharge or entry of any judgment provides only for the payment of
monetary damages (and does not impose any injunctive relief or otherwise impose
any conditions or restrictions on the Indemnified Party) and does not involve
any finding or admission of any violation of Law or rights of any Person,
admission of any wrongdoing, fault or culpability by the Indemnified Party, and
the Indemnifying Party shall obtain, as a condition of any settlement,
compromise, discharge, entry of judgment (if applicable), or other resolution, a
complete and unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from any and all
liabilities in respect of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party is
controlling a defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with this Article
XVII and fails to defend diligently the action or proceeding after notifying the
Indemnified Party of its assumption of the defense of such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party may assume such defense, and the reasonable and documented
fees of its attorneys will be covered by the indemnity provided for in this
Article XVII upon determination of the Indemnifying Party’s indemnity
obligations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 17.04, the
Indemnified Party (and not the Indemnifying Party) shall have the exclusive
right to assume the defense and control of any Third Party Claim if (A) the
Indemnified Party in good faith determines that the nature of the Third Party
Claim is such that it would reasonably be expected to involve criminal liability
being imposed on any Indemnified Party or its Affiliates, (B) such Third Party
Claim seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against any Indemnified
Party or (C) such Third Party Claim is initiated by a Governmental Authority;
provided that if such Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party that can be separated from a related claim for
money damages, the Indemnifying Party may only be entitled to assume control of
the defense of such Third Party Claim for money damages.
(e)    In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a claim for
indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 17.04(a) that does not
involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) Business Days following its receipt of such notice
whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party
under this Article XVII.
Section 17.05    Payment. In the event a claim for indemnification under this
Article XVII has been finally determined, the amount of such final determination
shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party on demand in
immediately available funds. Any claim, action, suit, arbitration or proceeding
by or before any Governmental Authority or arbitral body, and the liability for
and amount of damages therefor, shall be deemed to be “finally determined” for
purposes of this Article XVII when the parties hereto have so determined by
mutual agreement or, if disputed, when a final non-appealable governmental order
has been entered into with respect to such claim, action, suit, arbitration or
proceeding.
Section 17.06    Treatment of Indemnification Payments. To the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, for all purposes (including Tax purposes), the
parties hereto shall treat any payment made under Section 17.02 or Section 17.03
as an adjustment to the Ceding Commission.
Section 17.07    Provisions. No Indemnifying Party shall be liable under this
Article VII in respect of any Loss to the extent that the amount of such Loss is
expressly reflected in the calculation of the Initial Premium Adjustment.
Section 17.08    Exclusive Remedies. Each party hereto acknowledges and agrees
that, other than in the case of actual fraud by a party to this Agreement in the
making of a representation or warranty herein or willful breach by any party
hereto (a) subject to Section 3.05, the indemnification provisions of this
Article XVII shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedies of the parties
hereto for any breach of the representations or warranties contained in this
Agreement; and (b) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
breach of any representation or warranty contained herein shall give rise to any
right on the part of any party hereto to rescind this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.
Section 17.09    Damages. The Cedant and the Reinsurer agree that with respect
to each indemnification obligation set forth in this Article XVII, in no event
shall an Indemnifying Party have any liability to an Indemnified Party for:
(a) any punitive damages except to the extent paid to a third party and
(b) special, consequential or indirect damages, in each case, to the extent not
the reasonably foreseeable result of any breach by the Indemnifying Party of a
representation and warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement. For
purposes of determining whether a breach of any representation or warranty made
in this Agreement has occurred, and for calculating the amount of any Loss under
this Article XVII, each representation and warranty contained in this Agreement
shall be read without regard to any “materiality,” “material adverse effect” or
other similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty.
Section 17.10    Right to Recover.
(a)    If the Indemnifying Party is liable to pay an amount in discharge of any
claim under this Agreement and the Indemnified Party recovers or is entitled to
recover (whether by payment, discount, credit, relief, insurance or otherwise)
from a third party a sum which indemnifies or compensates the Indemnified Party
(in whole or in part) in respect of the Losses which is the subject matter of
the claim, then the Indemnified Party shall take such actions (at the
Indemnifying Party’s sole cost and expense) as may be reasonably requested by
the Indemnifying Party to enforce recovery against the third party and any
actual recovery (less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred in





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





obtaining such recovery) shall reduce or satisfy, as the case may be, such claim
to the extent of such recovery. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be
required to act or forbear to act under this Section 17.10 if such act or
forbearance, as applicable, could prejudice such Person’s ability to prosecute a
claim against the Indemnifying Party or any right hereunder in the reasonable
judgment of such party, as applicable.
(b)    If an Indemnifying Party has paid an amount in discharge of any claim
under this Agreement and the Indemnified Party recovers or is entitled to
recover (whether by payment, discount, credit, relief, insurance or otherwise)
from a third party a sum which indemnifies or compensates the Indemnified Party
(in whole or in part) in respect of the Loss which is the subject matter of the
claim, then the Indemnified Party shall take such actions (at the Indemnifying
Party’s sole cost and expense) as may be reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party to enforce such recovery and shall, or shall procure that the
Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party, as soon as practicable
after receipt an amount equal to (i) any sum recovered from the third party in
respect of such claim less any reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
obtaining such recovery or (ii) if less, the amount previously paid by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party.
(c)    This Section 17.10 shall apply to the indemnity provided under this
Section 17 and to the Cedant in respect of the Reinsurer’s indemnification
obligations under Section 13.04(d) and Section 15.01(a).
Section 17.11    Double Claims. No Indemnified Party shall be entitled to
recover from an Indemnifying Party under this Article XVII for the same Losses
more than once (notwithstanding that such Loss may result from breaches of
multiple provisions of this Agreement).

Section 18.10    Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND

TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, OR ITS PERFORMANCE UNDER OR THE
ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT.
Section 18.11    Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the covenants or obligations contained in
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Accordingly, each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to
injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or cure any breach by the other
parties of its covenants or obligations contained in this Agreement and to
specifically enforce such covenants and obligations in any court referenced in
Section 18.08 having jurisdiction, such remedy being in addition to any other
remedy to which any party may be entitled at law or in equity. The parties
acknowledge and agree that, in the event that the other parties seek an

specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the party seeking an
injunction will not be required to provide any bond or other security in

Section 18.12    Waivers. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be waived,
or the time for its performance may be extended, in writing at any time by the
party entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver shall be validly and
sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this Agreement if, as to any party,
it is authorized in writing by an authorized Representative of such party. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any provision of this
Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver of such provision, nor in any
way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of
any party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No waiver of any
breach of this Agreement shall be held to constitute a waiver of any preceding
or subsequent breach.

this Agreement in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be
deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one
and the same agreement. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page
to this Agreement by facsimile or electronic mail shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.
Section 18.15    Duty of Utmost Good Faith. With respect to the reinsurance
relationships and transactions among the parties and their Affiliates
contemplated by this Agreement, each party absolutely and irrevocably waives
resort to the duty of “utmost good faith” or any similar principle.
Section 18.16    Treatment of Confidential Information.
(a)    The Cedant and the Reinsurer (each, the “Receiving Party”) hereby
covenant and agree, each on behalf of itself and on behalf of its Affiliates,
that from and following the Closing Date, (i) subject to clause (ii) of this
Section 18.16(a), the Receiving Party will, and will cause its respective
Affiliates and Representatives to, use any Confidential Information of the other
party and its Affiliates (the “Disclosing Party”) solely in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the
Security and Control Agreement and (ii) the Receiving Party will not, and will
not permit its respective Affiliates to, disclose, give, sell or divulge any
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose or permit its
Representatives to do the same, except that each Receiving Party may disclose
such Confidential Information or portions thereof (A) if legally compelled to do
so, (B) to the extent necessary for the performance of such





--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Receiving Party’s obligations under this Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the
Security and Control Agreement, (C) to the extent necessary for the enforcement
of the rights of such Receiving Party and its Affiliates under this Agreement,
the Trust Agreement and the Security and Control Agreement, (D) as required in
connection with any retrocession of the Reinsured Liabilities permitted under
this Agreement, (E) to those of such Receiving Party’s Affiliates, and to their
respective Representatives in each case who need to know such information for
the foregoing purposes or (F) as required under any applicable Law, any rules or
regulations of any applicable stock exchange, or by any Governmental Authority;
provided, in the case of clause (D), that (i) the Receiving Party may only
disclose such Confidential Information in connection with any retrocession to a
counterparty that is bound by confidentiality obligations in respect of such
Confidential Information that are at least as stringent as the confidentiality
obligations of the Receiving Party under this Agreement (the “Retrocession
Confidentiality Obligations”) and (ii) the Receiving Party shall take all steps
necessary, at the Receiving Party’s sole expense, to enforce its rights in
respect of such Retrocession Confidentiality Obligations. If the Receiving Party
or its Affiliates, or any of their respective Representatives become legally
compelled or required by applicable Law or Governmental Authority to disclose
any Confidential Information, the Receiving Party, to the extent practicable and
allowed under applicable Law, shall provide the Disclosing Party with prompt
written notice of such requirement so that the Disclosing Party may seek a
protective order or other remedy or waive compliance with this Section 18.16. In
the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the
Disclosing Party waives compliance with this Section 18.16, the Receiving Party
or its Affiliates, as applicable, shall furnish only that portion of
Confidential Information which it reasonably believes is legally required to be
provided and exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances
that appropriate confidential treatment will be accorded such Confidential
Information. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 18.16 to the contrary, the
parties acknowledge and agree that each party may share any Confidential
Information of the other party with (A) any Governmental Authority charged with
the supervision of insurance companies or (B) the Internal Revenue Service or
any other taxing authority as each party deems necessary or advisable in its
good faith judgment.
(b)    The Cedant shall not provide to the Reinsurer, and the Reinsurer shall
have no right to access, any Non-Public Personal Information, as defined below,
except to the extent necessary for purposes of administration of this Agreement.
The Reinsurer and its Representatives and service providers will protect the
confidentiality and security of any Non-Public Personal Information provided to
it hereunder by:
(i)    holding all Non-Public Personal Information in strict confidence;
(ii)    maintaining appropriate measures that are designed to protect the
security, integrity and confidentiality of Non-Public Personal Information; and
(iii)    disclosing and using Non-Public Personal Information received under
this Agreement only for purposes of carrying out the Reinsurer’s obligations
under this Agreement, for purposes of retrocession as permitted hereunder, or as
may be required or permitted by Law.
“Non-Public Personal Information” is personally identifiable medical, financial
and other personal information about proposed, current and former applicants,
Customers, policy owners, contract holders, insureds, annuitants, claimants and
beneficiaries of Subject Annuities or contracts issued by the Cedant, and its
Representatives. Non-Public Personal Information does not include de-identified
personal data, i.e., information that does not identify, or could not reasonably
be associated with, an individual.
Section 18.17    Service of Process. The Reinsurer hereby designates the
Director of the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services as its
true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served any lawful process in any
Action instituted by or on behalf of the Cedant and submits to the jurisdiction
of any court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Michigan in connection
with such Action. The Reinsurer shall comply with all requirements necessary to
give such court jurisdiction, and shall abide by the final decision of such
court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal. A copy of any such
process shall be delivered to the Reinsurer in accordance with Section 18.02.
