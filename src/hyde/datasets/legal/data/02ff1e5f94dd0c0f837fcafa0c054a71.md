CONTRACT FOR PURCHASE
AND SALE OF REAL ESTATE


THIS CONTRACT FOR PURCHASE AND SALE OF REAL ESTATE (this “Contract”) is entered
into as of the last date of the signatures hereto (the “Effective Date”), by and
between PCY HOLDINGS, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“Seller”), and
CHALLENGER DENVER, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (“Purchaser”).


RECITALS:


A.          Seller is developing a master planned residential community known as
“Sky Ranch” which is located in Arapahoe County, Colorado (“County”). The Sky
Ranch master planned residential community may also be referred to herein as the
“Development”. The conceptual development plan and lotting diagram for Phase B
of the Development (the “Lotting Diagram”) are attached hereto as Exhibit A and
incorporated herein by this reference. The Development is being platted in
several subdivision filings and developed in phases. Each subdivision filing is
hereinafter sometimes respectively referred to as a “Filing” and collectively as
“Filings”.


B.          Seller desires to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser desires to
purchase and obtain from Seller, approximately 163 platted single family
residential lots (individually referred to as a “Lot” and collectively as the
“Lots”) in the Development which will be finished in accordance with this
Contract and which will be used for the construction of single family
residential dwellings upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Contract.


C.          Seller is selling platted residential lots within the Development to
multiple homebuilders, including Purchaser. The Lots to be sold by Seller and
acquired by Purchaser that are located within the Development shall be
hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Property.” The Lots will be
conveyed at one or more Closings as more particularly provided herein and each
such Closing may be referred to herein as a “Takedown.” The Lots which are to be
conveyed at the first Closing shall be sometimes hereinafter collectively
referred to as the “Takedown 1 Lots”; the Lots which are to be conveyed at the
second Closing shall be sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the
“Takedown 2 Lots”; the Lots which are to be conveyed at the third Closing shall
be sometimes hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Takedown 3 Lots”; and
the Lots which are to be conveyed at the fourth Closing shall be sometimes
hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Takedown 4 Lots”.


D.          As of the Effective Date, the Lots have not been subdivided pursuant
to a recorded final subdivision plat. The number and location of the Lots to be
acquired by Purchaser are generally depicted on the Lotting Diagram. The precise
number, dimension and location of the Lots will be established at the time the
subdivision plat for such Lots is approved by the County and/or any other
relevant governmental authority (the County any other governmental entity or
authority may be referred to herein collectively as the “Authorities”, and each
an “Authority”). As of the Effective Date, the parties anticipate that Purchaser
will acquire approximately:


1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


•
97 Lots that are approximately 35 feet wide by approximately 90 feet deep for
the construction of detached single family alley load homes (“35’ Alley Load
Lots”); and


•
66 Lots that are approximately 45 feet wide by approximately 110 feet deep for
the construction of detached single family homes (“SFD 45’ Lots”).



E.           Following Purchaser’s acquisition of Lots, Seller will construct
certain infrastructure improvements for the Lots as described on Exhibit C
attached hereto (the “Finished Lot Improvements”) pursuant to a lot development
agreement executed by Seller and Purchaser in the form set forth on Exhibit E
(“Lot Development Agreement”).


AGREEMENT:


1.          Purchase and Sale.The Property shall be purchased at four (4)
Closings. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Contract, Seller agrees to
sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase from Seller, on or before
the dates set forth in Section 8(b) below, the Lots in each Takedown, as
generally depicted on the Lotting Diagram and as follows:


At the Takedown 1 Closing (“First Closing”), Thirty-Two (32) 35’ Alley Load
Lots, and Twenty (20) SFD 45’ Lots;
 
At the Takedown 2 Closing (“Second Closing”), Twenty-Three (23) 35’ Alley Load
Lots, and Twenty (20) SFD 45’ Lots;
 
At the Takedown 3 Closing (“Third Closing”), Twenty-Two (22) 35’ Alley Load
Lots, and Ten (10) SFD 45’ Lots; and
 
At the Takedown 4 Closing (“Fourth Closing”), Twenty (20) 35’ Alley Load Lots,
and Sixteen (16) SFD 45’ Lots.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the parties acknowledge and agree that
the Parties shall negotiate during the Due Diligence Period to reach agreement
on a mutually acceptable site plan for the Lots (“Final Lotting Diagram”) and
that the exact number and location of the Lots within each Takedown are subject
to adjustment based upon the approval by the Authorities of the Final Plat (as
hereinafter defined) that includes the Lots to be acquired by Purchaser at each
Takedown. The precise number, dimension (subject to the provisions of this
Contract), location and legal description of the Lots will be established at the
time the Final Plat for such Lots is approved by the County and/or any other
Authority, and upon approval of each such Final Plat the parties shall execute
an amendment to this Contract setting forth the legal description of those Lots
included in the approved Final Plat.
 
2.           Purchase Price.The purchase price to be paid by Purchaser to Seller
for each Lot (the “Purchase Price”) shall consist of the Initial Purchase Price
(as hereinafter defined) and the Deferred Purchase Price (as hereinafter
defined). The Purchase Price for each Lot shall be calculated as provided in the
following Section 2(a) and shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Section
2(b) below:
 
2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a)          Purchase Price Payments. For each Lot the Purchase Price shall be
the sum of the “Initial Purchase Price” of: (i) Twenty-Four Thousand and 00/100
Dollars ($24,000.00) per 35’ Alley Load Lot, and (ii) Twenty-Nine Thousand and
00/100 Dollars ($29,000.00) per SFD 45’ Lot, paid by Purchaser to Seller by wire
transfer or other immediately available and collectible funds (“Good Funds”),
and the “Deferred Purchase Price” of (A) Forty-Eight Thousand Three Hundred and
00/100 Dollars ($48,300.00) per 35’ Alley Load Lot, and (B) Fifty-Eight Thousand
and 00/100 Dollars ($58,000.00) per SFD 45’ Lot, paid by Purchaser to Seller in
Good Funds, for a total of (1) Seventy-Two Thousand Three Hundred and 00/100
Dollars ($72,300.00) per 35’ Alley Load Lot and (2) Eighty-Seven Thousand and
00/100 Dollars ($87,000.00) per SFD 45’ Lot (subject to adjustment as
hereinafter provided in Section 2(b) of this Contract). As more particularly
described in Section 5(c)(iv), below, the Deferred Purchase Price for the Lots
acquired by Purchaser at the First Closing shall be secured by a letter of
credit delivered by Purchaser into escrow at the First Closing, the Deferred
Purchase Price for the Lots acquired by Purchaser at the Second Closing shall be
secured by a letter of credit delivered by Purchaser into escrow at the Second
Closing, the Deferred Purchase Price for the Lots acquired by Purchaser at the
Third Closing shall be secured by a letter of credit delivered by Purchaser into
escrow at the Third Closing, and the Deferred Purchase Price for the Lots
acquired by Purchaser at the Fourth Closing shall be secured by a letter of
credit delivered by Purchaser into escrow at the Fourth Closing.
 
(b)         Purchase Price Escalator. Any and all portions of the Purchase Price
of each Lot that is to be paid after the occurrence of the First Closing will
increase by an amount equal to the amount of simple interest that would accrue
thereon for the period elapsing between the date that the First Closing occurs
until the date such amount is paid, at a per annum rate equal to four percent
(4%) per annum (the “Escalator”). The Escalator applies to both the Initial
Purchase Price and the Deferred Purchase Price. By way of example and for
clarification purposes only, if the Purchase Price of a Lot at the Closing of
the Takedown 1 Lots is $60,000 then at a subsequent Closing occurring 12 months
(365 days) following the date of the closing of the Takedown 1 Lots, the
Purchase Price for the same type of Lot at such subsequent Closing will be
$62,400.00, which is calculated as follows: $60,000 + ($60,000 x .04) =
$62,400.00. If the Initial Purchase Price for such Lot to be acquired at the
subsequent closing is $20,000, then the Initial Purchase Price for such Lot to
be paid at the subsequent closing will be $20,800 [calculated as follows:
$20,000 + ($20,000 x .04) = $20,800.00]. Likewise, if one-half of the Deferred
Purchase Price of Lot acquired at the closing of the Takedown 1 Lot is due and
payable 24 months following the date of the closing of the Takedown 1 Lots then
one-half of the Deferred Purchase Price that will be due and payable will be
$21,600 [calculated as follows: $20,000 + ($20,000 x .04) + ($20,000 x .04) =
$21,600.00]. The Purchase Price Escalator shall not accrue or be calculated
during extension periods requested by Seller and in no event be calculated
beyond 24 months from the previous Closing, except in the event of delays
resulting from Purchaser’s actions, defaults, or as a result of Uncontrollable
Events.
 
3.           Payment of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price for each of the Lots,
as determined pursuant to Section 2 above, shall be payable as follows:
 
3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a)         Earnest Money Deposit. Within three (3) business days following the
Effective Date, Purchaser shall deliver to the Title Company (as defined in
Section 4(a) hereof) an earnest money deposit in the amount of $100,000.00 (the
“Initial Deposit”). At the end of the Due Diligence Period and within three (3)
business days after delivery of the Continuation Notice (as hereinafter
defined), Purchaser shall deliver to Title Company an additional deposit in the
amount of $100,000.00 (the “Additional Deposit”). The Initial Deposit and the
Additional Deposit and all interest earned thereon shall be referred to herein
as the “Deposit”. The Title Company will act as escrow agent and invest the
earnest money deposit in a federally insured institution at the highest money
market rate available. The Deposit shall be paid in Good Funds. The Deposit
shall be applied on a pro-rata basis to the Initial Purchase Price due at each
Closing. If this Contract is terminated prior to the expiration of the Due
Diligence Period for any reason, the Initial Deposit shall be refunded to
Purchaser. If this Contract is terminated after the Due Diligence Period and
prior to the Deposit being fully applied to the Purchase Price at the last
Closing, the unapplied portion of the Deposit shall be paid to Seller, except in
the case of a termination of this Contract pursuant to a provision that
expressly entitles Purchaser to a refund of the Deposit as provided elsewhere
herein.
 
(b)         Initial Purchase Price. That portion of the Purchase Price for each
Lot that is identified as the Initial Purchase Price and calculated as provided
in Section 2 above shall be paid by Purchaser to Seller in Good Funds at the
Closing that is applicable to the Lot.
 
(c)         Deferred Purchase Price. That portion of the Purchase Price for each
Lot that is identified as the Deferred Purchase Price in Section 2 above is due
and payable by Purchaser to Seller, as provided in and pursuant to the terms of
the Lot Development Agreement.
 
4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.           Seller’s Title.
 
(a)       Preliminary Title Commitment. Within ten (10) business days after the
Effective Date, Seller shall furnish to Purchaser, at Seller’s expense, a
current commitment for a Title Policy (as defined below) for the Property (the
“Master Commitment”) issued by Land Title Guarantee Company (“Title Company”) as
agent for First American Title Insurance Company, together with copies of the
instruments listed in the schedule of exceptions in the Master Commitment. If
the Master Commitment contains any exceptions from coverage which are
unacceptable to Purchaser, then Purchaser shall object to the condition of the
Master Commitment in writing within sixty (60) days of Purchaser’s receipt of
the Master Commitment together with copies of all documents constituting
exceptions to title (the “Title Objections”). Upon receipt of the Title
Objections, Seller may, at its option and at its sole cost and expense, clear
the title to the Property of the Title Objections within twenty (20) days of
receipt of the Title Objections. In the event Seller fails, or elects not to
clear the title to the Property of the Title Objections on or before the date
that is ten (10) days before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, the
Purchaser, as its sole remedy, may elect before the expiration of the Due
Diligence Period either: (i) to terminate this Contract, in which event the
Initial Deposit shall be promptly returned to Purchaser, Purchaser shall deliver
to Seller all information and materials received by Purchaser from Seller
pertaining to the Property and any non-confidential and non-proprietary
information otherwise obtained by Purchaser pertaining to the Property, and
thereafter the parties shall have no further rights or obligations under this
Contract except as otherwise provided in Section 12(c) below; or (ii) to waive
such objections and proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Contract,
in which event Purchaser shall be deemed to have approved the title matters as
to which its Title Objections have been waived. If Purchaser fails to provide
the Title Objections prior to the expiration of the sixty (60) day period
required by this Section 4(a), Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to
waive its objections as described in the preceding clause. If Purchaser fails to
notify Seller of its election to terminate this Contract or waive it objections,
Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected to waive its objections to any title
matter that Seller has failed or elected not to cure. Seller shall release at or
prior to the applicable Closing any monetary lien that Seller caused or created
against the Property with respect to that portion of the Property to be acquired
at a particular Closing other than non-delinquent real estate taxes and
assessments and Permitted Exceptions, and such monetary liens shall not
constitute Permitted Exceptions (as hereinafter defined). At each Closing,
without the need for Purchaser to object to the same in Purchaser’s Title
Objections, Seller shall execute and deliver the Title Company’s standard form
mechanic’s lien affidavit (the “Lien Affidavit”) in connection with the standard
printed exception for liens arising against the Lots purchased at the Closing
for work or materials ordered or contracted for by Seller, and to the extent
required by the Title Company a commercially reasonable indemnity agreement (the
“Title Company Indemnity”), provided, however, if Purchaser determines during
the Due Diligence Period that the Title Company refuses or is unwilling to
delete the standard printed exception for liens as part of extended coverage
despite Seller’s offer to execute and deliver the Lien Affidavit and Title
Company Indemnity, then Purchaser will have the right to terminate this Contract
on or before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period whereupon the Initial
Deposit will be returned to Purchaser, or Purchaser may proceed with the Closing
in which event the Title Policy will contain, and the Lots will be conveyed
subject to, the standard printed exception for liens unless the Title Company
agrees thereafter to delete such lien exception, however, the Purchaser shall
have no further termination rights if the Title Company does not agree to do so.
If the Title Company agrees during the Due Diligence Period to delete the
standard printed exception for liens as part of extended coverage and thereafter
the Title Company refuses to delete the exception for liens based on Seller’s
offer to execute and deliver the Lien Affidavit and Title Company Indemnity,
then such exception shall be deemed a Non-Seller Caused Exception (as
hereinafter defined) to which Purchaser shall have the right to object pursuant
to Section 4(b). Seller shall request that the Takedown Commitment (as
hereinafter defined) provide for the deletion of the other standard printed
exceptions from the Title Policy (provided that Seller’s only obligation with
respect thereto shall be (i) to provide a copy of Seller’s existing survey
(“Survey”), if any, of the land that contains the Lots, obtain and furnish, at
Purchaser’s sole cost and expense, a plat certification issued by a licensed
surveyor (“Plat Certificate”) if and to the extent a Plat Certificate is
required by the Title Company as a requirement to delete the standard survey
exception, (ii) to execute the Title Company’s standard form seller-owner final
affidavit and agreement as reasonably modified by Seller and as to Seller’s acts
only if such affidavit is required by the Title Company for the purpose of
deleting any exception for parties in possession (“Owner’s Affidavit”), and
(iii) to execute the Title Company’s Lien Affidavit with respect to Seller’s
acts, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Seller). Seller has no
obligation to provide a new Survey or to update any existing Survey.
 
5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)         Subsequently Disclosed Exceptions. Not less than fifteen (15) days
prior to the each Closing, at Seller’s expense, Purchaser may request that the
Title Company issue an updated title commitment for that portion of the Property
to be acquired at such Closing (each a “Takedown Commitment”), together with
copies of any additional instruments listed in the schedule of exceptions which
are not reflected in the Master Commitment furnished pursuant to Section 4(a)
above or in any prior Takedown Commitment. Additional items disclosed by a
Takedown Commitment or by an amendment to the Master Commitment that affect
title to the subject Property are referred to as “New Exceptions”. New
Exceptions affecting title to the subject Property that are allowed by the
provisions of this Contract are referred to as “Permissible New Exceptions” and
all other New Exceptions are referred to as “Other New Exceptions”. Purchaser
has no right to object to any Permissible New Exception. Other New Exceptions
which do not materially adversely affect title to a Lot, or Purchaser’s ability
to construct Homes (as hereinafter defined) thereon, shall also be Permissible
New Exceptions. Purchaser shall have a period of seven (7) days from the date of
its receipt of such Takedown Commitment or amendment to the Master Commitment
and a copy of the New Exceptions (the “New Exception Review Period”) to review
and to approve or disapprove any Other New Exceptions. If any Other New
Exception is unacceptable to Purchaser, Purchaser shall object to such Other New
Exception(s) in writing within seven (7) days after the date of Purchaser’s
receipt of the Takedown Commitment, together with a copy of the New Exceptions
(the “New Exception Objection”). Upon receipt of the New Exception Objection,
Seller shall cure the New Exception Objection (by deletion, insuring over or
endorsement) to the extent that such Other New Exception was caused or created
by Seller and is not otherwise permitted by this Contract (“Seller Caused
Exception”). If the New Exception Objection relates to an Other New Exception
that was not caused by Seller (“Non-Seller Caused Exception”), Seller may, at
its sole discretion, cure the New Exception Objection, within fifteen (15) days
of receipt of the New Exception Objection (“Seller Cure Period”) and the
applicable Closing Date will be extended to accommodate the Seller Cure Period.
In the event Seller fails, or elects not to cure a Non-Seller Caused Exception
within such fifteen (15) day period, the Purchaser, as its sole remedy, may
elect within five (5) days after the end of the Seller Cure Period either: (i)
to terminate this Contract, in which event that portion of the Deposit not
previously applied to the Purchase Price at a Closing, shall be refunded to
Purchaser and the parties shall have no further rights or obligations under this
Contract; or (ii) to waive such objection and proceed with the applicable
Takedown, in which event Purchaser shall be deemed to have approved the New
Exception. If Purchaser fails to notify Seller of its election to terminate this
Contract in accordance with the foregoing sentences within five (5) days after
the expiration of the Seller Cure Period (i) Purchaser shall be deemed to have
elected to waive its objections as described in the preceding sentences and (ii)
all such items shall be deemed to be Permitted Exceptions.
 
(c)         Permitted Exceptions; Additional Easements. Seller shall convey
title to the Lots included in each Takedown of the Property to Purchaser at the
Closing for such Takedown subject to the Permitted Exceptions described in
Section 9 hereof. Prior to each Closing, Seller shall have the right, subject to
the limitations set forth below and those Reservations and Covenants (as
hereinafter defined) as set forth on Exhibit B, attached hereto, and provided
Seller shall advise and provide copies of same to Purchaser promptly after
Seller becomes aware of same, to convey additional easements as Permissible New
Exceptions to utility and cable service providers, governmental or
quasi-governmental Authorities, metropolitan, water and sanitation districts,
homeowners associations or property owners associations or other entities that
serve the Development or adjacent property for construction of utilities and
other facilities to support the Development or such adjacent property, including
but not limited to sanitary sewer, water lines, electric, cable, broad-band and
telephone transmission, storm drainage and construction access easements across
the Property not yet acquired by Purchaser, allowing Seller or its assignees the
right to install and maintain sanitary sewer, water lines, cable television,
broad-band, electric, telephone and other utilities on the Property and on the
adjacent property owned by Seller and/or its affiliates, and further, to
accommodate storm drainage from the adjacent property. Such easements shall
require the restoration of any surface damage or disturbance caused by the
exercise of such easements, shall not be located within the building envelope of
any Lot or materially negatively impact any Home constructed thereon, and shall
not materially detract from the value, use or enjoyment of (i) the Lots affected
or the remaining portion of the Property on which such easements are to be
located, or (ii) any adjoining property of Purchaser.
 
6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d)         Master Covenants; Regional Improvements Authority. The Lots to be
acquired pursuant to this Contract shall be, prior to each Closing, made subject
to the Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Sky Ranch recorded in the
County Records on August 10, 2018, at Reception No. D8079588 (the “Master
Declaration”). The Master Declaration, together with any supplemental
declarations which have been, or may in the future be, recorded against the
Property, shall be collectively referred to as the “Master Covenants”. The
Master Covenants are administered by the Sky Ranch Community Authority Board
(“CAB”) and shall be a Permitted Exception (as hereinafter defined). Seller
shall provide to Purchaser for its review, a copy of the Master Covenants as
part of the Seller Documents (as hereinafter defined). Seller shall be permitted
to revise or supplement the Master Covenants at any time before the First
Closing under this Contract without the consent of Purchaser but with prior
notice and copies of same to Purchaser; provided, that any such revision has no
material adverse effect on the Lots acquired or to be acquired by Purchaser. The
Seller may petition the County for the organization of a public improvement
district pursuant to C.R.S. Title 30, Article 20 (the “Public Improvement
District” or “PID”), or one or more public entities, including without
limitation, the Sky Ranch Districts, CAB, and County may enter into an
intergovernmental agreement pursuant to C.R.S. §§ 29-1-203 and – 203.5 to create
a public authority (the “Regional Improvements Authority”) to provide a source
of funding for the construction and operation of certain regional public
improvements serving the Development and other properties, including without
limitation, the freeway interchange at Interstate I-70/Airpark Frontage Road
adjacent to the Development and other regional improvements (collectively, the
“Regional Improvements”). The PID, if formed, may pledge revenues and/or issue
general obligation indebtedness, revenue bonds or special assessment bonds and
will have the power to levy and collect ad valorem taxes on and against all
taxable property within the PID in accordance with the provisions of part 5 of
C.R.S. Title 30, Article 20. If and to the extent that Seller petitions the
County and the County organizes a PID that includes the Development, Purchaser
agrees that it will not object to the County’s organization of any such PID. The
Regional Improvements Authority, if created, may use revenue generated by the
Sky Ranch Districts’ imposition of a mill levy that is a subset of the Sky Ranch
Districts’ operations and maintenance mill levy to plan, design, acquire,
construct, install, relocate and/or redevelop, and the administration, overhead
and operations and maintenance costs incurred with respect to the Regional
Improvements (the “Regional Improvements Mill Levy”). The Regional Improvements
Mill Levy shall be calculated as the difference between the overlapping mill
levies of property subject to the Aurora Public Schools mill levy (“APS Mill
Levy”) and the overlapping mill levies of property not subject to the APS Mill
Levy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Purchaser may object if any proposal
may exceed the Maximum Mills Limitation (hereafter defined) and (ii) regardless
of whether or not Purchaser objects, Purchaser shall not be deemed to consent to
or approve, and all PID documentation, coupled and aggregated with any and all
other documentation relating to the District (hereafter defined), the other Sky
Ranch Districts (hereafter defined), and the Regional Improvements Authority
(such documentation being collectively referred to as, the “District
Documentation”) shall only be permitted to levy and collect in the aggregate
amounts that do not exceed the lesser of: (i) the total mill levy assessed
against a residential lot that is subject to the APS Mill Levy; and (ii) up to
55.664 mills (subject to “Gallagher Adjustments”) commencing with the
residential assessment rate as of January 1, 2021 for debt service, and up to
11.133 mills for operation and maintenance (also subject to Gallagher
Adjustments) (collectively, the “Maximum Mills Limitation”). Seller shall be
solely liable for and shall pay (i) any ad valorem taxes levied by any district
or other entity in excess of the Maximum Mills Limitation, and (ii) any other
rates, tolls, fees or charges adopted by any such district or other entity and
this obligation of Seller shall survive all Closings for the benefit of
Purchaser and all successor Lot owners.
 
7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(e)         Title Policy. Within a reasonable time after each Closing, Seller,
at its expense, shall cause the Title Company to deliver a Form 2006 ALTA
extended coverage owner’s policy of title insurance (“Title Policy”), insuring
Purchaser’s title to the Property conveyed at such Closing, pursuant to the
applicable Takedown Commitment and subject only to the Permitted Exceptions,
together with such endorsements as Purchaser may request and which the Title
Company agrees to issue during the Due Diligence Period, and shall pay the
premium for the basic policy at such Closing. The Title Policy shall provide
insurance in an amount equal to the Purchase Price for all Lots purchased at
such Closing. At each Closing, Seller shall offer to execute and deliver a Lien
Affidavit and an Owner’s Affidavit, and shall obtain and furnish a Plat
Certificate, as necessary. Purchaser shall pay any fees charged by the Title
Company to delete the standard pre-printed exceptions. Purchaser shall pay for
the premiums for any endorsements requested by Purchaser, except that Seller
shall pay for any endorsements that Seller agrees to provide in order to cure a
Title Objection.
 
5.           Seller Obligations. Seller shall have the following obligations:
 
(a)          Entitlements.
8

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i)        Platting and Entitlements. Seller shall be responsible, at Seller’s
sole cost and expense, for preparing and processing in a commercially reasonable
manner and timeframe, and diligently pursuing and obtaining Final Approval (as
defined below) from the County and any other appropriate Authority and recording
in the records of the Clerk and Recorder of the County (the “County Records”),
as may be required, the following: (A) a preliminary plat; (B) a general
development plan (“GDP”); (C) a specific development plan that includes the
Property (“SDP”); (D) an administrative site plan (“ASP”) and final subdivision
plat (or plats) for each Filing within the Property (each a “Final Plat”); (E)
the public improvement construction plans for all improvements relating to each
Final Plat (“CDs”); and (F) one or more development or subdivision improvement
agreements associated with the Final Plats and other similar documentation
required by the Authorities in connection with approval of the Final Plat(s) and
CDs (collectively, the “Entitlements”). The Entitlements shall substantially
comply with the Final Lotting Diagram, and shall provide that Phase B of the
Development contains approximately 834 lots with the Lots being of the number,
type, and dimension as set forth above in Recital D (after taking into
consideration applicable setbacks), and the Entitlements shall not impose new or
additional requirements upon Purchaser which increase (or could be expected to
increase) the construction cost for a Home on any Lot by more than $3,000 or
which materially adversely affect Purchaser’s ability to construct a Home on any
Lot. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to have the Entitlements
for each Takedown, respectively, approved by the Authorities and recorded as
necessary in the County Records with all applicable governmental or third-party
appeal and/or challenge periods applicable to an approval decision of the County
Board of Commissioners or County Planning Commission having expired without any
appeal then-pending (“Final Approval”). Seller shall use commercially reasonably
efforts to obtain Final Approval of the Entitlements applicable to the Takedown
1 Lots on or before that date which is nine (9) months after the expiration of
the Due Diligence Period, as such period may be extended pursuant to this
Section 5(a)(i), or as a result of delays resulting from Uncontrollable Events.
If Final Approval of the Entitlements applicable to the Takedown 1 Lots has not
been achieved as aforesaid on or before nine (9) months after the expiration of
the Due Diligence Period (subject to delays resulting from Uncontrollable
Events), then Seller, in its discretion, shall have the right to extend the date
for obtaining such Final Approval for a period not to exceed an additional six
(6) months by providing written notice to Purchaser prior to the expiration of
such nine (9) month period (or such later date as the same may have been
previously extended). If Seller has not secured such Final Approval of the
Takedown 1 Lots by the expiration of the initial nine (9) month period (subject
to delays resulting from Uncontrollable Events) and shall fail to exercise such
extension, each party shall thereupon be relieved of all further obligations and
liabilities under this Contract, except as otherwise provided herein, and the
Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser. If Seller extends the time period for
obtaining Final Approval of the Takedown 1 Lots, then during such extended time
period Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain Final Approval
of such Entitlements, and failing which, Seller shall not be in default of its
obligations under this Contract (unless Seller failed to use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain Final Approval of such Entitlements), but this
Contract shall terminate in which case each party shall thereupon be relieved of
all further obligations and liabilities under this Contract, except as otherwise
provided herein, and the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser. During the
Entitlement process, Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed of the
process and the anticipated results therefrom and, upon written request, Seller
will provide Purchaser with copies of those Entitlement documents as submitted
to the County and other reasonable documentation relating to same. Purchaser, at
no material cost to Purchaser (other than costs incurred to obtain services that
could reasonably be performed or provided in-house), shall cooperate with Seller
in Seller’s efforts to obtain Final Approval of the Entitlements by the County.


(ii)        Lot Minimums for each Takedown. The Final Plat(s) for the Property
and the Lots are anticipated to be in a form which is substantially consistent
with the Final Lotting Diagram, subject to changes made necessary by the
Authorities and/or final engineering decisions which are necessary to properly
engineer, design, and install the improvements in accordance with the
requirements of the County and other applicable Authorities.


(iii)       Recordation of Final Plat. At or before each Closing, Seller shall
cause to be recorded, in the County Records, the Final Plat that includes the
Lots that are to be purchased at such Closing. Seller shall be responsible for
providing to the County any bond or other financial assurance that is required
by the County to record each Final Plat.



9

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)         Interchange Obligations. As of the Effective Date, the existing
entitlements for the Development state that no more than 774 building permits
may be issued for the Development until the Freeway Interchange is upgraded. The
foregoing building permit provision may affect the ability of Purchaser and the
other builders within Phase B to obtain building permits on the Lots acquired
after the First Closing under this Contract and after the initial closings under
the other builder contracts. Seller is currently working with the County, CDOT,
and other stakeholders to identify interim upgrades to the Freeway Interchange
that, if implemented, would increase the number of building permits available
within the Development to accommodate all Lots subject to this Contract and the
other building contracts within Phase B (the “Interchange Upgrades”). In the
event that any Closing is delayed as a result of Seller’s failure to satisfy its
obligations with respect to the Interchange Upgrades, the Escalator shall be
tolled on a day-for-day basis equal to the length of any such delay.


(c)          Finished Lot Improvements/Lot Development Agreement.


(i)         At the First Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall enter into the Lot
Development Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit E, regarding
Seller’s obligations to construct and install the Finished Lot Improvements as
described on Exhibit C attached hereto.


(ii)         The Lot Development Agreement includes, without limitation,
provisions that provide for the following: (A) the payment of the Deferred
Purchase Price by Purchaser as follows: for each Takedown, one-half of the
Deferred Purchase Price for the Lots in that Phase shall be paid to Seller upon
Substantial Completion of that portion of the Finished Lot Improvements
consisting of the water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer infrastructure that is
necessary to serve the Lots in that Phase, and the remaining one-half of the
Deferred Purchase Price for the Lots in that Phase shall be paid to Seller upon
Substantial Completion of the balance of Finished Lot Improvements that serve
that Phase to the extent necessary to obtain building permits; (B) Seller’s
and/or the District’s obligation to post surety as required by the County in
connection with such Phases; (C) provisions regarding Seller’s and/or the
District’s agreements with the contractors who will construct the Finished Lot
Improvements; (D) Seller’s and/or the District’s warranty obligations, as
provided on Exhibit C; (E) Seller’s obligation to obtain lien waivers and to
discharge mechanics liens related to construction of the Finished Lot
Improvements; (F) Purchaser’s step-in rights following a Seller and/or District
Event of Default (as such term is defined in the Lot Development Agreement)
under the Lot Development Agreement; and (G) a license from Purchaser to permit
construction of the Finished Lot Improvements and performance of other related
activities on the Lots. The Seller, Purchaser, other builder(s) affected by any
improvements to be constructed under the Lot Development Agreement that serve or
benefit the Lots and other property that is to be acquired by such other
builder(s) (the “Joint Improvements”) and the Title Company will, at the
Takedown 1 Closing execute a “Joint Improvements Memorandum” that describes the
rights and obligations of Seller, Purchaser, such other builder(s) and Title
Company and such document will supplement the Lot Development Agreement
regarding the installation and construction of any Joint Improvements. The form
of the Joint Improvements Memorandum is attached to the Lot Development
Agreement as Exhibit F thereto.


10

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(iii)       After obtaining Final Approval of all necessary Entitlements for the
applicable Lots, Seller acting as the Constructing Party (as defined in the Lot
Development Agreement) under the Lot Development Agreement shall commence and
diligently pursue Substantial Completion, or cause to be Substantially
Completed, for the Lots being purchased and acquired by Purchaser at each
Closing, subject to delays resulting from Uncontrollable Events, the Finished
Lot Improvements in accordance with the phasing, provisions and schedules of the
Lot Development Agreement and all applicable laws, codes, regulations and
governmental requirements for the Lots. Seller will notify Purchaser when each
phase of the Finished Lot Improvements (have been Substantially Completed.
Seller’s failure to comply with the foregoing covenant shall not constitute a
default hereunder unless and until such failure shall constitute an Event of
Default (as defined in the Lot Development Agreement) under the Lot Development
Agreement.
 
(iv)       In order to secure Purchaser’s obligation (following each Closing) to
pay the Deferred Purchase Price in accordance with the terms of this Contract
and the payment schedule set forth in the Lot Development Agreement, as
described in Section 5(c) of this Contract, at each Closing Purchaser shall
deliver to Title Company (acting as escrow agent), either (a) a letter of
credit, in a form agreeable to Seller and issued by a financial institution
reasonably agreeable to Seller (the “Letter of Credit”), or (ii) a cash payment
(a Letter of Credit and the cash payment each constitute a “Deferred Purchase
Price Deposit”). The Deferred Purchase Price Deposit shall be in an amount equal
to the sum of the Deferred Purchase Price for all of the Lots acquired by
Purchaser at such Closing plus, for the Takedown 2 Lots, the Takedown 3 Lots,
and the Takedown 4 Lots, the Escalator thereon calculated pursuant to Section
2(b). Title Company shall hold and maintain the Deferred Purchase Price Deposit
pursuant to the Lot Development Agreement in an escrow account established by
Title Company for the benefit of Seller and Purchaser. A Letter of Credit that
is posted as the Deferred Purchase Price Deposit for a Closing shall remain in
place until the final payment of the Deferred Purchase Price applicable to such
Closing has been made to the Seller following Substantial Completion of the
Finished Lot Improvements which serve the Lots acquired by Purchaser at such
Closing. If a Letter of Credit is scheduled to expire prior to the Substantial
Completion of all of such Lots, and Purchaser has not renewed the Letter of
Credit at least fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration date thereof, Title
Company is authorized and directed to draw down the full amount of the Letter of
Credit and deposit such funds in escrow to be used solely for the payment of any
unpaid Deferred Purchase Price. The Letter of Credit may provide that it may be
reduced from time to time to the extent of payments of the Deferred Purchase
Price made by Purchaser for Finished Lot Improvements in accordance with the
terms, including the payment schedule, set forth in the Lot Development
Agreement and Section 5(a)(iii) of this Contract. The Letter of Credit for each
Closing shall be returned to Purchaser, together with an executed reduction
certificate reducing the face amount thereof to $0.00, upon payment in full of
the Deferred Purchaser Price for all of the Lots in such Closing. A cash payment
that is deposited as the Deferred Purchase Price Deposit for a Closing will be
drawn down and disbursed by the Title Company to Seller from time to time to the
extent of payments of the Deferred Purchase Price made by Purchaser for Finished
Lot Improvements in accordance with the terms, including the payment schedule,
set forth in the Lot Development Agreement and Section 5(a)(iii) of this
Contract. Failure by Purchaser to pay any portion of the Deferred Purchase Price
that is secured by a Letter of Credit when the same shall become due and
payable, provided that at such failure continues for a period of ten (10) days
after the delivery of written notice thereof from Seller to Purchaser, shall
entitle Seller to enforce the collection of the delinquent Deferred Purchase
Price by drawing upon the Letter of Credit or having the Title Company draw upon
the Letter of Credit, and in either event the funds so drawn shall be paid to
Seller as payment of any unpaid Deferred Purchase Price and such failure to pay
shall be deemed cured. If Seller or Title Company is unable to draw upon the
Letter of Credit, or Purchaser otherwise fails to pay the Deferred Purchase
Price, Seller may protect and enforce its rights under this Contract pertaining
to payment of the Deferred Purchase Price by (i) such suit, action, or special
proceedings as Seller shall deem appropriate, including, without limitation, any
proceedings for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained
in this Contract and the Lot Development Agreement or the enforcement of any
other appropriate legal or equitable remedy, or for the recovery of actual
damages (excluding consequential, punitive damages or similar damages) caused by
Purchaser’s failure to pay the Deferred Purchase Price, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees, and (ii) enforcing Seller’s lien rights under the Lot
Development Agreement. Seller’s remedies are non-exclusive. The foregoing
provisions regarding the Letter of Credit as security for payment of the
Deferred Purchase Price shall be included in the Lot Development Agreement in
the form of escrow instructions.



11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d)         Substantial Completion of Improvements. The term “Substantially
Complete” or “Substantial Completion” means that the Finished Lot Improvements
have been substantially completed in accordance with the applicable CDs and all
other requirements of this Contract and Purchaser will not be precluded from
obtaining building permits for homes on the Lots (thereafter Seller shall
complete the improvements so that Purchaser will not be precluded from obtaining
the issuance of certificates of occupancy following completion of homes as a
result of the degree of completion of the improvements).
 
6.           Pre-Closing Conditions.


(a)       Seller’s Conditions. It shall be a condition precedent to Seller’s
obligation to close each Takedown, that the following conditions (“Seller’s
Conditions Precedent”) have been satisfied:
 
(i)        Purchaser and other homebuilders are under contract to purchase at
least 250 of the Lots in Phase B, and close the initial purchase of lots under
some or all of such purchase and sale agreements as determined by Seller
simultaneously (the “Initial Purchase Condition”).
 
(ii)       Seller shall have satisfied, or is reasonably certain it will be able
to satisfy, its obligations with respect to the Interchange Upgrades, on or
before the Substantial Completion Deadline (as set forth in the Lot Development
Agreement) for such Takedown, such that Purchaser shall not be prevented from
obtaining building permits to construct Houses on Lots acquired at such Takedown
no later than the applicable Substantial Completion Deadline (the “Interchange
Condition”) and will not be prevented from obtaining certificates of occupancy
for such Houses, solely as a result of Seller’s failure to timely satisfy the
Interchange Condition.
 
12

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable, good faith efforts to timely
satisfy the Seller’s Conditions Precedent. If for any reason other than Seller’s
fault or exercise of its discretion, either Seller’s Condition Precedent is not
satisfied on or before a Closing Date, Seller may elect to: (1) terminate this
Contract by giving written notice to Purchaser at least ten (10) days prior to
such Closing; (2) waive the unsatisfied Seller’s Condition(s) Precedent and
proceed to the applicable Closing (provided, however, that such waiver shall not
apply to any subsequent Closings); or (3) extend the applicable Closing Date for
a period not to exceed ninety (90) days by giving written notice to Purchaser on
or before the applicable Closing Date, during which time Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause such unsatisfied Seller’s Conditions
Precedent to be satisfied (and during such extension period, the Escalator be
tolled on a day-for-day basis equal to the length of such extension period). If
Seller elects to extend any Closing Date and the unsatisfied Seller’s Condition
Precedent is not satisfied on or before the last day of the 90-day extension
period for any reason other than Seller’s fault or exercise of its discretion,
then Seller shall elect within five (5) business days after the end of such
extension period to either terminate this Contract or waive the unsatisfied
Seller’s Condition(s) Precedent and proceed to the applicable Closing. In the
event Seller terminates this Contract pursuant to this Section 6(a), that
portion of the Deposit made by Purchaser that has not been applied to the
Purchase Price for Lots already acquired by Purchaser shall be returned to
Purchaser. Failure to give a termination notice as described above shall be an
irrevocable waiver of Seller’s right to terminate this Contract as to the
affected Takedown pursuant to this Section 6(a).
 
(b)          Purchaser’s Conditions. It shall be a condition precedent to
Purchaser’s obligation to close each Takedown, that the following conditions
(“Purchaser’s Conditions Precedent”) have been satisfied:
 
(i)       Final Approval of the Entitlements for the applicable Takedown by the
County and all other applicable Authorities and recordation in the County
Records of the Final Plat for the Lots to be acquired at such Takedown and such
other Entitlements, as may be required by the County, on or before the
applicable Closing Date, as the same may be extended.
 
(ii)         Seller shall have satisfied, or is reasonably certain it will be
able to satisfy, the Interchange Condition, such that Purchaser shall not be
prevented from obtaining building permits for such Lots no later than the
applicable Substantial Completion Deadline (as set forth in the Lot Development
Agreement) and will not be prevented from obtaining certificates of occupancy
for such Houses solely as a result of Seller’s failure to timely satisfy the
Interchange Condition.
 
(iii)        Seller’s representations and warranties set forth herein shall be
materially true and correct as of the applicable Closing.
 
(iv)       The Title Company shall be irrevocably and unconditionally committed
(subject only to Purchaser’s obligation to pay the portion of the Title Policy
premium for which Purchaser is responsible under this Contract and satisfaction
of any Title Company requirements applicable to Purchaser) to issue to Purchaser
the applicable Title Policy with the endorsements as Purchaser may request and
the Title Company agrees in writing to issue prior to the expiration of the Due
Diligence Period, subject only to the Permitted Exceptions accepted by Purchaser
in accordance with the provisions of this Contract.
 
(v)          The Joint Improvements Memorandum shall have been fully executed by
all required parties.
 
13

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the Purchaser’s Conditions Precedent are not satisfied on or before a
respective Closing Date, Purchaser may: (1) waive the unfulfilled Purchaser’s
Condition Precedent and proceed to Closing, (2) extend the applicable Closing
Date for up to ninety (90) days to allow more time for Seller to satisfy the
unfulfilled Purchaser’s Condition Precedent, or (3) as its sole remedy hereunder
terminate this Contract as to such Takedown and any subsequent Takedowns by
written notice to Seller, delivered within two (2) business days after the
Closing Date for the applicable Takedown, in which case each party shall
thereupon be relieved of all further obligations and liabilities under this
Contract, except as otherwise provided herein, and the Deposit made by Purchaser
that has not been applied to the Purchase Price for Lots already acquired by
Purchaser shall be returned to Purchaser. If Purchaser elects to extend the
Closing Date under (2), above, and the unsatisfied Purchaser’s Condition
Precedent is not satisfied as of the last day of the ninety (90) day extension
period, then Purchaser shall, as its sole remedy, elect to waive or terminate
under (1) or (3). Failure to give notice as described above shall be an
irrevocable waiver of Purchaser’s right to terminate this Contract as to the
affected Takedown pursuant to this Section 6(b).
 
7.          Closing.“Closing” shall mean the delivery to the Title Company of
all applicable documents and funds required to be delivered pursuant to Section
8 hereof and unconditional authorization of the Title Company to disburse,
deliver and record the same. The purchase of Lots at the closing of a Takedown
shall be deemed to be “Closed” when the documents and funds required to be
delivered pursuant to Section 8 hereof have been delivered to the Title Company,
and the Title Company agrees to unconditionally to disburse, deliver and record
the same.
 
8.           Closings; Closing Procedures.
 
(a)        On each respective Closing Date, Purchaser shall purchase the number
of Lots that Purchaser is obligated to acquire hereunder in the applicable
Takedown.
 
(b)         Closing Dates. The First Closing shall occur on that date which is
ten (10) days after Final Approval of the Entitlements applicable to the
Takedown 1 Lots is obtained (the “Takedown 1 Closing Date”). The Second Closing
shall occur on that date which is ten (10) days after the later to occur of (i)
Final Approval of the Entitlements applicable to the Takedown 2 Lots and (ii)
that date which is twelve (12) months after the Takedown 1 Closing Date (the

of (i) Final Approval of the Entitlements applicable to the Takedown 4 Lots and
(ii) that date which is twelve (12) months after the Takedown 3 Closing Date
(the “Takedown 4 Closing Date”). The term “Closing Date” may be used to refer to
each of the Takedown 1 Closing Date, the Takedown 2 Closing Date, the Takedown 3
Closing Date, and the Takedown 4 Closing Date. If Purchaser desires to
accelerate any Closing Date, Purchaser may request that a Closing Date be
accelerated, and if Seller is willing to do so, in its sole and absolute
discretion, the parties will work together to prepare a mutually acceptable
amendment to this Contract to accommodate such request. Seller shall have the
right to extend the Takedown 1 Closing Date for up to 90 days in order to
satisfy Seller’s Condition Precedent as provided in Section 6(a) of this
Contract.
 
14

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c)          Closing Place and Time. Each Closing shall be held at 11:00 a.m. on

Purchaser the following listed items to the extent in Seller’s actual
possession; if an item listed below is not in Seller’s possession and not
delivered or made available to Purchaser, but is otherwise readily available to
Seller, then Purchaser may make written request to Seller to provide such item,
and Seller will use its reasonable efforts to obtain and deliver or make such
item available to Purchaser, but Seller will have no obligation otherwise to
obtain any item not in Seller’s possession: (i) any environmental reports, soil
reports and certifications pertaining to the Lots, (ii) a copy of any
subdivision plat for the Property, (iii) engineering and construction plans

days following the Effective Date of this Contract within which to review the
same (the “Due Diligence Period”). During the Due Diligence Period, Purchaser
shall have an opportunity to review and inspect the Property, all Seller
Documents and any and all factors deemed relevant by Purchaser to its proposed
development and the feasibility of Purchaser’s intended uses of the Property in
Purchaser’s sole and absolute discretion (the “Feasibility Review”). The
Feasibility Review shall be deemed to have been completed to Purchaser’s
satisfaction only if Purchaser gives written notice to Seller of its election to
continue this Contract (“Continuation Notice”) prior to the expiration of the
Due Diligence Period. If Purchaser fails to timely give a Continuation Notice or
if Purchaser gives a notice of its election to terminate, this Contract shall
automatically terminate, the Initial Deposit shall be promptly returned to
Purchaser, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller all information and materials
received by Purchaser from Seller pertaining to the Property and any
non-confidential and non-proprietary information otherwise obtained by Purchaser
pertaining to the Property and any information otherwise obtained by Purchaser,
and thereafter the parties shall have no further rights or obligations under
this Contract except as otherwise provided in Section 25 below. Seller will
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser, at Purchaser’s cost and at no cost and with
no liability to Seller to assist Purchaser in obtaining: (A) an updated or
recertification of any of the Seller Documents, (B) reliance letters from any of
the preparers of the Seller Documents, and (C) any consents that may be required
so that Purchaser may receive the benefits after Closing of any agreements
comprising the Seller Documents that confer a benefit and are reasonably
necessary for the Purchaser’s proper and efficient development of the Property
for residential use, to the extent such are obtainable by Purchaser.
 
18

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)       Approval of Property. If Purchaser gives a Continuation Notice on or
before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, except as otherwise provided
in this Section 10, Purchaser shall be deemed to have approved the Property, the
Development and the feasibility of Purchaser’s intended uses of the Lots
(subject to the terms and conditions of Section 5 and Section 6 hereof). Such
approval shall be deemed to include, but shall not be limited to, Purchaser’s
approval of the following as to the Property:
 
(i)         The ability of applicable utility companies to provide utility
services to the Property, including the quality, sizing and cost of such
services;
 
(ii)         The soil and environmental conditions of the Property;
 
(iii)         All Seller Documents delivered to Purchaser pursuant to this
Contract;
 
(iv)         All of the Permitted Exceptions;
 
(v)         The financial condition and other factors relevant to the operation
of the District;
 
(vi)         Fitness for Purchaser’s intended use, accessibility of roads, and
the condition and suitability for improvement and sale of the Lots, subject to
Seller’s obligations under this Contract.
 
(c)          Radon. Purchaser acknowledges that radon gas and naturally
occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) each naturally occurs in many locations
in Colorado. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) have detected elevated
levels of naturally occurring radon gas in residential structures in many areas
of Colorado, including the County and all of the other counties along the front
range of Colorado. The EPA has raised concerns with respect to adverse effects
on human health from long-term exposure to high levels of radon and recommends
that radon levels be tested in all Residences. Purchaser acknowledges that
Seller neither claims nor possesses any special expertise in the measurement or
reduction of radon or NORM. Purchaser further acknowledges that Seller has not
undertaken any evaluation of the presence or risks of radon or NORM with respect
to the Property nor has it made any representation or given any other advice to
Purchaser as to acceptable levels or possible health hazards of radon and NORM.
SELLER HAS MADE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, CONCERNING
THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF RADON, NORM OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS WITHIN
THE PROPERTY OR THE RESIDENCES TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON THE LOTS OR THE SOILS
BENEATH OR ADJACENT TO THE PROPERTY OR THE RESIDENCES TO BE CONSTRUCTED ON THE
LOTS PRIOR TO, ON OR AFTER THE APPLICABLE CLOSING DATE. Purchaser, on behalf of
itself and its successors and assigns, hereby releases the Seller from any and
all liability and claims with respect to any NORM. Every home sales contract
entered in to by Purchaser with respect to subsequent sales of Lots shall
include any disclosures with respect to radon (and other NORMs) as required by
applicable Colorado law.
 
19

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d)         Soils. Purchaser acknowledges that soils within the State of
Colorado consist of both expansive soils and low-density soils, and certain
areas contain potential heaving bedrock associated with expansive, steeply
dipping bedrock, which will adversely affect the integrity of a dwelling unit
constructed on a Lot if the dwelling unit and the Lot on which it is constructed
are not properly maintained. Expansive soils contain clay mineral, which have
the characteristic of changing volume with the addition or subtraction of
moisture, thereby resulting in swelling and/or shrinking soils. The addition of
moisture to low-density soils causes a realignment of soil grains, thereby
resulting in consolidation and/or collapse of the soils. Purchaser agrees that
it shall obtain a current geotechnical report for the Property and an individual
lot soils report for each Lot containing design recommendations from a licensed
geotechnical engineer for all structures to be placed upon the Lot. Purchaser
shall require all homes to have engineered footing and foundations consistent
with results of the individual lot soils report for each Lot and shall take
reasonable action as shall be necessary to ensure that the homes to be
constructed upon the Lots shall be done in accordance with proper design and
construction techniques. Purchaser shall also provide a copy of the geotechnical
report for the Property and the individual lot soils report for each Lot to
Seller within seven (7) days after Seller’s request for the same, and agrees in
the event that this Contract terminates for any reason Purchaser shall use
reasonable efforts to assign, without liability or recourse to Purchaser, at
Seller’s request, the geotechnical report for the Property and the individual
lot soils report for each Lot to any subsequent homebuilder who enters into a
purchase and sale agreement with Seller to purchase all of a portion of the
Lots. SELLER HAS MADE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
CONCERNING THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF EXPANSIVE SOILS, LOW-DENSITY SOILS OR
DIPPING BEDROCK UPON THE PROPERTY AND PURCHASER SHALL UNDERTAKE SUCH
INVESTIGATION AS SHALL BE REASONABLE AND PRUDENT TO DETERMINE THE EXISTENCE OF
THE SAME. Purchaser shall provide all disclosures required by C.R.S. Section
6-6.5-101 in every home sales contract entered in to by Purchaser with respect
to subsequent sales of a Lot to a homebuyer. Purchaser, on behalf of itself and
its successors and assigns, hereby releases the Seller from any and all
liability and claims with respect to expansive and low-density soils and dipping
bedrock located within the Property.
 
20

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(e)         Over Excavation. The Finished Lot Improvements required for each Lot
do not include any “over excavation” or comparable preparation or mitigation of
the soil (the “Overex”) on the Property and Purchaser shall have sole
responsibility at Purchaser’s sole expense with respect to the Overex and shall
have the right (pursuant to a license agreement to be provided by Seller) to
enter such Lots for the purposes of performing the Overex; provided, however,
that such entry shall be performed in a manner that does not materially
interfere with or result in a material delay or an increase in the costs or any
expenses in the construction of the Finish Lot Improvements, and provided
further that Purchaser shall promptly repair any portion of the Lots and
adjacent property that is materially damaged by Purchaser or its agents,
designees, employees, contractors, or subcontractors in performing the Overex.
Purchaser shall obtain, at its cost, a current geotechnical report for the
Property and an individual lot soils report for each Lot containing design
recommendations from a licensed geotechnical engineer for all structures to be
placed upon the Lot (“Purchaser’s Geotechnical Reports”). Purchaser shall not
rely upon any geotechnical or soils report furnished by Seller, and Seller shall
have no responsibility or liability with respect to the Overex, Purchaser’s
Geotechnical Reports or any matters related thereto. The parties shall
reasonably cooperate in coordinating Purchaser’s completion of the Overex so
that the Overex can be properly sequenced with Seller’s completion of the
Finished Lot Improvements and the parties acknowledge and agree that any delay
in Seller’s completion of the Finished Lot Improvements resulting from
Purchaser’s Overex work shall extend the date for substantial completion of the
Finished Lot Improvements in accordance with the provisions of the Lot
Development Agreement. In no event shall the Seller be liable to Purchaser for
any delay or costs or damages incurred by Purchaser with respect to such Overex,
even if caused by any delay in installation of Finished Lot Improvements
sequenced ahead of the Overex. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SELLER IS
NOT PERFORMING ANY OVER-EXCAVATION OF THE LOTS AND THAT SELLER SHALL HAVE NO
LIABILITY WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO OR ARISING OUT OF ANY OVER-EXCAVATION OF
THE LOTS OR EXPANSIVE SOILS PRESENT ON THE LOTS AND SELLER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
ANY LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY OVER-EXCAVATION OF THE LOTS AND EXPANSIVE
SOILS PRESENT ON THE LOTS. PURCHASER SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS
SELLER AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, AFFILIATES,
SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS FOR, FROM AND AGAINST ALL CLAIMS, DEMANDS, LIABILITIES,
LOSSES, DAMAGES (EXCLUSIVE OF SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, SPECULATIVE OR
LOST PROFITS DAMAGES), COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO COURT
COSTS AND REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES, ARISING OUT OF ANY EXPANSIVE SOILS,
OVER-EXCAVATION OR OTHER SOIL MITIGATION OR PURCHASER’S ELECTION NOT TO PERFORM
SOILS MITIGATION, ON OR PERTAINING TO PURCHASER’S LOTS. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
SECTION SHALL EXPRESSLY SURVIVE THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THIS CONTRACT.
 
21

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(f)          No Reliance on Documents. Except as expressly stated in this
Contract and/or expressly set forth in the documents executed by Seller at a
Closing, Seller makes no representation or warranty as to the truth, accuracy or
completeness of any materials, data or information (including, without

such materials, data or information by Purchaser shall be at the sole risk of
Purchaser, except as otherwise expressly stated herein. The Seller Parties (as
hereinafter defined) shall not be liable to Purchaser for any inaccuracy in or
omission from any such reports. Purchaser hereby represents to Seller that, to
the extent Purchaser deems the same to be necessary or advisable for its
purposes, and without waiving the right to rely upon the covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties expressly contained in this Contract and/or
expressly set forth in the documents executed by Seller at a Closing: (i)
Purchaser has performed or will perform an independent inspection and
investigation of the Lots and has also investigated or will investigate the
operative or proposed governmental laws, ordinances and regulations to which the
Lots may be subject, and (ii) Purchaser shall acquire the Lots solely upon the
basis of its own or its experts’ independent inspection and investigation,
including, without limitation, (a) the quality, nature, habitability,
merchantability, use, operation, value, fitness for a particular purpose,

the income and expenses, revenue or expense projections or other financial
matters, relating to the Lots, except as provided in any express
representations/warranties and/or covenants contained in this Contract.
 
(g)        As Is. Except for Seller’s Representations (as defined in Section 11
hereof) and Seller’s performance of its obligations under this Contract,
Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it is purchasing the Property based on
its own inspection and examination thereof, and Seller shall sell and convey to
Purchaser and Purchaser shall accept the property on an “AS IS, WHERE IS, WITH
ALL FAULTS, LIABILITIES, AND DEFECTS, LATENT OR OTHERWISE, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN”
basis in an “AS IS” physical condition and in an “AS IS” state of repair
(subject to the Finished Lot Improvements obligation set forth in Section
5(a)(iii) hereof). Except as expressly contained in this Contract, the special
warranty deed to be delivered at each Closing and Seller’s Representations, to
the extent not prohibited by law the Purchaser hereby waives, and Seller
disclaims all warranties of any type or kind whatsoever with respect to the
Property, whether express or implied, direct or indirect, oral or written,

applicable regulations.
 
(e)         Condemnation. Seller has received no written notice of any pending

25

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i)          Rights. Seller has not granted to any party, other than Purchaser
hereunder, any option, contract, right of refusal or other agreement with
respect to a purchase or sale of the Property. To Seller’s Actual Knowledge,
there are no leases, occupancy agreements, easements, licenses or other

Takedown Commitment or the Seller Documents.
 
(j)          Environmental. To Seller’s Actual Knowledge, neither Seller nor any

manufacture, refinement, handling, production, or disposal of Hazardous
Material, except as may be disclosed in the Seller Documents.
 
For purposes of the foregoing, the phrase “Seller’s Actual Knowledge” shall mean
the current, actual, personal knowledge of Mark Harding as President of Seller,
without any duty of investigation or inquiry and without imputation of any other
person’s knowledge. The fact that reference is made to the personal knowledge of
the above identified individual shall not render such individual personally
liable for any breach of any of the foregoing representations and warranties;
rather, Purchaser’s sole recourse in the event of any such breach shall be
against Seller, and Purchaser hereby waives any claim or cause of action against
the above identified individual arising from Seller’s Representations. Seller
and Purchaser shall notify the other in writing immediately if any Seller’s
Representation becomes untrue or misleading in light of information obtained by
Seller or Purchaser after the Effective Date. In the event that Purchaser elects
to close and Purchaser has actual knowledge (meaning the current, actual,
personal knowledge of Lee Eisenhiem, without any duty of investigation or
inquiry and without imputation of any other person’s knowledge) that any of
Seller’s Representations are untrue or misleading, or of a breach of any of
Seller’ Representations prior to a Closing, without the duty of further inquiry,
Purchaser shall be deemed to have waived any right of recovery with respect to
the matter actually known by Purchaser, and Seller shall not have any liability
in connection therewith.


Seller’s Representations shall survive each respective Closing for a period of
six (6) months, except that any claim for which legal action is filed within
such time period shall survive until resolution of such action, and except to
the extent of any matter that is waived by Purchaser pursuant to the previous
paragraph (and any such matter waived pursuant to the previous paragraph shall
not survive Closing).


Seller makes no promises, representations or warranties regarding the
construction, installation or operation of any amenities within the Development,
including without limitation, clubhouses, swimming pools and/or sports courts.
To the extent that any development plans, site plans, rendering, drawings,
marketing information or other materials related to the Development include,
depict or imply the inclusion of any amenities in the Development, they are
included only to illustrate possible amenities for the Development that may or
may not be built and Purchaser shall not rely upon any such materials regarding
the construction, installation or operation of any amenities within the
Development.


26

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12.        Purchaser’s Obligations. Purchaser shall have the following
obligations, each of which shall survive each respective Closing and, where
noted, termination of this Contract. Notwithstanding any contrary provision set
forth in this Contract, Seller shall have the right to enforce said obligations
by means of any legal or equitable proceedings including, but not limited to,
suit for actual damages and equitable relief:
 
(a)         Master Covenants; PID Service Plan. Purchaser shall comply with all
obligations applicable to Purchaser under the Master Covenants and under the PID
Service Plan.
 
(b)         Compliance with Laws. With respect to Purchaser’s entry onto the
Property and following each Closing, Purchaser shall comply with and abide by
all laws, ordinances, statutes, covenants, rules and regulations, building
codes, permits, association documents and other recorded instruments (as they
are from time to time amended, supplemented or changed) which regulate any
activities relating to Purchaser’s use, ownership, construction, sale or
investigation of any Lot or any improvements thereon.
 
(c)        Entry Prior to Closing. From and after the Effective Date of this
Contract until applicable Closing Date or earlier termination of this Contract,
and so long as no default by Purchaser exists under this Contract, Purchaser and
its agents, employees and representatives shall be entitled to enter upon the
Property for purposes of conducting soil and other engineering tests and to
inspect and survey any of the Property. If the Property is altered or disturbed
in any manner in connection with any of Purchaser’s activities, Purchaser shall
immediately return the Property to substantially the condition existing prior to
such activities. Purchaser shall promptly refill holes dug and otherwise to
repair any damage to the Property as a result of its activities. Purchaser and
its agents shall not have the right to conduct any invasive testing (e.g.,
borings, drilling, soil/water sampling, etc.), except standard geotech
preliminary investigation, on the Lots, including, without limitation, any
so-called “Phase II” environmental testing, without first obtaining Seller’s
written consent (and providing Seller at least seventy-two (72) hours’ prior
written notice), which consent may be withheld by Seller in its reasonable
discretion and shall be subject to any terms and conditions imposed by Seller in
its reasonable discretion. In the event that Purchaser fails to obtain Seller’s
written consent prior to any invasive testing, in addition to and without
limiting any other obligations Purchaser may have under this Section, Purchaser
shall be fully responsible and liable for all costs of remediation with respect
to any materials disturbed in any manner that requires remediation or that are
removed in connection with such invasive testing and including, but not limited
to, costs for disposal of materials removed during any invasive testing.
Purchaser shall not permit any lien to attach to the Property or any portion of
the Property as a result of the activities. Purchaser shall indemnify, defend
and hold Seller, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and
representatives harmless from and against any and all mechanics’ and
materialmen’s liens, claims (including, without limitation, personal injury,
death and property damage claims), damages, losses, obligations, liabilities,
costs and expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees
incurred by Seller, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees, agents and
representatives or their property arising out of any breach of the provisions of
this Section 12(c) by Purchaser, its agents, employees or representatives. The
foregoing indemnity obligation of Purchaser includes acts and omissions of
Purchaser and all agents, consultants and other parties acting for or on behalf
of Purchaser. Purchaser shall maintain in effect during its inspection of the
Property commercial general liability coverage for bodily injury and property
damage in the amount of at least $2,000,000.00 combined single limit, and
automobile liability coverage for bodily injury and property damage in the
amount of at least $2,000,000.00 combined single limit, and the policy or
policies of insurance shall be issued by a reputable insurance company or
companies which are qualified to do business in the State of Colorado and shall
name Seller as an additional insured. In addition, before entering upon the
Property, Purchaser shall provide Seller with valid certificates indicating such
insurance is in effect. The foregoing indemnity shall not apply to claims due to
(i) Hazardous Materials or conditions that are not placed on the Property or
caused by Purchaser or its agents, (ii) pre-existing matters, (iii) or Seller’s
actions or inactions. The indemnity and agreement set forth in this Section
12(c) shall survive the expiration or termination of this Contract for any
reason.
 
27

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d)         Architectural Approval. In order to assure that homes constructed by
Purchaser are compatible with the other residential construction in the
Development and the architectural, design, and landscaping criteria and
guidelines included in the approved Administrative Site Plan applicable to the
Property (the “ASP Criteria”) and are otherwise acceptable to Seller, all
construction and landscaping on the Lots shall be subject to the prior review
and approval of Seller. The Master Covenants provide for the formation of an
architectural review committee (“Architectural Review Committee”) and for the
promulgation and adoption of design guidelines (“Design Guidelines”) to be
applied by the Architectural Review Committee. The Master Covenants and the
Design Guidelines provide for an exemption from obtaining Architectural Review
Committee approval for the Seller and any other person whose House Plans (as
hereinafter defined) has been reviewed and approved by the Seller.
 
(i)          Purchaser shall submit to Seller the Purchaser’s elevations, floor
plans, typical landscape plans, exterior color palettes (“House Plans”) for
homes and other buildings, structures and improvements to be located on the Lots
(herein referred to as “Homes”, “Houses” or “Residences”) within twenty (20)
days following delivery of the ASP to Purchaser. Seller will review the House
Plans and Seller shall deliver notice to Purchaser of the Seller’s approval or
disapproval of the House Plans within ten (10) business days after receipt of
the House Plans, with such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, so long as such plans substantially comply and are generally
consistent and compatible with the ASP Criteria. If Seller fails to so notify
Purchaser of approval or disapproval within such 10-business day period, the
Purchaser shall provide Seller with written notice of the same and Seller shall
notify Purchaser within five (5) business days of its approval or disapproval.
If Seller fails to approve or disapprove within such 5-business day period, the
House Plans shall be deemed approved and/or an appropriate exemption shall be
given to Purchaser. In the event of disapproval, Purchaser shall revise and
resubmit the House Plans to the Seller for reconsideration, addressing the
matters disapproved by the Seller, and the procedure set forth above shall be
repeated until the House Plans are approved by the Seller. After Seller approves
the Purchaser’s House Plans, and before Purchaser commences construction of
Homes on the Lots, Purchaser shall submit to Seller any material changes in the
approved House Plans. Seller shall review the material changes for general
consistency and compatibility with the standards and criteria set forth in the
ASP Criteria and if Seller approves such changes, Seller shall notify Purchaser
within ten (10) business days of its approval, not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.
 
28

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(ii)        Purchaser shall obtain Seller approval of House Plans before
commencing construction activities on any Lot. Purchaser shall perform all
construction, development and landscaping in accordance with the approved House
Plans and in conformity with the ASP Criteria and all other requirements, rules,
regulations of any local jurisdictional authority. Purchaser and Seller
acknowledge that the County will not conduct architectural review nor issue
approval of Purchaser’s House Plans, but rather requires the building permit
applicant to comply with the ASP Criteria. Seller’s approval of Purchaser’s
House Plans is only intended as a review for compatibility with other
residential construction in the Development and the ASP Criteria and does not
constitute a representation or warranty that Purchaser’s House Plans comply with
ASP Criteria and Purchaser shall be responsible for confirming such compliance.
 
(e)       Disclosures to Homebuyers. Purchaser shall include in each contract
for the sale of any Home constructed by Purchaser in the Development all
disclosures required by applicable laws, including, but not limited to the
Special District Disclosure, Common Interest Community Disclosure, Mineral
Disclosure and Source of Potable Water Disclosure, and any other disclosure that
applicable laws require to be made to each homebuyer regarding
expansive/low-density soils, radon, NORMs, and other matters (“Homebuyer
Disclosures”). Purchaser shall furnish to Seller upon request a copy of
Purchaser’s disclosures to homebuyers which includes the Homebuyer Disclosures.
 
13.        Force Majeure. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this
Contract, the time for performance of any obligation of Seller or Purchaser
under this Contract (except for any monetary obligation of either party) shall
be extended if such performance is delayed due to any act, or failure to act, of
any Authority, strike, riot, act of war, act of terrorism, act of violence,
weather, act of God, epidemic/pandemic, or any other act, occurrence or
non-occurrence beyond such party’s reasonable control (each, an “Uncontrollable
Event”). Any extension under the preceding sentence shall continue for a length
of time reasonably necessary to satisfy such delayed obligation; provided,
however, that such extension shall not be for a period of time which is less
than the duration of the Uncontrollable Event. If a party claims a delay due to
an Uncontrollable Event, then such party shall provide written notice to the
other party of the occurrence of a condition that constitutes an Uncontrollable
Event, which notice shall reasonably detail the reason(s) giving rise to the
Uncontrollable Event and a reasonable estimation of the duration (to the extent
determinable at the time of such notice) of the delay that was caused by the
Uncontrollable Event. Each party will make efforts to minimize the delay from
any such Uncontrollable Event to the extent reasonably feasible; provided,
however, that neither party shall be required to use extraordinary means and/or
incur extraordinary costs in order to satisfy its obligations.
 
14.        Cooperation. Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with and require
its agents, employees, subcontractors and other representatives to cooperate
with all other parties involved in construction within the Development,
including, where applicable, the granting of a nonexclusive license to enter
upon the Property conveyed to Purchaser. Purchaser shall execute any and all
documentation reasonably required by Seller or the Authorities to effectuate any
desired modification or change in connection with Seller’s activities in the
Development including, without limitation, amendments or restatements of the
Master Covenants, or any Final Plat; provided, however, Purchaser shall not be
obligated to execute any such documentation if it will materially adversely
affect the fair market value of the Property or Purchaser’s ability to construct
or to sell its proposed homes within the Property, or if it will materially
increase the cost of such construction, interfere with or delay such
construction.
 
29

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15.          Fees. Subject to the provisions of Sections 16 and 18 below:
 
(a)          FHA/VA. Seller shall not be required to obtain any approvals
pursuant to FHA, VA or other governmental programs relating to the Lots or the
financing of improvements thereon.
 
(b)        Utility Company Refunds. Any refunds from utility providers relating
to construction deposits for the Property shall be the exclusive property of
Seller. Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in turning over any such funds and
directing those funds to Seller.
 
16.         Water and Sewer Taps; Fees; and District Matters.
 
(a)      Rangeview Metropolitan District. The water and sewer service provider
for the Lots is the Rangeview Metropolitan District (“Rangeview”) and Purchaser
shall be required to purchase water and sewer taps for the Lots from Rangeview
pursuant to the terms and provisions of a tap purchase agreement in a form
substantially consistent with the one attached hereto and incorporated herein as
Exhibit F (the “Tap Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the Tap Purchase
Agreement, Rangeview will agree to sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser will agree
to purchase from Rangeview, a water and sewer tap for each Lot in accordance
with an agreed-upon purchase schedule, but in no event later than the issuance
of a building permit for a Lot. The Tap Purchase Agreement shall be executed by
Rangeview and Purchaser on or before the date of the First Closing. If Rangeview
and Purchaser are unable to agree on a Tap Purchase Agreement before the
expiration of the Due Diligence Period, the Initial Deposit shall be promptly
returned to Purchaser, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller all information and
materials received by Purchaser from Seller pertaining to the Property and any
non-confidential and non-proprietary information otherwise obtained by Purchaser
pertaining to the Property, and thereafter the parties shall have no further
rights or obligations under this Contract except as otherwise provided in
Section 25 below. The combined cost to purchase a water tap and sewer will be
dependent on Lot size, house square footage, number of floors, driveway lanes,
outdoor irrigated square footage, and xeriscape square footage. For example,
based on Rangeview’s rates and charges as of the Effective Date as set forth in
that certain fee schedule attached hereto as Exhibit G (the “Lot Development Fee
Schedule”), a 5,500 square foot lot with a 2,400 square foot house 2 story 2 car
garage with 1,500 square feet of grass would have a computed tap fee equating to
a .9 SFE (1 SFE equal to .4 acre feet of water demand per year) or $24,488.10,
and a sewer tap fee of $4,752.
 
30

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)        District Governance and Financial Matters. The Property is included
within the boundaries of the District and with water and sewer service provided
by Rangeview. Persons affiliated with Seller have been elected or appointed to
the board of directors (“Board”) of the District and Rangeview and serve in that
capacity. Purchaser shall not qualify any persons affiliated with Purchaser as
its representative to serve on the Board of the District or Rangeview and this
prohibition shall survive all Closings and delivery of deeds hereunder until no
person affiliated with Seller serves on the Board. The District has been formed
for purposes that include, but are not limited to financing, owning, maintaining
and/or managing certain tracts and infrastructure improvements (“District
Improvements”) to serve the Development, including the Lots. Purchaser
acknowledges that: (i) the construction of District Improvements shall be
without compensation or reimbursement to Purchaser; and (ii) any reimbursements,
credits, payments, or other amounts payable by the District or Rangeview on
account of the construction of District Improvements or any other matters
related thereto (“Metro District Payments”) shall remain the property of the
Seller and shall not be conveyed to or otherwise be claimed by Purchaser. Upon
request of Seller, the District, or Rangeview, Purchaser will execute any and
all documents that may be reasonably required to confirm Purchaser’s waiver of
any right to Metro District Payments. The provisions of this Section are
material in determining the Purchase Price, and the Purchase Price would have
been higher but for the provisions of this Section. Seller shall provide to
Purchaser as part of the Seller Documents information available relating to the
District including the service plan and schedule of current fees and charges.
This Section shall survive each Closing as set forth herein.
 
(c)        Sky Ranch Community Authority Board. Pursuant to the Colorado
Constitution, Article XIV, Sections 18(2)(a) and (b), and C.R.S. Sections
29-1-203 and -203.5, metropolitan districts may cooperate or contract with each
other to provide any function, service or facility lawfully authorized to each,
and any such contract may provide for the sharing of costs, the impositions of
taxes, and the incurring of debt. Pursuant to the Modified Service Plans for Sky
Ranch Metropolitan District Nos. 1, 3, 4 and 5 (“Sky Ranch Districts”), approved
by Arapahoe County on September 14, 2004, as amended (“Service Plans”), and
pursuant to statutory authority, the Sky Ranch Metropolitan District Nos. 1 and
5 have entered into a Sky Ranch Community Authority Board Establishment
Agreement (“CABEA”), creating the CAB. It is anticipated that the Boards of Sky
Ranch Metropolitan District Nos. 3 and 4 will elect to become parties to the
CABEA in the future. The CABEA authorizes the CAB and the Sky Ranch Districts
that are parties to the CABEA to cooperate and contract with each other
regarding administrative and operational functions. One or more of the Sky Ranch
Districts, the CAB or other governmental entity may enter into an
intergovernmental agreement (an “IGA”) pursuant to C.R.S. §§ 29-1-203 and -203.5
to create the Regional Improvement Authority to use revenue generated by the
imposition of the Regional Improvements Mill Levy to plan, design, acquire,
construct, install, relocate, and/or redevelop the Regional Improvements, and
for the administration, overhead and operations and maintenance costs incurred
with respect to the Regional Improvements serving the Development. The Regional
Improvement Authority’s authority may include, without limitation, (i) sharing
or pledging revenue, including ad valorem taxes, to provide a source of funding
to pay for specific regional improvements that serve the Development, (ii) the
issuance of debt by the CAB or other governmental authority to pay for regional
improvements, and (iii) the construction of regional improvements. If and to the
extent that the District enters into such an IGA, Builder agrees that it will
not object to the IGA creating the Regional Improvements Authority; provided
that the total mill levy on a Lot does not exceed the Maximum Mills Limitation.
 
31

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d)          Fees.
 
(i)          Seller shall pay any and all of the following to the extent imposed
by any Authority in connection with the Property conveyed to Purchaser: (i) any
parks and recreation fees (including park dedication requirements and/or
cash-in-lieu payments related to the Property as part of the platting thereof);
(ii) drainage fees; (iii) fees for payment-in-lieu of school land dedications.
 
(ii)         Purchaser shall pay all costs or fees that may be imposed by any
Authority relating to the construction, use or occupancy of the Homes to be
constructed on the Lots and any ongoing or periodic maintenance and operations
fees and charges levied or otherwise imposed on Lot owned by Purchaser by any
Authority, including without limitation, those fees set forth in the Lot
Development Fee Schedule attached hereto as Exhibit G; provided, however, that
the fees set forth on Exhibit G are reflective only of the assessments as of the
Effective Date hereof and are subject to periodic increases as determined by the
assessing Authority. Without limiting the foregoing, and except for the fees to
be paid by Seller pursuant to Section 16(d)(i) above, Purchaser shall pay any
and all of the following to the extent imposed in connection with the Property
conveyed to Purchaser: (i) system development fees; (iii) any infrastructure
(facility) fee, including, without limitation, any transportation/road fee,
which may be imposed either by the County, the District or other Authority; (iv)
any impact fees and payment-in-lieu of land dedication fees imposed for roads or
other facilities that are payable at issuance of a building permit for a Home
constructed on a Lot; and (v) any excise fees.
 
(iii)       As of the Effective Date, the District does not levy a system
development fee (“SDF”) against property within the District. If the District at
any time before a Closing adopts a SDF, then at such Closing (and subsequent
Closings) the Purchaser shall pay the District’s SDF applicable to the Lots. In
order to offset Purchaser’s payment of the District’s SDF for a Lot at a
Closing, Purchaser shall receive a credit against the Purchase Price paid by
Purchaser for such Lot at such Closing equal to the amount of the District’s SDF
paid by Purchaser for the Lot.
 
(iv)        The covenants set forth in this Section 16 shall survive each
respective Closing and shall represent a continuing obligation until the
complete satisfaction or payment thereof.
 
17.         Homeowners’ Association. Certain alleys, walkways, landscape tracts,
and other private improvements will serve the Property and may also serve lots
acquired by other builders within Phase B. In order to address the maintenance
obligations related to such private improvements, Seller shall establish a
homeowners’ association that will own and/or maintain such private improvements
(the “Homeowners’ Association”) and cause the Lots to be annexed into such
Homeowners’ Association at Closing hereunder. Within thirty (30) days after the
Effective Date, Seller will deliver to Purchaser (and the other builders) for
its review and reasonable approval, a declaration with respect to the
maintenance of those private improvements (the “Maintenance Declaration”).
Purchaser shall have until fifteen (15) days before the end of the Due Diligence
Period, as the same may be extended, to notify Seller in writing of any
objection that Purchaser may have to the draft Maintenance Declaration. On or
before the fifth (5th) business day following Seller’s receipt of Buyer’s
objections to the draft Maintenance Declaration, Seller shall notify Buyer, in
writing, whether Seller elects to make such modifications to the draft
Maintenance Declaration, with Seller not to unreasonably withhold its consent to
Purchaser’s request; provided, however, that if Seller does not elect to modify,
or elects to modify and does not thereafter modify the Maintenance Declaration
within such 5-business day period and such decision is made on a reasonable
basis, Purchaser shall have the right to either: (i) terminate this Agreement by
delivery of a written termination notice to Seller on or before the end of the
Due Diligence Period, in which event the entire Initial Deposit shall be
promptly returned to Purchaser, Purchaser shall return to Seller all information
and materials received by Purchaser from Seller pertaining to the Property, and
thereafter the Parties shall have no further rights or obligations under this
Agreement except for those which expressly survive the termination hereof; or
(ii) waive any objections to the Maintenance Declaration and proceed with the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, in which event Purchaser shall be
deemed to have approved the Maintenance Declaration as to which its objections
have been waived. Upon approval of the form of the Maintenance Declaration by
the Parties, the Parties will cause such form to be attached to this Agreement
by a mutually executed amendment hereto. The Maintenance Declaration shall be
recorded in the Records at or before the First Closing and shall constitute a
Permitted Exception hereunder.
 
32

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

18.        Reimbursements and Credits. Purchaser shall have no right to any
reimbursements and/or cost-sharing agreements pursuant to any agreements entered
into between Seller or any of Seller’s affiliates and third parties which may or
may not affect the Property. In addition, Purchaser acknowledges that Seller,
its affiliates, the District, the PID, or other metropolitan district, has
installed or may install certain infrastructure improvements (“Infrastructure
Improvements”) the Interchange Upgrades, and/or donate, dedicate and/or convey
certain rights, improvements and/or real property (“Dedications”) to the County
or other Authority which benefit all or any part of the Property, together with
adjacent properties, and which entitle Seller or its affiliates and/or the
Property or any part thereof to certain reimbursements by the County or other
Authority or credits by the County or other Authority for park fees, open space
fees, school impact fees, capital expansion fees and other governmental fees
which would otherwise be required to be paid to the County or other governmental
or quasi-governmental entity by the owner of the Property or any part thereof
from time to time (“Governmental Fees”). In the event Purchaser is entitled to a
credit or waiver of Governmental Fees by the County and/or any other Authority
as a result of the Infrastructure Improvements, the Interchange Upgrades, and/or
any Dedications, then, in such event, Purchaser shall pay to or reimburse Seller
and/or its designated affiliates in an amount equal to such credited or waived
Governmental Fees at the same time that the Governmental Fees would otherwise be
payable by Purchaser or its assignees to the County or other Authority but for
the construction of the Infrastructure Improvements, the Interchange Upgrades,
and/or any Dedications by Seller, its affiliates, the District, or other
Authority. In addition, Purchaser acknowledges that Seller or its affiliate(s)
may have negotiated or may negotiate with the County or other Authority for
reimbursements to Seller or its affiliates. Purchaser acknowledges that certain
Governmental Fees which may be paid by Purchaser to the County or other
Authority may be reimbursed to Seller and/or its affiliates pursuant to the
terms of said agreement. The obligations and covenants set forth in this Section
18 shall survive the Closing of the purchase and sale of the Property and shall
represent a continuing obligation of Purchaser until complete satisfaction
thereof. Purchaser shall be released from the obligations in this Section 18 to
the extent such obligations are assumed in writing by a subsequent owner of all
or a portion of the Property and a copy of such written assumption is furnished
to Seller. Each special warranty deed conveying the applicable portion of the
Property at each Closing shall contain the foregoing reimbursement covenant,
which reimbursement covenant shall expressly state that it automatically
terminates as to any Lot upon issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a home
constructed on the Lot and conveyance of the Lot to a homebuyer.
 
33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19.        Name and Logo. The name and logo of “Sky Ranch” are wholly owned by
Seller. Purchaser agrees that it shall not use or allow the use of the name “Sky
Ranch” or any logo, symbol or other words or phrases which are names or
trademarks used or registered by Seller or any of its affiliates in any manner
to name, designate, advertise, sell or develop the Property or in connection
with the operation or business located or to be located upon the Property
without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent may be withheld for
any reason. Any consent to the use of such names or logos may be conditioned
upon Purchaser entering into a license agreement with Seller, as applicable, at
no additional cost to Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however,
Purchaser shall have a non-exclusive, royalty-free license for so long as
Purchaser is building and selling homes in the Development, without the need for
any further consent or approval by Seller, to use the name and logo of “Sky
Ranch” in connection with the use, marketing, sales, development and operation
of the Property, provided that Purchaser shall comply with any requirements
uniformly applicable to all homebuilders in Sky Ranch that Seller promulgates
with respect to such usage.
 
20.        Renderings. All renderings, plans or drawings of the Property or the
Development locating landscaping, trees and any improvements are artists’
conceptions only and may not accurately reflect their actual location. Purchaser
waives any claims based upon any inaccuracy in the location of such items as
depicted on the renderings, plans or drawings.
 
21.       Communications Improvements. Seller may, but is not obligated to,
enter into an agreement with a service provider for the development and
installation of Communication Improvements in all or any portion of the
Development. “Communications Improvements” means any equipment, property and
facilities, if used or useful in connection with the delivery, deployment,
provision or modification of (a) broadband Internet access service; (b)
monitoring service, for the benefit of governmental entities, quasi-governmental
entities, or utilities, regarding the usage of electricity, gas, water and other
resources; (c) video programming or content, including Internet protocol
television (a/k/a “IPTV”) service; (d) voice over Internet protocol (a/k/a
“VoIP”) service; (e) telecommunications services, including voice; (f) any other
service or services delivered by means of the Internet or otherwise delivered by
means of digital signals; and (g) any other service or services based on
technology that is similar to or is a technological extension of any of the
foregoing (“Service”). Communications Improvements do not include any equipment,
facilities or property located or in the home of a person who receives services
from the service provider, such as, but not limited to routers, wireless access
points, in-house wiring, set-top boxes, game consoles, gateways and other
equipment under the control of the owner or occupant of the home. Seller may
grant to such service provider one or more permanent, non-exclusive, perpetual,
assignable and recordable easements (collectively referred to as the “Easement”)
to access and use the Property and other property within the Development, as
necessary, appropriate or desirable, to lay, install, construct, reconstruct,
modify, operate, maintain, repair, enhance, upgrade, regulate, remove, replace
and otherwise use the Communications Improvements. So long as any such Easement

Homes on the Lots, Purchaser shall not object to and shall cooperate with Seller
in connection with the installation and operation of the Communications
Improvements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22.        Soil Hauling. Purchaser shall be responsible for either relocating
from the Property all surplus soil generated during Purchaser’s construction of
structures on the Property or to import any necessary fill required to complete
Purchaser’s Overex activities or other construction activities. At the option of
Seller, in its sole discretion, the surplus soil shall be transported at
Purchaser’s expense, to a site designated by Seller within the Development;
provided, that Seller has designated and made such a site available to Purchaser
at the time Purchaser is ready to transport surplus soils, if any. Purchaser may
choose its preferred form of transport for such surplus soils, subject to
Seller’s prior written consent to such form of transport, and provided that
Purchaser shall not damage any portion of the Development or interfere with
Seller’s activities within the Development. If and to the extent that Seller
establishes stock pile site within the Development, Seller may modify any such
stock pile locations from time to time in Seller’s discretion (but Purchaser
shall not have any obligation to relocate any soil Purchaser previously
delivered to the prior designated stock pile site). At Seller’s request,
Purchaser shall supply copies of any reports or field assessments identifying
the material characteristics of the excess soil prior to accepting such soil for
fill purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Seller does not
establish a stock pile site or elects not to accept any surplus soils from
Purchaser, then Purchaser shall, at its sole expense, find a purchaser or taker
or otherwise transport and dispose of such surplus soil upon such terms as it
shall desire, but such surplus soil must still be removed from the Property and
may not be stockpiled on the Property or within the Development after
construction has been completed. At the option of Developer, in its sole
discretion, if Builder needs to import any necessary fill that is required to
complete Builder’s construction activities and Developer has fill dirt available
on the Property, then Developer may make available to Builder, on terms and
conditions determined by Developer, any such fill dirt for transport at
Builder’s expense.

Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the United States Department of the Treasury
(including those named on OFAC’s Specially Designated and Blocked Persons List)

thereto. Seller represents and warrants to Purchaser that Seller and all persons
and entities owning (directly or indirectly) an ownership interest in Seller are
currently in compliance with and shall at all times prior to the Closing of this

in whole or in part under this Contract without the consent of Purchaser.
 
35

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)         Purchaser’s Assignment. The obligations of the Purchaser under this
Contract are personal in nature, and neither this Contract nor any rights,
interests, or obligations of Purchaser under this Contract may be transferred or
assigned without the prior written consent of Seller, except that Purchaser may
assign its rights or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written
consent of Seller, to (i) any affiliate of Purchaser, or (ii) any third-party
from which Purchaser has a contractual right to acquire the Lots pursuant to an
option agreement or similar arrangement with such third-party, but Purchaser
shall not be released from any obligations hereunder.
 
25.         Survival. All covenants and agreements of either party which are
intended to be performed in whole or in part after any Closing or termination of
this Contract, and all representations, warranties and indemnities by either
party to the other under this Contract shall survive such Closing or termination
of this Contract and shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided,
however, that Seller’s Representations pursuant to this Contract shall survive
each respective Closing for a period of six (6) months, and any action by
Purchaser based on a breach of any of such Seller’s Representations must be
brought within such six (6) month period.
 
26.        Condemnation. If a condemnation action is filed or either party
receives written notice from any competent condemning authority of intent to
condemn which directly affects any Lot or Lots which Purchaser has a right to
purchase, either party may at its sole discretion by written notice to the other
party within ten (10) days following receipt of such condemnation notice
terminate this Contract as to the Lots subject to the condemnation action and
receive a refund of a prorata portion of the Deposit with respect to those Lots
only, and the parties shall have no further rights or obligations with respect
to those Lots. If the right to terminate is not exercised by either party, this
Contract shall remain in full force and effect with respect to the Lot in
question and upon exercise of the right to purchase the Lot, the Closing shall
proceed in accordance with the terms of this Contract. Any condemnation award
shall be paid to the party who is the owner of the affected Lot at the time the
award is determined by the condemning authority.

losses, damages or claims which may result from any broker, agent or finder,
licensed or otherwise, claiming through, under or by reason of the conduct of
either of them respectively in connection with the purchase of the Lots by
Purchaser.
 
28.         Default and Remedies. Time is of the essence hereof. If any amount
received as a Deposit hereunder or any other payment due hereunder is not paid
by Purchaser, honored or tendered when due and payable, or if each Closing is
not consummated as required in accordance with Section 8 above, or if any other
covenant, agreement, obligation or condition hereunder is not performed or
waived as herein provided within five (5) days (or such longer period as
required under this Contract) after the party failing to perform the same has
received written notice of such failure, there shall be the following remedies:
 
36

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a)         Purchaser’s Default. If Purchaser is in default under this Contract,
Seller may terminate this Contract, in which event the Deposit shall be
forfeited and retained on behalf of Seller, and both parties shall, except as
otherwise provided herein, thereafter be released from all obligations
hereunder. It is agreed that, except as otherwise provided in this subpart (a)
and in subparts (c) and (d) below and except with respect to the indemnification
by Purchaser in Sections 10, 12 and 27 above, such payments and things of value
are LIQUIDATED DAMAGES and are SELLER’S SOLE AND ONLY REMEDY for Purchaser’s
failure to perform the obligations of this Contract prior to the Closing. Except
as otherwise provided in this Contract, Seller expressly waives the remedies of
specific performance and additional damages with respect to a default by
Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other contrary provision of this
Contract, Seller’s right to file a claim against Purchaser in accordance with
any provision of this Contract pursuant to which Purchaser agrees to indemnify,
hold harmless and defend Seller from and against any losses, costs, claims,
causes of action or liabilities of any kind or nature, or pursuant to which
Purchaser waives any rights or claims that it may have against Seller, shall
survive for twelve (12) months after any termination of this Contract, and shall
be and remain fully enforceable against Purchaser for said twelve (12) month
period in accordance with the terms of this Contract and applicable laws.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other indemnity provision contained herein,
Purchaser shall not be liable for and Seller shall not be entitled to recover
from Purchaser exemplary, punitive, special, indirect, consequential, lost
profits or any other damages.
 
(b)          Seller’s Default. If Seller is in default under this Contract,
Purchaser may elect AS ITS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY either: (i) to treat this
Contract as canceled, in which case the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser,
and Purchaser shall have the right to recover, as damages, all out‑of‑pocket
expenses incurred by it in negotiating this Contract and in inspecting,
analyzing or otherwise performing its rights and obligations pursuant to this
Contract, but in no event will the amount of such damages exceed Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000.00); or (ii) Purchaser may elect to treat this Contract as
being in full force and effect and Purchaser shall have a right to specific
performance, provided that any such action for specific performance must be
commenced within sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable notice
and cure period provided herein, and, in the event specific performance is not
available, then Purchaser may pursue the remedy set forth in clause (i) above.
Seller shall not be liable for and Purchaser shall not be entitled to recover
exemplary, punitive, special, indirect, consequential, lost profits or any other
damages (except for recovery of out‑of‑pocket expenses as set forth in clause
(i) above).
 
(c)        Indemnity. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Contract,
any and all provisions of this Contract pursuant to which a party agrees to
indemnify, hold harmless and defend the other party from and against any losses,
costs, claims, causes of action or liabilities of any kind or nature, or
pursuant to which a party waives any rights or claims that it may have against
the other party, shall survive any termination of this Contract, and shall be
and remain fully enforceable against a party in accordance with the terms of
this Contract and applicable laws.
 
(d)        Award of Costs and Fees. Anything to the contrary herein
notwithstanding, in the event of any litigation arising out of this Contract
related to an action for specific performance brought by either party as
permitted in accordance with the terms of this Contract, the court shall award
the substantially prevailing party all reasonable costs and expenses, including
attorneys’ fees, incurred by the substantially prevailing party in the
litigation or other proceedings.
 
37

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(e)         Post-Closing Defaults. With respect to post-closing defaults, the
parties agree that the non-defaulting party shall be entitled to exercise all
remedies available at law or in equity, except that damages shall be limited to
actual out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred. The foregoing does not limit
or control the remedies as are to be separately provided in the Lot Development
Agreement.

are subject to Purchaser’s SWPPP (as hereafter defined), Purchaser shall be
solely responsible for complying with the SWPPP, installing and maintaining all
required best management practices (“BMPs”), and conducting and documenting all

Purchaser’s SWPPP with respect to all of the Lots then owned by Purchaser, and
shall comply with all local, state, and federal environmental obligations
(including stormwater) associated with its ownership of, development of, or
construction on, all such Lots. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller
harmless from all third party claims and causes of action solely arising from
breach of the foregoing covenants of Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, Seller is only responsible for complying with the SWPPP to the extent
required to complete Seller’s development work on the Property and is otherwise
not obligated to install any other stormwater management facilities on the Lots,
as shown in the CDs, including without limitation, any SWPPP work to be
conducted by Purchaser, its successors and assigns..

RESERVATIONS AND COVENANTS


Reservation of Easements. For a period of twenty-five (25) years following the
date hereof, Grantor expressly reserves unto itself, its successors and assigns,
easements for construction of utilities and other facilities to support the
development of the properties commonly known as “Sky Ranch,” including but not
limited to sanitary sewer, water lines, electric, cable, broad‑band and
telephone transmission, storm drainage and construction access easements across
the Property allowing Grantor or its assignees the right to install and maintain
sanitary sewer, water lines, cable television, broad‑band, electric, and
telephone utilities on the Property and on its adjacent property, and further,
to accommodate storm drainage from its adjacent property. Such easements shall
not allow above-grade surface installation of facilities and shall require the
restoration of any surface damage or disturbance caused by the exercise of such
easements, shall not be located within the building envelope of any Lot or
otherwise interfere with the use of a Lot for construction of Grantee’s homes,
shall not materially detract from the value, use or enjoyment of (i) the
remaining portion of the Property on which such easements are to be located, or
(ii) any adjoining property of Grantee, and shall not require any reduction in
allowed density for the Property or reconfiguration of planned lots or the
building envelope on a lot. If possible, such easements shall be located within
the boundaries of existing easement areas. Grantor, at its sole expense, shall
immediately restore the land and improvements thereon to their prior condition
to the extent of any damage incurred due to Grantor’s utilization of the
easements herein reserved.


Reservation of Minerals and Mineral Rights. To the extent owned by Grantor,
Grantor herein expressly excepts and reserves unto itself, its successors and
assigns, all right, title and interest in and to all minerals and mineral
rights, including bonuses, rents, royalties, royalty interests and other
benefits that may be payable as a result of any oil, gas, gravel, minerals or
mineral rights on, in, under or that may be produced from the Property,
including, but not limited to, all gravel, sand, oil, gas and other liquid
hydrocarbon substances, casinghead gas, coal, carbon dioxide, helium, geothermal
resources, and all other naturally occurring elements, compounds and substances,
whether similar or dissimilar, organic or inorganic, metallic or non-metallic,
in whatever form and whether occurring, found, extracted or removed in solid,
liquid or gaseous state, or in combination, association or solution with other
mineral or non-mineral substances, provided that Grantor expressly waives all
rights to use or damage the surface of the Property to exercise the rights
reserved in this paragraph and, without limiting such waiver, Grantor’s
activities in extracting or otherwise dealing with the minerals and mineral
rights shall not cause disturbance or subsidence of the surface of the Property
or any improvements on the Property.


B-1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reservation of Water and Water Rights. To the extent owned by Grantor, Grantor
herein expressly excepts and reserves unto itself, its successors and assigns,
all water and water rights, ditches and ditch rights, reservoirs and reservoir
rights, streams and stream rights, water wells and well rights, whether
tributary, non-tributary or not non-tributary, including, but not limited to,
all right, title and interest under C.R.S. 37-90-137 on, underlying, appurtenant
to or now or historically used on or in connection with the Property, whether
appropriated, conditionally appropriated or unappropriated, and whether
adjudicated or unadjudicated, including, without limitation, all State Engineer
filings, well registration statements, well permits, decrees and pending water
court applications, if any, and all water well equipment or other personalty or
fixtures currently used for the supply, diversion, storage, treatment or
distribution of water on or in connection with the Property, and all water and
ditch stock relating thereto; provided that Grantor expressly waives all rights
to use or damage the surface of the Property to exercise the rights reserved in
this paragraph and, without limiting such waiver, Grantor’s activities in
dealing with the water and water rights herein reserved shall not cause
disturbance or subsidence of the surface of the Property or any improvements on
the Property.


Reimbursements and Credits. Grantee shall have no right to any reimbursements
and/or cost-sharing agreements pursuant to any agreements entered into between
Grantor or any of Grantor’s affiliates and third parties which may or may not
affect the Property. In addition, Grantee acknowledges that Grantor, its
affiliates or one (1) or more metropolitan district(s) have installed or may
install certain infrastructure improvements (“Infrastructure Improvements”)
and/or donate, dedicate and/or convey certain rights, improvements and/or real
property (“Dedications”) to Arapahoe County (“County”) or other governmental
authority (“Authority”) which benefit all or any part of the Property, together
with adjacent properties, and which entitle Grantor or its affiliates and/or the
Property or any part thereof to certain reimbursements by the County or other
Authority or credits by the County or other Authority for park fees, open space
fees, school impact fees, capital expansion fees and other governmental fees
which would otherwise be required to be paid to the County or other Authority by
the owner of the Property or any part thereof from time to time (“Governmental
Fees”). In the event Grantee is entitled to a credit or waiver of Governmental
Fees by the County and/or other Authority as a result of the Infrastructure
Improvements and/or Dedications, then, in such event, Grantee shall pay to or
reimburse Grantor and/or its designated affiliates in an amount equal to such
credited or waived Governmental Fees at the same time that the Governmental Fees
would otherwise be payable by Grantee or its assignees to the County or other
Authority but for the construction of the Infrastructure Improvements and/or the
Dedications by Grantor, its affiliates and/or metropolitan district(s). In
addition, Grantee acknowledges that Grantee or its affiliate(s) may have
negotiated or may negotiate with the County or other Authority for
reimbursements to Grantor or its affiliates. Grantee acknowledges that certain
Governmental Fees which may be paid by Grantee to the County or other Authority
may be reimbursed to Grantor and/or its affiliates pursuant to the terms of said
agreement.


The obligations and covenants set forth herein shall be binding on Grantee, its
successors and assigns, and any subsequent owners of the Property, except that
homeowners shall have no obligation for any reimbursements provided herein. The
obligation for reimbursements described herein shall automatically terminate
(without the necessity of recording any document) with respect to any
residential lot as of the date of conveyance of such residential lot, together
with a residence constructed thereon, to a homebuyer. Any title insurance
company may rely on the automatic termination language set forth above for the
purpose of insuring title to a home.

EXHIBIT C


FINISHED LOT IMPROVEMENTS


1.            “Finished Lot Improvements” means the following improvements on,
to or with respect to the Lots or in public streets or tracts in the locations
as required by all approving Authorities to obtain building permits for home
improvements for the Lots, and substantially in accordance with the CDs:


(a)          overlot grading together with corner pins for each Lot installed in
place, graded to match the specified Lot drainage template within the CDs (but
not any Overex);


(b)          water and sanitary sewer mains and other required installations in
connection therewith identified in the CDs, valve boxes and meter pits,
substantially in accordance with the CDs approved by the approving Authorities,
together with appropriate markers;


(c)          storm sewer mains, inlets and other associated storm drainage
improvements pertaining to the Lots in the public streets as shown on the CDs;


(d)          curb, gutter, asphalt, sidewalks, street striping, street signage,
traffic signs, traffic signals (if any are required by the approving
Authorities), and other street improvements, in the private and/or public
streets as shown on the CDs; Seller will either have applied a final lift of
asphalt or in Seller’s discretion posted sufficient financial guarantees as
required by the County for the Lots to qualify for issuance of building permits
in lieu of such final lift of asphalt;


(e)          sanitary sewer service stubs if required by the Authorities,
connected to the foregoing sanitary sewer mains, installed into each respective
Lot (to a point beyond any utility easement), together with appropriate markers
of the ends of such stubs, as shown on the CDs;


(f)          water service stubs connected to the foregoing water mains
installed into each Lot (to a point beyond any utility easement), together with
appropriate markers of the ends of such stubs, as shown on the CDs;


(g)          Lot fill in compliance with the geotechnical engineer’s
recommendation, and with respect to any filled area or compacted area, provide
from a Colorado licensed professional soils engineer a HUD Data Sheet 79G
Certification (or equivalent) and a certification that the compaction and
moisture content recommendations of the soils engineer were followed and that
the grading of the respective Lots complies with the approved grading plans,
with overlot grading completed in conformance with the approving Authorities
approved grading plans within a +/- 0.2’ tolerance of the approved grading
plans; however, the Finished Lot Improvements do not include any Overex as
provided in Section 10(e) of the Contract;


(h)          all storm water management facilities as shown in the CDs; and


C-1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.            Dry Utilities. Electricity, natural gas, and telephone service
will be installed by local utility companies. The installations may not be
completed at the time of a Closing, and are not part of the Finish Lot
Improvements; provided, however, that: (i) with respect to electric distribution
lines and street lights, Seller will have signed an agreement with the electric
utility service provider and paid all costs and fees for the installation of
electric distribution lines and facilities to serve the Lots, and all sleeves
necessary for electric, gas, telephone and/or cable television service to the
Lots will be installed; (ii) with respect to gas distribution lines, Seller will
have signed an agreement with the gas utility service provider and paid all
costs and fees for the installation of gas distribution lines and facilities to
serve the Lots. Seller will take commercially reasonable efforts to assist
Purchaser in coordinating with these utility companies to provide final
electric, gas, telephone and cable television service to the residences on the
Lots, however, Purchaser must activate such services through an end user
contract. Purchaser acknowledges that in some cases the telephone and cable
companies may not have pulled the main line through the conduit if no closings
of residences have occurred. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if dry utilities
have not been installed upon Substantial Completion of the Finished Lot
Improvements, Seller shall be obligated to have contracted for same and paid all
costs and fees payable for such installation. Unless Seller has contracted for
such installation and paid such costs before the Effective Date, Seller will
give Purchaser notice when such contracts have been entered and such costs paid.
With respect to any Finished Lot Improvements that are required by the
subdivision improvement agreement applicable to the Lots but which are not
addressed as part of the Finished Lot Improvements, and any other improvements
which are not required for the issuance of building permits but which are
required by the Authorities so that dwellings and other improvements constructed
by Purchaser on the Lots are eligible for the issuance of certificates of
occupancy for homes, Seller shall complete such other improvements, to the
extent required by the County, so as not to delay the issuance of certificates
of occupancy for residences constructed by Purchaser on the Lots.


3.            Tree Lawns/Sidewalks. Notwithstanding anything in the Contract to
the contrary, Seller shall have no obligation to construct, install, maintain or
pay for the maintenance, construction and installation of (i) any landscaping or
irrigation for such landscaping behind the curb on any Lot that is to be
maintained by the owner of such lot (collectively, “Tree Lawns”), but Seller
shall be responsible for constructing and installing the detached sidewalks and
ramps (collectively, “Sidewalks”) that are located immediately adjacent to any
Lot or on a tract as required by the approved CDs, County, or any other
Authority and/or applicable laws as provided in this Contract. Purchaser shall
be responsible for installing any other lead walks, pathways, and driveways and
any other flatwork on the Lots. Purchaser shall install all Tree Lawns on or
adjacent to the Lots in accordance with all applicable CDs, requirements,
regulations, laws, development codes and building codes of all Authorities.


4.            Warranty.


(a)          Government Warranty Period. The Authorities require warranty
periods (each a “Government Warranty Period”) after the final completion that is
applicable to those Finished Lots Improvements that are dedicated to or owned,
and accepted for maintenance by the Authorities (the “Public Improvements”). In
the event defects in the Public Improvements to which a governmental warranty
(each a “Governmental Warranty”) applies become apparent during the applicable
Government Warranty Period, then Seller shall coordinate the repairs with the
applicable Authorities and cause the service provider(s) who performed the work
or supplied the materials in which the defect(s) appear to complete such repairs
or, if such service providers fail to correct such defects, otherwise cause such
defects to be repaired to the satisfaction of the Authorities. Any costs and
expenses incurred pursuant to a Government Warranty in connection with any
repairs or warranty work performed during the Government Warranty Period
(including, but not limited to, any costs or expenses incurred to enforce any
warranties against any service providers) shall be borne by Seller, unless such
defect was caused by Purchaser or its contractors, subcontractors, employees, or
agents, in which event Purchaser shall pay all such costs and expenses to the
extent such defect was caused by Purchaser or its contractors, subcontractors,
employees, or agents.


C-2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b)          Non-Government Warranty Period. Seller warrants (“Non-Government
Warranty”) to Purchaser that each Finished Lot Improvement, other than the
Public Improvements, shall have been constructed in accordance with the CDs for
one (1) year from the date of Substantial Completion of the Improvement (the
“Non-Government Warranty Period”). If Purchaser delivers written notice to
Seller of breach of the Non-Government Warranty during the Non-Government
Warranty Period, then Seller shall coordinate the corrections with Purchaser and
cause the service provider(s) who performed the work or supplied the materials
in which the breach of Non-Government Warranty appears to complete such
corrections or, if such service providers fail to make such corrections,
otherwise cause such corrections to be made to the reasonable satisfaction of
Purchaser. Any costs and expenses incurred in connection with a breach of the
Non-Government Warranty shall be borne by Seller (including, but not limited to,
any costs or expenses incurred to enforce any warranties against service
providers), unless such breach was caused by Purchaser or its contractors,
subcontractors, employees, or agents, in which event Purchaser shall pay all
such costs and expenses to the extent the breach was caused by Purchaser or its
contractors, subcontractors, employees, or agents.


(c)          EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION 3, SELLER MAKES NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND TO PURCHASER IN RELATION TO THE
FINISHED LOT IMPROVEMENTS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OF THE SAME AND SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO
REPAIR OR CORRECT AND SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY WITH RESPECT TO
ANY DEFECT IN IMPROVEMENTS FOR WHICH NO CLAIM IS ASSERTED DURING THE APPLICABLE
WARRANTY PERIOD.  If and to the extent C.R.S. 13.20-806(7) applies with respect
to any claim arising out of residential property, nothing in this Agreement is
intended to constitute a waiver of, or limitation on, the legal rights, remedies
or damages provided by the Construction Defect Action Reform Act, C.R.S.
13-20-801 et seq., or provided by the Colorado Consumer Protection Act, Article
1 of Title 6, C.R.S., as described in the Construction Defect Action Reform Act,
or on the ability to enforce such legal rights, remedies, or damages within the
time provided by applicable statutes of limitation or repose.

THIS LOT DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENT (this “LDA”) is made as of the ___ day of
_____________, 202__ (the “Effective Date”), by and between PCY HOLDINGS, LLC, a
Colorado limited liability company (“Developer”), and CHALLENGER DENVER, LLC, a
Colorado limited liability company (“Builder,”).  Developer and Builder are
sometimes individually referred to as a “Party” and collectively referred to as
the “Parties.”


RECITALS
 
A.         Developer owns certain real property located in Arapahoe County (the
“County”), Colorado which Developer is developing as part of the Sky Ranch
master planned residential community (“Development”). The preliminary concept
map for Phase B of the Development (“Concept Plan”) is depicted on Exhibit A
attached hereto (the “Property”). The Development is being subdivided in several
subdivision filings and developed in phases. The Builder Lots in each phase are
generally depicted on the Concept Plan.
 
B.          Pursuant to the terms of a separate Contract for Purchase and Sale
of Real Estate by and between Developer, as seller, and Builder, as purchaser,
as may be amended from time to time (the “Contract”), Builder is acquiring from
Developer a portion of the Property consisting of approximately 163 single
family residential lots (collectively, the “Builder Lots”) at four (4) closings
(each, a “Takedown”, and collectively, the “Takedowns”), as more specifically
described on Exhibit A, attached hereto and incorporated herein by this
reference.
 
C.          Pursuant to the Contract, Developer has agreed to construct, or
cause to be constructed, those public infrastructure improvements described in
the construction plans and specifications that have been approved by the
Approving Authorities (the “Plans”) and which relate to the final plat(s) of the
Property (each, a “Plat”) and the corresponding subdivision improvement
agreement (“SIA”) as identified in Exhibit B attached hereto (“Improvements”). 
To the extent that Developer has not obtained Final Approval (as defined in the
Contract) of any of the Plans as of the Effective Date, then at such time as any
such Plans have been so approved, and to the extent required, Exhibit B will be
replaced by an updated list of the final approved Plans by amendment to this LDA
(“Revised Exhibit B”).


D.          As required by the terms of the Contract, Builder has agreed (i) to
pay the Initial Purchase Price (as defined in the Contract) for the Builder Lots
that the Builder acquires at a Closing; and (ii) pay that portion of the
Purchase Price for the Builder Lots defined as the Deferred Purchase Price (as
hereinafter defined) in accordance with the terms and provisions of this LDA as
the Improvements are completed and as more particularly set forth herein.
 
E-1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


E.          The Parties now desire to enter into this LDA in order to set forth
the terms and conditions under which the Improvements will be constructed by the
Developer and provide for the payment of the Improvements, together with such
other matters as are set forth hereinafter.


AGREEMENT


NOW THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, Developer and Builder agree as follows:


1.           Incorporation of Recitals.  The Parties hereby acknowledge and
agree to the Recitals set forth above, which are incorporated herein by this
reference.
 
2.           Definitions.  Unless otherwise defined herein, all capitalized
terms used in this LDA and not defined in this LDA shall have the same meaning
as set forth in the Contract.


3.           Responsibilities of Developer and Builder.


3.1.        Constructing Party.  The Parties acknowledge and agree that, as of
the Effective Date hereof, Developer is the constructing party hereunder with
the obligation to construct, or cause to be constructed, the public
infrastructure improvements as provided herein, subject to the rights of Builder
and the other builders within the Development, as set forth in Section 4.6, (and
the other builders within the Development as set forth in such builders’
respective LDA), to appoint either Builder or another qualified third party as a
Substitute Constructing Party to assume and take over the construction of the
Improvements.  Any exercise by Builder of the Builder’s Step-In Option (under
Section 4.6), or any similar exercise by another builder within the Development
of its step-in option, shall apply only with respect to completion of the
Improvements to serve the Phase in which such step-in option was exercised.


3.2.        Generally.  Developer shall construct, or cause to be constructed,
the Improvements in substantial conformance with the approved Plans.  Developer
will coordinate, administer, and oversee (a) the preparation and filing of all
applications, filings, submittals, plans and specifications, and other documents
pertaining to construction and installation of the Improvements and (b)
construction and installation of the Improvements.  Developer may engage or
cause to be engaged consultants, contractors and subcontractors who will be
responsible for the construction of the Improvements and suppliers who will be
responsible for supplying labor, materials, equipment, services and other work
in connection with the construction of the Improvements (“Service Provider(s)”),
pursuant to the Construction Contracts (as hereinafter defined).  Developer and
Builder acknowledge and agree that the Developer may perform its obligations
under this Agreement, in whole or in part, by acting as the project manager
(“PM”) for Sky Ranch Community Authority Board (the “CAB”) and/or the Sky Ranch
Metropolitan District No. 3 (“District”) pursuant to one or more project
management service agreements (collectively, the “Service Agreements”) under
which the Developer will coordinate, manage and administer the construction of
the Improvements for the CAB and/or the District.  In either such event,
Developer may cause the engagement of the Service Providers for and on behalf of
the CAB and/or the District, as applicable, with respect to Improvements that
are constructed by the applicable entity, but Developer shall not be released
from its obligation to Builder to cause the completion of the Improvements,
whether or not Developer acts as PM for the CAB or the District. Each Service
Agreement will permit assignment thereof by Developer to Builder in the event
Builder becomes the Substitute Constructing Party (as set forth in Section
4.6.3).
 
E-2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3.         Legal Requirements; Bonds and Assurances.  Developer will comply
with all applicable laws in performing its obligations under this LDA.  As part
of the Costs, Developer shall provide to all applicable Approving Authorities
any bonds, assurance agreements, or other financial assurances required with
respect to the construction of the Improvements and provide to all applicable
Approving Authorities all warranties, bonds and other financial assurances
required to obtain permits for, and the preliminary and final acceptance and
approval of, the Improvements.  Builder shall take all commercially reasonable
actions and execute all documents requested by the Developer (at no cost or
liability to Builder) in its efforts to obtain releases of all such warranties,
bonds, and other financial assurances upon final acceptance of the Improvements
by the Approving Authorities.
 
3.4.         Taxes, Fees and Permits.  Developer, or the Service Providers,
shall pay all applicable sales, use, and other similar taxes pertaining to the
construction of the Improvements, and shall secure and pay for all approvals,
easements, assessments, charges, permits and governmental fees, licenses and
inspections necessary for proper construction and completion of the
Improvements, subject to the terms of the Contract and except as otherwise
provided in this LDA.
 
3.5.         Dedications.  Developer and Builder shall timely make all
conveyances and dedications of the Improvements as to any Improvements owned by
such Party if and as required by the Approving Authorities, free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances.
 
3.6.         Indemnity.  Developer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Builder and its owners, employees, members, managers, directors, officers,
agents, affiliates, successors and assigns (each a “Builder Indemnitee” and
collectively, the “Builder Indemnitees”) for, from and against all claims,
demands, liabilities, losses, damages (exclusive of special, consequential,
punitive, consequential and lost profits damages), costs and expenses, including
but not limited to court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of
material damage caused by Developer’s gross negligence or willful misconduct in
the performance of the construction of the Improvements undertaken by the
Developer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Developer shall not be obligated
under this LDA to indemnify the Builder to the extent such liabilities result
from the negligence or willful misconduct of any Builder Indemnitee and
Developer shall not be obligated hereby to indemnify Builder for any claims
arising out of geologic, soils, ground water or other physical conditions
affecting the Lots, or underdrains systems installed by the Developer according
to Plans reviewed and approved by Builder.  Builder shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Developer and its respective owners, affiliates, employees,
members, managers, directors, officers, agents, successors and assigns (each an
“Developer Indemnitee” and collectively, the “Developer Indemnitees”) for, from
and against all claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, costs and
expenses, including but not limited to court costs and reasonable attorneys’
fees, arising out of or relating to (i) Builder’s or its successor’s
development, construction, use, ownership, management, marketing or sales
activities associated with the Lots and the Property (including, without
limitation, land development, grading, excavation, trenching, and soils
compaction, and construction on the Builder Lots performed by or on behalf of a
Builder); (ii) the soils, subsurface geologic, groundwater or other physical
conditions present on or affecting the Builder Lots; (iii) any change subsequent
to the Effective Date in the Entitlements to the extent that the change was
caused, requested or made by Builder or the design of any residence for which
Builder obtained approval from Seller in accordance with Section 12(d) of the
Contract (each a “Home”, and collectively, the “Homes”) constructed on the
Builder Lots; or (e) homeowner claims asserting or relating to any implied
warranty of habitability, merchantability, or fitness for any particular purpose
in connection with Builder’s construction of one or more Homes on the Builder
Lots.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Builder shall not be obligated under this
LDA to indemnify, defend or hold harmless Developer from claims arising solely
out of a successor’s development, construction, use, ownership, management,
marketing or sales activities associated with the Builder Lots and the Property
if such successor is approved by Developer and gives Developer a substitute
indemnity that is equivalent to the indemnity provided by the Builder under this
Section 3.6 and such successor is financially sound as reasonably determined by
Developer. Obligations under this Section shall survive the termination or
expiration of this LDA.
 
E-3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.7.        Insurance.  Developer shall procure and maintain, or shall cause the
Service Providers to procure and maintain, the insurance described in Exhibit C
attached hereto during the construction of the Improvements and any warranty
work performed on the Improvements.
 
3.8.         Independent Contractor.  Developer is an independent contractor and
neither Developer nor its employees are entitled to worker’s compensation
benefits or unemployment insurance benefits through Builder as a result of
performing under the LDA.  The Developer is responsible for and obligated to pay
all assessable federal and state income tax on amounts earned or paid under this
LDA.
 
4.           Construction of Improvements.
 
4.1.         Plans and Specifications.  To the extent that Developer has not
obtained Final Approval of all of the Plans as of the Effective Date, Developer
shall (i) diligently finalize, process and obtain approval of the Plans from the
applicable Approving Authorities and (ii) apply to the utility service provider
for the preparation of electric, gas and telephone dry utility plans (“Utility
Plans”).  If and to the extent Developer receive copies of the approved Utility
Plans from the applicable utility service provider, then upon receipt of any
such approved Utility Plans, Developer will, upon written request by Builder,
furnish Builder with a copy of such Utility Plans.  If after Final Approval of
the Plans, Developer elects to amend such Plans in a manner that will result in
a Material Change (defined below), then Developer shall provide written notice
of such Material Change (a “Notice of Material Change”) to Builder if the
Builder Lots are affected by the change.  The Notice of Material Change shall
describe the modification to the Plans requested by Developer.  Builder shall
have five (5) business days after receipt of the Notice of Material Change to
object to the proposed Material Change (a “Notice of Material Change
Objection”).  Each Notice of Material Change Objection shall describe revisions
to the Material Change that would render it acceptable to Builder.  If Builder
fails to give a timely Notice of Material Change Objection to Developer, the
Material Change shall be deemed approved by Builder.  If Developer performs any
Material Change without first providing Builder with a Notice of Material
Change, or after receiving a Notice of Material Change Objection, which
objection has not been resolved in accordance with the following provisions,
then Developer shall assume responsibility for the cost of correcting any damage
resulting from such action.  Within five (5) business days after delivery to
Developer of a Notice of Material Change Objection, Developer and Builder shall
meet to approve or reject the Material Change.  If Developer and Builder cannot
reach an acceptable resolution regarding the Notice of Material Change
Objection, the dispute shall be resolved pursuant to the arbitration provision
set forth in Section 7 below.  For purposes of this Section 4.1, a “Material
Change” shall consist only of the following changes to the approved Plans for
the Improvements to be installed for the benefit of the Property which have
previously been approved by the applicable Approving Authorities:
 
E-4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1.1.     Reduction of the total number of Builder Lots available for the
construction of Homes by more than 10% in any phase or a reduction in the width
of the building envelope below the minimum dimension required by the Contract.
 
4.1.2.     Changes greater than one half (1/2) of one (1) foot to the proposed
finish grade elevation for any of the Builder Lots.
 
4.1.3.     Changes that prevent the construction of a Home on any Builder Lot.
 
4.2.        Construction Standard.  Developer shall cause the applicable
Improvements to be constructed in accordance with the Construction Standard and
shall obtain preliminary and final acceptance thereof by all Approving
Authorities.  As used herein, the term “Construction Standard” means
construction and installation of the Improvements in a good, workmanlike and
lien‑free manner and in substantial conformity with the Plans (as may be
modified pursuant to the terms hereof), in compliance with the terms of the SIA
which corresponds to the Plat(s) containing the applicable Builder Lots, and in
substantial conformity with the applicable requirements of the Approving
Authorities and the “Finished Lot Standard” set forth on Exhibit D attached
hereto.  The Construction Standard does not include, and Developer shall have no
obligation with respect to, any so-called “over excavation” or comparable
preparation or mitigation of the soil (hereinafter defined as the “Overex”) on
the Builder Lots, and the Developer shall have no obligation to complete any
Improvement required by the SIA (or any Plat), which is not necessary to obtain
building permits (or certificates of occupancy) for the Builder Lots included in
the applicable Phase.  Builder shall be solely and exclusively responsible with
respect to any Overex that the Builder determines to undertake on the Builder
Lots.  The terms and provision of Section 10(e) (Over Excavation) of the
Contract are hereby incorporated herein by this reference.  The Parties,
including as applicable any Substitute Constructing Party, shall reasonably
cooperate in coordinating the Builder’s completion of the Overex so that the
Overex can be properly sequenced with Developer’s completion of the
Improvements.  In no event shall Developer be liable to Builder for any delay,
costs or damages incurred with respect to such Overex, even if caused by any
delay in installation of Improvements sequenced ahead of the Overex and such any
delay shall extend, on a day-for-day basis, the applicable Substantial
Completion Deadline (as set forth herein).
 
E-5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.3.        Construction Contracts for Work.  Developer and contractors of
Developer shall construct and/or contract for all of the work and materials for
the construction of the applicable Improvements.  Developer shall have the right
to bid, pursue, negotiate, agree to and execute contracts and agreements with
Service Providers for the work and materials comprising the Improvements (each a
“Construction Contract” and collectively, the “Construction Contracts”), based
upon forms that Developer deems necessary or appropriate in its commercially
reasonable discretion.  Developer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to:
(i) cause each Construction Contract to identify Builder as an intended
third-party beneficiary of such Construction Contract (including, without
limitation, the warranty and indemnity provisions thereof); (ii) require the
Service Provider to name the Builder as additional insured on all required
insurance maintained by the Service Provider for a period expiring not sooner
than final acceptance of the Improvements by the applicable Approving Authority
for which such Service Provider furnished materials or work; (iii) require the
Service Providers to provide a warranty on materials and labor supplied by such
Service Provider for a period coterminous with the warranty period required by
the applicable Approving Authorities for Improvements to be dedicated to an
Approving Authority; (iv) require the Service Provider to perform its work in
accordance with the Construction Standard; (v) require the Service Provider to
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Developer from all claims and causes of
action arising from the negligent acts or omissions or intentional misconduct of
the Service Provider or its employees or agents; (vi) permit retainage in an
amount of at least five percent (5%) of the amounts payable to the Service
Provider, until the work to be completed pursuant to such contract has been
substantially completed and, if applicable, granted initial acceptance by the
applicable Approving Authority; and (vii) provide for no limitation on remedies
against the Service Provider for a default except the prohibition of recovery of
punitive damages.  Upon receipt of written request from Builder, Developer shall
deliver a copy of each Construction Contract to Builder.
 
4.4.        Commencement and Completion Dates.  Developer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause construction of the Improvements to be commenced and
completed as follows:


4.4.1.      Commencement; Construction Schedule; Completion.  The Improvements
will be completed in phases consisting of one phase with respect to the Takedown
1 Lots, one subsequent phase with respect to the Takedown 2 Lots, one subsequent
phase with respect to the Takedown 3 Lots, and one subsequent phase with respect
to the Takedown 4 Lots, for a total of four (4) phases (each a “Phase”). 
Developer shall cause Substantial Completion (as hereinafter defined) of the
Improvements in each Phase to occur on or before the applicable deadline
therefor (each, a “Substantial Completion Deadline”), subject to Section 4.4.2
below.  The Substantial Completion of the first Phase of Improvements (“Phase
1”) shall occur on or before that date which is twelve (12) months after the
First Closing of the Takedown 1 Lots (the “Phase 1 Completion Deadline”);
Substantial Completion of the second Phase of Improvements (“Phase 2”) shall
occur on or before that date which is the later of (a) twelve (12) months after
the Second Closing of the Takedown 2 Lots and (b) ____________, 20__ (the “Phase
2 Completion Deadline”); Substantial Completion of the third Phase of
Improvements (“Phase 3”) shall occur on or before that date which is the later
of (i) twelve (12) months after the Third Closing of the Takedown 3 Lots and
(ii) ____________, 20__ (the “Phase 3 Completion Deadline”); and Substantial
Completion of the fourth Phase of Improvements (“Phase 4”) shall occur on or
before that date which is the later of (A) twelve (12) months after the Fourth
Closing of the Takedown 4 Lots and (B) ____________, 20__ (the “Phase 4
Completion Deadline”).  Developer may cause Improvements to be constructed and
installed as Developer deems necessary, in the Developer’s commercially
reasonable discretion, to coordinate such Improvements with the development of
portions of the Development other than the Property; or cause Improvements to be
constructed and installed in accordance with scheduling requirements of the
County and other Approving Authorities or in advance of the Substantial
Completion dates set forth above.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
Developer shall have no obligation to install landscaping during the months of
October through April.
 
E-6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.4.2.     Force Majeure.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this LDA,
the Substantial Completion Deadline for each Phase and the time for performance
of any other Developer obligation under this LDA shall be extended if such
performance or progress in construction of the Improvements is delayed due to
any Dispute, as defined below, acts or failures to act of any Approving
Authority, strike, riot, act of war, act of terrorism, act of violence, weather,
act of God, epidemic/pandemic, or any other act, occurrence or non-occurrence
beyond Developer’s reasonable control (each, an “Uncontrollable Event”).  Any
extension under the preceding sentence shall continue for a length of time
reasonably necessary to satisfy such delayed obligation; provided, however, that
such extension shall not be for a period of time which is less than the duration
of the Uncontrollable Event.  If Developer claims a delay due to an
Uncontrollable Event, then Developer shall provide written notice to the Builder
of the occurrence of a condition that constitutes an Uncontrollable Event, which
notice shall reasonably detail the reason(s) giving rise to the Uncontrollable
Event and a reasonable estimation duration (to the extent determinable at the
time of such notice) of the delay that was caused by the Uncontrollable Event. 
Developer will make efforts to minimize the delay from any such Uncontrollable
Event to the extent reasonably feasible; provided, however, that Developer shall
not be required to use extraordinary means and/or incur extraordinary costs in
order to satisfy its obligations hereunder.
 
4.5.        Substantial Completion.
 
4.5.1.     Definition of Substantial Completion.  “Substantial Completion” of
the Improvements (or applicable component thereof) shall be deemed to have
occurred when; (a) the Improvements (or applicable component thereof) have been
installed pursuant to the Construction Standard and shall be substantially
complete so that Builder is not precluded from obtaining from the Approving
Authorities building permits for Homes constructed, or to be constructed, on any
Builder Lots solely as a result of such Improvements (or applicable component
thereof) not being complete; and (b) no mechanics’ or materialmen’s liens shall
have then been filed against any of the Builder Lots with respect to the
Improvements and final unconditional lien waivers have been obtained from the
Service Providers that constructed the Improvements (or applicable portion
thereof), or the Developer has obtained a bond to insure over any such
mechanics’ or materialmen’s liens.  Notwithstanding the foregoing to the
contrary, with respect to any Improvements that are required pursuant to the
Construction Standard (or the applicable subdivision improvement agreement), but
which are not required by the Approving Authority to obtain building permits,
but are necessary prior to the issuance of certificates of occupancy for Homes
on the Builder Lots, completion of such Improvements is not required to achieve
Substantial Completion, but the Developer shall either: (a) complete or cause
the completion of such other Improvements at a later time, or (b) post such
collateral, as required by the Approving Authorities in order to obtain
certificates of occupancy; so as not to delay the issuance of certificates of
occupancy for Homes constructed by Builder on the Builder Lots.
 
E-7

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.5.2.     Inspection.
 
(a)          Notice to Builder.  Developer shall notify the Builder in writing
when Substantial Completion of the Improvements (or applicable component
thereof) on the Builder Lots has been achieved, except for minor punch-list work
which does not affect the ability to obtain building permits or certificates of
occupancy, as applicable, for Homes on the Builder Lots.  Within ten (10) days
after receipt by the Builder such notice from the Developer, the Parties shall
jointly inspect the Improvements (or applicable component thereof) on the
Builder Lots and produce a punchlist (“Builder Punchlist”).  The Builder
Punchlist may not contain any items other than incomplete Improvements or
components thereof, deficient or defective construction of the Improvements or
components thereof, or failure to construct the Improvements or components
thereof in accordance with the Construction Standard.  Builder shall not be able
to object to, or provide Builder Punchlist items for, any portion of the
Improvements previously inspected by the Builder except in the case of
construction defects, or any portion of the Improvements constructed by Builder
as the Substitute Constructing Party.  If the Parties are unable to agree upon a
Builder Punchlist within five (5) business days after the joint inspection
described above, then any dispute related to such Builder Punchlist shall be
submitted to the expedited dispute resolution procedures in accordance with
Section 7 below.  Upon written request by the Builder, the Developer will
provide copies of any inspection reports or punchlists received from the
Approving Authorities in connection with the inspection of the Improvements, and
the Developer shall be responsible to correct punchlist items from the Approving
Authority and items set forth on the Builder Punchlist.  In the event of a
conflict between corrective action required by the Approving Authority and
corrective action required by the Builder Punchlist, the punchlists received
from the Approving Authorities shall control. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, including any Builder Punchlist item, if an Approving Authority grants
preliminary approval or construction acceptance of any of the Improvements, or,
with respect to grading, if the engineer issues a certification with respect to
the grading, fill and compaction in accordance with item (g) of Exhibit D, then
it shall be conclusively presumed that such Improvement or work was completed in
accordance with the Construction Standard, subject to completion of the
punchlist items provided by the Approving Authority.  If an item is not
identified as incomplete on the Builder Punchlist or any Approving Authority
punchlist, then it shall conclusively be presumed that such Improvement was
completed in accordance with the Construction Standard, and thereafter the
Builder and not Developer, regardless of which Party is the constructing party,
shall be responsible for repairing damage to such Improvement occurring after
completion of the Builder Punchlist work unless such damage is determined either
by agreement of the parties or pursuant to Section 7 of this LDA to be the
result of a design or construction defect.  Disputes regarding Builder Punchlist
items and matters will be resolved pursuant to the expedited dispute resolution
procedures set forth in Section 7 of this LDA.
 
(b)          Correction of Punchlist Items.  Developer shall cause any punchlist
items to be corrected within the time required by the County or other applicable
Approving Authorities.
 
E-8

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c)          Interim Inspections.  Upon reasonable prior notice, Builder may
inspect the construction of the Improvements on the Builder Lots; provided,
however, such inspection shall be (i) at the sole risk of Builder, (ii) such
inspection shall be non-invasive and shall be performed in a manner that does
not interfere with or result in a delay in the construction of the Improvements,
and (iii) Builder shall indemnify Developer for any damage resulting from such
inspection.
 
4.6.        Self-Help Remedy.
 
4.6.1.     Notice of Default.  If Developer does not Substantially Complete the
Improvements in accordance with the Plans on or before the applicable
Substantial Completion Deadline, as may be extended by any Uncontrollable Event
(a “Constructing Party Default”), then the Builder may deliver to Developer
written notice of such Constructing Party Default (a “Notice of Default”). 
Developer shall have thirty (30) days after receipt of a Notice of Default from
the Builder to cure the Constructing Party Default (the “Cure Period”);
provided, however, if the nature of the Constructing Party Default is such that
it cannot reasonably be cured within thirty (30) days, the Cure Period shall be
deemed extended for a reasonable period of time (not to exceed an additional
sixty (60) days) so long as Developer has commenced in good faith and with due
diligence to cause such Constructing Party Default to be remedied.  If Developer
does not timely cure the Constructing Party Default within the Cure Period, as
may be extended pursuant to the preceding sentence or as a result of
Uncontrollable Events (an “Event of Default”), then the Builder may elect to
appoint either itself or another qualified third party (which may include
another builder under contract with Developer to purchase lots within the
Development, provided that such builder agrees to, and accepts, such
appointment) (“Substitute Constructing Party”) to assume and take over the
construction of the Improvements by providing written notice to Developer of its
election (an “Assumption Notice”).  With respect to any Improvements that
Developer causes to be constructed as PM for the CAB (or the District) under
either Service Agreement, the Substitute Constructing Party’s right to take over
the construction of the Improvement shall be the right to step into the rights
of Developer as the PM under the Service Agreements and assume the role of the
PM thereunder, including the right to submit draw requests to the CAB, or the
District, for payment of Service Providers and other construction costs to
complete the Improvements.  Substitute Constructing Party’s assumption of the
construction of the Improvements shall not include the assumption of any
liability for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Assumption Notice, or
receipt of any cost savings prior to the Assumption Notice.  The Builder’s
election to appoint a Substitute Constructing Party to assume and take over the
construction of the Improvements and to exercise and enforce the rights and
obligations set forth in Section 4.6.2 below shall thereafter be the Builder’s
sole and exclusive remedy, except that the limitation on Builder’s remedies for
a Constructing Party Default shall not apply to Developer’s indemnity
obligations in this LDA.  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 4.6
to the contrary, the rights of any party, including Builder, to step in and act
as a Substitute Constructing Party, in place of Developer, shall apply only with
respect to a Constructing Party Default pertaining the Developer’s failure to
Substantially Complete the Improvements for a particular Phase and the Builder
rights under this Section 4.6 must be exercised with respect to a Constructing
Party Default on a phase-by-phase basis.
 
E-9

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.6.2.     Assumption Right.  If Builder delivers an Assumption Notice, or if
Builder or another builder exercises the Builder’s Step-In Option with respect
to the Joint Improvements (as such terms are defined below), then: (i) Developer
shall cooperate to allow the Substitute Constructing Party to take over and
complete the incomplete Improvements for the applicable Phase, including, as
applicable, the execution and delivery to the Substitute Constructing Party of
such agreements, documents or instruments as may be reasonably necessary to
assign to the Substitute Constructing Party all Construction Contracts with
third parties pertaining to the Improvements, and/or assignment of the Service
Agreements so that Substitute Constructing Party can take over as PM thereunder;
(ii) Developer shall be relieved of all further obligations under this LDA with
respect to the completion of the incomplete Improvements for the applicable
Phase; (iii) Developer shall remain liable for its gross negligence or willful
misconduct, and any indemnification obligations specified herein incurred prior
to the date of such Assumption Notice; and (iv) Substitute Constructing Party
shall assume and perform all obligations under all Contracts and the Service
Agreements pertaining to the construction of the Improvements for the applicable
Phase which Substitute Constructing Party will complete to the extent such
obligations are to be performed after the date of delivery of the Assumption
Notice.  Upon delivery of an Assumption Notice, Substitute Constructing Party
shall be obligated to complete or cause the completion of the Improvements for
the applicable Phase and pay the Costs incurred thereafter by Substitute
Constructing Party to complete such Improvements (subject to Developer’s funding
obligation under the Joint Improvements Memorandum (as hereinafter defined), and
Substitute Constructing Party’s rights as PM under the Service Agreements to
process payments through the CAB and/or the District.  If a Substitute
Constructing Party assumes the obligation to construct the Improvements for the
applicable Phase, the Substitute Constructing Party shall use commercially
reasonable and diligent efforts to Substantially Complete the applicable
Improvements under existing Construction Contracts, construction budgets and
other similar construction documents, and the Builder’s obligation for the
payment of costs under Section 6 which are due and payable after the date of the
Assumption Notice shall be suspended until Substantial Completion of the
Improvements for the applicable Phase and thereupon all Costs incurred and paid
by Builder shall be offset against the unpaid portions of the Deferred Purchase
Price (as hereinafter defined).  If the amount of the unpaid portions of the
Deferred Purchase Price is insufficient to offset the Costs incurred and paid by
Builder, then Developer will pay to Builder the amount of the deficiency within
thirty (30) days after Builder presents Developer with an invoice for such
payment, including reasonable supporting documentation for the Cost incurred by
Builder.  Invoices not paid within thirty (30) days after receipt shall bear
simple interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum (the “Default
Interest Rate”) until paid.  In the event of an Assumption Notice, the
Substitute Constructing Party shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Developer and its members, managers, shareholders, employees, directors,
officers, agents, affiliates, successors and assigns for, from and against all
claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages (exclusive of special,
consequential, punitive, speculative or lost profits damages), costs and
expenses, including but not limited to court costs and reasonable attorneys’
fees, that accrue after the date of the Assumption Notice and arise out of the
Substitute Constructing Party’s completion of the Improvements, and this
indemnity shall not apply to any claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages,
costs, expenses, acts or omissions arising or accruing before the date of the
Assumption  Notice.  The obligations under this Section shall survive the
termination or expiration of this LDA.
 
E-10

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.6.3.      Appointment of Substitute Constructing Party.  For purposes of
exercising the self-help remedies set forth in this Section 4.6 with respect to
an Event of Default, Builder may elect to appoint either itself or another
Substitute Constructing Party (which may include another builder under contract
with Developer to purchase lots within the Development, provided that such
builder agrees to, and accepts, such appointment) who shall then have the right
and authority to act pursuant to the self-help provisions of this Section 4.6
(“Designated Builder”).  If the cure of an Event of Default requires the
construction or completion of Improvements that serve the Builder Lots and other
lots that are owned by another builder that is under contract with Developer for
the completion of such Improvements (the “Joint Improvements”), then Builder
shall have the non-exclusive right, but not the obligation, to step in and
complete such Joint Improvements pursuant to the self-help provisions of this
Section 4.6 (“Builder’s Step-In Option”).  If Builder desires to exercise the
Builder’s Step-In Option, it shall give notice thereof to Developer and the
other builders; provided, that, the first builder to give such notice, shall be
deemed the Substitute Constructing Party authorized to act on behalf of all such
builders pursuant to the self-help provisions of this Section 4.6 (or such
similar provisions set forth in such other builder’s LDA) with respect to the
Joint Improvements.  The Developer, Builder, the other builders(s) affected by
any joint improvements and the Title Company will at Closing execute a “Joint
Improvements Memorandum” that describes the rights and obligations of Developer,
Builder, such other builder(s) and Title Company and such document will
supplement this LDA regarding the installation and construction of any Joint
Improvements.  The form of the Joint Improvements Memorandum is attached hereto
as Exhibit F.
 
4.7.         Over-Excavation of Lots.  The Parties acknowledge that the
Improvements shall not include Overex of the Builder Lots.  Builder, with
respect to its Builder Lots shall, at its sole cost, cause the Overex to be
performed, and shall have the right to enter such Builder Lots for the purposes
of performing the Overex; provided, however, that such entry shall be performed
in a manner that does not interfere with or result in a delay or an increase in
the Costs or any expenses in the construction of the Improvements, and provided
further that Builder shall promptly repair any portion of the Builder Lots and
adjacent property that is damaged by Builder or its agents, designees,
employees, contractors, or subcontractors in performing the Overex.  THE PARTIES
ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT DEVELOPER IS NOT PERFORMING ANY OVER-EXCAVATION OF
THE BUILDER LOTS AND THAT THE DEVELOPER SHALL HAVE NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER WITH
RESPECT TO OR ARISING OUT OF ANY OVER-EXCAVATION OF THE BUILDER LOTS OR
EXPANSIVE SOILS PRESENT ON THE BUILDER LOTS AND DEVELOPER EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS
ANY LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY OVER-EXCAVATION OF THE BUILDER LOTS AND
EXPANSIVE SOILS PRESENT ON THE BUILDER LOTS.  BUILDER SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND
AND HOLD HARMLESS DEVELOPER AND ITS SHAREHOLDERS, EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS,
OFFICERS, AGENTS, AFFILIATES, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS FOR, FROM AND AGAINST ALL
CLAIMS, DEMANDS, LIABILITIES, LOSSES, DAMAGES (EXCLUSIVE OF SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, SPECULATIVE OR LOST PROFITS DAMAGES), COSTS AND
EXPENSES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO COURT COSTS AND REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’
FEES, ARISING OUT OF ANY EXPANSIVE SOILS, OVER-EXCAVATION OR OTHER SOIL
MITIGATION OR BUILDER’S ELECTION NOT TO PERFORM SOILS MITIGATION, ON OR
PERTAINING TO THE BUILDER LOTS.  THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 4.7 SHALL
EXPRESSLY SURVIVE THE EXPIRATION OR TERMINATION OF THIS LDA.
 
E-11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.8.        Warranty Periods.
 
4.8.1.     Government Warranty Period.  The Approving Authorities may require a
warranty period after the Substantial Completion of the Improvements (a
“Government Warranty Period”). In the event defects in the Improvements to which
a governmental warranty applies become apparent during the Government Warranty
Period, then Developer shall coordinate the repairs with the applicable
Approving Authorities and cause the Service Provider(s) who performed the work
or supplied the materials in which the defect(s) appear to complete such repairs
or, if such Service Providers fail to correct such defects, otherwise cause such
defects to be repaired to the satisfaction of the Approving Authorities.  Any
costs and expenses incurred in connection with any repairs or warranty work
performed during the Government Warranty Period (including, but not limited to,
any costs or expenses incurred to enforce any warranties against any Service
Providers) shall be borne by the Developer, except for damage that was caused by
the Builder or its contractors, subcontractors, employees, or agents, in which
event the Builder shall pay all such costs and expenses to the extent caused by
Builder or its contractors, subcontractors, employees, or agents.  Any damage to
an Improvement that was not listed on the Builder Punchlist shall be presumed to
have been caused by the Builder, or its contractors, subcontractors, employees,
or agents, unless the Builder conclusively proves that the damage was caused by
a third party or as the result of a design or construction defect in the
original construction by Developer as determined by agreement of the parties or
as determined in a legal proceeding pursuant to the Expedited Dispute procedure
in Section 7, below.
 
E-12

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.8.2.     Non-Government Warranty Period.  Developer shall warrant
(“Non-Government Warranty”) to Builder each Improvement to which a Governmental
Warranty Period does not apply shall have been constructed in accordance with
the Plans for one (1) year from the date of Substantial Completion of such
Improvement (the “Non-Government Warranty Period”).  If the Builder delivers
written notice to the Developer of breach of the Non-Government Warranty during
the Non-Government Warranty Period, then the Developer shall coordinate the
corrections with the Builder and cause the Service Provider(s) who performed the
applicable work or supplied the applicable materials to complete such
corrections or, if such Service Providers fail to make such corrections,
otherwise cause such corrections to be made.  Any costs and expenses incurred in
connection with a breach of the Non-Government Warranty shall be borne by the
Developer (including, but not limited to, any costs or expenses incurred to
enforce any warranties against Service Providers), except for any breach or
damage that was caused by the Builder or its contractors, subcontractors,
employees, or agents, in which event the Builder Party shall pay all such costs
and expenses to the extent caused by the Builder or its contractors,
subcontractors, employees, or agents.  Any damage to an Improvement that was not
listed on the Builder Punchlist shall be presumed to have been caused by the
Builder or its contractors, subcontractors, employees, or agents, unless the
Builder conclusively proves that the damage was caused as the result of a design
or construction defect in the original construction by the Developer.  EXCEPT AS
EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN SECTION 4.8.1 OR 4.8.2, THE DEVELOPER PARTIES MAKE NO
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND TO BUILDER IN RELATION TO THE
IMPROVEMENTS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL OF THE SAME AND SHALL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO
REPAIR OR CORRECT ANY DEFECT IN IMPROVEMENTS FOR WHICH NO CLAIM IS ASSERTED
DURING THE APPLICABLE WARRANTY PERIOD.  The preceding sentence does not affect,
alter or modify any Service Provider’s obligations to repair or correct any
defects in Improvements and shall not be construed as a limitation on the
Builder’s statutory rights or remedies which may not be modified by contract.
 

4.9.         License for Construction.  Each Party hereby grants to the
Developer or the Substitute Constructing Party (as applicable) and the Service
Providers a temporary, non-exclusive license to enter upon the Property owned by
such Party, including the Builder Lots, as reasonably necessary for the
installation of the Improvements, rough grading of the Builder Lots, stubbing of
utilities and/or the performance of the Developer’s (or Substitute Constructing
Party’s, as applicable) responsibilities under this LDA.  Each Party further
agrees to grant such separate written rights of entry and/or licenses in or upon
the Property owned by such Party, including the Builder Lots, as may be
reasonably necessary for installation of the Improvements, rough grading of the
Builder Lots and stubbing of utilities.  No rights of entry and/or licenses over
any portion of the Property may be exercised or used by a Party in any fashion
that would unreasonably interfere with or adversely impact any other Party’s
development of its parcel.  The rights under this Section or any instruments
delivered hereunder shall terminate upon the expiration of all Government
Warranty Periods.
 
4.10.       Liens.  Developer shall pay, or cause to be paid, when due, all
liens and claims for labor and/or materials furnished to the Builder Lots
pursuant to this LDA to prevent the filing or recording by any third party of
any mechanics’, materialmen’s or other lien, stop notice or bond claim or any
attachments, levies or garnishments (collectively “Liens”) involving the
Improvements.  Developer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Builder
for, from and against all injuries, losses, liens, claims, demands, judgments,
liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including but not limited to court
costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses) sustained by or made or
threatened against Builder, which result from or arise out of or in connection
with mechanics' or materialmen's liens, stop notices or bonded stop notices
which may be asserted against Builder or such party’s property (including, as
applicable, any Builder Lot) as a result of Developer’s actions in connection
with the construction of the Improvements.  Developer will, within sixty (60)
calendar days after written notice from Builder, or within sixty (60) days after
Developer otherwise becomes aware of such Liens, terminate the effect of any
Liens by filing or recording an appropriate release or bond if so requested by
Builder.  If the Builder requests that Developer file and obtain any such
release or bond and the Developer fails to do so within sixty (60) calendar days
of such request, the Builder may obtain such bond or secure such release on
behalf of Developer and offset all costs and fees related thereto against any
amount payable by Builder pursuant to this LDA.  If any mechanic's or
materialmen's lien is not removed from each Builder Lot affected thereby prior
to the scheduled closing of the retail sale of such Builder Lot, then the notice
and cure period above shall not apply and Builder shall have the right to
immediately exercise its right to secure such bond or release. If no amounts are
payable by Builder under this LDA, then Developer shall reimburse the Builder
for all costs and fees related securing such bond or release, within thirty (30)
days after receipt of written request therefor and any such cost or amount that
is not paid by the Developer to the Builder when due shall bear interest at the
Default Interest Rate from the due date thereof until paid in full (together
with such interest).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Developer shall have no
obligation with respect to Liens which arise as a result of Builder’s failure to
timely pay any sum due under the Contract or this LDA.
 
E-13

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.11.       Tree Lawns/Sidewalks. Notwithstanding anything in this LDA to the
contrary, Developer, as Constructing Party, shall have no obligation to
construct, install, maintain or pay for the maintenance, construction and
installation of any landscaping or irrigation for such landscaping behind the
curb on any Builder Lot that is to be maintained by the owner of such lot
(collectively, “Tree Lawns”), but Developer shall be responsible for
constructing and installing the detached sidewalks and ramps (collectively,
“Sidewalks”) that are located immediately adjacent to any Builder Lot or on a
tract as required by the approved Plans, County, or any other Approving
Authority and/or applicable laws as provided in this LDA.  Builders shall be
responsible for installing any other lead walks, pathways, and driveways and any
other flatwork on the Builder Lots.  Builder shall install all Tree Lawns on or
adjacent to its Builder Lots in accordance with all applicable Plans,
requirements, regulations, laws, development codes and building codes of all
Approving Authorities and such Tree Lawns shall not be considered part of the
Improvements.
 

4.12.      Soil Hauling.  Builder shall be responsible for relocating from the
Builder Lots all surplus soil generated during Builder’s construction of
structures on the Builder Lots, if any, and for importing any necessary fill
required to complete Builder’s construction activities.  At the option of
Developer, in its sole discretion, any surplus soil shall be transported at
Builder’s expense to a site designated by Developer within the Development;
provided, that Developer has designated and made such a site available to
Builder at the time Builder is ready to transport surplus soils, if any. 
Builder may choose its preferred form of transport for such surplus soils,
subject to Developer’s prior written consent to such form of transport, and
provided that Builder shall not damage any portion of the Development or
interfere with Developer’s activities within the Development.  Developer may
modify any such stock pile location from time to time in Developer’s
discretion.  At Developer’s request, Builder shall supply copies of any reports
or field assessments identifying the material characteristics of the excess soil
prior to accepting such soil for fill purposes and if Developer does not accept
any surplus soils from Builder, then Builder shall, at its sole expense, find a
purchaser or taker or otherwise transport and dispose of any surplus soil upon
such terms as it shall desire, but such surplus soil must still be removed from
the Property and may not be stockpiled on the Property or within the Development
after construction has been completed.  At the option of Developer, in its sole
discretion, if Builder needs to import any necessary fill that is required to
complete Builder’s construction activities and Developer has fill dirt available
on the Property, then Developer may make available to Builder, on terms and
conditions determined by Developer,  any such fill dirt for transport at
Builder’s expense.

5.           Costs of Improvements.
 
5.1.        Definition of Costs.  As used herein, the term “Costs” shall mean
all hard and soft costs incurred in connection with the design (including all
engineering expenses), construction and installation of the Improvements,
including, but not limited to, costs of labor, materials and suppliers,
engineering, design and consultant fees and costs, blue printing services,
construction staking, demolition, soil amendments or compaction, any processing,
plan check or permit fees for the Improvements, engineering services required to
obtain a permit for and complete the Improvements, costs of compliance with all
applicable laws, costs of insurance required by this LDA, costs of any financial
assurances, any corrections, changes or additions to work required by the
Approving Authorities or necessitated by site conditions, municipal, state and
county taxes imposed in connection with construction of the Improvements, any
warranty work, and any other costs incurred in connection with the performance
of the obligations of Developer or the Substitute Constructing Party (as
applicable) hereunder to complete the Improvements.
 
5.2.        Deferred Purchase Price; Additional Costs.  As set forth in Section
6, below, Builder shall pay to Developer, the Deferred Purchase Price which is
equal to the sum of:
 
(a) $48,300 per 35’ Alley Load Lot,
 
(b) $58,000 per SFD 45’ Lot,
 
(c) plus the applicable Escalator; and
 
(d) the Builder Required Costs, if any, as defined below;
 
(collectively, the “Maximum Builder Costs”).  The term “Builder Required Costs”
means those Costs which represent increases in Developer’s costs, as reasonably
determined by the Developer to the extent such increases result from (a) changes
requested by Builder to the approved Plans, Entitlements, and/or Improvements,
(b) Builder’s breach of its obligations under this LDA, and (c) Builder’s
actions or inactions under this LDA, the Contract, or otherwise.  Builder shall
immediately pay all Builder Required Costs upon receipt of an invoice therefor
from the Developer and Developer’s determination of Builder Required Costs shall
be binding on the Parties except in the event of manifest error.  Developer
shall pay all Costs which exceed the Maximum Builder Costs as set forth above,
subject to payment of costs due from other builders. Builder shall not be
responsible for any increase in Developer costs which are the result of changes
requested by other builders.  In the event Builder disputes any Builder Required
Costs and the parties cannot resolve such dispute within 30 days, either party
shall have the right to submit such dispute to arbitration in accordance with
the provisions in Section 7, below.
 
6.           Payment of Costs.  Pursuant to the terms of the Contract, Builder
shall pay to Developer, as Seller, part of the Purchase Price in cash at each
closing (the “Initial Purchase Price”), and pay in accordance with the terms of
this LDA a deferred portion of the Purchase Price (“Deferred Purchase Price”)
equal to the Maximum Builder Costs (including Builder Required Costs, if any)
which represents Builder’s share of the Costs of the Improvements.  After
Builder pays the Initial Purchase Price under the Contract, Builder has no
responsibility for payment of any funds in excess of the Maximum Builder Costs. 
The Deferred Purchase Price is payable to Developer in installments based upon
completion of the Improvements that serve each Phase of the Builder Lots as
follows:
 
E-15

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1.        Takedown 1 Lots – Phase 1. Phase 1 consists of approximately
thirty-two (32) 35’ Alley Lots and twenty (20) SFD 45’ Lots, as identified on

Builder shall pay to Developer one-half (1/2) of the Deferred Purchase Price due
for each of the Phase 1 Lots, as set forth on Exhibit G, attached hereto and

Escalator.

the Developer the balance of the Deferred Purchase Price due for each of the
Phase 2 Lots, as set forth on the Takedown Matrix, plus the applicable
Escalator.
 
6.3.        Takedown 3 Lots – Phase 3. Phase 3 consists of approximately
twenty-two (22) 35’ Alley Lots and ten (10) SFD 45’ Lots as identified on the

6.5.        Escalator.  All payments of the Deferred Purchase Price shall be
subject to the Escalator as provided in Section 2(b) of the Contract.
 
E-16

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.6.        Invoice.  After Substantial Completion is achieved as described in
Section 4.5 above (including inspections under Section 4.5.2(a)), Builder shall
pay the applicable portion of the Deferred Purchase within five (5) business
days after an invoice for payment is delivered to Builder by Developer.
 
6.7.        Definition of Wet Utilities. The Wet Utilities that serve each Phase
of the Builder Lots that will trigger the Builder’s payment obligation upon
Substantial Completion thereof are identified on Exhibit E.
 
6.8.        Security for Payment of Deferred Purchase Price - Letter of Credit. 
In order to secure Builder’s obligation following each Closing to pay the
Deferred Purchase Price in accordance with the terms of the Contract and the
payment obligations set forth above in this Section 6, at each Closing, Builder
shall deliver to Title Company, acting as escrow agent, either (i) a letter of
credit issued by [insert issuer of LOC], in a form agreeable to Developer (the
“Letter of Credit”), or (ii) a cash payment (a Letter of Credit and the cash
payment each constitute a “Deferred Purchase Price Deposit”).  The Deferred
Purchase Price Deposit shall be an amount that is equal to the sum of the
Deferred Purchase Price for all Builder Lots acquired by Builder at such
Closing, plus an estimate of the applicable Escalator, as reasonably determined
by Developer.  Title Company shall hold and maintain such Deferred Purchase
Price Deposit pursuant to this LDA and the Contract in an escrow account
established by Title Company for the benefit of Developer and Builder (pursuant
to the terms of an escrow agreement to be agreed upon during the Due Diligence
Period under the Contract, and entered into by Developer, Builder and Title
Company concurrently with the execution of this LDA (the “Escrow Agreement”)). 
A Letter of Credit that is posted for a Closing shall remain in place until the
final payment of the Deferred Purchase Price applicable to such Closing has been
made to the Developer following Substantial Completion of the Finished Lot
Improvements which serve the Builder Lots acquired by Builder at such Closing. 
If a Letter of Credit is scheduled to expire prior to the Substantial Completion
of all such Builder Lots, and Builder has not renewed the Letter of Credit at
least fifteen (15) days prior to the expiration date thereof, Title Company is
authorized and directed to draw down the full amount of the Letter of Credit and
deposit such funds in escrow to be used solely for the payment of any unpaid
Deferred Purchase Price.  The Letter of Credit may provide that it may be
reduced from time to time to the extent of payments of the Deferred Purchase
Price in Good Funds made by Builder for Improvements in accordance with the
terms, including the payment schedule, set forth in this LDA.  If the Letter of
Credit provides for periodic reduction, then from time to time as Builder pays
installments of the Deferred Purchase Price, Developer and Escrow Agent shall
execute and deliver to the issuer of the Letter of Credit a reduction
certificate (in the form required and furnished by the issuer) to reduce the
Letter of Credit by the amount of the Deferred Purchase Price installment that
was paid.  The Letter of Credit for each Closing shall be returned to Builder,
together with an executed reduction certificate reducing the face amount thereof
to $0.00, upon payment in full of the Deferred Purchase Price in Good Funds for
all of the Builder Lots in such Closing.  A cash payment that is deposited as
the Deferred Purchase Price Deposit for a Closing will be drawn down and
disbursed by the Title Company to Developer from time to time to the extent of
payments of the Deferred Purchase Price made by Builder in accordance with the
terms, including the payment schedule, set forth in this LDA and Section 5(c) of
the Contract.  Failure by Builder to pay any portion of the Deferred Purchase
Price that is secured by a Letter of Credit when the same shall become due and
payable, provided that at such failure continues for a period of ten (10) days
after the delivery of written notice thereof from Developer to Builder, shall
entitle Developer to enforce the collection of the delinquent Deferred Purchase
Price by having the Title Company draw upon the Letter of Credit, and the funds
so drawn shall be paid to Developer as payment of any unpaid Deferred Purchase
Price and such failure to pay shall be deemed cured.  If Developer or Title
Company is unable to draw upon the Letter of Credit, or Builder otherwise fails
to pay the Deferred Purchase Price, Developer may protect and enforce its rights
under this LDA pertaining to payment of the Deferred Purchase Price by (i) such
suit, action, or special proceedings as Developer shall deem appropriate,
including, without limitation, any proceedings for the specific performance of
any covenant or agreement contained in this LDA or the Contract or the
enforcement of any other appropriate legal or equitable remedy, or for the
recovery of actual damages (excluding consequential, punitive damages or similar
damages) caused by Builder’s failure to pay the Deferred Purchase Price,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, and (ii) enforcing Developer’s lien rights
set forth in this LDA.  Developer’s remedies are non-exclusive.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Builder shall have the right, at any time, upon written notice to
Developer, to substitute any Letter of Credit with a cash payment of equal
amount into escrow with Escrow Agent, subject to the Parties’ reasonable
agreement to amend the Escrow Agreement to reflect such change.
 
E-17

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.           Expedited Dispute Resolution.
 
7.1.        Disputes Related to Material Changes, Draw Requests and Punchlist
Items.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, disputes related to
Material Changes, any Builder Punchlist item or matter, objections to
Construction Contracts, determination of Substantial Completion (“Expedited
Disputes”) shall all be resolved by an independent, impartial third party
qualified to resolve such disputes as determined by the Parties involved in the
Expedited Dispute (“Informal Arbitrator”).  If such Parties cannot agree on an
Informal Arbitrator, then the Parties involved shall select one (1) registered
engineer and the Builder shall select one (1) registered engineer and the
engineers so selected by such Parties shall promptly select an independent,
impartial third party qualified to act as the Informal Arbitrator and resolve
the Expedited Dispute.  Within five (5) business days after a Party delivers a
Dispute Notice, the Developer and the Builder shall deliver to the Informal
Arbitrator a written statement of how such Party believes the Expedited Dispute
should be resolved, together with reasonable supporting documentation of such
position (“Resolution Notice”).  Within ten (10) business days after receipt of
Resolution Notices from both such Parties, the Informal Arbitrator shall approve
one (1) of the Parties’ Resolution Notice and shall deliver written notice of
such approval to each Party.  The decision of the Informal Arbitrator shall be
binding on all Parties with respect to the applicable Expedited Dispute.  All
Parties shall timely cooperate with the Informal Arbitrator in rendering his or
her decision.  The party that is not the prevailing party in the resolution of
any Expedited Dispute shall promptly pay the Informal Arbitrator’s fee, and the
prevailing party’s other fees and costs of any such expedited dispute resolution
process and reasonable attorney’s fees.  The term “prevailing party” means the
party who successfully obtains substantially all of the relief sought by such
party or is successful in denying substantially all of the relief sought by the
other party.  The Parties acknowledge that there is a benefit to the Parties in
having work done as expeditiously as possible and that there is a need for a
streamlined method of making decisions described in this Section so that work is
not delayed.  A Party and shall not be entitled to recover from any other Party
exemplary, punitive, special, indirect, consequential or any other damages other
than actual damages (unless the Informal Arbitrator finds intentional abuse or
frustration of the arbitration process) in connection with an Expedited Dispute.
 
E-18

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.2.        Standards of Conduct.  The Parties agree that with respect to all
aspects of the expedited dispute resolution process contained herein they will
conduct themselves in a manner intended to assure the integrity and fairness of
that process.  To that end, if an Expedited Dispute is submitted to expedited
dispute resolution process, the Parties agree that they will not contact or
communicate with the Informal Arbitrator who was appointed with respect to any
Expedited Dispute either ex parte or outside of the contacts and communications
contemplated by this Article 7, and the Parties further agree that they will
cooperate in good faith in the production of evidence in a prompt and efficient
manner to permit the review and evaluation thereof by the other Parties.
 
8.           Progress Meetings.  The Parties shall, from time to time, meet
following reasonable request by the Builder to discuss the status of
construction of the Improvements, scheduling and coordination issues,
engineering and design issues, and other similar issues.  The initial designated
representative for each Party for the purpose of this Section shall be the
individual listed on each Party’s respective signature page attached hereto. 
All inquiries, requests, instructions, authorizations, and other communications
with respect to the matters covered by this LDA shall be made to such
representatives.  Any Party may without further or independent inquiry, assume
and rely at all times that the representatives of the other parties designated
hereunder have the power and authority to make decisions on behalf of such other
parties, to communicate such decisions to the other Party and to bind such Party
by his acts and deeds, unless otherwise notified in writing by the Party
designating the representative.  Any Party may change its representative under
this LDA at any time by written notice to the other Parties.
 
9.           Builder’s Stormwater Permit Responsibilities.  Following
Substantial Completion of the Improvements and prior to Builder engaging in any
construction activities upon the Builder Lots, Builder shall obtain from the
Colorado Department of Public Health, Water Quality Control Division, a Colorado
Construction Stormwater Discharge Permit issued to Builder with respect to the
Builder Lots.  No fewer than five (5) business days prior to the initiation of
construction activities on any Builder Lot, Builder shall deliver a copy of at
least one (1) of the following documents to Developer:


9.1.        Such valid Colorado Construction Stormwater Discharge Permit for the
Builder Lots;
 
9.2.         A signed notice of reassignment of permit coverage (State of
Colorado Form COR030000 or current equivalent), that transfers any pre-existing
permit coverage for the Builder Lots; or
 
9.3.         A signed State of Colorado modification form to add the Builder
Lots if Builder has an existing site permit with the State of Colorado within
the Property.
 
To the extent required by the County and the Southeast Metro Stormwater
Authority, Builder shall also obtain a Grading, Erosion and Sediment Control
Permit issued to Builder by the County and the Southeast Metro Stormwater
Authority for the Builder Lots.  Builder shall be responsible to obtain and
maintain any State of Colorado dewatering permits if required for Builder’s
further construction within the Builder Lots.  If requested by Developer,
Builder shall execute a Notice of Property Conveyance and Change in
Responsibility for the Colorado Discharge Permit held by Developer or an
affiliated entity with respect to the Property.  In all cases, Builder shall
obtain from the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment Water Quality
Control Division, a Notice of Property Conveyance and Change in Responsibility
on a form acceptable to the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment
Water Quality Control Division executed by Builder, for the Colorado Stormwater

11.         Attorneys’ Fees.  Except as provided in Section 7.1, should any
action be brought in connection with this LDA, including, without limitation,
actions based on contract, tort or statute, the substantially prevailing Party
in such action shall be awarded all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with such action, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. The provisions of this
Section shall survive the expiration or termination of this LDA.


12.         Further Acts.  Each of the Parties hereto shall execute and deliver
all such documents and perform all such acts as reasonably necessary, from time
to time, to carry out the matters contemplated by this LDA.
 
13.         No Partnership; Third Parties.  It is not intended by this LDA to,
and nothing contained in this LDA shall, create any partnership, joint venture
or other arrangement among the Parties hereto.  No term or provision of this LDA
is intended to, or shall, be for the benefit of any person, firm, organization
or corporation not a Party hereto, and no such other person, firm, organization
or corporation shall have any right or cause of action hereunder.
 
14.         Entire Agreement; Headings for Convenience Only; Not to be Construed
Against Drafter; No Implied Waiver.  This LDA and all other written agreements
among the Parties constitute the entire agreement among the Parties hereto
pertaining to the subject matter hereof.  No change or addition is to be made to
this LDA except by written amendment executed by the Parties.  The headings,
captions and titles contained in this LDA are intended for convenience of
reference only and are of no meaning in the interpretation or effect of this
LDA.  This LDA shall not be construed more strictly against one (1) Party than
another merely by virtue of the fact that it may have been initially drafted by
one (1) of the Parties or its counsel, since all Parties have contributed
substantially and materially to the preparation hereof.  No failure by a Party
to insist upon the strict performance of any term, covenant or provision
contained in this LDA, no failure by a Party to exercise any right or remedy
under this LDA, and no acceptance of full or partial payment owed to a Party
during the continuance of any default by the other Party(ies), shall constitute
a waiver of any such term, covenant or provision, or a waiver of any such right
or remedy, or a waiver of any such default unless such waiver is made in writing
by the Party to be bound thereby.  Any waiver of a breach of a term or a
condition of this LDA shall not prevent a subsequent act, which would have
originally constituted a default under this LDA, from having all the force and
effect of a default.
 
E-21

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15.         Governing Law.  This LDA is entered into in Colorado and shall be
construed and interpreted under the law of the State of Colorado without giving
effect to principles of conflicts of law which would result in the application
of any law other than the law of the State of Colorado.
 
16.         Severability.  If any provision of this LDA is declared void or
unenforceable, such provision shall be severed from this LDA and shall not
affect the enforceability of the remaining provisions of this LDA.
 
17.         Assignment; Binding Effect.  This LDA shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Neither Builder or Developer may assign any of its rights or
obligations under this LDA without the prior written consent of the other
Party(ies), which consent may be withheld in each Party’s sole and absolute
discretion; provided, however, that:
 
17.1.      Builder may assign, without consent, its rights under this LDA in
full, but not in part: (i) to a third party which acquires all of Builder’s
Builder Lots, or (ii) to an entity that controls, is controlled by, or under
common control with, Builder; provided further, however that Developer approves
the form of assignment, which approval shall be in Developer’s reasonable
discretion; and
 
17.2.      Developer may assign, without consent, its rights under this LDA: (i)
to an entity that controls, is controlled by, or under common control with,
Developer; (ii) to any entity that acquires all or substantially all of the
Developer’s interests in the Builder Lots which Seller reasonably believes has
the financial ability and experience to perform Seller’s obligations under this
LDA.
 
18.         Counterparts; Copies of Signatures.  This LDA may be executed in two
(2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one (1) and the same instrument.  The signature
pages from one (1) or more counterparts may be removed from such counterparts
and such signature pages all attached to a single instrument so that the
signatures of all Parties may be physically attached to a single document.  This
LDA may be executed and delivered by electronic mail in portable document format
(.pdf) or similar means and delivery of the signature page by such method will
be deemed to have the same effect as if the original signature had been
delivered to the other party.  Upon execution of this LDA by Developer and
Builder, Developer shall provide a fully executed copy of this LDA to Builder
for its records.
 
19.         Time of the Essence.  Time is of the essence for performance or
satisfaction of all requirements, conditions, or other provisions of this LDA,
subject to any specific time extensions set forth herein.
 
20.         Computation of Time Periods. All time periods referred to in this
LDA shall include all Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, unless the period of time
specifies business days.  If the date to perform any act or give a notice with
respect to this LDA shall fall on a Saturday, Sunday or national or state
holiday, the act or notice may be timely performed on the next succeeding day
which is not a Saturday, Sunday or a national or state holiday.
 
E-22

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21.         Remedies.
 
21.1.       Except as hereinafter provided with regard to Expedited Disputes and
the self-help remedy under Section 4.6, if any Party is in default of any of its
obligations under this LDA beyond any applicable notice or cure periods, the
other Party(ies) may avail itself to any rights and remedies available at law
and equity, but may only recover its actual, out-of-pocket damages (excluding
any incidental, consequential, speculative, punitive or lost profits damages)
incurred as a result of such default.  For Expedited Disputes, the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parties is set forth in Section 7 of this LDA, and for
Constructing Party Defaults, the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties is set
forth in Section 4.6 of this LDA.
 
21.2.       In addition to the remedies permitted under Section 21.1, any claim
by Developer against Builder for breach of Builder’s obligation hereunder to pay
of any portion of the Deferred Purchase Price, together with simple interest at
the Default Interest Rate from the date such payment is due and payable, and all
costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys' fees awarded to Developer in
enforcing any payment in any suit or proceeding under this LDA, shall constitute
a lien ("Lien") against the applicable Phase of Builder Lots to which the
payment pertains until paid, effective upon the recording of a notice of lien
with respect thereto in the Office of the Clerk and Recorder of the County;
provided, however, that any such Lien shall be subject and subordinate to (i)
liens for taxes and other public charges which by applicable law are expressly
made superior, and (ii) all liens recorded in the Office of the Clerk and
Recorder of the County prior to the date of recordation of said notice of lien. 
All liens recorded subsequent to the recordation of the notice of lien described
herein shall be junior and subordinate to the Lien.  The notice of lien will be
signed and acknowledged by Developer and will contain the following: (a) a
statement of all amounts due and payable; (b) a description sufficient for
identification of the applicable Phase of Builder Lots to which the notice
relates; (c) the name of the Builder as owner of such Builder Lots; and (d) the
name and address of the Developer causing the notice to be recorded.  Developer
has the right to enforce the Lien by foreclosing the Lien against the applicable
Phase of Builder Lots under the prevailing Colorado law relating to the
foreclosure of realty mortgages.  Upon the timely curing by the defaulting
Builder of any default for which a notice of lien was recorded, the Developer
shall record an appropriate release of such notice of lien and Lien. The sale or
transfer of a Builder Lot by Builder does not affect the Lien.


22.         Jury Waiver.  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY, WITH AND UPON THE ADVICE OF COMPETENT
COUNSEL, WAIVE, RELINQUISH AND FOREVER FORGO THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION OR PROCEEDING BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS LDA.
