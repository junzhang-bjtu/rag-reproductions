DEMISED PREMISES; TERM; RENT

1.01.In consideration of the terms, conditions, and agreements set forth in this
Lease, and for good and valuable consideration the sufficiency of which are
hereby acknowledged, Landlord hereby agrees to lease to Tenant, and Tenant
hereby hires from Landlord, the Demised Premises, for the Term, for the rents
hereinafter reserved and upon and subject to the terms, conditions (including
limitations, restrictions and reservations) and covenants hereinafter
provided.  Each Party hereby expressly covenants and agrees to observe and
perform all of the conditions and covenants herein contained on its part to be
observed and performed.

1.02.Landlord and Tenant have mutually agreed and stipulated that the Demised
Premises leased hereunder has a rentable area of 20,913 square feet.  Said
Premises, together with all fixtures and equipment, including Landlord’s
Furniture (as defined in Article 42), which at the commencement or during the
term of this Lease are thereto attached (except items not deemed to be included
therein and removable by Tenant as provided in Article 13), shall constitute the
“Demised Premises”.

1.03.The term of this Lease, for which the Demised Premises are hereby leased,
shall commence on the Commencement Date and, subject to Tenant’s renewal rights
as set forth herein, shall end at 5:00 P.M. on the last day of the calendar
month in which occurs the date that is three (3) years and two (2) months after
the Commencement Date, which ending date is hereinafter called the “Expiration
Date”, or shall end on such earlier date upon which said Term may expire or be
canceled or terminated pursuant to any of the provisions of this Lease or
pursuant to law.  Promptly following the Commencement Date, Landlord and Tenant
shall execute a confirmation, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
both parties, confirming the Commencement Date, the Rent Commencement Date and
the Expiration Date; provided, however, failure to execute and deliver such
confirmation shall not affect the validity of the Commencement Date, the Rent
Commencement Date or the Expiration Date as herein set forth.

1.04.The rents reserved under this Lease (collectively the “Rent”), for the Term
thereof, shall be and consist of:

(a)Fixed Base Rent in the amounts set forth in the Preamble, which shall be
payable in monthly installments, as above described, on the first day of each
and every calendar month during the Term commencing on the Rent Commencement
Date (except as otherwise set forth in Section 1.06); and

(b)Additional Rent consisting of all such other sums of money as shall become
due from and payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder (for default in payment of
which Landlord shall have the same remedies as for a default in payment of fixed
rent), all to be paid to Landlord at its office, or such other place, or to such
agent at such place, as Landlord may designate by notice to Tenant, in lawful
money of the United States of America.

1.05.Tenant shall pay the Fixed Base Rent and Additional Rent as herein reserved
promptly as and when the same shall become due and payable, pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Lease, without further demand therefor, and without
any rights of abatement, deduction, counterclaim or setoff whatsoever except as
otherwise expressly set forth herein.

- 4 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.06.Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Tenant shall pay upon the
execution and delivery of this Lease an amount equal to the sum of (i) the
Security Deposit and (ii) the first month’s Fixed Base Rent.  If the Rent
Commencement Date is on the first day of a month, such payment of Fixed Base
Rent shall be credited against the first full monthly installment of Fixed Base
Rent due and payable under this Lease.  If the Rent Commencement Date is not on
the first day of a month, then on the Rent Commencement Date, Tenant shall pay
prorated Fixed Based Rent for the period from the Rent Commencement Date through
the last day of such month (both dates inclusive) and the payment of Fixed Base
Rent made by Tenant upon the execution and delivery of this Lease shall be
credited toward Fixed Base Rent for the next succeeding calendar month.

1.07.Any payment of Rent, including monthly Fixed Base Rent or any portion
thereof, and any Additional Rent, which is not received within five (5) days
after it is due (any such period to be referred to as a “Grace Period”), will be
subject to a late charge equal to five percent (5%) of the unpaid
amount.  However, not more than once in each calendar year, if applicable,
Tenant may have an additional five (5) business day period after the Grace
Period (any such additional period to be referred to as a “Second Grace Period”)
before any late payment of Rent is subject to the late charge in the preceding
sentence.  The late charge, if assessed, will be compensation for Landlord’s
additional cost of processing late payments.  In addition, any Rent which is not
paid within thirty (30) days after it is due, including monthly Fixed Base Rent,
will accrue interest at a rate equal to the Prime Rate as defined herein plus
five percent (5%) per annum, from the date on which it was due until the date on
which it is paid in full with accrued interest.  If Tenant is in default of this
Lease for failure to pay Rent, in addition to the late charges and interest set
forth above, Tenant shall be charged with and responsible for payment of all
reasonable attorney fees incurred by Landlord in connection with the collection
of all sums due Landlord.

thereafter, upon each successive Operating Year, Tenant shall pay to Landlord as
Additional Rent for the then Operating Year, Tenant’s Projected Share of
Increase in Taxes in equal monthly installments; provided, however, that Tenant
shall not be required to pay Tenant’s Projected Share of Increase for any period

5.03.Within one hundred fifty (150) days after the expiration of each Operating

for each such Operating Year as well as Tenant’s Proportionate Share of

Year, Tenant shall then pay the amount of such excess to Landlord within thirty

Proportionate Share of Increase in Taxes shall be calculated as though the
increase in Taxes for the first Operating Year is three percent (3%).
Thereafter, Tenant's Proportionate Share of Increase in Taxes shall not exceed

(d)“Base Year” shall mean calendar year 2019.

(e)“Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Increase” shall mean Tenant’s Percentage
multiplied by the increase in Operating Expenses for the Operating Year over
Operating Expenses for the Base Year.

(f)“Tenant’s Projected Share of Increase” shall mean Tenant’s Proportionate

5.05.Commencing with the first Operating Year and thereafter, Tenant shall pay

Share of Increase; provided, however, that Tenant shall not be required to pay
Tenant’s Projected Share of Increase for any period prior to the first (1st)
anniversary of the Commencement Date.

5.06.After the expiration of the first Operating Year and after the expiration
of each Operating Year thereafter, Landlord shall furnish to Tenant a reasonably
detailed statement of the Operating Expenses incurred for such Operating Year
which statement shall set forth Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Increase, if
any.  If the statement furnished by Landlord to Tenant, pursuant to this
Section, at the end of the then Operating Year shall indicate that Tenant’s
Projected Share of Increase exceeded Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Increase,
Landlord shall either forthwith pay the amount of excess directly to Tenant
concurrently with the statement or credit same against Tenant’s next monthly
installment of rent within thirty (30) days.  If such statement furnished by
Landlord to Tenant hereunder shall indicate that the Tenant’s Proportionate
Share of Increase exceeded Tenant’s Projected Share of Increase for the then
Operating Year, Tenant shall forthwith pay the amount of such excess to Landlord
within thirty (30) days.  If Landlord has not provided Tenant a written
statement for Tenant’s Projected Share of Increase as of the commencement of any
Operating Year, Tenant shall be obligated to continue to pay as Additional Rent
each month at the same rate as reflected in the previous estimate furnished by
Landlord until such time as Landlord has sent the statement whereupon
appropriate adjustments will be made.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenant's contribution towards Landlord's
Controllable Operating Expenses (as that term is defined below) shall not be
increased by more than five percent (5%) per calendar year on a compounding and
cumulative basis for the initial Term of the Lease (the “Operating Expense
Cap”). “Controllable Operating Expenses” shall mean all Operating Expenses with
the exception of the costs and expenses related to snow and ice removal, weather
related expenses, security, insurance premiums and deductibles, costs of
compliance with Laws, fuel charges and all utilities. The costs and expenses
related to snow and ice removal, weather related expenses, security, insurance
premiums and deductibles, costs of compliance with Laws, fuel charges and all
utilities shall be deemed “Non-Controllable Operating Expenses” and
Non-Controllable Operating Expenses shall be excluded from any Operating Expense
Cap and Tenant

- 14 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

shall pay its full Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Increase of such
Non-Controllable Operating Expenses, regardless of any Operating Expense
Cap.  In the event Tenant exercises a Renewal Period, Tenant's Proportionate
Share of Increase for the first Lease Year of such Renewal Period shall be its
full Tenant’s Proportionate Share of Increase, without any Operating Expense Cap
being applied, based on Operating Expenses for that first full Lease Year of the
applicable Renewal Period. Thereafter, the Operating Expense Cap shall be
applied as set forth herein.

5.07.Every statement given by Landlord pursuant to Sections 5.03 and 5.06 shall
be conclusive and binding upon Tenant unless (i) within ninety (90) days after
the receipt of such statement Tenant shall have given a notice to Landlord that
Tenant disputes the correctness of the statement, specifying in reasonable
detail the basis for such assertion.  Pending resolution of such a dispute, and
absent manifest error, Tenant shall pay the Additional Rent in accordance with
the statement furnished by Landlord.  Landlord agrees, upon prior written
request, during normal business hours to make available for Tenant’s inspection,
at Landlord’s offices, Landlord’s books and records which are relevant to any
items in dispute.  If after such inspection, Tenant still disputes such
statement of Taxes or Operating Expenses, either party may refer the decision of
the issues raised to a reputable independent firm of certified public
accountants, selected by Landlord and approved by Tenant, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld as long as such firm is a regionally or nationally
recognized firm with at least twenty (20) partners or principals who are
certified public accountants, and the decision of such accounting firm shall be
conclusively binding upon the Parties Tenant shall not be permitted to use any
accounting firm or other company which derives or ties its compensation from the
savings realized by Tenant for any audit. The fees and expenses involved in such
decision shall be borne by Tenant, unless the accounting firm determines that
Landlord’s original calculation of the actual Taxes or Operating Expenses was in
error by more than five percent (5%), in which event Landlord shall pay the
reasonable fees of such accounting firm.  If the inspection shows an undercharge
to Tenant, Tenant shall pay the amount due to Landlord within thirty (30) days
after completion of the audit.  If the audit indicates an overpayment by Tenant,
then Tenant shall be entitled at Landlord’s sole option to either (i) to receive
a refund from Landlord within thirty (30) days after finalization of such audit,
or (ii) a credit in an amount equal to such excess against Rent next becoming
due under this Lease.  In no event shall this Lease be terminable nor shall
Landlord be liable for damages based upon any disagreement regarding an
adjustment of Operating Expenses, except as otherwise expressly set forth in
this Section 5.07.  Tenant recognizes the confidential nature of Landlord’s
books and records and agrees to maintain the information obtained from any
examination conducted pursuant to this Section 5.07 in strict confidence.  

ARTICLE 6

SUBORDINATION TO MORTGAGEES

6.01.This Lease shall be subject and subordinate at all times to the lien of any
mortgage, deed of trust, ground lease, installment sale agreement and/or other
instrument or encumbrance heretofore or hereafter placed upon any or all of
Landlord’s interest or estate in the Premises or the remainder of the Property
and of all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions
thereof (all of which are hereinafter referred to collectively as a “mortgage”),
all automatically and without the necessity of any further action on the part of
the Tenant to effectuate such subordination.  Within twenty-five (25) days of
any request by Landlord, Tenant shall, at the

- 15 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

request of the holder of any such mortgage, attorn to such holder, and shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver, upon demand by the Landlord or such holder,
such further instrument or instruments evidencing such subordination of the
Tenant’s right, title and interest under this Lease to the lien of any such
mortgage, and such further instrument or instruments evidencing and elaborating
such attornment, as shall be reasonably desired by such holder.  Further, (i)
Landlord, at Landlord’s sole cost, shall obtain a subordination, non-disturbance
agreement (“SNDA”) from the current holder of any ground lease and/or mortgage
on in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H; and (ii) Landlord shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an SNDA from any future ground lessees
or mortgagees substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H.  

ARTICLE 7

QUIET ENJOYMENT

7.01.Landlord covenants that if and so long as Tenant pays Fixed Base Rent and
any Additional Rent as herein provided and performs Tenant’s covenants hereof,
Landlord shall do nothing to affect Tenant’s right to peacefully and quietly
have, hold and enjoy the Demised Premises for the term herein defined, subject
to all provisions of this Lease and to any mortgage to which this Lease shall be
subordinate.

ARTICLE 8

ASSIGNMENT, MORTGAGING, SUBLETTING

8.01.Tenant may not mortgage, pledge, hypothecate, assign, transfer, sublet or
otherwise deal with this Lease or the Premises in any manner except as
specifically provided for in this Article 8.

8.02.(a) Except for a Permitted Transfer (as hereinafter defined), in the event
that Tenant desires to sublease the whole or any portion of the Demised Premises
or assign the within Lease to any other party, the terms and conditions of such
sublease or assignment shall be communicated to Landlord in writing not less
than twenty (20) days prior to the effective date of any such sublease or
assignment and Landlord shall thereafter have ten (10) business days to respond
to Tenant’s request for such sublease or assignment.

(b)Tenant may assign this Lease or sublet the whole or any portion of the
Premises, subject to Landlord’s prior written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed, on the basis of the following
terms and conditions (it being agreed that if the terms of any mortgage loan
documents encumbering the Property require the mortgagee of the Property to
consent to any sublease or assignment, and the mortgagee of the Property fails
or refuses to consent to a proposed sublease or assignment, then Landlord shall
not be deemed to have acted unreasonably in withholding its consent to such
sublease or assignment):

(1)The Tenant shall provide to Landlord the name and address of the assignee or
subtenant.

(2)The assignee shall assume, by written instrument, all of the obligations of
this Lease, and a copy of such assumption agreement shall be furnished to
Landlord within ten (10) days of its execution.  Any sublease shall expressly

- 16 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

acknowledge that said subtenant’s rights against the Landlord shall be no
greater than those of the Tenant.

(3)The Tenant and each assignee (including if such assignee is in place as a
result of a Permitted Transfer), shall be and remain liable for the observance
of all the covenants and provisions of this Lease, including, but not limited
to, the payment of Fixed Base Rent and Additional Rent reserved herein, as and
when required to be paid, through the entire Term of this Lease.

(4)The Tenant and any assignee shall promptly pay to Landlord one-half (1/2) of
any net consideration received for any assignment or one-half (1/2) of the net
sublease rent, as and when received, in excess of the Fixed Base Rent and
Additional Rent required to be paid by Tenant for the period affected by said
assignment or sublease for the area sublet, computed on the basis of an average
square foot rent for the gross square footage Tenant has leased.  As used
herein, net consideration and/or net rent shall mean gross rent (Fixed Base and
Additional) or gross consideration less any reasonable legal fees, brokerage
commissions, and/or tenant work paid by Tenant in connection with the assignment
or sublet, said legal fees, brokerage commissions or tenant work to be amortized
over the term of the sublet.

(5)In any event, the acceptance by Landlord of any rent (Fixed Base and
Additional) from the assignee or from any of the subtenants or the failure of
Landlord to insist upon a strict performance of any of the terms, conditions and
covenants herein shall not release Tenant herein, nor any assignee assuming this
Lease, from any and all of the obligations herein during and for the entire Term
of this Lease.

(6)Landlord shall require a One Thousand Five Hundred and 00/100 Dollar
($1,500.00) payment to cover its handling charges for each request for consent
to any sublet or assignment prior to its consideration of the same.

(7)Tenant shall have no claim, and hereby waives the right to any claim, against
Landlord for money damages by reason of any refusal, withholding or delaying by
Landlord of any consent, and in such event, Tenant’s only remedies therefor
shall be an action for specific performance, injunction or declaratory judgment
to enforce any such requirement.

8.03.Any sublet or assignment to (i) an entity controlling, controlled by or
under common control with Tenant, or (ii) any successor of Tenant resulting from
a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets or
equity interests of Tenant or other form of corporate reorganization (in any
such case, a “Permitted Transfer”), shall not be subject to the provisions of
Subsection 8.02(b)(4) and shall not require Landlord’s prior written consent,
but the provisions of Subsections 8.02(b)(2), (3), (5) and (7) shall apply to
any Permitted Transfer.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in order for an
assignment resulting from a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of
Tenant to a third party to be deemed a Permitted Transfer, (x) the purchaser of
Tenant’s assets must have a net worth computed in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles at least equal to the net worth of
Tenant on the date of

- 17 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

such sublet or assignment, and (y) upon request provide proof reasonably
satisfactory to Landlord of such net worth prior to the effective date of any
such transaction.  

8.04.Except as specifically set forth above, no portion of the Demised Premises
or of Tenant’s interest in this Lease may be acquired by any other person or
entity, whether by assignment, mortgage, sublease, transfer, operation of law or
act of the Tenant, nor shall Tenant pledge its interest in this Lease or in any
security deposit required hereunder.

ARTICLE 9

COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS

regulations of the federal, state and municipal governments or any of their
departments affecting Tenant’s manner of use and occupancy of the Demised

expense to Landlord) contest, by appropriate proceedings prosecuted diligently
and in good faith, the validity, or applicability to the Demised Premises, of
any law or requirement of public authority, and Landlord shall reasonably
cooperate with Tenant at no cost to Landlord in such proceedings provided that:

(a)Tenant shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Landlord against all
liability, loss or damage which Landlord shall suffer by reason of such
non-compliance or contest, including reasonable attorney’s fees and other
expenses reasonably incurred by Landlord;

(b)Such non-compliance or contest shall not constitute or result in any
violation of any superior mortgage, or, if such superior mortgage shall permit
such non-compliance or contest on condition of the taking of action or
furnishing of security by Landlord, such action shall be taken and such security
shall be furnished at the expense of Tenant;

(c)Tenant shall keep Landlord advised as to the status of such proceedings;

(d)Tenant, by its acts or omissions, does not place Landlord or other tenants in
jeopardy or subject to any form of penalty or fine; and

(e)Any such proceedings shall not affect the payment of Fixed Rent or Additional
Rent or other sums payable hereunder, nor prevent Tenant from using the Demised
Premises for its intended purpose.

ARTICLE 10

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

in the State of New Jersey upon property of every description and kind owned by
Tenant and or under Tenant’s care, custody or control located in the Building or
for which Tenant is legally liable or installed by or on behalf of Tenant,
including by way of example and not by way of limitation, furniture, fixtures,

single limit per occurrence and Two Million and 00/100 ($2,000,000) Dollars
general aggregate for bodily injury or death and property damage occurring in,
upon, adjacent, or connected with the Demised Premises and any part thereof on a
per location basis, as well as at least One Million and 00/100 ($1,000,000)
Dollars of coverage for property insurance.  Tenant shall name such other
insureds associated with the Building as Landlord reasonably requests.  Tenant
shall pay all premiums and charges therefor and upon failure to do so Landlord
may, but shall not be obligated to, make payments, and in such latter event the
Tenant agrees to pay the amount thereof to Landlord on demand and said sum shall
be deemed to be Additional Rent, and in each instance collectible on the first
day of any month following the date of notice to Tenant in the same manner as
though it were rent originally reserved hereunder, together with interest
thereon at the rate of three points in excess of Prime Rate.  Copies of the
original insurance policies or appropriate certificates shall be deposited with
Landlord together with any renewals, replacements or endorsements at all times
to the end that said insurance shall be in full force and effect for the benefit
of the Landlord during the Term of this Lease; (c) Worker’s Compensation
insurance in form and amount as required by law; (d) excess or “umbrella”
liability insurance in an amount of not less than Three Million and 00/100

forms of insurance as Landlord or the mortgagee of Landlord may reasonably
require from time to time if in the reasonable opinion of Landlord or said
mortgagees or said coverage and/or limits become inadequate or less than that
commonly maintained by prudent tenants in similar buildings in the area by
tenants making similar uses.

10.02.All insurance policies required pursuant to this Article shall be taken
out with insurers rated A- XII by A.M. Best Company, who are licensed to do
business in the State of New Jersey.  A policy or certificate evidencing such
insurance together with a paid bill shall be delivered to Landlord not less than
fifteen (15) days prior to the commencement of the Term hereof.  Such insurance
policy or certificates will unequivocally provide an undertaking by the insurers
to notify Landlord and the mortgages of Landlord in writing not less than thirty
(30) days prior to any material change, reduction in coverage, cancellation or
other termination thereof (except that any cancellation for non-payment shall
require only ten (10) days prior written notice).  Should a certificate of
insurance initially be provided, a policy shall be furnished by Tenant within
thirty (30) days of the Term’s commencement.  The aforesaid insurance shall be
written with reasonable and customary deductibles.

10.03.Insofar as and to the extent that the following provision may be effective
without invalidating or making it impossible to secure insurance coverage
obtainable from responsible insurance companies doing business in the state in
which the Property is located (even though extra premium may result therefrom),
Landlord and Tenant mutually agree that Landlord and Tenant shall have no
liability to one another, or to any insurer, by way of subrogation or otherwise,

- 19 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

on account of any loss or damage to their respective property, the Demised
Premises or its contents, or the Property, regardless of whether such loss or
damage is caused by the negligence of Landlord or Tenant, arising out of any of
the perils or casualties insured against by the property insurance policies
carried, or required to be carried, by the parties pursuant to this Lease. The
insurance policies obtained by Landlord and Tenant pursuant to this Lease shall
permit waivers of subrogation which the insurer may otherwise have against the
non-insuring party. In the event the policy or policies do not allow waiver of
subrogation prior to loss, either Landlord or Tenant shall, at the request of
the other party, deliver to the requesting party a waiver of subrogation
endorsement in such form and content as may reasonably be required by the
requesting party or its insurer.  In the event that any additional premium is
payable by either party as a result of this provision, the other party shall
reimburse the party paying such premium the amount of such extra premium.  The
releases herein contained shall not apply to any loss or damage occasioned by
the willful acts of either of the parties hereto.

10.04.Each party hereby releases the other party with respect to any claim
(including a claim for negligence) which it might otherwise have against the
other party for loss, damage, or destruction with respect to its property
(including rental value or business interruption) occurring during the term of
this Lease to the extent to which it is insured under a policy or policies
containing a waiver of subrogation or naming the other party as an additional
insured, as provided in this Article.  

10.05.Landlord covenants and agrees that throughout the Term it will insure the
Building (excluding any property with respect to which Landlord is obligated to
insure pursuant to Section 10.01, above) against damage by fire and standard
extended coverage perils and public liability insurance in such reasonable
amounts with such reasonable deductibles as required by any mortgagee or ground
Landlord (if any), or if none, as would be carried by a prudent owner of a
similar building in the area.  In addition, Landlord shall maintain and keep in
force and effect during the Term, rental income insurance insuring Landlord
against abatement or loss of Fixed Base Rent and Additional Rent, in case of
fire or other casualty similarly insured against, in an amount at least equal to
one year’s Fixed Base Rent for the Building.  Landlord may, but shall not be
obligated to, take out and carry any other forms of insurance as it or the
mortgagee or ground lessor (if any) of Landlord may require or reasonably
determine available.  All insurance carried by Landlord on the Building or Land
shall be included as an Operating Expense pursuant to Article 5.

10.06  To the extent available, Landlord and Tenant each agree to include an
endorsement in its property insurance policies reflecting the waiver of the
insurer’s right of subrogation against the other party as contemplated by
Section 10.03.

ARTICLE 11

inconsistency between the provisions of this Lease and any of the Rules and

this Lease.

ARTICLE 14

REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE

14.01.  Landlord shall at its expense, maintain the Property in good repair and
condition as a Class A office building, including but not limited to the
maintenance and repair of the roof, foundation, air conditioning, heating,
plumbing and electrical systems, structural components, parking areas, walkways,
and landscaping.  Tenant will not in any manner deface or injure the Building,
and will pay the cost of repairing any damage or injury done to the Building or
any part thereof by Tenant or Tenant’s agents, employees or invitees.  Tenant
shall take good care of the Premises and keep the Premises free from waste and
nuisance of any kind. Tenant shall keep the Premises, including Landlord’s
Furniture and all fixtures installed by Tenant and any plate glass and special
store fronts, in good condition, reasonable wear and tear and damage caused by
casualty excepted, and make all necessary non-structural repairs except those
caused by fire, casualty or acts of God covered by Landlord’s fire insurance
policy covering the Building.  The performance by Tenant of its obligations to
maintain and make repairs shall be conducted only by contractors and
subcontractors approved in writing by Landlord (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), it being understood that Tenant
shall procure and maintain and shall cause contractors and subcontractors
engaged by or on behalf of Tenant to procure and maintain insurance coverage
against such risks, and in such amounts as Landlord may reasonable require and
with such companies as landlord may reasonably approve, in connection with any
such maintenance and repair.  If Tenant fails to make such repairs or take steps
to have such condition corrected after the occurrence of the damage or injury,
Landlord may at its option make such repair, and Tenant, shall within thirty
(30) days of request therefor, pay Landlord for the cost thereof.  At the end or
other termination of this Lease, Tenant shall deliver up the Premises with all
improvements located thereon (except as otherwise herein provided) in good
repair and condition, reasonable wear and tear and damage caused by casualty
excepted, and shall deliver to Landlord all keys to the Premises.

14.02.If Landlord shall fail to perform any term, condition, covenant or
obligation required under this Lease and such failure either (a) has a material
adverse impact on Tenant’s access to or use of the Demised Premises or Landlord
shall fail to perform snow removal in the public portions of the Property, and
such failure continues for more than five (5) days after notice to Landlord, or
(b) in the event of a failure other than what is set forth in subsection (a),
such failure has continued for a period of forty five (45) days after prior
written notice and opportunity to cure thereof from Tenant to Landlord;
provided, however, that if the term, condition, covenant or obligation to be
performed by Landlord is such that it cannot reasonably be performed within the
applicable time period set forth in this Section 14.02, such default shall be
deemed to have been cured if Landlord commences such performance within said
45-day period (or 5-day period, as the case may be) and thereafter diligently
undertakes to complete the same, Tenant may, at its option, without waiving any
claim for damages for breach of agreement, at any time thereafter

- 22 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cure such default for the account of Landlord and any amount paid or any
contractual liability incurred by Tenant in so doing shall be deemed paid or
incurred for the account of Landlord and Landlord shall reimburse Tenant
therefore within thirty (30) days of Tenant’s demand.

ARTICLE 15

ELECTRICITY

15.01.To the extent available at the Property, Tenant shall obtain electric
service directly from the provider and provide evidence satisfactory to Landlord
that electric charges for the Demised Premises have been changed into Tenant’s
name for billing purposes within three (3) days after the Actual Delivery
Date.  Any utility service agreement with respect to the Premises is subject to
Landlord’s approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. If
electric is submetered, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent for
such service, during the Term, an amount equal to the amount Landlord actually
pays to the utility company to provide electricity to the Premises, including
all applicable surcharges, demand charges, taxes and other sums payable in
respect thereof, without any mark-up, service charge or other additional fees or
profit margin imposed by Landlord and Tenant shall receive the net of any
rebates or credits actually received by Landlord in respect of such electricity
supplied to the Premises and paid for by Tenant, based on Tenant's demand and/or
consumption of electricity as registered on a meter or sub-meter installed by
Landlord for purposes of measuring such demand and consumption. Landlord, at
Landlord's sole cost and expense (but subject to recoupment by Landlord pursuant
to Sections 5.05 and 5.06) shall maintain such meters or sub-meters in good
working order.  If at any time the Demised Premises are not separately metered
Tenant shall have the right to audit such readings, bills and calculations.  For
the avoidance of doubt, electric energy for the HVAC system and all common areas
of the Building is included in Operating Expenses, and Tenant shall pay Tenant’s
Percentage of the same.

15.02.Landlord shall not be liable in any way to Tenant for any failure or
defect in the supply or character of electric energy furnished to the Demised
Premises by reason of any requirement, act, or omission of the public utility
serving the Building with electricity or for any other reason.  Landlord shall
furnish and install all replacement lighting tubes, lamps, bulbs, and ballasts

16.02.Use of the Demised Premises, or any part thereof, in a manner exceeding
the design conditions for air-conditioning service to the Demised Premises or
rearrangement of partitioning which interferes with normal operation of the

air-conditioning system servicing the Demised Premises.  Such changes, so
occasioned, shall be made by Landlord at Tenant’s expense.

ARTICLE 17

employees shall have after-hours access to the Demised Premises and the free use
of light, power, and water in the Demised Premises as reasonably required for
the purpose of cleaning the Demised Premises in accordance with Landlord’s
obligations hereunder. In the event Tenant becomes dissatisfied with the

water and/or hot water for such other purposes and/or steam, as the case may
be.  In such instances Tenant shall pay for the quantities of cold water and hot
water shown on such meters, at Landlord’s cost thereof, on the rendition of

accidents, emergencies, strikes, or the making of repairs or changes which
Landlord is required by this Lease or by law to make or in good faith deems
necessary, by reason of difficulty in securing proper supplies of fuel, steam,
water, electricity, labor or supplies, or by reason of any other cause beyond
Landlord’s reasonable control.

17.06  If the Demised Premises or any portion thereof are rendered untenantable
or inaccessible or are not able to be used by Tenant without material and
significant hardship or inconvenience for a period of three (3) consecutive
business days (subject to extension due to Force Majeure) as a result of a
failure of the water, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, electric,
sanitary, elevator, or other Building systems serving the Demised Premises,
Tenant’s Rent shall be proportionately abated commencing on the fourth (4th) day
of such service interruption until such time as the systems have been restored
and the Demised Premises or the affected portion thereof is no longer
untenantable or inaccessible, provided that there shall be no abatement of Rent
if such failure is caused by the acts or omission of Tenant, its agents,
contractors, licensees or invitees.

17.08.Landlord shall initially make available for Tenant’s use 64 parking
spaces, which number shall be increased in the event that Tenant leases
additional space in the Building at the rate of 3.47 parking spaces per

ARTICLE 21

DESTRUCTION OR DAMAGE

21.01.If the Building or the Demised Premises shall be partially or totally
damaged or destroyed by fire or other cause, then whether or not the damage or
destruction shall have resulted from the fault or neglect of Tenant, or its
employees, agents or visitors (and if this Lease shall not have been terminated
as in this Article hereinafter provided), Landlord shall repair the damage and
restore and rebuild the Building and/or the Demised Premises, at its expense,
with reasonable dispatch after notice to it of the damage or destruction;
provided, however, that Landlord shall not be required to repair or replace any
of the Tenant’s Property.

21.02.If the Building or the Demised Premises shall be partially damaged or
partially destroyed by fire or other cause then the rents payable hereunder
shall be abated to the extent that the Demised Premises shall have been rendered
untenantable and for the period from the date of such damage or destruction to
the date the damage shall be repaired or restored; provided, however, if the
damage shall be attributable to the fault or negligence of Tenant, its agents or
employees, then rent shall continue but shall be reduced by any amounts received
by Landlord pursuant to Landlord’s coverage for business interruption and/or
rent insurance attributable to the Demised Premises.  If all or a substantial
majority of the Demised Premises shall be totally (which shall be deemed to
include substantially totally) damaged or destroyed or rendered completely
(which shall be deemed to include substantially completely) untenantable on
account of fire or other cause, the Rents shall abate as of the date of the
damage or destruction and until Landlord shall repair, restore, and rebuild the
Building and the Demised Premises; provided, however, that should Tenant
reoccupy a portion of the Demised Premises during the period of restoration work
is taking place and prior to the date that the same are made completely
tenantable, Rents allocable to such portion shall be payable by Tenant from the
date of such occupancy.

21.03.If the Building or the Demised Premises shall be totally damaged or
destroyed by fire or other cause, or if the Building shall be so damaged or
destroyed by fire or other cause (whether or not the Demised Premises are
damaged or destroyed) as to require a reasonably estimated expenditure of more
than twenty-five percent (25%) of the full insurable value of the Building
immediately prior to the casualty, then in either such case, Landlord may
terminate this Lease by giving Tenant notice to such effect within one hundred
eighty (180) days after the date of the casualty.  In case of any damage or
destruction mentioned in this Article, Tenant may terminate this Lease by notice
to Landlord if Landlord has not completed the making of the required repairs and
restored and rebuilt the Building and the Demised Premises within twelve (12)
months from the date of such damage or destruction, or within such period after
such date (not exceeding six (6) months) as shall equal the aggregate period
Landlord may have been delayed in doing so by adjustment of insurance, labor
trouble, governmental controls, act of God, or any other cause beyond Landlord’s
reasonable control (“Force Majeure”).

21.04.No damages, compensation, or claim shall be payable by Landlord for
inconvenience, loss of business, or annoyance arising from any repair or
restoration of any portion of the Demised Premises or of the Building pursuant
to this Article. Landlord shall endeavor to restore such repair or restoration
promptly and in such manner as not unreasonably to interfere

- 29 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

with Tenant’s use and occupancy during such time that Tenant is able to use the
Demised Premises during Landlord’s restoration.

21.05.Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this Article, if
Landlord or the holder of any superior mortgage shall be unable to collect all
of the insurance proceeds (including rent insurance proceeds) applicable to
damage or destruction of the Demised Premises or the Building by fire or other
cause, by reason of some action or inaction on the part of Tenant or any of its
employees, agents or contractors in connection with the processing of any claim,
then, without prejudice to any other remedies which may be available against
Tenant, there shall be no abatement of Tenant’s rents.

21.06.Landlord will not carry insurance of any kind on Tenant’s Property, and
shall not be obligated to repair any damage thereto or replace the same.

21.07.The provisions of this Article shall be considered an express agreement
governing any case of damage or destruction of the Demised Premises by fire or
other casualty, and any law of the State of New Jersey providing for such a
contingency in the absence of an express agreement, and any other law of like
import, now or hereafter in force, shall have no application in such case.

21.08.If the Demised Premises and/or access thereto become partially or totally
damaged or destroyed by any casualty not insured against, then Landlord shall
have the right to terminate this Lease upon giving the Tenant thirty (30) days’
notice and upon the expiration of said thirty (30) day notice period, this Lease
shall terminate as if such termination date were the Expiration Date. In the
event of an uninsured casualty, Landlord shall give Tenant notice within sixty
(60) days after the casualty, whether or not Landlord intends to restore the
Demised Premises and/or access to the Demised Premises regardless of the lack of
insurance coverage. In the event Landlord (i) informs Tenant it has elected not
to restore the Demised Premises and/or access thereto due to the casualty being
uninsured; or (ii) if the casualty is not insured, fails to inform Tenant within
sixty (60) days after the casualty that Landlord is uninsured for the casualty,
Tenant shall also have the right, upon thirty (30) days’ notice, to terminate
the Lease, and this Lease shall terminate as if such termination date provided
by Tenant were the Expiration Date.  

ARTICLE 22

EMINENT DOMAIN

22.01.If the whole or a substantial part of the Building shall be lawfully taken
by condemnation or in any other manner for any public or quasi-public use of
purpose, this Lease and the term and estate hereby granted shall forthwith
terminate as of the date of vesting of title on such taking (which date is
herein after also referred to as the “date of the taking”), and the rents shall
be prorated and adjusted as of such date.

22.02.If any part of the Building shall be so taken, this Lease shall be
unaffected by such taking, except that Tenant may elect to terminate this Lease
in the event of a partial taking, if the area of the Demised Premises shall not
be reasonably sufficient for Tenant to continue feasible operation of its
business.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22.03.Landlord shall be entitled to receive the entire award in any proceeding
with respect to any taking provided for in this Article without deduction
therefrom for any estate vested in Tenant by this Lease, and Tenant shall
receive no part of such award.  Tenant hereby expressly assigns to Landlord all
of its right, title, and interest in or to every such award. The foregoing shall
not, however, deprive, limit, nor restrict Tenant of, or from, any separate
award for moving expenses, business dislocation damages or for any other award
which would not reduce the award payable to Landlord.  Upon the date the right
to possession shall vest in the condemning authority, this Lease shall cease and
terminate with Rent adjusted to such date.

ARTICLE 23

SURRENDER

23.01.On the last day of the term of this Lease, or upon any earlier termination
of this Lease, or upon any re-entry by Landlord upon the Demised Premises,
Tenant shall quit and surrender the Demised Premises to Landlord in good order,
condition, and repair, except for ordinary wear and tear, casualty and
condemnation damages, and Tenant shall remove all of Tenant’s Property therefrom
and perform such restoration work as is required by this Lease. Landlord’s
Furniture shall be surrendered together with the Demised Premises, in good order
and condition, except for ordinary wear and tear. This Article 23 shall survive
the expiration or earlier termination of this Lease.

ARTICLE 24

CONDITIONS OF LIMITATION

24.01.This Lease and the Term and estate hereby granted are subject to the
limitation that:

(a)Whenever Tenant defaults in the payment of installment of Fixed Base Rent, or
in the payment of any Additional Rent or any other charge payable by Tenant to
Landlord, and such default shall continue for five (5) days after written notice
thereof; or

(b)Whenever Tenant shall do or permit anything to be done, whether by action or
inaction, contrary to any of Tenant’s obligations hereunder, and if such
situation shall continue and shall not be remedied by Tenant within thirty (30)
days after Landlord shall have given to Tenant a written notice specifying the
same, or, in the case of a happening or default which cannot with due diligence
be cured within a period of thirty (30) days and the continuance of which for
the period required for cure will not subject Landlord to risk of criminal
liability or foreclosure of any superior mortgage if Tenant shall not, (i)
within said thirty (30) day period advise Landlord of Tenant’s intention to duly
institute all steps necessary to remedy such situation; (ii) duly institute
within said thirty (30) day period, and thereafter diligently prosecute to
completion all steps necessary to remedy the same; and (iii) complete such
remedy within such time after the date of giving of said notice to Landlord as
shall reasonably be necessary; or

(c)Whenever any event shall occur or any contingency shall arise whereby this
Lease or the estate hereby granted or the unexpired balance of the term hereof
would, by operation of law or otherwise, devolve upon or pass to any person,
firm, or corporation other than Tenant, except as expressly permitted by Article
8;

- 31 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

then, and in any of the foregoing cases, this Lease and the Term and estate
hereby granted, whether or not the Term shall theretofore have commenced, shall,
if the Landlord so elects, terminate upon ten (10) days written notice by
Landlord to Tenant of Landlord’s election to terminate the Lease and the term
hereof shall expire and come to an end on the date fixed in such notice, with
the same effect as if that day were the Expiration Date, but Tenant shall remain
liable for the Fixed Base Rent and Additional Rent which subsequently accrues
(and for all accrued but unpaid Fixed Base Rent and Additional Rent as of the
date of the termination) and for damages as provided in Article 26.

ARTICLE 25

RE-ENTRY BY LANDLORD

25.01.If Tenant shall default in the payment of any installment of Fixed Base
Rent, or of any installment of Additional Rent, on any date upon which the same
ought to be paid and if such default shall continue for five (5) days after
written notice thereof, or if this Lease shall expire as provided in Article 24,
Landlord or Landlord’s agents and employees may immediately or at any time
thereafter re-enter the Demised Premises, or any part thereof, either by summary
dispossess proceedings or by any suitable action or proceeding at law, or by
force or otherwise, without being liable to indictment, prosecution or damages
therefor, and may repossess the same, and may remove any persons therefrom, to
the end that Landlord may have, hold, and enjoy the Demised Premises again as
and of its first estate and interest therein.  The word “re-enter”, as herein
used, is not restricted to its technical legal meaning.  In the event of any
termination of this Lease under the provisions of Article 24 or if Landlord
shall re-enter the Demised Premises under the provisions of this Article or in
the event of the termination of this Lease, or of re-entry, by or under any
summary dispossess or other proceeding or action or any provision of law by
reason of default hereunder on the part of Tenant, Tenant shall thereupon pay to
Landlord the Fixed Base Rent and Additional Rent payable by Tenant to Landlord
up to the time of such termination of this Lease, or of such recovery of
possession of the Demised Premises by Landlord, as the case may be, and shall
also pay to Landlord damages as provided in Article 26.

25.02.In the event of a breach or threatened breach by Landlord or Tenant of any
of their respective obligations under this Lease, either Landlord or Tenant, as
the case may be, shall also have the right of injunction.  The special remedies
hereunder are cumulative and are not intended to be exclusive of any other
remedies or means of redress to which the parties may lawfully be entitled at
any time.

25.03.If this Lease shall terminate under the provisions of Article 24, or if
Landlord shall re-enter the Demised Premises under the provisions of this
Article, or in the event of any termination of this Lease, or of re-entry, by or
under any summary dispossess or other proceeding or action or any provision of
law by reason of default hereunder on the part of Tenant, Landlord shall be
entitled to retain all moneys, if any, paid by Tenant to Landlord, whether as
advance rent, security, or otherwise, but such moneys shall be credited by
Landlord against any fixed rent or Additional Rent due from Tenant at the time
of such termination or re-entry or, at Landlord’s option, against any damages
payable by Tenant under Article 26 or pursuant to Law.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTICLE 26

DAMAGES

26.01.If this Lease is terminated under the provisions of Article 24, or if
Landlord shall re-enter the Demised Premises under the provisions of Article 25,
or in the event of the termination of this Lease, or of re-entry, by or under
any summary dispossess or other proceeding or action of any provision of law by
reason of default hereunder on the part of Tenant, Tenant shall pay to Landlord
as damages, at the election of Landlord, either;

(a)A sum which at the time of such termination of this Lease or at the time of
any such re-entry by Landlord, as the case may be, represents the then value of
the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate of the Fixed Base Rent and the
Additional Rent payable hereunder which would have been payable by Tenant
(conclusively presuming the Additional Rent to be the same as was payable for
the year immediately preceding such termination) for the period commencing with
such earlier termination of this Lease or the date of any such re-entry, as the
case may be, and ending with the Expiration Date, had this Lease not so
terminated or had Landlord not so re-entered the Demised Premises, discounted to
present value at the rate of four (4%) percent over (ii) the aggregate rental
value of the Demised Premises for the same period, or

(b)Sums equal to the Fixed Base Rent and the Additional Rent (as above presumed)
payable hereunder which would have been payable by Tenant had this Lease not so
terminated, or had Landlord not so re-entered the Demised Premises, payable upon
the due dates therefor specified herein following such termination or such
re-entry and until the Expiration Date, provided, however, that if Landlord
shall relet the Demised Premises during said period, Landlord shall credit
Tenant with the net rents received by Landlord from such reletting, such net
rents to be determined by first deducting from the gross rents as and when
received by Landlord from such reletting, the expenses incurred or paid by
Landlord in terminating this Lease or in re-entering the Demised Premises and in
securing possession thereof, as well as the expenses of reletting, including
altering and preparing the Demised Premises for new tenants, brokers’
commissions, and all other expenses properly chargeable against the Demised
Premises and the rental therefrom; it being understood that any such reletting
may be for a period shorter or longer than the remaining term of this Lease; but
in no event shall Tenant be entitled to receive any excess of such net rents
over the sums payable by Tenant to Landlord hereunder, nor shall Tenant be
entitled in any suit for the collection of damages pursuant to this Subsection
to a credit in respect of any net rents from a reletting, except to the extent
that such net rents are actually received by Landlord. Damages shall also
include the unamortized portion of any brokerage fees or commissions paid by
Landlord.  If the Demised Premises or any part thereof should be relet in
combination with other space, then proper apportionment on a square foot basis
shall be made of the rent received from such reletting and of the expenses of
reletting.

If the Demised Premises or any part thereof to be relet by Landlord for the
unexpired portion of the term of this Lease, or any part thereof, before
presentation of proof of such damages to any court, commission or tribunal, the
amount of rent reserved upon such reletting shall, prima facie, be the fair and
reasonable rental value for the Demised Premises, or part thereof, so relet
during the term of the reletting.

- 33 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

26.02.Suit or suits for the recovery of such damages, or any installments
thereof, may be brought by Landlord from time to time at its election, and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to require Landlord to postpone suit
until the date when the term of this Lease would have expired if it had not been
so terminated under the provisions of Article 24, or under any provision of law,
or had Landlord not re-entered the Demised Premises.  Nothing herein contained
shall be construed to limit or preclude recovery by Landlord against Tenant of
any sums or damages to which, in addition to the damages particularly provided
above, Landlord may lawfully be entitled by reason of any default hereunder on
the part of Tenant.  Nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit or
prejudice the right of Landlord to seek and obtain as liquidated damages by
reason of the termination of this Lease or re-entry on the Demised Premises for
the default of Tenant under this Lease, an amount equal to the maximum allowed
by any statute or rule of law in effect at the time when, and governing the
proceedings in which, such damages are to be proved whether or not such amount
be greater, equal to, or less than any of the sums referred to in Section 26.01.

26.03.In addition to the foregoing and without regard to whether this Lease is
terminated, Tenant shall pay to Landlord upon demand, all costs and expenses
incurred by Landlord, including reasonable attorney’s fees, with respect to any
lawsuit instituted or defended or any action taken by Landlord to enforce all or
any of the provisions of this Lease.

26.04.

Notwithstanding anything in this Article 26 to the contrary, if this Lease is
terminated under the provisions of Article 24, or if Landlord shall re-enter the
Demised Premises under the provisions of Article 25, or in the event of the
termination of this Lease, or of re-entry, by or under any summary dispossess or
other proceeding or action of any provision of law by reason of default
hereunder on the part of Tenant, Landlord shall not have the right to seek or
collect damages from Tenant for Fixed Base Rent or Additional Rent not yet due
and payable (i.e., Landlord shall not have the right to accelerate such rent)
unless and until any mortgagee of the Land or Building or Landlord’s interest
therein accelerates its loan as a result of Tenant’s default beyond all
applicable notice and cure periods hereunder.

ARTICLE 27

WAIVERS

27.01.

Tenant, for Tenant, and on behalf of any and all persons claiming through or

ARTICLE 28

NO OTHER WAIVERS OR MODIFICATIONS

28.01.The failure of either Party to insist in any one or more instances upon
the strict performance of any one or more of the obligations of this Lease, or
to exercise any election herein contained, shall not be construed as a waiver or
relinquishment for the future of the performance of such one or more obligations
of this Lease or of the right to exercise such election, but the same shall
continue and remain in full force and effect with respect to any subsequent
breach, act, or omission. No executory agreement hereafter made between Landlord
and Tenant shall be effective to change, modify, waive, release, discharge,
terminate or effect an abandonment of this Lease, in whole or in part, unless
such executory agreement is in writing, refers expressly to this Lease and is
signed by the Party against whom enforcement of the change, modification,
waiver, release, discharge, or termination of effectuation of the abandonment is
sought.

ARTICLE 29

CURING TENANT’S DEFAULTS

29.01.If Tenant shall default in the performance of any of Tenant’s obligations
under this Lease, Landlord, without thereby waiving such default, may (but shall
not be obligated to) perform the same for the account and at the expense of
Tenant, without notice, in a case of emergency, and in any other case, only if
such default continues after the expiration of (i) ten (10) business days from
the date Landlord gives Tenant notice of its intention to cure, or (ii) the
applicable grace period provided in Section 24.02 or elsewhere in this Lease for
cure of such default, whichever occurs later.

ARTICLE 30

BROKER

30.01.Tenant and Landlord each covenants, warrants, and represents to the other
that there was no broker except the Broker instrumental in consummating this
Lease and that no conversations or negotiations were had with any broker except
Broker concerning the renting of the Demised Premises.  Tenant agrees to hold
Landlord harmless against any claims for a brokerage commission arising out of
any conversations or negotiations had by Tenant with any broker except Broker.
  Landlord agrees to hold Tenant harmless against any claims for a brokerage
commission arising out of any conversations or negotiations had by Landlord with
any broker including Broker. Landlord agrees to pay Broker pursuant to a
separate agreement.

and deliver to Landlord a statement certifying that this Lease is unmodified and
in full force and effect (or if there have been modifications, that the same is
in full force and effect as modified and stating the modifications), certifying
the dates to which the Fixed Base Rent and Additional Rent have been paid,
whether any dispute exists with respect thereto and stating whether or not, to
Tenant’s best knowledge, Landlord is in default in performance of any of its

applicable laws, rules, ordinances, and regulations, including without
limitation all zoning, fire, life safety, building codes, environmental laws,

that Landlord has not made and is not making, and Tenant, in executing and
delivering this Lease, is not relying

- 36 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

upon any warranties, representations, promises or statements, except to the
extent that the same are expressly set forth in this Lease. It is understood and
agreed that all understandings and agreements heretofore had between the parties
are merged in this Lease, which alone fully and completely express their
agreements and that the same are entered into after full investigation, neither
party relying upon any statement or representation not embodied in this Lease
made by the other. Landlord further represents that, to Landlord’s actual
knowledge:

(a) there are no pending or threatened action against Landlord or the Building
relating to any alleged violations of the Laws from any governmental authority
or third party; and

(b) Landlord is not aware of the existence of any Hazardous Substances at, on or
under the Property that require remediation under any Environmental Laws.  For
purposes of this subsection: “Hazardous Substances” means any pollutant, toxic
substance, hazardous substance, hazardous waste or any similar term as defined
in any Environmental Law; and “Environmental Laws” means any Law applicable to
Landlord or the Property and relating to environmental matters or concerning
pollution or protection of the environment, including Laws governing the use,
storage, disposal, discharge, cleanup or reporting of Hazardous Substances.

As used in this Section and elsewhere in the Lease, to “Landlord’s actual
knowledge” shall mean actual, and not any implied, imputed or constructive
knowledge, without any investigation by Landlord.

34.02.If any of the provisions of this Lease, or the application thereof to any
person or circumstances, shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the
remainder of this Lease, or the application of such provision or provisions to
persons or circumstances other than those as to whom or which it is held invalid
or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and every provision of this
Lease shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

34.03.This Lease shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of
New Jersey, without regard to any conflict of law principles that might
otherwise cause the laws of a different jurisdiction to govern or apply.

34.04.In the event of any litigation, arbitration, or other legal proceedings
that may arise between the Parties to enforce any of the provisions of this
Lease, or any right of either Party hereunder except for litigation as described
in Article 26.03, the prevailing Party shall be entitled to recover its costs,
expenses, and reasonable attorneys’ fees in addition to any other relief to
which such Party many be entitled.  An award for such costs, expenses, and
reasonable attorneys’ fees may be included in any judgment rendered in such
litigation, arbitration, or other legal proceeding.  This paragraph shall
survive the termination of this Lease.

ARTICLE 35

SECURITY

35.01.Tenant shall deposit with Landlord the Security Deposit upon the execution
of this Lease.  The Security Deposit shall be held by Landlord as security for
the faithful performance by Tenant of all the terms of this Lease by said Tenant
to be observed and performed.  The Security Deposit shall not and may not be
mortgaged, assigned, transferred, or encumbered by Tenant,

- 37 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

without the written consent of Landlord, and any such act on the part of Tenant
shall be without force and effect and shall not be binding upon Landlord.  If
any of the Fixed Base Rent or Additional Rent herein reserved or any other sum
payable by Tenant to Landlord shall be overdue and unpaid beyond applicable
notice and cure periods, or if Landlord makes payment on behalf of Tenant, or if
Tenant shall fail beyond applicable notice and cure periods to perform any of
the terms, covenants, and conditions of this Lease then Landlord may, at its
option and without prejudice to any other remedy which Landlord may have on
account thereof, appropriate and apply the so much of the Security Deposit as
may be necessary to compensate Landlord toward the payment of Fixed Base Rent or
Additional Rent and any loss or damage sustained by Landlord due to such breach
on the part of Tenant, plus expenses; and Tenant shall forthwith within ten (10)
business days after demand restore the Security Deposit to the original sum
deposited.  The issuance of a warrant and/or the re-entering of the Demised
Premises by Landlord for any default on the part of Tenant or for any other
reason prior to the expiration of the term shall not be deemed such a
termination of this Lease as to entitle Tenant to the recovery of the Security
Deposit.  If Tenant complies with all of the terms, covenants, and conditions of
this Lease and pays all of the Fixed Base Rent and Additional Rent and all other
sums payable by Tenant to Landlord as they fall due, the Security Deposit shall
be returned in full to Tenant within thirty (30) days after the expiration of
the Term of this Lease and Tenant’s satisfaction of all its obligations accruing
prior to this Lease expiration date.  In the event of bankruptcy or other
creditor-debtor proceedings against Tenant, the Security Deposit and all other
securities shall be deemed to be applied first to the payment of Fixed Base Rent
and Additional Rent and other charges due Landlord for all periods prior to the
filing of such proceedings.  In the event of sale by Landlord of the Building,
Landlord shall deliver the then balance of the Security Deposit to the
transferee of Landlord’s interest in the Demised Premises and Landlord shall
thereupon be discharged from any further liability with respect to the Security
Deposit and this provision shall also apply to any subsequent transferees.  No
holder of a superior mortgage to which this Lease is subordinate shall be
responsible in connection with the Security Deposit, by way of credit or payment
of any Fixed Base Rent or Additional Rent, or otherwise, unless such mortgagee
actually shall have received the entire Security Deposit.

35.02.The Security shall be in the form of an irrevocable, clean “Evergreen”
automatically renewable commercial letter of credit (the "Letter of Credit") in
the form annexed hereto as Exhibit I, issued by a “Confirming Bank” which shall
mean a bank which is authorized by the State of New Jersey to conduct banking
business in the State of New Jersey, and is a member of the New York Clearing
House Association.  The Confirming Bank shall have combined capital, surplus and
undivided profits of at least $500 million and a long-term rating of at least
“Aa”, as published by Moody’s Investors Services, Inc., or its successor
(collectively, the “Confirming Bank Criteria”).  If at any time during the term
of this Lease, the Confirming Bank does not maintain the Confirming Bank
Criteria, then Landlord may so notify Tenant and, unless Tenant delivers a
replacement Letter of Credit from another bank meeting the Confirming Bank
Criteria within ninety (90) days after receipt of such notice, Landlord may draw
the full amount of the Letter of Credit and hold the proceeds as a cash security
deposit in accordance with this Article 35.  The Letter of Credit shall provide
that it shall be fully transferable by Landlord to any transferee of Landlord’s
interest in the Demised Premises with any transfer fee paid by the beneficiary,
and which shall also provide for presentation and payment in the City of New
York, (or if not able to be presented in the City of New York, able to be
presented via facsimile or other electronic method) which shall permit Landlord
(a) to draw thereon up to the full amount of the

- 38 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

credit evidenced thereby (but partial drawings shall be permitted) in the event
of any default by Tenant beyond applicable notice and cure periods in the terms,
provisions, covenants or conditions of this Lease or (b) to draw the full amount
thereof to be held as  cash security pursuant to Article hereof if for any
reason the Letter of Credit is not renewed within thirty (30) days prior to its
expiration date, in which event Landlord covenants and agrees to deposit same in
an interest bearing account or certificate.  Landlord shall be entitled to and
shall be paid the lesser of (x) interest earned on such cash security deposit or
(y) to 1% per annum of such security deposit for administration of such security
account or certificate solely to the extent held as cash pursuant to the
preceding sentence.  The remainder of the interest on such account or
certificate shall belong to Tenant, but shall be retained by Landlord as
additional security in accordance with the terms of this paragraph.  The Letter
of Credit (and each renewal thereof) shall (i) be for a term of not less than
one (1) year (except that the last Letter of Credit shall be for a term expiring
sixty (60) days after the Expiration Date), (ii) expressly provide for the
issuing bank to notify Landlord in writing not less than sixty (60) days prior
to its expiration as to its non-renewal, and (iii) if not so renewed each year
(or later period of expiration) shall be immediately available for Landlord to
draw up to the full amount of such credit (to be held as cash security as
aforesaid).  Not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration date of each
Letter of Credit (and every renewal thereof if not automatically renewed by its
terms), Tenant shall deliver a renewal Letter or if Tenant is not renewing the
then current Evergreen Letter, Tenant shall deliver to Landlord a new Letter of
Credit subject to all of the conditions aforesaid, all to the intent and
purposes, that a Letter of Credit in the sum of $100,000.00 shall be in effect
during the entire term of this lease. In the event Tenant is issuing a new
Letter of Credit, Landlord shall deliver the Letter of Credit being replaced to
Tenant concurrently with receipt of the new Letter of Credit. The Letter of
Credit shall specifically provide that any transfer fees shall be payable by the
beneficiary.  Failure by Tenant to comply with the provisions of this Article
shall be deemed a material default hereunder entitling Landlord to exercise any
and all remedies as provided in this Lease for default in the payment of Fixed
Base Rent and, to draw on the existing Letter of Credit up to its full amount.

ARTICLE 36

PARTIES BOUND

36.01.The obligations of this Lease shall bind and benefit the successors and
assigns of the Parties with the same effect as if mentioned in each instance
where a Party is named or referred to, except that no violation of the
provisions of Article 8 shall operate to vest any rights in any successor or
assignee of Tenant and that the provisions of this Article shall not be
construed as modifying the conditions of limitation contained in Article
24.  However, the obligations of Landlord under this Lease shall not be binding
upon Landlord herein named with respect to any period subsequent to the transfer
of its interest in the Building as owner or Tenant thereof and in event of such
transfer, said obligations shall thereafter be binding upon each transferee of
the interest of Landlord herein named as such owner or Tenant of the Building,
but only with respect to the period ending with a subsequent transfer within the
meaning of this Article.

36.02.If Landlord shall be an individual, joint venture, tenancy in common,
partnership, trust, unincorporated association, or other unincorporated
aggregate of individuals and/or entities or a corporation, Tenant shall look
only to such Landlord’s estate and property in the Property and the rents and
proceeds therefrom  and, where expressly so provided in this Lease, to offset
against

- 39 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the rents payable under this Lease for the collection of a judgment (or other
judicial process) which requires the payment of money by Landlord in the event
of any default by Landlord hereunder.  No other property or assets of such
Landlord shall be subject to levy, execution or other enforcement procedure for
the satisfaction of Tenant’s remedies under or with respect to this Lease, the
relationship of Landlord and Tenant hereunder, or Tenant’s use or occupancy of
the Demised Premises.  The Parties agree that except as otherwise expressly set
forth herein, neither party shall be liable to the other for any special,
indirect, or consequential damages arising out of Landlord’s breach of this
Lease.

ARTICLE 37

CONSENTS

37.01.Wherever it is specifically provided in this Lease that a Party’s consent
is not to be unreasonably withheld, a response to a request for such consent
shall also not be unreasonably delayed or conditioned.  If either Landlord or
Tenant considers that the other had unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned a consent, it shall so notify the other Party within ten (10) days
after receipt of notice of denial of the requested consent or, in case notice of
denial is not received, within ten (10) days after making its request for the
consent, or in the case such requested consent is conditioned, within ten (10)
days of receiving notice of such condition.

37.02.Tenant hereby waives any claim for damages against Landlord which it may
have based upon any assertion that Landlord has unreasonably withheld or
unreasonably delayed any such consent, and Tenant agrees that its sole remedy
shall be an action or proceeding to enforce any such provision or for specific
performance, injunction or declaratory judgment.  The sole remedy for Landlord’s
unreasonably withholding, conditioning or delaying of consent shall be as
provided in this Article.

ARTICLE 38

MORTGAGE FINANCING - TENANT COOPERATION

38.01.In the event that Landlord desires to seek mortgage financing secured by
the Demised Premises or Landlord’s interest therein, Tenant agrees to reasonably
cooperate with Landlord in support of Landlord’s application(s) by delivery to
Landlord’s mortgage broker or mortgagee, an estoppel certificate as described in
Article 32 and such other information as they shall reasonably require with
respect to Tenant’s occupancy of the Demised Premises, provided however that
Tenant shall not be obligated to provide any financial statements other than its
most recently filed Form 10-K or 10-Q.  Any such cooperation by Tenant pursuant
to this Section shall be at no cost or expense to Tenant.

ARTICLE 39

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

39.01.Tenant shall, at Tenant’s sole cost and expense, comply with the New
Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder
(referred to as “ISRA”) as same relate to Tenant’s occupancy of the Demised
Premises, as well as all other state, federal

- 40 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

or local environmental law, ordinance, rule, or regulation either in existence
as of the date hereof or enacted or promulgated after the date of this Lease,
that concern the management, control, discharge, treatment and/or removal of
hazardous discharges or otherwise affecting or affected by Tenant’s use and
occupancy of the Demised Premises.  Tenant represents that Tenant’s North
American Industry Classification System (“NAICS”) number does not subject it to
ISRA.  

ARTICLE 40

HOLDING OVER

40.01.Tenant will have no right to remain in possession of all or part of the
Demised Premises after the expiration or earlier termination of the Term.  The
parties recognize and agree that the damage to Landlord resulting from any
failure by Tenant to timely surrender possession of the Demised Premises as
aforesaid will be extremely substantial, will exceed the amount of the monthly
installments of the Fixed Base Rent and Additional Rent theretofore payable
hereunder, and will be impossible to accurately measure.  Tenant therefore
agrees that if possession of the Premises is not surrendered to Landlord upon
the expiration or termination of this Lease, in addition to any other rights or
remedies Landlord may have hereunder or at law, and without in any manner
limiting Landlord’s right to demonstrate and collect any damages suffered by
Landlord and arising from Tenant’s failure to surrender the Demised Premises as
provided herein, Tenant shall pay to Landlord on account of use and occupancy of
the Demised Premises for each month and for each portion of any month during
which Tenant holds over in the Demised Premises after the expiration or
termination of this Lease, in addition to all Additional Rent otherwise required
to be paid hereunder, (i) a sum equal to one hundred twenty five percent (125%)
of the Fixed Base Rent which was payable under this Lease during the last month
of the Term for the first three (3) months of holdover; and (ii) a sum equal to
one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Fixed Base Rent which was payable under
this Lease during the last month of the Term thereafter.  In addition, Tenant
agrees to indemnify and save Landlord harmless from and against all claims,
losses, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) resulting from Tenant failing to
so surrender the Premises within thirty (30) days after the expiration or
termination of the Term, including, without limitation, any claims made by any
succeeding tenant founded on such delay exceeding thirty (30) days. Nothing
herein contained shall be deemed to permit Tenant to retain possession of the
Demised Premises after the expiration or termination of this Lease or to limit
in any manner Landlord’s right to regain possession of the Demised Premises
through summary proceedings, or otherwise, and no acceptance by Landlord of
payments from Tenant after the expiration or termination of this Lease shall be
deemed to be other than on account of the amount to be paid by Tenant in
accordance with the provisions of this Article 40.  The provisions of this
Article 40 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Lease.

ARTICLE 41

CERTAIN DEFINITIONS AND CONSTRUCTIONS

41.01.The terms “include,” “including,” and “such as”, as used in this Lease,

this Lease or are defined in Exhibits annexed hereto, shall have the meanings

any of its other obligations hereunder, or to be compensated.

(b)The term Laws and/or requirements of public authorities and words of like

of termination as if such date were the date of expiration of the term of this
Lease and neither Party shall have any further obligation or liability to the
other after such termination (i) except as shall be expressly provided for in
this Lease, or (ii) except for such obligation as by its nature or under the
circumstances can only be, or by the provisions of this Lease, may be performed
after such termination and, in any event, unless expressly otherwise provided in
this Lease, any liability for a payment which shall have accrued to or with
respect to any period ending at the time of termination shall survive the
termination of this Lease.

ARTICLE 42

FURNITURE

An inventory of the furniture which is to be provided for Tenant’s use within
the Demised Premises is attached hereto as Exhibit E (the “Landlord’s
Furniture”). Landlord shall deliver the Demised Premises furnished with
Landlord’s Furniture, all such Landlord’s Furniture to be in “as is” condition.
Landlord makes no representations or warranties regarding the condition, fitness
for a particular use or any other aspect of Landlord’s Furniture and Tenant
shall use the furniture at

its own risk. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Landlord represents and warrants
that Landlord’s Furniture is owned by Landlord, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances. Tenant shall not remove, disassemble, repurpose, dispose of or

the Term, in good condition, wear and tear excepted.

- 43 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTICLE 43

RENEWAL OPTIONS

43.01.Provided that at the time of the exercise of the applicable option to
renew and as of the expiration of the then current Term (i) Tenant is not then
in default beyond applicable notice and cure periods of the terms, covenants,
and provisions of this Lease, and (ii) Tenant shall be in occupancy and
possession of the Demised Premises pursuant to this Lease, Landlord hereby
grants to Tenant the option (the “Renewal Option”) to renew the term of this
Lease for two (2) additional periods of three (3) years each (each, a “Renewal
Period”). The first Renewal Period, if the Renewal Option therefor is exercised,
will commence on the day after the initial Expiration Date upon the same terms
and conditions as set forth in this Lease other than the Fixed Base Rent which
shall be the Fair Market Value of the Demised Premises at the time of the
commencement of the Renewal Period multiplied by the rentable square footage of
the Demised Premises (but in no event less than the Fixed Base Rent payable
hereunder by Tenant for the last 12 months of the original Term).  The second
Renewal Period, if the Renewal Option therefor is exercised, will commence on
the day after the scheduled expiration of the first Renewal Period upon the same
terms and conditions as set forth in this Lease other than the Fixed Base Rent
which shall be the Fair Market Value of the Demised Premises at the time of the
commencement of the second Renewal Period multiplied by the rentable square
footage of the Demised Premises (but in no event less than the Fixed Base Rent
payable hereunder by Tenant for the last 12 months of the first Renewal
Period).  The Fixed Base Rent shall automatically increase on each anniversary
of the commencement of the applicable Renewal Period by an amount equal to three
percent (3%) over the Fixed Base Rent for the prior Lease Year.

43.02.Tenant shall exercise the first Renewal Option by giving written notice to
Landlord (a “Renewal Notice”) not earlier than twelve (12) months and not later
than nine (9) months prior to the initial Expiration Date, TIME BEING OF THE
ESSENCE.  Tenant shall exercise the second Renewal Option, if applicable, by
giving a Renewal Notice to Landlord not earlier than twelve (12) months and not
later than nine (9) months prior to the scheduled expiration date of the first
Renewal Period, TIME BEING OF THE ESSENCE.  If Tenant fails to give a Renewal
Notice with respect to the first Renewal Option or the second Renewal Option,
Tenant will be deemed to have waived such Renewal Option and the provisions of
this Section shall be null and void.  The Renewal Options accorded in this
Article 43 are personal to Tenant and may not be assigned except to an assignee
of Tenant pursuant to a Permitted Transfer.

43.03.Fair Market Value shall mean the amount, on a per square foot basis, that
a willing tenant would pay and a willing landlord would accept in an arms’
length transaction for office space comparable to the Demised Premises in the
Plainsboro/Princeton New Jersey office market area, giving appropriate
consideration to the recent renovations of the Building, tenant improvements,
free rent periods, brokerage commissions, Tax and Operating Cost base years, and
other applicable factors.

- 44 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

43.04.For purposes of determining “Fair Market Value” for either Renewal Period,
the following procedure shall apply:

(a)Landlord shall, within fifteen (15) business days after its receipt of a
Renewal Notice, provide its written determination of the Fair Market Value at
the commencement of the applicable Renewal Period (“Landlord’s Determination”)
to Tenant.  

(b)Within fifteen (15) business days after its receipt of Landlord’s
Determination, Tenant may, if it does not agree with Landlord’s Determination,
deliver notice to Landlord setting forth Tenant’s determination of the Fair
Market Value at the commencement of the applicable Renewal Period (“Tenant’s
Determination”).  If Tenant fails to object to Landlord’s Determination and
provide Tenant’s Determination in writing within such fifteen (15) business day
period, then Landlord’s Determination shall be deemed the Fair Market Value for
the commencement of the applicable Renewal Period and shall be binding upon
Tenant for purposes of determining Fixed Base Rent for such Renewal Period.

(c)If, within thirty (30) days after the delivery of Tenant’s Determination (the
“Negotiation Period”), Landlord and Tenant shall mutually agree upon the
determination of Fair Market Value (a “Mutual Determination”) for the
commencement of the applicable Renewal Period, then their Mutual Determination
shall constitute the Fair Market Value for purposes of determining Fixed Base
Rent during the applicable Renewal Period.

(d)If Landlord and Tenant shall be unable to reach a Mutual Determination during
the Negotiation Period, then Tenant may revoke its Renewal Notice at its sole
option by advising Landlord in writing of such, or if Tenant fails or elects not
to revoke its Renewal Notice then Landlord and Tenant shall jointly appoint an
independent qualified commercial real estate broker with at least fifteen (15)
years of office leasing experience in the Plainsboro/Princeton New Jersey office
market area (the “Arbiter”) to determine Fair Market Value at the commencement
of the applicable Renewal Period.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, Tenant shall have no right to revoke its Renewal Notice after the
appointment of the Arbiter.

(e)If appointed, the Arbiter’s fee shall be borne equally by Landlord and
Tenant.  In the event that Landlord and Tenant shall be unable to jointly agree
on the designation of the Arbiter within fifteen (15) business days after the
end of the Negotiation Period, then the Parties agree to allow the American
Arbitration Association, or any successor organization, to designate the Arbiter
in accordance with its commercial rules.

(f)The Arbiter shall conduct such investigations as he or she may deem
appropriate and shall, within thirty (30) days after the date of designation of
the Arbiter, choose either Landlord’s Determination or Tenant’s Determination
only, and such choice by the Arbiter shall be conclusive and binding upon
Landlord and Tenant for purposes of determining Fixed Base Rent at the
commencement of the applicable Renewal Period.  Each Party shall pay its own
counsel fees and expenses, if any, in connection with any arbitration under this
Article.  The Arbiter shall not have the power to add to, modify or change any
of the provisions of this Lease.

ARTICLE 44

RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER

44.01Right of First Offer. So long as no default exists beyond applicable notice
and cure periods either at the time that Landlord is obligated to give notice
according to this Section or on the date on which Landlord would otherwise
deliver possession of the First Offer Space (as that term is defined in this
Section), Tenant will have a continuing right of first offer (the "Right of
First Offer") to lease space on the Third Floor of the Building (the "First
Offer Space"). Tenant's right to the First Offer Space is subject to the rights
of any tenants under any leases hereafter existing of any space in the Building
("third party leases"), including any options to lease, rights of expansion,
rights of first refusal, or other options or rights of any tenants ("third party
rights") under any third party leases.  Landlord hereby confirms to Tenant that
there are currently no existing third party rights.

44.02Exercise of Right of First Offer. The Right of First Offer will be
exercised in accordance with, and subject to, the following terms and
conditions:

 

(a)

Landlord shall notify Tenant in writing if it decides to lease the First Offer
Space. Landlord's notice will include:

 

(i)

the specific location of the First Offer Space and the rentable area comprising
the First Offer Space;

 

(ii)

the approximate date on which the First Offer Space will become available for
occupancy by Tenant; and

 

(iii)

the improvements, if any, as Landlord is willing to make to the First Offer
Space.

 

(b)

Within ten (10) business days after Tenant's receipt of Landlord's notice,
Tenant will exercise the Right of First Offer for the entirety of the First
Offer Space, or the offer will expire as set forth in Paragraph (e) of this
Article. If Tenant exercises the Right of First Offer, then the leasing of the
First Offer Space will be on the same terms and conditions as the Lease except:

 

(i)

If within the first two Lease Years of the Term, the Fixed Base Rent shall be at
the same per square foot rental rate as then applicable to the Demised
Premises.  If after the expiration of Lease Year 2, the Fixed Base Rent to be
paid for all the First Offer Space will be the Fair Market Value as then
determined by Landlord pursuant to Article 43. Tenant shall also pay all
Additional Rent allocable to the First Offer Space.

 

(ii)

Tenant's obligation to pay Rent for the First Offer Space will commence on the
date such space is made available to Tenant, but not sooner than the date
specified in Landlord's notice unless Tenant occupies the First Offer Space
prior to such date, and will continue through the expiration or earlier
termination of the Term of the Lease.

- 46 -

4846-0294-9028.v11

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

(iii)

Landlord will deliver and Tenant will accept the First Offer Space in its then
existing condition, on an "as is" basis. Tenant will not be entitled to receive
any contribution or allowance from Landlord for improvement of the First Offer
Space.

 

(c)

The rentable area of the Premises will be adjusted appropriately to include the
rentable area of the First Offer Space and Landlord and Tenant will execute, at
the request of either, an instrument stating the rentable area of the expanded
Demised Premises, as so adjusted.

 

(d)

Tenant's right to occupy the First Offer Space will continue to and end at the
same time as its right to occupy the Demised Premises.

 

(e)

If Tenant does not exercise the Right of First Offer as to the First Offer Space
strictly in accordance with this Section, time being of the essence, the Right
of First Offer will cease to exist as to the First Offer Space and Landlord
shall be free for a period of twelve (12) months to lease the First Offer Space
on such terms as Landlord may determine and without any restrictions by reason
of this Lease.  In the event Landlord does not consummate a lease within such
twelve (12) month period, the First Offer Space shall again be subject to
Tenant’s Right of First Offer.

 

(f)

Tenant cannot assign its Right of First Offer to any sublessee of the Premises,
or to any assignee of the Lease other than an assignee pursuant to a Permitted
Transfer, or to any other person; however, if the Tenant has exercised the Right
of First Offer and has leased a First Offer Space, then Tenant's right to
sublease the First Offer Space, or to assign its rights under the Lease to the
First Offer Space, will be subject to Article 8.  Tenant’s Right of First Offer
will expire upon any assignment of the Lease or sublease of the Demised Premises
other than, in either case, a Permitted Transfer.

 

(g)

Upon inclusion of the First Offer Space, all references in the Lease to the
"Premises" or “Demised Premises” shall be deemed to include the First Offer
Space.

EXHIBIT C

RULES AND REGULATIONS

1.The rights of tenants in the entrances, corridors, elevators, and escalators
of the Building are limited to ingress to and egress from the tenants’ demised
premises for the tenants and their employees, licensees, and invitees, and no
tenant shall use or permit the use of the entrances, corridors, escalators, or
elevators for any other purpose.  No tenant shall invite to the tenant’s demised
premises, or permit the visit of, persons in such numbers or under such
conditions as to interfere with the use and enjoyment of any of the plazas,
entrances, corridors, escalators, elevators, and other facilities of the
Building by other tenants. Fire exits and stairways are for emergency use only,
and they shall not be used for any other purpose by the tenants, their
employees, licensees, or invitees.  No tenant shall encumber or obstruct, or
permit the encumbrance or obstruction of any of the sidewalks, plazas,
entrances, corridors, escalators, elevators, fire exits, or stairways of the
Building.  Landlord reserves the right to control and operate the public
portions of the Building and the public facilities, as well as facilities
furnished for the common use of the tenants, in such manner as it deems best for
the benefit of the tenants generally.

2.The Landlord may refuse admission to the Building outside of ordinary business
hours to any person not having a pass issued by Landlord or the tenant whose
demised premises are to be entered or not otherwise properly identified, and may
require all persons admitted to or leaving the Building outside of ordinary
business hours to register.  Any person whose presence in the Building at any
time shall, in the judgment of the Landlord, be prejudicial to the safety,
character, reputation, and interests of the Building or of its tenants may be
denied access to the Building or may be ejected therefrom.  In case of invasion,
riot, public excitement, or other commotion, the Landlord may prevent all access
to the Building during the continuance of the same, by closing the doors or
otherwise, for the safety of the tenants and protection of property of the
Building.  Landlord may require any person leaving the Building with any package
or other object to exhibit a pass from the tenant from whose premises the
packaging or object is being removed, but the establishment and enforcement of
such requirement shall not impose any responsibilities on the Landlord for the
protection of any tenant against the removal of property from the premises of
the tenant.  Landlord shall in no way be liable to any tenant for damages or
loss arising from the admission, exclusion, or ejection of any person to or from
the tenant’s premises or the Building under the provisions of this
rule.  Canvassing, soliciting, or peddling in the Building is prohibited, and
every tenant shall cooperate to prevent the same.

3.No tenant shall obtain or accept for use in its demised premises ice, food for
on premises preparation other than warming, beverage towel, barbering, boot
blackening, floor polishing, lighting maintenance, cleaning, or other similar

notice to Tenant next following the date on which the Lender succeeds to the
interest of Landlord under the Lease and/or to title to the Demised Premises; or

 

e.

possession of the Demised Premises upon the foreclosure of the Mortgage, or upon
the sale of the Demised Premises by Lender after foreclosure or acquisition of
