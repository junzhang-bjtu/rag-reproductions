reports or statements presented by the other Member, the President, any other
Officer or employee of the Company, or the Board or other committee of the

the Company, the other Member and its Affiliates, and its and their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and attorneys from and against any and
all losses, Claims, damages and liabilities arising out of or relating to:

 

(i)any unauthorized act (which for certainty does not mean or include a breach

A MEMBER OR THE COMPANY HEREUNDER, OR ANY OBLIGATION OF A MEMBER TO CONTRIBUTE
CAPITAL HEREUNDER, TO FUND CONTINUING OBLIGATIONS, TO REIMBURSE OR INDEMNIFY THE

Article 2 AND Article 12 OR SECTIONS 5.1, 5.5, 5.7, 5.8, 5.9, 8.9, 8.10, 9.2,
9.3, 14.12, 11.4 AND 14.12 WITHOUT THE REQUIREMENT TO BRING A DERIVATIVE ACTION

Article 5
PERCENTAGE INTERESTS

 

5.1               Member’s Initial Contributions. The Members shall be deemed to
have made the following Initial Contributions:

 



NovaCopper $176 million   South32 $176 million  

 

Subject to this Agreement, the Initial Contribution of South32 shall be applied
to fund all Expenditure requirements of the Company in connection with the
Operations the subject of the Initial Program and Budget and, as applicable, the
Operations the subject of any subsequent adopted Program and Budget and no
Member shall be obliged to contribute funds in accordance with Section 5.5 until
(i) the date on which the remaining balance of the Subscription Contribution of
South32 is equal to the cash balance that the President is required to maintain
in accordance with Section 9.2 and (ii) any loans to any Member by the Company,
including without limitation the Loan, have been repaid in full (“Funding
Commencement Date”).

 



 

20

 

5.2               Return of Contributions. No Member shall be entitled to the
return of any part of its capital contributions or to be paid interest in
respect of either its Capital Account or its capital contributions. No unrepaid
capital contribution shall constitute a liability of the Company or any Member.
A Member is not required to contribute or to lend cash or property to the
Company to enable the Company to return either Member’s capital contributions.
The provisions of this Section 5.2 shall not limit a Member’s rights or
obligations under Article 11.

 

5.3               Initial Percentage Interests. The Members shall have the
following initial Percentage Interests, which shall be represented by the Units
as set forth on Schedule 1:

 

NovaCopper Fifty Percent (50%)   South32 Fifty Percent (50%)  

 

5.4               Changes in Percentage Interests. A Member’s Percentage
Interest shall be changed as follows (with appropriate adjustment made in the
Units issued to the Members as shown on Schedule 1):

 

(a)as provided in Section 5.8; or

 

(b)upon an election by a Member pursuant to Sections 5.6 and 8.8 to contribute
less to an adopted Program and Budget than the percentage reflected by its
Percentage Interest; or

 

(c)in the event of default by a Member in making its agreed-upon contribution to
an adopted Program and Budget, followed by an election by the other Member to
invoke Section 5.7(b); or

 

(d)upon the Transfer by a Member of all or less than all of its Membership
Interest in accordance with Article 14; or

 

(e)(i) other than as set forth in subsections (ii) or (iii) below, upon the
issuance of additional Membership Interest in the Company with the unanimous
approval of the Members, (ii) in the event of a forfeiture of Units by South32
(or its successor) to the Company and an election by NovaCopper to exercise its
Contribution Election (as defined in the Loan Agreement) each pursuant to the
Loan Agreement, upon the issuance of that number of Units provided for in the
Loan Agreement to NovaCopper, or (iii) in the event of a forfeiture of Units by
South32 (or its successor) to the Company pursuant to the Loan Agreement, upon
the issuance of an equal number of Units with the unanimous approval of the
other Members.

 

5.5               Additional Cash Contributions. Subject to any election
permitted by Section 5.6, the Members shall on and after the Funding
Commencement Date be obliged to contribute funds in proportion to their
respective Percentage Interests to all adopted Programs and Budgets. If a Member
fails to contribute to any adopted Program and Budget in at least the amount
required to maintain its Percentage Interest equal to or greater than ten
percent (10%), Section 5.8 shall apply.

 

5.6               Voluntary Reduction in Percentage Interest. On or after the
Funding Commencement Date, a Member may elect, in the manner provided in Section
8.8, to limit its contributions to an adopted Program and Budget as follows:

 

(a)to some lesser amount than its respective Percentage Interest; or

 

(b)by not contributing any amount to the adopted Program and Budget.

 



 

21

 

If a Member elects, as permitted by this Section 5.6, to contribute to an
adopted Program and Budget some lesser amount than its proportionate share of
such Program and Budget based on its Percentage Interest, or not to contribute
any amount, and the other Member elects to contribute the shortfall amount or
elects not to contribute the shortfall amount and contributes its proportionate
share of such Program and Budget based on its Percentage Interest, the
Percentage Interest of the Member electing to contribute a lesser amount or not
at all shall be recalculated at the time of election to equal the result
obtained by dividing: (i) the sum of (a) the agreed value of the Member’s
Initial Contribution under Section 5.1, plus (b) the total of all of the
Member’s additional contributions, plus (c) the amount, if any, the Member
elects to contribute to the adopted Program and Budget; by (ii) the sum of (a),
(b) and (c) above for both Members; and then multiplying the result by one
hundred. The Percentage Interest of the other Member shall thereupon become the
difference between one hundred percent (100%) and the recalculated Percentage
Interest.

 

5.7               Default in Making Contributions.

 

(a)If on or after the Funding Commencement Date a Member defaults in making a
contribution under Section 9.2 as required by an approved Program and Budget in
respect of which as provided in Section 8.8 it has elected, or is deemed to have
elected, to contribute, the non-defaulting Member may, in addition to all other
rights and remedies available to it, advance the defaulted contribution on
behalf of the defaulting Member and treat the same, together with any accrued
interest, as a demand loan to the defaulting Member bearing interest from the
date of the advance at the rate provided in Section 9.3 (“Cover Loan”). The
failure to repay the Cover Loan upon demand shall be a default. A non-defaulting
Member may elect any applicable remedy under Section 5.75.7(b) or any other
rights and remedies available to such Member at law or in equity. All such
remedies shall be cumulative and, except as otherwise provided herein, the
election of one or more remedies shall not waive the election of any other
remedies.

 

On or at any time after a non-defaulting Member has advanced a Cover Loan, the
defaulting Member shall, when requested in writing by the non-defaulting Member,
grant to the non-defaulting Member a first-ranking charge, mortgage, security
agreement, debenture or other form of security interest specified by the
non-defaulting Member over the defaulting Member’s Membership Interest
(including the defaulting Member’s share of Products or cash entitlements in
accordance with Article 10) on terms satisfactory to the non-defaulting Member
to secure the repayment by the defaulting Member of the Cover Loan. The
defaulting Member covenants and agrees with the non-defaulting Member that it
shall, promptly at any time and from time to time at the request and cost of the
defaulting Member, execute and deliver to the non-defaulting Member all deeds,
instruments and other documents and do all acts and things which the
non-defaulting Member may require for the purpose of granting such charge,
mortgage, security agreement, debenture and other forms of security interest
over the defaulting Member’s Membership Interest and for the purpose of
registering such security interests.

 

(b)If a default in making a contribution or in repaying a Cover Loan as required
hereunder, the non-defaulting Member may, on not less than thirty (30) days
prior Notice to the defaulting Member of its intention to exercise its rights
under this Section 5.7(b), elect, as its sole and exclusive remedy, with respect
to any such default not cured within such thirty (30) day notice period, to have
the defaulting Member’s Percentage Interest permanently reduced by a percentage
equal to:

 

(A – ((B)/(D+C))) * Default Rate

 

Where:

 

A = the defaulting Member’s Percentage Interest immediately prior to the
adjustment

 



 

22

 

B = the sum of (a) the agreed value of the defaulting Member’s Initial
Contribution under Section 5.1, plus (b) the total of all of the defaulting
Member’s additional contributions

 

C = the amount of the Cover Loan default (including accrued but unpaid
interest), if any

 

D = the sum of (a) the agreed value of the all of the Members’ Initial
Contribution under Section 5.1, plus (b) the total of all of the Members’
additional contributions (through the date of the contribution default under
Section 5.7(a))

 

The “Default Rate” is one and one-half (1.5) for the first and second such
default and two (2.0) for the third and each subsequent such default. See
Exhibit F for examples of adjustments to a defaulting Member’s Percentage
Interest pursuant to this Section 5.7. Amounts treated as a Cover Loan pursuant
to Section 5.7(a) and interest thereon shall be included in the calculation of
the defaulting Member’s reduced Percentage Interest. The non-defaulting Member’s
Percentage Interest shall, at such time, become the difference between one
hundred percent (100%) and the further reduced Percentage Interest. Such
reductions shall be effective as of the date of the default. Appropriate
adjustments to the number of Units held by the Members shall be made to reflect
the adjusted Percentage Interests of the Members.

 

5.8               Redemption of Minority Interest. On and after the Funding
Commencement Date each Member covenants to make all contributions necessary to
maintain a Percentage Interest of ten percent (10%) or more. If the Percentage
Interest of a Member is reduced to less than ten percent (10%), a Member shall
be deemed to have resigned from the Company within the context of the operation
of Sections 18-306(2) and 18-502(c) of the Act and, as a consequence, shall have
its entire Membership Interest redeemed for no consideration. Neither the
Company nor the other Member shall have any other rights or remedies solely as a
result of the redeemed Member’s failure to maintain a Percentage Interest of ten
percent (10%) or more.

 

5.9               Continuing Obligations and Liabilities. Each Member shall be
liable to the other Member to reimburse and pay to such other Member its
respective share, based on Percentage Interests, of any and all third party
losses, Claims, damages and liabilities arising out of or relating to the
Company or the Operations, including each Member’s respective share of
Environmental Liabilities and Continuing Obligations should the cumulative cost
of satisfying any Environmental Liabilities or Continuing Obligations be in
excess of cumulative amounts accrued or otherwise charged to the Environmental
Compliance Fund, incurred by such other Member. The reimbursement obligation of
a Member under this Section 5.9 shall apply whether or not any such losses,
Claims, damages or liabilities accrue before or after the resignation or deemed
resignation of such Member, the Transfer by such Member of all or any portion of
its Membership Interest, the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, or any
reduction of such Member’s Percentage Interest, but in each case:

 

(a)only to the extent not indemnified by the Company pursuant to Section 4.9(b);
and

 

(b)not to the extent such losses, Claims, damages and liabilities arise out of
conduct of the Member requesting reimbursement described in any of Sections
4.9(e)(i) to 4.9(e)(iii) inclusive.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, South32 shall not be liable to reimburse and pay
to NovaCopper any and all third party losses, Claims, damages and liabilities
relating to the Company or the Operations, including Environmental Liabilities
and Continuing Obligations to the extent that such third party losses, Claims,
damages and liabilities arise out or in connection with any Liabilities (other
than the Assumed Obligations).

 

For purposes of this Section 5.9, such Member’s share of such liability shall be
equal to its Percentage Interest at the time such liability was incurred (or as
to any such liabilities arising or existing prior to the Effective Date, such
Member’s initial Percentage Interest). Any resignation or deemed resignation of
a Member, any Transfer by such Member or all or any portion of its Membership
Interest, or any reduction of a Member’s Percentage Interest under this Article
5 shall not relieve such Member of its share of any such liability accruing
before such Transfer or reduction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions
of this Section 5.9 shall not apply in the case that the Member requesting
reimbursement is finally determined to be personally liable for such losses,
Claims, damages or liabilities, and shall not be construed as a waiver or
reduction of the limitations under the Act or other applicable Law of the
liability of a Member for Company obligations.

Article 6
BOARD

 

6.1               Organization and Composition.

 

(a)The Members hereby establish a Board which shall be responsible for the
management of the business and affairs of the Company. Except with respect to
those governing anti-corruption/anti-bribery, the Board shall determine overall
policies, procedures, practices and standards (including health, safety,
environment and community policy, business conduct policy and operating
standards), methods and actions of the Company which shall reflect the
corresponding policies, procedures, practices and standards of the Members
holding, in the aggregate, not less than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding
Membership Interest. With respect to those governing
anti-corruption/anti-bribery, the Board shall adopt, at a minimum, those of
South32’s policies and procedures as applicable to the Company. The Board
initially shall consist of four (4) representatives. So long as a Member
maintains a twenty-five percent (25%) Percentage Interest, each such Member
shall be entitled to appoint two (2) representatives to the Board; provided that
in the event that the Percentage Interest of a Member decreases below
twenty-five percent (25%), such Member shall be entitled to appoint only one (1)
representative on the Board and the other Member shall be entitled to appoint
three (3) representatives.

 



 

24

 

(b)Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time there are more than two (2)
Members then:

 

(i)each such Member shall be entitled to appoint one (1) representative to the
Board for each twenty percent (20%) Percentage Interest held by it; and

 

(ii)in the event that the Percentage Interest of a Member decreases below
fifteen percent (15%), the one representative of such Member on the Board shall
be deemed to have automatically resigned without the necessity of any action by
the Company or the other Members and such Member shall no longer have the right
to appoint a representative to the Board and the other Members shall be entitled
to appoint all the representatives to the Board.

 

(c)Each Member may appoint one or more alternates to act in the absence of a
regular representative. Any alternate so acting shall be deemed a representative
on the Board of the appointing Member. A Member may replace one or more of its
representatives or alternate representatives on the Board, by Notice to the
other Members.

 

(d)The Board shall at the first meeting of the Board in each Fiscal Year appoint
one of the representatives appointed by the Members to the Board to be the Chair
of the Board during that Fiscal Year.

 

(e)The Chair of the Board shall preside at meetings of the Board but shall not
in any circumstances be entitled to cast a deciding vote in the event that there
is a tied vote cast by the representatives to the Board on any matter or to cast
a deciding vote on any matter that must be determined by Special Approval or
Unanimous Approval.

 

(f)Representatives on the Board shall not be considered managers under the Act
in such capacity, but derive all of their right, power and authority from the
Members. No Member or representative of a Member on the Board shall have the
power or authority in its individual capacity to bind the Company. All documents
and instruments executed on behalf of the Company shall be signed by the
President or an Officer, employee or agent of the Company to whom the Board has
delegated the necessary general or specific authority.

 

6.2               Decisions.

 

(a)Except with respect to Loan Decisions, each Member, acting through its
appointed representatives on the Board shall have the number of votes on all
matters presented for decision by the Board equal to such Member’s Percentage
Interest. With respect to Loan Decisions, each Member (other than South32 or its
successor), acting through its appointed representatives on the Board shall have
the number of votes on all matters presented for decision by the Board equal to
such Member’s Percentage Interest. All of the votes that the representatives of
a Member are entitled to cast at any meeting of the Board shall be cast by the
Voting Representative of that Member and no other representative of such Member
shall be entitled to vote on any matter. At each meeting of the Board at which
more than one representative of a Member is present, the representatives of such
Member shall designate one such representative as the Voting Representative. If
only one representative of a Member is present at a meeting of the Board, that
representative shall be the Voting Representative. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Voting Representative of a Member with a fifty percent (50%) Percentage
Interest would be entitled to cast fifty (50) votes and the Voting
Representative of a Member with a forty-six and 32/100ths (46.32%) Percentage
Interest would be entitled to cast forty-six and 32/100ths (46.32) votes.

 

(b)Except as provided in Section 6.6 or expressly provided in any other Section
of this Agreement, all decisions or actions of the Board shall require a
Majority Approval. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the determination of whether
there has been Majority Approval with respect to a Loan Decision shall be
determined by excluding any Voting Representatives appointed by South32 (or its
successor) from that determination; provided, however, that any decision by the
Voting Representatives with respect to a Loan Decision must be made in good
faith.

 

(c)The matters and actions set forth in Section 6.6(a) shall require Special
Approval of the Board.

 



 

25

 

 

(d)The matters and actions set forth in Section 6.6(b) shall require Unanimous
Approval of the Board.

 

(e)The matters and actions set forth in Section 6.6(c) shall require Majority
Approval of the Board, which must include the approval of at least one Voting
Representative appointed by South32 (or its successor).

 

(f)Any election by the Company to exercise the Purchase Option pursuant to the
Lease Agreement shall be determined by the Voting Representative(s) appointed by
South32 (or its successor).

 

6.3               Meetings.

 

(a)The Board shall meet as required by this Agreement or as otherwise needed,
but not less frequently than once each quarter during each Fiscal Year. Meetings
of the Board shall be held at such places as the Board may from time to time
determine but the majority of all meetings of the Board in any Fiscal Year shall
be held at locations or places within the United States. The Chair shall give
not less than twenty (20) days’ prior Notice to the Members and representative
of the Board of such regular meetings. Additionally, either Member may call a
special meeting upon not less than twenty (20) day’s prior Notice to the Chair
of the Board, the representatives of the Board, and the other Member. In case of
emergency, reasonable notice of a special meeting shall suffice.

 

(b)There shall be a quorum at any meeting of the Board if at least one
representative (whether a regular representative or an alternate representative
acting on behalf of a regular representative) of each Member is present;
provided, however, that a representative of South32 (or its successor) is not
required to be present at a meeting of the Board where the only items being
considered are Loan Decisions in order for there to be a quorum as long as the
representatives of South32 were provided notice of such meeting in accordance
with this Agreement and were provided the opportunity to attend such Meeting of
the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time scheduled for a meeting
a quorum is not present or represented because at least one representative
appointed by one of the Members is not in attendance or represented, then (i)
the meeting shall be adjourned to the same time and place forty-eight (48) hours
later, provided, however, if such adjournment would fall on a day that is not a
Business Day, then the meeting shall be adjourned to the same time and place on
the first Business Day following such forty-eight (48) hour period, and (ii)
Notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to both Members and all
representatives. If at the first adjourned meeting a quorum is still not present
or represented because at least one representative appointed by one of the
Members is not in attendance or represented, then at such further adjourned
meeting a quorum shall not require the attendance of a representative appointed
by the Member whose representative(s) failed to attend the first Board meeting
or the first adjourned Board meeting.

 

(c)Each Notice of a meeting of the Board shall include an itemized agenda
prepared by or on behalf of the Chair of the Board in the case of a regular
meeting, or prepared by the Member calling the meeting in the case of a special
meeting (including any agenda items requested by the other Members), but any
matters may be considered with the consent of both Members. In the case of
adjourned meetings due to lack of a quorum, the Board may act only on those
items included in the Notice of the meeting to which the adjourned meeting
relates.

 

(d)Meetings of the Board may be held by means of conference telephone, video
conferencing or other similar instantaneous communications technology by means
of which all representatives on the Board participating in the meeting can hear
each other, and participation in a meeting by such communications technology
shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. Neither Member shall record
any of the proceedings of the Board without the express prior written consent of
the other Member.

 



 

26

 

(e)The Chair of the Board shall cause written minutes of all meetings to be
prepared and distributed to the Members within fifteen (15) days after the
meeting. The Members shall have ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt
of a copy of the minutes to raise objections or to request revisions to the
minutes by Notice to the Chair. If no such objection or request is made by a
Member within such ten (10) Business Day period, such minutes shall be binding
on the Members and the Board. If a Member raises objections or requests
revisions to the minutes, such Member shall provide in writing a reasonable
alternative to the provisions in the minutes distributed by the Chair and the
Members shall attempt to revise the minutes, taking into account the objections
or comments raised and the alternative provisions proposed. If the Members do
not agree on the minutes of the meeting within thirty (30) days after delivery
of the Notice from the objecting Member, the minutes of the meeting as prepared
by the Chair together with the proposed changes submitted by the objecting
Member shall collectively constitute the record of the meeting.

 

(f)If Personnel employed or engaged by the Company for the purposes of the

Budget shall, among other things, include details of:

 

(A)the nature and extent of Operations;

 

(B)anticipated levels of production of Products;

 

(C)details of any capital works to be undertaken or any significant contract or
commitment to be entered into and related operating or capital Expenditure; and

 

(D)a schedule of projected working capital requirements

 

(E)capital cost requirements (sustaining and major);

 

(viii)an Environmental Compliance plan for all Operations consistent with any
applicable Law or contractual obligations and shall include in each Program and
Budget sufficient funding to be deposited in the Environmental Compliance Fund
to implement the Environmental Compliance plan and to satisfy the financial
assurance requirements of any applicable Law or contractual obligation
pertaining to Environmental Compliance or Continuing Obligations (or both, as
the case may be). To the extent practical, the Environmental Compliance plan
shall incorporate concurrent reclamation of Project Properties disturbed by the
Operations;

 

(ix)such other facts as may be necessary to reasonably illustrate the results
intended to be achieved by the proposed Program;

 

(x)an estimate of the Expenditure which is anticipated for the Fiscal Year
following the Fiscal Year to which the Program and Budget relates together with
the assumptions relating to that estimate;

 

(xi)any other information required by the Board or considered appropriate and
material by the President for the Board to assess the proposed Program and
Budget; and

 

(xii)any other information that the President considers material or otherwise
prudent for the Board to take into consideration.

 

Where a proposed Program and Budget contains details of capital works to be
undertaken in respect of a Project that has progressed to the Operating Phase,
the President may and, if so directed by the Board, shall prepare and submit to
the Board a separate proposed Program and Budget covering the carrying out of
such capital works.

 

Each proposed Program and Budget shall be accompanied by the reports and data
that are reasonably necessary for each Member to evaluate and assess the adopted
Program and Budget for the then current Fiscal Year and the proposed Program and
Budget in respect of the next Fiscal Year. Upon request of any Member, the
General Manger shall meet with the Member and its representatives to discuss the
proposed Program and Budget and the President shall provide such additional or
supplemental information as the Member may reasonably require, and such
additional or supplemental information must also be provided to the other
Member.

adopt a Program and Budget at a meeting called to consider a proposed Program
and Budget at which a quorum is present:

 



 

38

 

(i)after the expiration of the current adopted Program and Budget and until a
new Program and Budget is adopted by the Board, the Company shall conduct
Operations and incur Expenditure necessary to preserve the Assets and the Board
shall be deemed to have approved of the Company undertaking sufficient
Operations and incurring sufficient Expenditure during the relevant Fiscal Year
in order to satisfy those requirements;

 

(ii)such Operations shall be funded by the Members making additional capital
contributions to the Company in proportion to their respective Percentage
Interests at the time the preceding adopted Program and Budget expired; and

 

(iii)the President shall promptly prepare and submit to the Board a revised
proposed Program and Budget, taking into account any instructions from the
Board.

expenses for all Operations contemplated under the Program and Budget and such
funds will be deposited into the Environmental Compliance Fund. Costs of
reasonably anticipated Environmental Compliance shall be determined by the
President and approved by the Board, on a Program basis, and shall be based on
proportionate contributions in an amount sufficient to establish a fund, which
through successive proportionate contributions during the life of the Company,
will pay for ongoing Environmental Compliance conducted during Operations and
which will aggregate the reasonably anticipated costs of mine closure,
post-Operations Environmental Compliance and Continuing Obligations. The
Environmental Compliance Fund shall be maintained by the President in a
separate, interest bearing cash management account, which may include, but is
not limited to, money market investments and money market funds, and/or in
longer term investments if approved by the Board. Such funds shall be used
solely for Environmental Compliance and Continuing Obligations, including the
committing of such funds, interest in property, insurance or bond policies, or
other security to satisfy applicable Laws regarding financial assurance for the
reclamation or restoration of the Project Property and for other Environmental
Compliance requirements.

 

8.7               Preliminary Review of Proposed Programs and Budgets. Within
twenty (20) days following receipt of a proposed Program and Budget from the
President or from a Member as provided in Section 8.5(a), the Board shall meet

Manger shall attend such meeting. Prior to the meeting the General Manger shall
promptly respond to all reasonable inquiries from Members for information, data,
analyses or other matters concerning the proposed Program and Budget.

 

8.8               Approval of Programs and Budgets and Election to Participate.

 

(a)With respect to each proposed Program and Budget submitted to the Board
pursuant to Section 8.4, the Board shall meet to consider the adoption of such
proposed Program and Budget following the date on which both Members have
received the necessary corporate authority and internal authorizations required
by it in order for the representatives appointed by it to the Board to vote on
the proposed Program and Budget, but in no event later than December 15.

 

(b)During a Board meeting at which a Program and Budget was adopted, a Member
may elect to contribute to such Program and Budget in some lesser amount than
its respective Percentage Interest, or may elect not to contribute any amount,
in which cases its Percentage Interest shall be recalculated as provided in
Article 5. If a Member fails to make such an election at such Board meeting, the
Member shall be deemed to have elected to contribute to such Program and Budget
in proportion to its respective Percentage Interest as of the beginning of the
period covered by the Program and Budget.

 

(c)If a Member elects pursuant to Section 8.8(b) not to contribute to an adopted
Program and Budget or to contribute in some lesser amount than its respective
Percentage Interest, then the other Member may, at the same Board meeting at
which such election was made, elect to withdraw its votes in favor of the
adopted Program and Budget and if such withdrawal results in fewer votes in
favor of the Program and Budget than are required to adopt it, to require a new
vote on the proposed Program and Budget.

 



 

39

 

8.9               Budget Overruns. The President shall immediately notify the
Board of any material departure from an adopted Program and Budget. Overruns of
ten percent (10%) or less of the amount of a Budget shall be borne by the
Members in proportion to their respective Percentage Interests as of the time
the overrun occurs. Except as provided in Section 8.10, the Company may not
exceed the adopted Budget by more than ten percent (10%) without the Majority
Approval of Board.

 

8.10            Emergency or Unexpected Expenditures. In case of emergency, the
President may take any reasonable action he or she deems necessary to protect
life, limb or property, to protect the Assets or to comply with Law or
government regulation. The President shall promptly notify the Members of the
emergency. The cost incurred in responding to the emergency shall be funded by
the Members making additional capital contributions to the Company in proportion
to their respective Percentage Interests at the time the emergency expenditures
are incurred. In case of emergency expenditures exceeding $10 million, the Board
shall meet within twenty (20) days after receipt of notice of such expenditures
to reconsider the then approved Program and Budget, and such Program and Budget
shall become subject to re-approval in accordance with Section 8.8.

 

8.11            Alterations. The Board may at any time and from time to time of
its own volition or on the recommendation of the President alter by Majority
Approval an adopted Program and Budget and from the date of the alteration, the
adopted Program and Budget will be varied accordingly.

 

8.12            Bridging Budget.

 

(a)This Section 8.12 applies on and after the date on which a Project has
progressed to the Operating Phase.

 

(b)If the Board does not by Majority Approval approve and adopt a Program and
Budget proposed by the President in respect of a period during which, in the
absence of such approval, there will be no current Program and Budget relating
to Operations and the Members do not prior to the commencement of that period
reach some contrary agreement or the Board does not by Majority Approval approve
that proposed Program and Budget or a revision of the proposed Program and
Budget, then the Board will be deemed to have approved and adopted a Program and
Budget for:

 

(i)the continuation of the Operations at the level of the last approved and
adopted Program and Budget (excluding any capital Expenditure other than that
set forth in Section 8.12(b)(ii)) but with:

 

(A)the budget of Expenditure; and

 

(B)each item in the budget of Expenditure,

 

comprised in the last approved and adopted Program and Budget escalated at the
annual rate of inflation; and

 

(ii)the replacement of worn out or obsolete plant, machinery and equipment at
the discretion of the President to an aggregate value of up to 50% of the
average annual Expenditure incurred on such replacements over the three (3)
preceding Fiscal Years by the Company.

 



 

40

 

(c)For the purposes of this Section 8.12 the “annual rate of inflation” in
respect of a Fiscal Year and in respect of each item comprised in a budget of
Expenditure means the movement during the Fiscal Year:

 

(i)in the case of consumable supplies, in the actual purchase cost of the item
concerned; or

 

(ii)in the case of wages, in the applicable award, collective agreement or other
similar agreement; or

 

(iii)in all other cases (including salaries and benefits), in the Consumer Price
Index which is most appropriate to the item concerned as published by United
States Bureau of Labor Statistics (or in the absence of that Index some other
periodically published measure of inflation in the United States which as nearly
as possible equates to that Index agreed upon by the Members or failing such
agreement selected by the auditor for the time being of the Company).

period of approximately sixty (60) days. All funds in excess of immediate cash
requirements shall be invested in interest-bearing accounts with the Company’s
bank, for the benefit of the Business Account.

 

9.3               Failure to Meet Cash Calls. Except as provided in Section 8.8,
a Member that fails to meet cash calls in the amount and at the times specified
in Section 9.2 shall be in default, and the amounts of the defaulted cash call

points (4%) over the Prime Rate, but in no event shall such rate of interest

assistance of the Management Team, shall cause the Company to prepare and

applicable), upon notice in writing to the Company, shall be provided with
reasonable access during regular business hours to the information necessary to
audit either internally or externally, the Company’s accounts, records and
systems relating to the accounting hereunder for any financial year within the
12-month period following the end of such financial year; provided that such
right shall be exercised in a manner that does not interfere with the conduct of
the business or expeditious completion by the Company of its accounts for a
financial year. Where two or more Members or their designated representatives
wish to conduct an audit, they shall make every reasonable effort to conduct
joint or simultaneous audits in a manner which will result in a minimum of

such Member to meet its audit requirements. Such audited reports shall be made
available to each Member.

Company shall distribute to each Member in kind its share of all Products in
accordance with such Member’s Percentage Interest at the time of such
distribution. The President shall give the Members prompt Notice in advance of
the delivery date upon which their respective shares of Products will be
available for distribution. Unless otherwise agreed by Unanimous Approval of the
Board, title to, and all risk of loss of, or damage to, and all liability and
Claims arising out of or in connection with transportation, storage, sale or
other disposition or use by any means of Products, shall transfer to and be
assumed solely by each Member upon such Products being loaded by the Company
from the port facilities maintained by the Company in Port Mackenzie, or such

Member for the purposes of transporting such Products to another location or
other mode of transport.

 

10.2            Distributions of Cash. Distributions of cash by the Company to

distributions of cash shall be made to the Members in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests.

 



 

42

 

10.3            Hedging. Neither Member shall have any obligation to account to
the other Member for, nor have any interest or right of participation in any
profits or proceeds nor have any obligation to share in any losses from, futures
contracts, forward sales, trading in puts, calls, options or any similar
hedging, price protection or marketing mechanism employed by the other Member
with respect to its proportionate share of any Products produced or to be
produced from the Properties.

 

10.4            Withholding.

 

(a)All amounts withheld or required to be paid by the Company pursuant to the
Code or any federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law with respect to any
payment, distribution, ownership by or allocation to a Member, or which the
Company is otherwise obliged to pay to any Governmental Authority because of the
status of a Member of the Company (including, any interest, penalties and
expenses associated with such payments), will, to the extent so withheld or paid
over (or both, as the case may be) to such Governmental Authority, be treated as
amounts paid to such Member for all purposes of this Agreement. The Board is
authorized to withhold from distributions to Members, or to pay with respect to
allocations to Members, and in each case to pay over to the appropriate federal,
state, local or non-U.S. government any amounts required to be so withheld or
paid. The Board will allocate any such amounts to the Members in respect of
whose distribution or allocation the tax was withheld or paid and will treat
such amounts as actually distributed to such Members. Each Member shall
indemnify the Company in full for any amounts paid pursuant to this Section
10.4(a) (including any interest, penalties and expenses associated with such
payments) with respect to such Member to the extent not otherwise applied to
reduce any concurrent distribution to which such Member would otherwise be
entitled. The Board may offset future distributions to which a Member is
otherwise entitled under this Agreement against such Person’s obligation to
indemnify the Company under this Section 10.4(a), and each Member will promptly
upon notification of an obligation to indemnify the Company pursuant to this
Section 10.4(a) make a cash payment to the Company equal to the full amount to
be indemnified (and the amount paid will be treated as a capital contribution
and added to such Member’s Capital Account) with interest to accrue on any
portion of such cash payment not paid in full when requested, calculated at a
rate equal to 10% per annum, compounded as of the last day of each year (but not
in excess of the highest rate per annum permitted by law).

 

(b)Each Member will provide the Company with any information, representations,
certificates or forms relating to such Member (or its direct or indirect owners
or account holders) that are requested from time to time by the Board and that
the Board determines in its sole discretion are necessary or appropriate in
order for any entity (including (i) the Company, (ii) any entity in which the
Company holds (directly or indirectly) an interest (whether in the form of debt
or equity) and (iii) any member of any “expanded affiliated group” (as defined
in Code Section 1471(e)(2)) of which any Person described in clause (i) or (ii)
is a member) to:

 

(i)enter into, maintain or comply with the agreement contemplated by Code
Section 1471(b);

 

(ii)satisfy any requirement imposed under Code Sections 1471 through 1474 in
order to avoid any withholding required under Code Sections 1471 through 1474
(including any withholding upon any payments to such Member under this
Agreement);

 

(iii)comply with any reporting or withholding requirements under Code Sections
1471 through 1474; or

 

(iv)comply with any fiscal or regulatory legislation, rules or practices adopted
pursuant to any intergovernmental agreement entered into in connection with the
implementation of Code Sections 1471 through 1474.

 



 

43

 

In addition, each Member will take such actions as the Board may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing. In the event that any Member fails to
provide any of the information, representations, certificates or forms (or
undertake any of the actions) required under this Section 10.4(b), the Board
will have full authority to take any steps as the Board determines in its sole
discretion are necessary or appropriate to mitigate the consequences of such
Member’s failure to comply with this Section 10.4(b) on the other Member. If
requested by the Board, such Member will execute any and all documents,
opinions, instruments and certificates as the Board will have reasonably
requested or that are otherwise required to effectuate the foregoing. Any Member
that fails to comply with this Section 10.4(b) will, together with all other
Members that fail to comply with this Section 10.4(b), unless otherwise agreed
by the Board in writing, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify and
hold harmless the Board and the Company for any costs or expenses arising out of
such failure or failures, including any withholding tax imposed under Code
Sections 1471 through 1474 or as a result of any intergovernmental agreement
described in Section 10.4(b)(iv) on the Company and any withholding or other
taxes imposed as a result of a transfer effected pursuant to this Section
10.4(b). Each Member acknowledges and agrees that any personal data in respect
of such Member (or any Persons that indirectly hold an interest in the Company
through such Member) provided to the Company in accordance with this Section
10.4(b) may, if required, be disclosed to any tax authority.

pursuant to the Loan Agreement and those to which both Members have given their
written consent after the Effective Date, and such Membership Interest shall be

of Operations conducted or conditions existing prior to such resignation.

 

11.3            Liquidation and Termination After Dissolution. Upon the
dissolution of the Company under Section 11.1, the Board shall appoint in
writing one or more liquidators (who, upon Unanimous Approval, may be a Member)
who shall have the authority set forth in Section 11.6. The liquidator shall
take all action necessary to wind up the activities of the Company, and all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the liquidation and termination
of the Company shall be expenses chargeable to the Company. The liquidator may
determine which Assets, if any, are to be distributed in kind, and shall sell or
otherwise dispose of all other Assets of the Company. All gain or loss with
respect to the Assets (including Assets distributed in kind) shall be allocated
among the Members in accordance with the applicable provisions of Exhibit B.
Should a Member have a deficit balance in its Capital Account (after giving
effect to such allocations of gain or loss), the Member shall not be obligated
to make a contribution to the Company to restore all or any part of such Capital
Account deficit. The Assets of the Company shall first be paid, applied, or
distributed in satisfaction of all liabilities of the Company to third parties
(or to making reasonable provision for the satisfaction thereof) and then to
satisfy any debts, obligations, or liabilities owed to the Members. Thereafter,
any remaining cash and all other Assets shall be distributed to the Members in
accordance with Section 3(b)(ii) of Exhibit B. Each Member shall have the right
to designate another Person to receive any Assets that otherwise would be
distributed in kind to that Member pursuant to this Section 11.3. Upon the
completion of the winding up of the Company, the liquidator shall cancel the
Certificate of Formation of the Company and take such other actions as may be
reasonably necessary to terminate the continued existence of the Company.

11.4            Financial Assurances for Continuing Operations. Within a period
of forty-five (45) days following the Transfer or forfeiture of Member’s
Membership Interest, the deemed resignation of a Member pursuant to Section 5.8,
or the Notice of election to resign referred to in Section 11.2, the President
shall procure a qualified independent third party to conduct an environmental
baseline study that shall estimate in dollar amounts the costs and liabilities
associated with reclamation of the Properties in relation to work performed
during the period starting from the Effective Date and up to and including the
date of such Notice, such resignation, forfeiture or Transfer. Such calculation
shall take into account the applicable amount of any mine reclamation bonds and
the amounts in any mine reclamation fund. Based on this environmental baseline
study and estimate, the resigning, forfeiting or transferring Member shall
provide (a) a lump-sum cash payment or (b) other adequate financial assurance in
an amount equal to such Member’s pro rata share based on its respective
Membership Interest (determined as of the date of the Notice referred to in
Section 11.2, deemed resignation, Transfer or forfeiture, and prior to giving
effect to the resignation, Transfer or forfeiture) for any unfunded
Environmental Compliance or Continuing Obligations costs (whether in the form of
cash, negotiable securities, letters of guarantee, irrevocable letters of credit
or otherwise) payable to the Company’s Environmental Compliance Fund to satisfy
the Company’s obligations under any Environmental Laws regarding reclamation,
including reclamation requirements, compliance with the Company’s reclamation
plan, and the Company’s maintenance of financial assurance for the reclamation
or restoration of the Properties.

 

11.5            Right to Data After Termination. After the termination of the
Company pursuant to Section 11.1, each Member shall be entitled to copies of all
information acquired by the Company before the effective date of termination not
previously furnished to it, but a Resigning Member shall not be entitled to any
such copies as are acquired by the Company after the date of the Resigning
Member’s resignation or the date on which the Resigning Member forfeits or
transfers its entire Membership Interest (as the case may be).

 

11.6            Continuing Authority. From and after the dissolution of the
Company under Section 11.1, the liquidator shall have the power and authority of
the Members, the President and the Board to do all things on behalf of the
Company which are reasonably necessary or convenient to: (a) wind up the
Operations and the Company, (b) continue to operate the Properties and other
Assets of the Company during the winding up of the Operations and the Company
and (c) complete any transaction and satisfy any obligation, unfinished or
unsatisfied, at the time of such dissolution, if the transaction or obligation
arises out of Operations prior to such dissolution. The liquidator shall have
the power and authority to grant or receive extensions of time or change the
method of payment of an already existing liability or obligation, prosecute and
defend actions on behalf of the Company, mortgage Assets, and take any other
reasonable action in any matter with respect to the Company or the Operations.

Article 13
ABANDONMENT AND SURRENDER OF PROPERTIES

 

13.1            Surrender or Abandonment of Property. The Board may by Unanimous
Approval authorize the President to surrender or abandon part or all of the
Properties (“Abandonment Property”). If the Board authorizes by Unanimous
Approval any such surrender or abandonment then the Company shall give Notice to
each Member at least twenty (20) Business Days in advance of the proposed date
of surrender or abandonment (“Abandonment Date”) together with details of the
Abandonment Date and details of any Encumbrance on the Abandonment Property
created by, through or under the Company. Each Member shall have a period of ten
(10) Business Days from receipt of the Notice to elect by Notice to the Company
to take an assignment of the Abandonment Property, which assignment will be on
an “as is” basis for a total consideration equal to ten dollars ($10). If a
Member elects to take an assignment of the Abandonment Property, then the
Company shall assign to the electing Member or its nominee, by quitclaim deed or
other appropriate instrument and at the cost of the electing Member, all of the
Company’s interest in the Abandonment Property, and the Abandonment Property
shall cease to be part of the Properties and the Company shall have no further
right, title or interest in the Abandonment Property. With effect from date of
assignment, the electing Member taking an assignment of the Abandonment
Property, and subject to the mining laws and regulations as contained in the
Alaska Statutes and the Alaska Administrative Code, including but not limited to
the approval where applicable of the commissioner of the Alaska Department of
Natural Resources pursuant to 11 AAC 97.330 and 11 AAC 97.350:

 



 

45

 

 

(a)shall assume all of the liabilities (including any Encumbrance) accruing or
attaching to the registered holder or beneficial owner of the Abandonment
Property irrespective of whether such liabilities arose or accrued before, on or
after the date of assignment to the electing Member; and

 

(b)is solely liable for any Claim, and shall indemnify the other Member and the
Company from and against any Claim, arising out of or in connection with the
Abandonment Property irrespective of whether the Claim arose before, on or after
the date of assignment of the Abandonment Property to the electing Member or was
caused or contributed to by any act or omission of the other Member or the
Company.

 

If a Member does not give notice to the Company within the period of twenty (20)
Business Days referred to above electing to take an assignment of the
Abandonment Property, then the Company may surrender or abandon the Abandonment
Property on the Abandonment Date and will thereafter have no further obligation
to maintain the title to the Abandonment Property.

 

13.2            Reacquisition. If any Abandonment Property is abandoned or
surrendered under the provisions of Section 13.1, then except as provided in
Section 13.1, unless this Agreement is earlier terminated, neither Member nor
any Affiliate thereof shall acquire any interest in such Abandonment Property or
a right to acquire such Abandonment Property (“Abandonment Property Interest”)
for a period of two (2) years following the Abandonment Date. If a Member
acquires any Abandonment Property Interest in violation of this Section 13.2,
then the other Member may elect by Notice to the acquiring Member within
forty-five (45) days after it has actual notice of such acquisition, to have
such Abandonment Property Interest contributed to the Company. Until contributed
to the Company in accordance with this Section 13.2, the acquiring Member shall
hold such Abandonment Property Interest in trust for the exclusive use and
benefit of the Company and the other Member. After such Notice to contribute the
Abandonment Property Interest, the Member that has acquired the Abandonment
Property Interest shall convey to the other Member by special warranty deed an
interest in such Abandonment Property Interest equal to the Percentage Interest
of the other Member at the time and thereafter each Member shall contribute the
interest it holds in the Abandonment Property Interest to the Company. In the
event such an election is made, the contributed Abandonment Property Interest
shall thereafter be treated and form part of the Properties, and the costs of
acquisition shall be borne solely by the Member that initially acquired the
Abandonment Property Interest. No adjustment to the Members’ respective
Percentage Interests shall be made as a result of such contribution.

14.2            Limitations on Free Transferability. The Transfer right of a
Member in Section 14.1 shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

 

(a)No Transfer permitted by this Article 14 shall relieve the transferring

(d)Except as approved by Unanimous Approval of the Board, no Member shall, in
connection with its Membership Interest, enter into a mineral stream agreement
or similar agreement pursuant to which a third party is entitled to receive a
percentage of relevant minerals or metal credits which in either case are
measured, quantified or calculated based on, in whole or in part, Products or
proceeds from the sale of Products by a Member upon distribution to it pursuant
to Article 10, which by its terms provides that upon Transfer of that Member’s
Membership Interest to the other Member or a third party, such other Member or a
third party shall be subject to and be bound by such mineral stream agreement or
similar agreement.

 

(e)No Member, without the Unanimous Approval of the Board, shall make a Transfer

(f)Any Member who holds a Membership Interest must be qualified to apply for and
to obtain mining rights under Alaska Statute 38.05.190.

 

(g)Except with regard to transfers by a Member of all or any part of its

14.3            Acquisition Right. Except as otherwise provided in Section 14.4,
if a Member desires to Transfer all or any part of its Membership Interest, the
other Member or Members, as the case may be (“Remaining Member” or “Remaining
Members” as the case may be) shall have the right of first refusal to acquire
such interests as provided in this Section 14.3.

 

(a)A Member (“Selling Member”) intending to Transfer all or any part of its
Membership Interest (the “Offered Interest”) shall, subject to this Section
14.3, promptly provide Notice to the Remaining Member or Remaining Members, as
the case may be of its intentions (“Transfer Notice”). The Transfer Notice shall
state the price, the identity of the proposed transferee including the identity
of the Person which is the ultimate holding company of the proposed transferee
(“Transferee”) and all other pertinent terms and conditions of the intended
Transfer, and shall be accompanied by a copy of the proposed offer or contract
for sale. If the consideration for the intended Transfer or any part of it is
not in cash, then the Transfer Notice given by the Selling Member shall specify
the cash value of such consideration or the relevant part of the consideration,
as determined by the Selling Member.

 

(b)                Within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a Transfer
Notice under Section 14.3(a) the Remaining Member or Remaining Members, as the
case may be, may object in writing to the Selling Member’s determination of the
cash value of the consideration or relevant part of it which is the subject of
the intended Transfer and upon such an objection being made the Members shall
seek to agree upon that cash value but if they cannot reach agreement within
five (5) Business Days after the date of objection, then that cash value will
constitute a Dispute to be resolved by an Expert in accordance with Article 15
(the cost of which determination shall be borne, if the cash value determined is
less than that determined by the Selling Member, by the Selling Member and in
any other case by the Remaining Member or Remaining Members, as the case may
be).

 



 

47

 

(c)The Remaining Member or Remaining Members, as the case may be, shall have
sixty (60) days from the date the Transfer Notice is delivered or sixty (60)
days from the date of agreement or determination of the cash value of the
consideration or relevant part of it which is the subject of the intended
Transfer (whichever is the later) (“Election Period”) to notify the Selling
Member whether they elect to acquire the Offered Interest at (subject to Section
14.3(b)) the same price and on the same terms and conditions as set forth in the
Transfer Notice. If there is more than one Remaining Member then the election
will be exercisable by all or any one or more of the Remaining Members and those
who exercise it shall purchase the Offered Interest of the Selling Member and be
liable for the purchase price as between them in proportion to their Percentage
Interests inter se or in such other proportions as they may agree. For greater
certainty, the Remaining Member will have the right to acquire all but not less
than all of the Offered Interest.

 

(d)If the Remaining Members elect to acquire the Offered Interest during the
Election Period pursuant to Section 14.3(b) and the Selling Member receives
offers in respect of all but not less than all of the Offered Interest, the
Transfer shall be consummated within sixty (60) days after the date on which the
Selling Member or other Member(s) (or both, as the case may be) have secured (on
terms and conditions satisfactory to it) any necessary Consents of any
Governmental Authority to the Transfer of the offered Membership Interest and
all waiting periods which applicable Law requires the Selling Member or other
Member (or both, as the case may be) to observe have expired. Notwithstanding
the foregoing and in any event, the Transfer to the other Member shall be
consummated within twelve (12) months after Notice of such election is delivered
to the Selling Member.

 

(e)If, after having completed the procedures described above, the Selling Member
has not received elections to acquire all but not less than all of the Offered
Interest, then the Selling Member shall following the expiration of the Election
Period, be entitled to consummate the Transfer to the Transferee within sixty
(60) days after the date on which the Selling Member has secured (on terms and
conditions satisfactory to it) any necessary Consents of any Governmental
Authority to the Transfer of the Membership Interest and all waiting periods
which applicable Law requires the Selling Member or the Transferee (or both, as
the case may be) to observe have expired which Transfer shall be at a price and
on terms no less favorable than those offered to the other Member(s) in the
Transfer Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing and in any event, the Transfer of
the Membership Interest to the Transferee shall be consummated within twelve
(12) months after the date on which the Election Period expired.

 

(f)If the Selling Member fails to consummate the Transfer to the Transferee
within the twelve (12) month period set forth in Section 14.3(e) or any material
alteration of the terms and conditions of the intended Transfer is proposed
within such period then the Selling Member shall not complete the intended
Transfer after that time or as so altered without first having again complied
with the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.3.

Membership Interest as permitted in accordance with Section 14.5.

over the Membership Interest of South32 (or its successor) created pursuant to
the Loan Agreement, each Member shall not create or permit the creation of any
Encumbrance over all or part of its Membership Interest unless:

 

(a)the Encumbrance is a mortgage, charge, assignment by way of security or other
recognized form of security reasonably acceptable to the other Member
(“Security”); and

 

(b)the Security is to secure money borrowed by the Member for the purpose of
meeting its obligations under this Agreement; and

that the Security Holder and any liquidator, receiver, receiver and manager,
trustee, assignee or transferee taking an interest in or relating to the
Membership Interest of the Member giving or granting the Security (“Encumbered

Security Holder under the Security, if it desires to exercise any power of sale
or foreclosure arising under the Security, shall comply with Section 14.3 as if
such Security Holder, receiver or receiver and manager were the Selling Member
and as if reference to the other Member in Section 14.3 was to the Non-secured
Member; and

 

(iii)the Security must be subordinate to any then-existing debt or Encumbrance,
encumbering the Member's Membership Interest.

 

14.6            Conditions of Assignment. A Transfer to an Affiliate under
Section 14.4(a), or to a third party under Section 14.3, shall have no effect
unless and until the Affiliate or the third party (as the case may be):

executes and delivers to the other Member and the Company an agreement or
instrument in a form as the other Member may reasonably require, by which the

pursuant to this Section 14.8 to the Member intending to Transfer its Membership
Interest including access to the President and Officers of the Company and all
information and management presentations provided by the President and Officers
of the Company to that Member or its proposed transferee.

(“CC Option”) to acquire its entire Membership Interest (“Interest”) and the CC
Option:

 

(a)will be exercisable by the Continuing Member or Continuing Members, as the

Notice of the exercise of the CC Option to all of the other Continuing Members
which will then have twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of that Notice
within which to exercise the CC Option themselves; and

 

(C)the date of exercise of the CC Option will be deemed to be the date of

Continuing Members of a Notice under Section 14.10(b)(ii)(B) from the first
Continuing Member to exercise the CC Option;

 

(iii)the Continuing Member or Continuing Members (as the case may be) exercising

14.11        Determination of Fair Market Value. If the fair market value of an
Interest of a CC Member cannot be agreed to by the CC Member and the Continuing
Members within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the Change of Control
Notice, then the fair market value of an Interest of a CC Member will constitute
a Dispute to be resolved by an Expert in accordance with Article 15 (the cost of
which determination shall be borne, if the fair market value determined is less
than that determined by the CC Member, by the CC Member and in any other case by
the Continuing Members).

Such offer shall be made in writing and can be accepted by such other Member at
any time within forty-five (45) days after the date on which the offer is

Member in trust for the exclusive benefit of the other Member and the Resigning
Member shall not assign, transfer, deal with or otherwise dispose of the AOI
Property (either directly or indirectly) other than strictly in accordance with
this Section 14.12.

to any court and judgment on any arbitral award may be entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction.

arbitrators, as the case may be.

 

No arbitration proceeding may be commenced under this Article 15 unless
commenced within the time period permitted for actions by the applicable statute
of limitations.

 

All papers, notices or process pertaining to an arbitration under this Agreement
may be served on a Member in accordance with Section 18.1.

conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the
Rules, then the provisions of this Agreement shall prevail.

53

in any arbitration proceeding with the other Member and with any Affiliate of
the other Member, all such arbitrations may at such Member's discretion be
consolidated or joined with the other arbitration or arbitrations such that all
Disputes between the Members and any Affiliates of the Members, are resolved by
a single arbitral panel.

independent of the Parties and shall have qualifications and experience
appropriate to the subject matter of the Dispute) to whom the Dispute will be
referred for determination; and

 

(c)if within thirty (30) days of the notice referred to in Section 15.10(a) the
Members fail to agree upon the appointment of a single Expert, then the Members
shall request the then President of the BCICAC to appoint the Expert. If the
then President of the BCICAC does not appoint the Expert within 10 days of
receiving the Members' request, then the Expert will be designated by a Judge of
the Supreme Court of British Columbia.

any action to change the status of the Company as a partnership under Treas.
Reg. § 1.7701-3 or similar provision of state law. It is understood and agreed
that the Members intend to create a partnership for federal and state income tax
purposes only. After approval by the Board pursuant to Section 4.4 of the
Agreement, the VPF shall cause to be filed with the appropriate office of the
Internal Revenue Service a partnership income tax return for the Company. The
Members recognize that the Agreement may be subject to state income tax
statutes. After approval by the Board pursuant to Section 4.4 of the Agreement,
the VPF shall cause to be filed with the appropriate offices of the state
agencies any required partnership state income tax returns. Each Member agrees
to furnish to the VPF any information it may have relating to itself and its
Affiliates, the Company or the Operations as shall be required for proper
preparation of such returns. The VPF shall use its best efforts to furnish to
the Members for their review and comment a copy of each proposed income tax
return (and access to supporting data and records) at least fifteen (15)
business days prior to the date the return is filed to the extent reasonably
feasible. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, the VPF
shall use his or her best efforts to provide to the Members the proposed final
IRS Form 1065 (including all schedules and access to supporting data and
records) for any taxable year on or before the June 15 immediately following the
end of such taxable year. The VPF shall promptly (and, in any event, within 30
days) provide to the Members all information in the possession or control of the
Company (which may be reasonable estimates) reasonably requested by such Member
for purposes of calculating estimated tax payments and preparing tax return
extensions.

 

(b)Tax Elections. The Company shall make the following elections for purposes of
all partnership income tax returns:

 

(i)To use the accrual method of accounting;

 

(ii)To use as its taxable year the year required by the provisions at Section

(iii)Unless the Members unanimously agree otherwise, to deduct currently all
development expenses to the extent possible under Section 616 of the Code;

 

(iv)Unless the Members unanimously agree otherwise, to compute the allowance for
depreciation in respect of all depreciable Assets using the maximum accelerated
tax depreciation method and the shortest life permissible or, at the election of
the VPF, using the units of production method of depreciation;

 

(v)To treat advance royalties as deductions from gross income for the year paid
or accrued to the extent permitted by law;

Any other election required or permitted to be made by the Company under the
Code or any state tax law shall be made as determined by the Board.

 

Each Member shall elect under Section 617(a) of the Code to deduct currently all
exploration expenses. Each Member reserves the right to capitalize its share of
development and/or exploration expenses of the Company in accordance with
Section 59(e) of the Code, provided that a Member’s election to capitalize all
or any portion of such expenses shall not affect the Member’s Capital Account.

 

(c)Allocations to Members. Allocations to Members shall be in accordance with
the following:

 

(i)Except as otherwise provided in this Paragraph 2(c) and Paragraph 2(d), all
items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated to the Members in
accordance with their Percentage Interests.

 

(ii)Any recapture of exploration expenses under Section 617(b)(1)(A) of the
Code, and any disallowance of depletion under Section 617(b)(1)(B) of the Code,
shall be borne by the Members in the same manner as the related exploration
expenses were allocated to, or claimed by, them.

 

(iii)If the Members’ Percentage Interests change during any taxable year of the
Company, the distributive share of items of income, gain, loss and deduction of
each Member shall be determined in any manner (1) permitted by Section 706 of
the Code, and (2) agreed by both Members. If the Members cannot agree on a
method, the method shall be determined by the VPF in consultation with the
Company’s tax advisers, with preference given to the interim
closing-of-the-books method except where application of that method would result
in undue administrative expense in relationship to the amount of the items to be
allocated.

 

(d)Regulatory Allocations. Notwithstanding the provisions of Paragraph 2(c) to
the contrary, the following special allocations shall be given effect for
purposes of maintaining the Members’ Capital Accounts.

 

(i)If either Member unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations, or
distributions described in Treas. Reg. § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4),
§ 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5) or § 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), which result in a
deficit Capital Account balance, items of income and gain shall be specially
allocated to each such Member in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate,
to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations, the Capital Account deficit
of such Member as quickly as possible. For the purposes of this
Subparagraph 2(d)(i), each Member’s Capital Account balance shall be increased
by the sum of (i) the amount such Member is obligated to restore pursuant to any
provision of the Agreement, and (ii) the amount such Member is deemed to be
obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentences of Treas. Reg.
§§ 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5).

 

(ii)If there is a net decrease in partnership minimum gain for a taxable year of
the Company, each Member shall be allocated items of income and gain for that
year equal to that Member’s share of the net decrease in partnership minimum
gain, all in accordance with Treas. Reg. § 1.704-2(f). If, during a taxable year
of the Company, there is a net decrease in partner nonrecourse debt minimum
gain, any Member with a share of that partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain as
of the beginning of the year shall be allocated items of income and gain for the
year (and, if necessary, for succeeding years) equal to that partner’s share of
the net decrease in partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain, all in accordance
with Treas. Reg. § 1.704-2(i)(4). Pursuant to Treas. Reg. § 1.704-2(i)(1),
deductions attributable to “partner nonrecourse liability” shall be allocated to
the Member that bears the economic risk of loss for such liability (or is
treated as bearing such risk).

 





B-3

 

(iii)If the allocation of deductions to either Member would cause such Member to
have a deficit Capital Account balance at the end of any taxable year of the
Company (after all other allocations provided for in this Article 2 have been
made and after giving effect to the adjustments described in
Subparagraph 2(d)(i)), such deductions shall instead be allocated to the other
Member.

 

(iv)“Nonrecourse deductions” as defined by Treas. Reg. § 1.704-2(b)(1) shall be
allocated between the Members in proportion to their Percentage Interests.

 

(v)Items of Company loss, deduction and expenditures described in
Section 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code which are attributable to any nonrecourse debt
of the Company and are characterized as partner nonrecourse deductions under
Treas. Reg. § 1.704-2(i) shall be allocated to the Members’ Capital Accounts in
accordance with said Treas. Reg. § 1.704-2(i).

 

(vi)To the extent that an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Company
asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required pursuant to
Treas. Reg. § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4), to be taken
into account in determining Capital Accounts as the result of a distribution to
a Member in complete liquidation of its Membership Interest, the amount of such
adjustment to Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the
adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment
decreases such basis), and such gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the
Members in accordance with their interests in the Company in the event Treas.
Reg. § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) applies, or to the Member to whom such
distribution was made in the event Treas. Reg. § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4)
applies.

 

(e)Curative Allocations. The allocations set forth in Paragraph 2(d) (the
“Regulatory Allocations”) are intended to comply with certain requirements of
the Treasury Regulations. It is the intent of the Members that, to the extent
possible, all Regulatory Allocations shall be offset either with other
Regulatory Allocations or with special allocations of other items of income,
gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this Paragraph. Therefore, notwithstanding
any other provisions of this Article 2 (other than the Regulatory Allocations),
the VPF shall, in a manner approved by the Board, make such offsetting special
allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction in whatever manner it determines
appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each Member’s
Capital Account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the Capital Account
balance such Member would have had if the Regulatory Allocations were not part
of the Agreement and all items were allocated pursuant to Paragraph 2(c) without
regard to Paragraph 2(d).

 

(f)Tax Allocations. Except as otherwise provided in this Paragraph 2(f), items
of taxable income, deduction, gain and loss shall be allocated in the same
manner as the corresponding item is allocated for book purposes under
Paragraphs 2(c), 2(d) and 2(e) of the corresponding item determined for Capital
Account purposes.

 

(i)Recapture of tax deductions arising out of a disposition of property shall,
to the extent consistent with the allocations for tax purposes of the gain or
amount realized giving rise to such recapture, be allocated to the Members in
the same proportions as the recaptured deductions were originally allocated or
claimed.

 





B-4

 

(ii)To the extent required by Section 704(c) of the Code, income, gain, loss,
and deduction (including depreciation, depletion and amortization) with respect
to property contributed to the Company by a Member and with respect to property
revalued in accordance with Treas. Reg. § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) (collectively
referred to as “Adjusted Properties”) shall be allocated between the Members so
as to take account of the variation between the adjusted tax basis of the
Adjusted Property to the Company and its fair market value at the time of
contribution or revaluation in accordance with the provisions of Sections 704(b)
and 704(c) of the Code and Treas. Reg. § 1.704-3(b)(1). Any income, gain, loss
or deduction attributable to an Adjusted Property (exclusive of such items
allocated to eliminate the difference between the adjusted tax basis and the
fair market value in accordance with the preceding sentence) shall be allocated
in the same manner as such gain or loss would be allocated under Paragraph 2(c).
To the extent that allocations of tax items are required under section 704(c) of
the Code or in accordance with the principles of 704(c) of the Code to be made
other than in accordance with the allocations under Paragraphs 2(c), 2(d), and
2(e) of the corresponding items for Capital Account purposes, the Company shall
use the method or methods described in Treas. Reg. § 1.704-3 as determined by
the Board; provided however, that such method or methods shall ensure that the
net taxable income or loss allocated to South32 in each taxable year includes
items of deduction and loss in the aggregate at least equal to the items of
deduction and loss that South32 would have been allocated if the property
contributed by NovaCopper had adjusted tax basis equal to the value assigned to
such property on the date of contribution.

 

(iii)Excess percentage depletion deductions with respect to depletable property
shall be allocated to the Members in accordance with the allocation of gross
income from the property from which such deductions are derived. The term
“excess percentage depletion” shall mean the excess, if any, of deductions for
percentage depletion as determined for tax purposes over the adjusted basis of
the depletable property. Depletion deductions with respect to contributed
property shall be determined without regard to any portion of the property’s
basis that is attributable to precontribution expenditures by NovaCopper that
were capitalized under Code Sections 616(b), 59(e) and 291(b).

 

(iv)The tax credits, if any, with respect to the Company’s property or
operations shall be allocated among the Members in accordance with Treas. Reg. §
1.704-1(b)(4)(ii).

 

(v)The Members understand the allocations of tax items set forth in this
Paragraph 2(f), and agree to report consistently with such allocations for
federal and state tax purposes.

 

3.CAPITAL ACCOUNTS; LIQUIDATION

 

(a)Capital Accounts.

 

(i)By the end of December 15, 2020 or, if later, within 15 business days of the
completion of the audit by the auditors of the Company, the Members shall agree
on the Capital Account balance of NovaCopper and South32 as of February 11,
2020.

 

(ii)The Capital Account of a Member shall maintained in accordance with the
provisions of Treas. Reg. § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).

 

(iii)In the event that the Capital Accounts of the Members are computed with
reference to the book value of any Asset which differs from the adjusted tax
basis of such Asset, then the Capital Accounts shall be adjusted for
depreciation, depletion, amortization and gain or loss as computed for book
purposes with respect to such Asset in accordance with Treas. Reg.
§ 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(g). The amount of book depreciation, depletion, or
amortization for a period with respect to an item of property of the Company
shall be the amount that bears the same relationship to the book value of such
property (as determined for purposes of maintaining Capital Accounts) as the
depreciation (or cost recovery deduction), depletion, or amortization computed
for tax purposes with respect to such property for such period bears to the
adjusted tax basis of such property; provided that, if such property has a zero
adjusted tax basis, the book depreciation, depletion, or amortization may be
determined under any reasonable method selected by the Board; and provided
further that the amount of book depletion with respect to a depletable property
shall not exceed the book value of such property (as determined for purposes of
maintaining the Capital Accounts).

 





B-5

 

(iv)In the event any interest in the Company is transferred in accordance with
the terms of the Agreement, the transferee shall succeed to the Capital Account
of the transferor to the extent it relates to the transferred interest, except
as provided in Treas. Reg. § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(1).

 

(v)In the event property, other than money, is distributed to a Member, the
Capital Accounts of the Members shall be adjusted to reflect the manner in which
the unrealized income, gain, loss and deduction inherent in such property (that
has not been reflected in the Capital Accounts previously) would be allocated
among the Members if there was a taxable disposition of such property for the
fair market value of such property (taking Section 7701(g) of the Code into
account) on the date of distribution. For this purpose the fair market value of
the property shall be determined as set forth in Paragraph 3(b)(i) below.

 

(vi)For purposes of maintaining the Capital Accounts, the Company’s deductions
with respect to contributed property in each year for (i) depletion,
(ii) deferred development expenditures under Section 616(b) attributable to
pre-contribution expenditures, (iii) amortization under Section 291(b)
attributable to pre-contribution expenditures, and (iv) amortization under
Section 59(e) attributable to pre-contribution expenditures shall be the amount
of the corresponding item determined for tax purposes pursuant to
Subparagraph 2(f)(iii) multiplied by the ratio of (A) the book value at which
the contributed property is recorded in the Capital Accounts to (B) the adjusted
tax basis of the contributed property (including basis resulting from
capitalization of pre-contribution development expenditures under Sections
616(b), 291(b), and 59(e)). This provision is intended to be consistent with the
capital account maintenance rules of section 704(b) and shall be so applied.

 

(vii)If the Members so agree, upon the occurrence of an event described in
Treas. Reg. § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)(5), the Capital Accounts shall be restated in
accordance with Treas. Reg. § 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) to reflect the manner in
which unrealized income, gain, loss or deduction inherent in the assets of the
Company (that has not been reflected in the Capital Accounts previously) would
be allocated among the Members if there were a taxable disposition of such
assets for their fair market values, as determined in accordance with
Subparagraph 3(b)(i). For purposes of Paragraph 2(c), a Member shall be treated
as contributing the portion of the book value of any property that is credited
to the Member’s Capital Account pursuant to the preceding sentence. Following a
revaluation pursuant to this Subparagraph 3(a)(viii), the Members’ shares of
depreciation, depletion, amortization and gain or loss, as computed for tax
purposes, with respect to property that has been revalued pursuant to this
Subparagraph 3(a)(viii) shall be determined in accordance with the principles of
Code Section 704(c) as applied pursuant to Subparagraph 2(f)(ii).

 

(viii)The foregoing provisions, and the other provisions of the Agreement
relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts and the allocations of income,
gain, loss, deduction and credit, are intended to comply with Treas. Reg. §
1.704-1(b), and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with
such Treasury Regulation. In the event the Board shall determine that it is
prudent to modify the manner in which the Capital Accounts, or any debits or
credits thereto, are computed in order to comply with such Treasury Regulation,
the Board may make such modification, provided that it is not likely to have a
material effect on the amount distributable to either Member upon liquidation of
the Company pursuant to Paragraph 3(b).

 

(b)Liquidation. In the event the Company is dissolved pursuant to Section 11.3
of the Agreement then, notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement to
the contrary, the following steps shall be taken (after taking into account any
adjustments in Percentage Interests pursuant to Sections 5.6, 5.7, or 5.8 of the
Agreement):

 





B-6

 

(i)The Capital Accounts of the Members shall be adjusted to reflect any gain or
loss which would be realized by the Company and allocated to the Members
pursuant to the provisions of Article 2 of this Exhibit B if the Assets had been
sold at their fair market value at the time of liquidation. The fair market
value of the Assets shall be determined by agreement of both Members provided,
however, that in the event that the Members fail to agree on the fair market
value of any Asset, its fair market value shall be determined by a nationally
recognized independent engineering firm or other qualified independent party
approved by both Members.

 

(ii)After making the foregoing adjustments and/or contributions, and after
taking into account all allocations under Article 3, including Subparagraph
2(c)(iii) and giving effect to all sales or distributions of production through
the date of the final distribution, all remaining Assets shall be distributed to
the Members in accordance with Percentage Interests. Unless otherwise expressly
agreed by both Members, with respect to any asset distributed in kind, each
Member shall receive an undivided interest in such Asset in equal to the
Member’s Percentage Interest at the time of distribution. Assets distributed to
the Members shall be deemed to have a fair market value equal to the value
assigned to them pursuant to Subparagraph 3(b)(i) above.

 

(iii)All distributions to the Members in respect of their Capital Accounts shall
be made in accordance with the time requirements of Treas. Reg.
§§ 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(2) and (3).

 

4.TAX MATTERS REPRESENTATIVE

 

(a)The Board shall have the authority to designate, remove and replace the
“partnership representative” of the Company for any tax period subject to the
provisions of Section 6223(a) of the Code (the “Tax Matters Representative”).
The term “Tax Matters Representative” shall include any person appointed by the
Internal Revenue Service to serve as the partnership representative. The Board
shall have the authority to appoint, remove and replace the “designated
individual” if required under the Partnership Audit Regime (as defined below).
Each Member hereby consents to such designation and agrees that, upon the
request of the Board, it will execute, certify, acknowledge, deliver, swear to,
file and record at the appropriate public offices such documents as may
reasonably be necessary or appropriate to evidence such consent. The Partnership
Representative and designated individual may resign as such at any time. The
resignation or removal of the Partnership Representative or designated
individual shall become effective upon the appointment of a successor in the
manner required by applicable Treasury Regulations.

 

(b)In its capacity as Tax Matters Representative, the Tax Matters Representative
shall represent the Company in any disputes, controversies or proceedings with
the Internal Revenue Service or with any state, local, or non-U.S. taxing
authority and is hereby authorized to take any and all actions that it is
permitted to take by applicable law when acting in that capacity.  The Members
acknowledge and agree that it is the intention of the Members to minimize any
obligations of the Company to pay taxes and interest in connection with any
audit of the Company. The Members agree to cooperate in good faith, including
without limitation by timely providing information reasonably requested by the
Tax Matters Representative and making elections reasonably requested by the Tax
Matters Representative, provided, that any material elections must be approved
in writing by Special Approval of the Voting Representatives. The Members agree
to pay any applicable taxes, interest and penalties, to give effect to each of
the immediately preceding two sentences. Each of the initial Members is, and
each assignee of a Membership Interest or other Member of the Company shall be,
either a C corporation or any foreign entity that would be treated as a C
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it were domestic in
compliance with Section 6221(b)(1)(C) of the Code and any applicable Treasury
Regulations. The Board shall, determine if the Company is eligible in each
taxable year to elect out of the partnership audit regime as provided in chapter
63, subchapter C of the Code and any applicable, analogous provisions of U.S.
state or local law (the “Partnership Audit Regime”). If the Board determines
that the Company is eligible to elect out of the Partnership Audit Regime, the
Company shall follow the procedure for electing out of the Partnership Audit
Regime as set forth in Section 6221(b) of the Code and any applicable Treasury
Regulations (or applicable state or local laws), and each Member shall comply
with any requirements related to such election. The Company and Members agree to
prepare and furnish such information as is required in connection with any such
election as provided in Section 6221(b) and any applicable Treasury Regulations.

 





B-7

 

(c)If the Board reasonably determines that the Company is not eligible to elect
out of the Partnership Audit Regime, the Company shall make any payments it may
be required to make under the Partnership Audit Regime and shall allocate any
such payment among the current or former Members of the Company for the
“reviewed year” to which the payment relates in a manner that reflects the
current or former Members’ respective interests in the Company for that year and
any other factors , such as available modifications under Section 6225 (e.g.,
including but not limited to the “tax-exempt” status of a Member) taken into
account in determining the amount of the payment. To the extent payments are
made by the Company on behalf of or with respect to a current Member in
accordance with this Section 4(c), such amounts shall, at the reasonable
election of the Board, (i) be applied to and reduce the next distribution(s)
otherwise payable to such Member under this Agreement or (ii) be paid by the
Member to the Company within thirty (30) days of written notice from the Tax
Matters Representative requesting the payment.  In addition, if any such payment
is made on behalf of or with respect to a former Member, that Member shall pay
over to the Company an amount equal to the amount of such payment made on behalf
of or with respect to it within thirty (30) days of written notice from the Tax
Matters Representative requesting the payment.  The Tax Matters Representative
shall use reasonable best efforts to modify the Company’s imputed underpayment
under Section 6225(c)(3) and (c)(4) of the Code taking into account the tax
classification, tax rates and tax attributes of the Members and such
apportionment of liability shall also take into account the extent to which the
Company’s imputed underpayment was modified. Furthermore, no Member shall be
required to file an amended tax return without the Member’s advance written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Tax Matters Representative shall
not (i) enter into any settlement agreement that is binding upon the Members
with respect to the determination of Company items of income, gain, loss, or
deduction at the Company level, (ii) file a petition under Section 6234(a) of
the Code for the readjustment of those Company items, or (iii) appeal any
judicial decision with respect to any Company item, in each case without
consulting with the other Members in good faith.]1 The Tax Matters
Representative, is permitted, with the express written permission of the Board,
to make an election pursuant to Section 6226 of the Code. If such election is
made, each Member agrees to timely pay its share of any tax deficiency as
determined pursuant to the completion of any audit o subsequent judicial
proceedings.

 

(d)The Company shall indemnify and reimburse the Tax Matters Representative for
(i) all expenses, including legal and accounting fees, claims, liabilities,
losses and damages incurred in connection with any administrative or judicial
proceeding with respect to the tax liability of the Members or in connection
with any audit of the Company’s income tax returns, except to the extent such
expenses, claims, liabilities, losses and damages are attributable to the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Tax Matters Representative and (ii) any
taxes imposed on the Company in respect of the Company’s operations or
activities. The payment of all such expenses to which the indemnification
applies shall be made before any distributions pursuant to Article X. The taking
of any action and the incurring of any expense by the Tax Matters Representative
in connection with any such proceeding, except to the extent required by law, is
a matter in the reasonable discretion of the Tax Matters Representative and the
Company and each of the Members shall indemnify and hold harmless the Tax
Matters Representative for its decisions and actions made in its capacity as
such.

 

(e)The provisions contained in this Section 4 shall survive the dissolution of
the Company and the withdrawal of any Member or the Transfer of any Member’s
interest in the Company and shall apply to any current or former Member.

5.DISPUTE RESOLUTION

 

If the Members are unable to reach agreement on any tax related matter subject
to approval or agreement of the Members, before application of Section 15.2 of
the Agreement, any such disputed tax matter shall be promptly referred to an
independent, unrelated accounting or law firm of national reputation in the
United States approved by the Board (the “Unrelated Firm”). The Unrelated Firm
shall be directed to render a written report on the unresolved disputed tax
matter as promptly as practicable and to resolve only those tax matters in
dispute and the resolution of the dispute by the Unrelated Firm shall be final
and binding on the parties; provided that if such dispute is not resolved within
180 days of the referral, Section 15.2 of the Agreement shall control. The fees
and expenses of the Unrelated Firm shall be borne by the Company.

EXHIBIT F

 

EXAMPLES OF PERCENTAGE INTEREST ADJUSTMENTS UNDER SECTION 5.7

 

These examples are based on the following assumptions:

 

·Each Member holds a 50% Percentage Interest with $176 million in capital as of
the time of the default.

·No additional capital contributions have been made by either Member prior to
the scenarios below.

·There have been no previous defaults by either Member, resulting in a dilution
multiplier of 1.5

 

Scenario 1: On or after the Funding Commencement Date, there is a failure to
make a capital contribution of $20 million, and the non-defaulting Member elects
not to make a Cover Loan.

 

·Each Member is required to contribute $20 million.

·The non-defaulting Member makes a $20 million capital contribution, increasing
its capital to $196 million.

·The defaulting Member fails to make its $20 million capital contribution.

·The total contributed capital of all Members is increased to $372 million.

 

Under Section 5.7, the defaulting Member’s Percentage Interest is reduced by
4.03%. Accordingly, the defaulting Member’s new Percentage Interest is 45.97%.

 

Scenario 2: On or after Funding Commencement Date, there is a failure to make a
capital contribution of $20 million, and the non-defaulting Member elects to
make a $20 million Cover Loan.

 

·Each Member is required to contribute $20 million.

·The non-defaulting Member makes a $20 million capital contribution, increasing
its capital to $196 million.

·The defaulting Member fails to make its $20 million capital contribution.

·The non-defaulting Member extends $20 million Cover Loan.

·The defaulting Member subsequently defaults on the Cover Loan. This is treated
as if the non-defaulting Member made an additional capital contribution in the
amount equal to the Cover Loan, which in this scenario increases its capital to
$216 million.

·The total contributed capital of all Members is increased to $392 million.

 

Under Section 5.7, the defaulting Member’s Percentage Interest is reduced by
7.65%. Accordingly, the defaulting Member’s new Percentage Interest is 42.35%.
