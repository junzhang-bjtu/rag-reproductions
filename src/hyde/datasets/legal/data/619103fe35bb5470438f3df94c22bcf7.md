effected on the same Business Day as the applicable Purchase Date, have
theretofore been received by the Investor as DWAC Shares in accordance with this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not deliver a

(each such purchase, an “Additional Accelerated Purchase”). The Company may
deliver multiple Additional Accelerated Purchase Notices to the Investor on an
Additional Accelerated Purchase Date; provided, however, that the Company may
deliver an Additional Accelerated Purchase Notice to the Investor only (i) on a

Accelerated Purchase Notice in accordance with this Agreement on the applicable
Purchase Date for a Regular Purchase of a number of Purchase Shares not less
than the Regular Purchase Share Limit then in effect in accordance with this
Agreement and (ii) if all Purchase Shares subject to each prior Regular
Purchase, Accelerated Purchase and Additional Accelerated Purchase, including,
without limitation, those that have been effected on the same Business Day as

(d) Payment for Purchase Shares. For each Regular Purchase, the Investor shall
pay to the Company an amount equal to the Purchase Amount with respect to such

immediately available funds on the same Business Day that the Investor receives
such Purchase Shares, if such Purchase Shares are received by the Investor
before 1:00 p.m., Eastern time, or, if such Purchase Shares are received by the
Investor after 1:00 p.m., Eastern time, the next Business Day. For each
Accelerated Purchase and each Additional Accelerated Purchase, the Investor
shall pay to the Company an amount equal to the Purchase Amount with respect to
such Accelerated Purchase and Additional Accelerated Purchase, respectively, as
full payment for such Purchase Shares via wire transfer of immediately available
funds on the second Business Day following the date that the Investor receives
such Purchase Shares. If the Company or the Transfer Agent shall fail for any
reason or for no reason to electronically transfer any Purchase Shares as DWAC
Shares to the Investor or its agent with respect to any Regular Purchase,
Accelerated Purchase or Additional Accelerated Purchase (as applicable) within
two (2) Business Days following the receipt by the Company of the Purchase
Price, Accelerated Purchase Price or Additional Accelerated Purchase Price,
respectively, therefor in compliance with this Section 2(d), and if on or after
such Business Day the Investor purchases (in an open market transaction or
otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the
Investor of such Purchase Shares that the Investor anticipated receiving from
the Company in respect of such Regular Purchase, Accelerated Purchase or an
Additional Accelerated Purchase (as applicable), then the Company shall, within
two (2) Business Days after the Investor’s request, either (i) pay cash to the
Investor in an amount equal to the Investor’s total purchase price (including
customary brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so
purchased (the “Cover Price”), at which point the Company’s obligation to
deliver such Purchase Shares as DWAC Shares shall terminate, or (ii) promptly
honor its obligation to deliver to the Investor such Purchase Shares as DWAC
Shares and pay cash to the Investor in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of
the Cover Price over the total Purchase Amount paid by the Investor pursuant to
this Agreement for all of the Purchase Shares to be purchased by the Investor in
connection with such Regular Purchase, Accelerated Purchase or Additional
Accelerated Purchase (as applicable). The Company shall not issue any fraction
of a share of Common Stock upon any Regular Purchase, Accelerated Purchase or
Additional Accelerated Purchase. If the issuance would result in the issuance of
a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of
a share of Common Stock up or down to the nearest whole share. All payments made
under this Agreement shall be made in lawful money of the United States of
America or wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account as the
Company may from time to time designate by written notice in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. Whenever any amount expressed to be due by the
terms of this Agreement is due on any day that is not a Business Day, the same
shall instead be due on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day.

(e) Compliance with Principal Market Rules. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, and in addition to the limitations set forth in
Section 2(f), the Company shall not issue more than 5,977,642 shares (including
the Commitment Shares) of Common Stock (the “Exchange Cap”) under this
Agreement, which equals 19.99% of the Company’s outstanding shares of Common
Stock as of the date hereof, unless stockholder approval is obtained to issue in
excess of the Exchange Cap; provided, however, that the foregoing limitation
shall not apply if at any time the Exchange Cap is reached and at all times
thereafter the average price paid for all shares of Common Stock issued under
this Agreement is equal to or greater than $0.3342 (the “Minimum Price”), a
price equal to the lower of (i) the Nasdaq Official Closing Price immediately
preceding the execution of this Agreement or (ii) the arithmetic average of the
five (5) Nasdaq Official Closing Prices for the Common Stock immediately
preceding the execution of this Agreement, as calculated in accordance with the
rules of the Principal Market (in such circumstance, for purposes of the
Principal Market, the transaction contemplated hereby would not be “below

the Exchange Cap would not apply). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
shall not be required or permitted to issue, and the Buyer shall not be required
to purchase, any shares of Common Stock under this Agreement if such issuance
would violate the rules or regulations of the Principal Market. The Company may,
in its sole discretion, determine whether to obtain stockholder approval to
issue more than 19.99% of its outstanding shares of Common Stock hereunder if
such issuance would require stockholder approval under the rules or regulations
of the Principal Market. The Exchange Cap shall be reduced, on a share-for-share
basis, by the number of shares of Common Stock issued or issuable that may be
aggregated with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under applicable
rules of the Principal Market.

(f) Beneficial Ownership Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company shall not issue or sell, and the
Investor shall not purchase or acquire, any Common Stock under this Agreement
which, when aggregated with all other shares of Common Stock then beneficially
owned by the Investor and its affiliates (as calculated pursuant to
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and Rule 13d-3 promulgated thereunder) would
result in the beneficial ownership by the Investor and its affiliates of more
than 19.99% of the then issued and outstanding Common Stock (the “Beneficial
Ownership Limitation”). Upon the written or oral request of the Investor, the
Company shall promptly (but not later than 24 hours) confirm orally or in
writing to the Investor the amount of Common Stock then outstanding. The
Investor and the Company shall each cooperate in good faith in the
determinations required hereby and the application hereof.

(g) Excess Share Limitation. If the Company delivers any Purchase Notice for a
Purchase Amount in excess of the limitations contained in this Section 2, such
Purchase Notice shall be void ab initio to the extent of the amount by which the
number of Purchase Shares set forth in such Purchase Notice exceeds the number
of Purchase Shares which the Company is permitted to include in such Purchase
Notice in accordance herewith, and the Investor shall have no obligation to
purchase such excess Purchase Shares in respect of such Purchase Notice;
provided, however, that the Investor shall remain obligated to purchase the
number of Purchase Shares which the Company is permitted to include in such
Purchase Notice.

(h) Adjustments for Shares. All share-related numbers contained in this
Section 2 shall be adjusted to take into account any reorganization,
recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split or other similar transaction
effected with respect to the Common Stock except as specifically stated herein.

not (i) result in a violation of the Certificate of Incorporation (including any

regulations of the Principal Market applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) or by which any property or asset of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound or affected, except in the case of conflicts, defaults,
terminations, amendments, accelerations, cancellations and violations under
clause (ii), which could not reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation or
default of or under (i) any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws, any Subsidiary’s respective certificate or articles of incorporation or
bylaws, any certificate of designation, preferences and rights of any
outstanding series of preferred stock or organizational charter, respectively,
(ii) the terms of any indenture, contract, lease, mortgage, deed of trust, note
agreement, loan agreement or other agreement, obligation, condition, covenant or
instrument to which it is a party or bound or to which its property is subject,
or (iii) any judgment, order or decree of any court, regulatory body,
administrative agency, governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having
jurisdiction over the Company or any of its properties, which, in the case of
clauses (ii) or (iii), would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement and as required
under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws and the rules and
regulations of the Principal Market, the Company is not required to obtain any
consent, Authorization (as defined below) or order of, or make any filing or
registration with, any court or governmental agency or any regulatory or
self-regulatory agency in order for it to execute, deliver or perform any of its
obligations under or contemplated by the Transaction Documents in accordance
with the terms hereof or thereof. Except as set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement, all consents, Authorizations, orders, filings and registrations which
the Company is required to obtain pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be
obtained or effected on or prior to the Commencement Date.

(f) SEC Documents; Financial Statements. The Company has filed all reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be filed by the
Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including pursuant to
Section 13(a) or 15(d) thereof, for the 24 months preceding the date hereof (or
such shorter period as the Company was required by law or regulation to file
such material) (the foregoing materials together with each Prospectus, including
the exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, being
collectively referred to herein as the “SEC Documents”) on a timely basis. As of
their respective dates, the SEC Documents complied in all material respects with
the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as applicable. None
of the SEC Documents, when filed, contained any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The financial
statements of the Company included in the SEC Documents comply in all material
respects with applicable accounting requirements and the rules and

 

13



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as in effect at the time of filing.
Such financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (“GAAP”), except as may be otherwise specified in such
financial statements or the notes thereto and except that unaudited financial
statements may not contain all footnotes required by GAAP, and fairly present in
all material respects the financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of and for the dates thereof and the results of operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended, subject, in the case of unaudited
statements, to normal, immaterial, year-end audit adjustments. Except as set
forth in the SEC Documents, the Company has received no notices or
correspondence from the SEC for the one year preceding the date hereof. The SEC
has not commenced any enforcement proceedings against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(g) Absence of Certain Changes. Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents, since
December 31, 2018, there has been no material adverse change in the business,
properties, operations, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company has not taken any steps, and does not
currently expect to take any steps, to seek protection pursuant to any
Bankruptcy Law nor does the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have any
knowledge or reason to believe that its creditors intend to initiate involuntary
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The Company is financially solvent and is
generally able to pay its debts as they become due.

(h) Absence of Litigation. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or
investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency,
self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting the Company, the
Common Stock or any of the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ officers or directors
in their capacities as such, which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(i) Acknowledgment Regarding Investor’s Status. The Company acknowledges and
agrees that the Investor is acting solely in the capacity of arm’s length
purchaser with respect to the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company further acknowledges that the
Investor is not acting as a financial advisor or fiduciary of the Company (or in
any similar capacity) with respect to the Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and any advice given by the
Investor or any of its representatives or agents in connection with the
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby is
merely incidental to the Investor’s purchase of the Securities. The Company
further represents to the Investor that the Company’s decision to enter into the
Transaction Documents has been based solely on the independent evaluation by the
Company and its representatives and advisors.

(j) No Aggregated Offering. Neither the Company, nor any of its affiliates, nor
any Person acting on its their behalf has, directly or indirectly, made any
offers or sales of any security or solicited any offers to buy any security,
under circumstances that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be
integrated or aggregated with prior offerings by the Company other than the
Investor in a manner that would require stockholder approval pursuant to the
rules of the Principal Market on which any of the securities of the Company are
listed or designated. The issuance and sale of the Securities hereunder does not
contravene the rules and regulations of the Principal Market.

(k) Intellectual Property Rights. The Company and its Subsidiaries own or
possess adequate rights or licenses to use all material trademarks, trade names,
service marks, service mark registrations, service names, patents, patent
rights, copyrights, inventions, licenses, approvals, Authorizations, trade
secrets and rights necessary to conduct their respective businesses as now
conducted. None of the Company’s material trademarks, trade names, service
marks, service mark registrations, service names, patents, patent rights,
copyrights, inventions, licenses, approvals, Authorizations, trade secrets or
other intellectual property rights have expired or terminated, or, by the terms
and conditions thereof, could expire

 

14



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

or terminate within two years from the date of this Agreement. The Company and
its Subsidiaries do not have any knowledge of any infringement by the Company or
its Subsidiaries of any material trademark, trade name rights, patents, patent
rights, copyrights, inventions, licenses, service names, service marks, service
mark registrations, trade secret or other similar rights of others, or of any
such development of similar or identical trade secrets or technical information
by others, and there is no claim, action or proceeding being made or brought
against, or to the Company’s knowledge, being threatened against, the Company or
its Subsidiaries regarding trademark, trade name, patents, patent rights,
invention, copyright, license, service names, service marks, service mark
registrations, trade secret or other infringement, which could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(l) Environmental Laws. The Company and its Subsidiaries (i) are in compliance
with any and all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and
regulations relating to the protection of human health and safety, the
environment or hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, pollutants or
contaminants (“Environmental Laws”), (ii) have received all permits, licenses or
other approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to conduct
their respective businesses and (iii) are in compliance with all terms and
conditions of any such permit, license or approval, except where, in each of the
three foregoing clauses, the failure to so comply could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(m) Title The Company and its Subsidiaries own no real property. Except as
disclosed in the SEC Documents, the Company and its Subsidiaries have good and
marketable title in fee simple to all real property owned by them and good and
marketable title in all personal property owned by them that is material to the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case free and clear of all
Liens and, except for Liens as do not materially affect the value of such
property and do not materially interfere with the use made and proposed to be
made of such property by the Company and its Subsidiaries and Liens for the
payment of federal, state or other taxes, the payment of which is neither
delinquent nor subject to penalties. Any real property and facilities held under
lease by the Company and its Subsidiaries are held by them under valid,
subsisting and enforceable leases with which the Company and its Subsidiaries
are in compliance with such exceptions as are not material and do not interfere
with the use made and proposed to be made of such property and buildings by the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

(n) Insurance. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are insured by insurers
of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such
amounts as management of the Company believes to be prudent and customary in the
businesses in which the Company and its Subsidiaries are engaged. Neither the
Company nor any such Subsidiary has been refused any insurance coverage sought
or applied for and neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary has any reason to
believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and
when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers
as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(o) Regulatory Permits. Except as described in the SEC Documents, the Company
and its Subsidiaries possess all material certificates, Authorizations and
permits issued by the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign regulatory
authorities necessary to conduct their respective businesses, and neither the
Company nor any such Subsidiary has received any written notice of proceedings
relating to the revocation or modification of any such certificate,
Authorization or permit.

(p) Tax Status. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has made or filed all
federal and state income and all other material tax returns, reports and
declarations required by any jurisdiction to which it is subject (unless and
only to the extent that the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has set aside
on its books provisions reasonably adequate for the payment of all unpaid and
unreported taxes) and has paid all taxes and other governmental assessments and
charges that are material in amount, shown or determined to

 

15



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

be due on such returns, reports and declarations, except those being contested
in good faith and has set aside on its books provision reasonably adequate for
the payment of all taxes for periods subsequent to the periods to which such
returns, reports or declarations apply. There are no unpaid taxes in any
material amount claimed to be due by the taxing authority of any jurisdiction,
and the officers of the Company know of no basis for any such claim.

(q) Transactions With Affiliates. Except as set forth in the SEC Documents, none
of the officers or directors of the Company and, to the knowledge of the
Company, none of the Company’s stockholders, the officers or directors of any
stockholder of the Company, or any family member or affiliate of any of the
foregoing, has either directly or indirectly any interest in, or is a party to,
any transaction that is required to be disclosed as a related party transaction
pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act.

(r) Application of Takeover Protections. The Company and its Board of Directors
have taken or will take prior to the Commencement Date all necessary action, if
any, in order to render inapplicable any control share acquisition, business
combination, poison pill (including any distribution under a rights agreement)
or other similar anti-takeover provision under the Certificate of Incorporation
or the laws of the state of its incorporation which is or could become
applicable to the Investor as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the Company’s issuance of the
Securities and the Investor’s ownership of the Securities.

(s) Disclosure. Except with respect to the material terms and conditions of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents that will be timely
publicly disclosed by the Company, the Company confirms that neither it nor any
other Person acting on its behalf has provided the Investor or its agents or
counsel with any information that it believes constitutes or might constitute
material, non-public information which is not otherwise disclosed in the
Registration Statement or the SEC Documents. The Company understands and
confirms that the Investor will rely on the foregoing representation in
effecting purchases and sales of securities of the Company. All of the
disclosure furnished by or on behalf of the Company to the Investor regarding
the Company, its business and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the disclosure schedules to this Agreement, is true and correct and does not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The press releases
disseminated by the Company during the twelve (12) months preceding the date of
this Agreement taken as a whole do not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made and when made, not misleading. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that the Investor neither makes nor has made any
representations or warranties with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby other than those specifically set forth in Section 3 hereof.

(t) Foreign Corrupt Practices. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, agent, employee or
affiliate of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is aware of or has taken any
action, directly or indirectly, that would result in a violation by such persons
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder (the “FCPA”), including, without limitation, making use
of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in
furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay or authorization of the payment
of any money, or other property, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the
giving of anything of value to any “foreign official” (as such term is defined
in the FCPA) or any foreign political party or official thereof or any candidate
for foreign political office, in contravention of the FCPA; and the Company, the
Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, its affiliates have conducted
their businesses in compliance with the FCPA and have instituted and maintain
policies and procedures designed to ensure, and which are reasonably expected to
continue to ensure, continued compliance

 

16



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

therewith. The operations of the Company and the Subsidiaries are and have been
conducted at all times in compliance with applicable financial recordkeeping and
reporting requirements and the money laundering statutes and the rules and
regulations thereunder and any related or similar rules, regulations or
guidelines, issued, administered or enforced by any applicable governmental
agency, including, without limitation, Title 18 U.S. Code section 1956 and 1957,
the Patriot Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, and international anti-money laundering
principles or procedures by an intergovernmental group or organization, such as

is a member and with which designation the United States representative to the
group or organization continues to concur, all as amended, and any Executive
order, directive or regulation pursuant to the authority of any of the
foregoing, or any orders or licenses issued thereunder (collectively, the “Money
Laundering Laws”), and no action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or
governmental agency, authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the Money Laundering Laws is pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries, nor to the knowledge of the Company any of the directors,
officers or employees, agents, affiliates or representatives of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, is an individual or entity that is, or is owned or controlled
by an individual or entity that is: (i) the subject of any sanctions
administered or enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign
Assets Control, the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, Her
Majesty’s Treasury, or other relevant sanctions authority (collectively,
“Sanctions”), nor (ii) located, organized or resident in a country or territory
that is the subject of Sanctions (including, without limitation, the Balkans,
Belarus, Burma/Myanmar, Cote D’Ivoire, Cuba, Democratic Republic of Congo, Iran,
Iraq, Liberia, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Zimbabwe).
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will, directly or indirectly,
use the proceeds of the transactions contemplated hereby, or lend, contribute or
otherwise make available such proceeds to any subsidiary, joint venture partner
or other individual or entity: (i) to fund or facilitate any activities or
business of or with any individual or entity or in any country or territory
that, at the time of such funding or facilitation, is the subject of Sanctions
or (ii) in any other manner that will result in a violation of Sanctions by any
individual or entity (including any individual or entity participating in the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether as underwriter, advisor, investor or
otherwise). For the past five years, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has knowingly engaged in, and is not now knowingly engaged in, any
dealings or transactions with any individual or entity, or in any country or
territory, that at the time of the dealing or transaction is or was the subject
of Sanctions.

(u) Shelf Registration Statement. The Company has prepared and filed the Shelf
Registration Statement with the SEC in accordance with the Securities Act. The

Securities Act, the Shelf Registration Statement and any amendments thereto
complied and will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading; and the Base Prospectus and any Prospectus
Supplement thereto, at the time such Base Prospectus or such Prospectus
Supplement thereto was issued and on the Commencement Date, complied and will
comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and
did not and will not contain an untrue

 

17



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading; provided that this representation and warranty does
not apply to statements in or omissions from any Prospectus Supplement made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to the Investor
furnished to the Company in writing by or on behalf of the Investor expressly
for use therein. The Company meets all of the requirements for the use of a
registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to the Securities Act in reliance on
General Instruction I.B.1 of Form S-3 for the offering and sale of the
Securities contemplated by this Agreement, and the SEC has not notified the
Company of any objection to the use of the form of the Shelf Registration
Statement pursuant to Rule 401(g)(1) of the Securities Act. The Shelf
Registration Statement, as of its effective date, meets in all material respects
the requirements set forth in Rule 415(a)(1)(x) pursuant to the Securities Act.
At the earliest time after the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement that
the Company or another participant in the transactions contemplated hereby made
a bona fide offer (within the meaning of Rule 164(h)(2) of the Securities Act)
relating to any of the Securities, the Company was not, and as of the Execution
Date the Company is, not an “Ineligible Issuer” (as defined in Rule 405 of the
Securities Act). The Company has not distributed any offering material in
connection with the offering and sale of any of the Securities, and, until the
Investor does not hold any of the Securities, shall not distribute any offering
material in connection with the offering and sale of any of the Securities, to
or by the Investor, in each case, other than the Shelf Registration Statement or
any amendment thereto, the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement required
pursuant to applicable law or the Transaction Documents. The Company has not
made and shall not make an offer relating to the Securities that would
constitute a “free writing prospectus” as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act.

(v) DTC Eligibility. The Company, through the Transfer Agent, currently
participates in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) Program and
the Common Stock can be transferred electronically to third parties via the DTC
Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) Program.

(w) Accounting Controls; Sarbanes-Oxley. The Company maintains a system of
internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that
(A) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s general or
specific authorization; (B) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain
accountability for assets; (C) access to assets is permitted only in accordance
with management’s general or specific authorization; and (D) the recorded
accountability for assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable
intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences.
Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents, the Company has concluded that its
internal control over financial reporting is effective and the Company is not
aware of any “significant deficiencies” or “material weaknesses” (each as
defined by the rules adopted by the SEC) in its internal control over financial
reporting, or any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who have a significant role
in the Company’s internal controls; and since the end of the latest audited
fiscal year, there has been no change in the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting (whether or not remediated) that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting. The Board of Directors has, subject to the exceptions, cure
periods and the phase in periods specified in the applicable stock exchange
rules of the Principal Market (“Exchange Rules”), validly appointed an audit
committee to oversee internal accounting controls whose composition satisfies
the applicable independence and other requirements of the Exchange Rules and the
rules under the Exchange Act, and the Board of Directors has adopted a charter
for the audit committee that satisfies the requirements of the Exchange Rules
and the rules under the Exchange Act. No relationship, direct or indirect,
exists between or among the Company, on the one hand, and the directors,
officers, stockholders, customers or suppliers of the Company, on the other
hand, which is required to be described in the Shelf Registration Statement and
the Prospectus which is not so described. The Company has not, directly or
indirectly, extended or maintained credit, or arranged for the extension of
credit, or renewed an extension of credit, in the form of a personal loan to or
for any of its directors or executive officers in violation of Applicable Laws,
including Section 402 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and
regulations promulgated in connection therewith.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(x) Certain Fees. No brokerage or finder’s fees or commissions are or will be
payable by the Company to any broker, financial advisor or consultant, finder,
placement agent, investment banker, bank or other Person with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. The Investor shall have
no obligation with respect to any fees or with respect to any claims made by or
on behalf of other Persons for fees of a type contemplated in this Section 4(x)
that may be due in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents.

(y) Investment Company. The Company is not, and immediately after giving effect
to the sale of the Purchase Shares in accordance with this Agreement and the
application of the proceeds as described in the Prospectus under the caption
“Use of Proceeds,” will not be, an “investment company” within the meaning of
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”).

(z) Listing and Maintenance Requirements. The Common Stock is registered
pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and the Company has taken no
action designed to, or which to its knowledge is likely to have the effect of,
terminating the registration of the Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act
nor has the Company received any notification that the SEC is currently
contemplating terminating such registration. Except as disclosed in the SEC
Documents, the Company has not, in the twelve (12) months preceding the date
hereof, received any notice from any Person to the effect that the Company is
not in compliance with the listing or maintenance requirements of the Principal
Market. Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents, the Company is, and has no
reason to believe that it will not in the foreseeable future continue to be, in
compliance with all such listing and maintenance requirements.

(aa) Accountants. The Company’s accountants are set forth in the SEC Documents
and, to the knowledge of the Company, such accountants are an independent
registered public accounting firm as required by the Securities Act.

(bb) No Market Manipulation. The Company has not, and to its knowledge no Person
acting on its behalf has, (i) taken, directly or indirectly, any action designed
to cause or to result in the stabilization or manipulation of the price of any
security of the Company to facilitate the sale or resale of any of the
Securities, (ii) sold, bid for, purchased, or, paid any compensation for
soliciting purchases of, any of the Securities, or (iii) paid or agreed to pay
to any Person any compensation for soliciting another to purchase any other
securities of the Company.

(cc) Benefit Plans; Labor Matters. Each benefit and compensation plan,
agreement, policy and arrangement that is maintained, administered or
contributed to by the Company for current or former employees or directors of,
or independent contractors with respect to, the Company has been maintained in
compliance with its terms and the requirements of any applicable statutes,
orders, rules and regulations, and the Company has complied in all material
respects with all applicable statutes, orders, rules and regulations in regard
to such plans, agreements, policies and arrangements. Each stock option granted
under any equity incentive plan of the Company (each, a “Stock Plan”) was
granted with a per share exercise price no less than the market price per common
share on the grant date of such option in accordance with the rules of the
Principal Market, and no such grant involved any “back-dating,” “forward-dating”
or similar practice with respect to the effective date of such grant; each such
option (i) was granted in compliance in all material respects with Applicable
Laws and with the applicable Stock Plan(s), (ii) was duly approved by the Board
of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, and (iii) has been properly
accounted for in the Company’s financial statements and disclosed, to the extent
required, in the Company’s filings or submissions with the SEC, and the
Principal Market. No labor problem or dispute with the employees of the Company
exists or is threatened or imminent, and the Company is not aware of any
existing or imminent labor disturbance by the employees of any of its principal
suppliers or contractors, that would have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

19



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(dd) Regulatory. During the 12-month period immediately preceding the Execution
Date, except as described in the SEC Documents, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries: (A) is and at all times has been in material compliance with all
applicable U.S. and foreign statutes, rules, or regulations applicable to
Company and its Subsidiaries (“Applicable Laws”), except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect; (B) have not received any written notice of adverse finding,
warning letter, untitled letter or other correspondence or notice from the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration or any other federal, state, or foreign
governmental authority having authority over the Company (“Governmental
Authority”) alleging or asserting material noncompliance with any Applicable
Laws or any licenses, certificates, approvals, clearances, authorizations,
permits and supplements or amendments thereto required by any such Applicable
Laws (“Authorizations”); (C) possess all material Authorizations and such
material Authorizations are valid and in full force and effect and, to the
Company’s knowledge, are not in violation of any term of any such material
Authorizations; (D) have not received written notice of any claim, action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, enforcement, investigation, arbitration or other action
from any Governmental Authority or third party alleging that any product,
operation or activity is in violation of any Applicable Laws or Authorizations
and have no knowledge that any such Governmental Authority or third party is
considering any such claim, litigation, arbitration, action, suit, investigation
or proceeding; (E) have not received written notice that any Governmental
Authority has taken, is taking or intends to take action to limit, suspend,
modify or revoke any Authorizations and the Company has no knowledge that any
such Governmental Authority is considering such action; and (F) have filed,
obtained, maintained or submitted all material reports, documents, forms,
notices, applications, records, claims, submissions and supplements or
amendments as required by any Applicable Laws or material Authorizations and
that all such reports, documents, forms, notices, applications, records, claims,
submissions and supplements or amendments were complete and correct in all
material respects on the date filed (or were corrected or supplemented by a
subsequent submission). During the 12-month period immediately preceding the
Execution Date, to the Company’s knowledge, the studies, tests and preclinical
studies and clinical trials conducted by or on behalf of the Company were and,
if still pending, are, in all material respects, being conducted in accordance
with experimental protocols, procedures and controls pursuant to accepted
professional scientific standards and all Applicable Laws, including, without
limitation, the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or any other
federal, provincial, state, local or foreign governmental or quasi-governmental
body exercising comparable authority; the descriptions of the results of such
studies, tests and trials contained in the SEC Documents are accurate and
complete in all material respects and fairly present the data derived from such
studies, tests and trials; and the descriptions in the SEC Documents of the
results of such clinical trials are consistent in all material respects with
such results and to the Company’s knowledge there are no other studies or other
clinical trials whose results are materially inconsistent with or otherwise
materially call into question the results described or referred to in the SEC
Documents. The Company has concluded that it uses commercially reasonable
efforts to review, from time to time, the progress and results of the studies,
tests and preclinical studies and clinical trials and, based upon (i) the
information provided to the Company by the third parties conducting such
studies, tests, preclinical studies and clinical trials that are described in
the SEC Documents and the Company’s review of such information, and (ii) the
Company’s actual knowledge, the Company reasonably believes that the
descriptions of the results of such studies, tests, preclinical studies and
clinical trials are accurate and complete in all material respects.

(ee) No Disqualification Events. None of the Company, any of its predecessors,
any affiliated issuer, any director, executive officer, other officer of the
Company participating in the transactions contemplated hereby, any beneficial
owner of 20% or more of the Company’s outstanding voting equity securities,
calculated on the basis of voting power, nor any promoter (as that term is
defined in Rule 405

 

20



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

under the Securities Act) connected with the Company in any capacity at the time
of sale (each, an “Issuer Covered Person”) is subject to any of the “Bad Actor”
disqualifications described in Rule 506(d)(1)(i) to (viii) under the Securities
Act (a “Disqualification Event”), except for a Disqualification Event covered by
Rule 506(d)(2) or (d)(3) under the Securities Act. The Company has exercised
reasonable care to determine whether any Issuer Covered Person is subject to a
Disqualification Event.

(ff) Absence of Schedules. In the event that on the Commencement Date, the
Company does not deliver any disclosure schedule contemplated by this Agreement,
the Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that each such undelivered disclosure
schedule shall be deemed to read as follows: “Nothing to Disclose”.

 

5.

COVENANTS.

(a) Filing of Current Report and Shelf Registration Statement. The Company
agrees that it shall, within the time required under the Exchange Act, file with
the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K relating to the transactions contemplated
by, and describing the material terms and conditions of, the Transaction
Documents (the “Current Report”). The Company further agrees that it shall,
within the time required under Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, file with
the SEC the Initial Prospectus Supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the
Securities Act specifically relating to the transactions contemplated by, and
describing the material terms and conditions of, the Transaction Documents,
containing information previously omitted at the time of effectiveness of the
Shelf Registration Statement in reliance on Rule 430B under the Securities Act,
and disclosing all information relating to the transactions contemplated hereby
required to be disclosed in the Shelf Registration Statement and the Prospectus
as of the date of the Initial Prospectus Supplement, including, without
limitation, information required to be disclosed in the section captioned “Plan
of Distribution” in the Prospectus. The Investor acknowledges that it will be
identified in the Initial Prospectus Supplement as an underwriter within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act. The Company shall permit the
Investor to review and comment upon the Current Report and the Initial
Prospectus Supplement at least two (2) Business Days prior to their filing with
the SEC, the Company shall give due consideration to all such comments, and the
Company shall not file the Current Report or the Initial Prospectus Supplement
with the SEC in a form to which the Investor reasonably objects. The Investor
shall use its reasonable best efforts to comment upon the Current Report and the
Initial Prospectus Supplement within one (1) Business Day from the date the
Investor receives the final pre-filing draft version thereof from the Company.
The Investor shall furnish to the Company such information regarding itself, the
Securities held by it and the intended method of distribution thereof, including
any arrangement between the Investor and any other Person relating to the sale
or distribution of the Securities, as shall be reasonably requested by the
Company in connection with the preparation and filing of the Current Report and
the Initial Prospectus Supplement, and shall otherwise cooperate with the
Company as reasonably requested by the Company in connection with the
preparation and filing of the Current Report and the Initial Prospectus
Supplement with the SEC.

(b) Blue Sky. The Company shall take all such action, if any, as is reasonably
necessary in order to obtain an exemption for or to register or qualify (i) the
issuance of the Commitment Shares and the sale of the Purchase Shares to the
Investor under this Agreement and (ii) any subsequent resale of all Commitment
Shares and all Purchase Shares by the Investor, in each case, under applicable
securities or “Blue Sky” laws of the states of the United States in such states
as is reasonably requested by the Investor from time to time, and shall provide
evidence of any such action so taken to the Investor.

(c) Listing/DTC. The Company shall promptly secure the listing of all of the
Purchase Shares and Commitment Shares to be issued to the Investor hereunder on
the Principal Market (subject to official notice of issuance) and upon each
other national securities exchange or automated quotation system, if any, upon
which the Common Stock is then listed, and shall use reasonable best efforts to
maintain, so long as

 

21



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

any shares of Common Stock shall be so listed, such listing of all such
Securities from time to time issuable hereunder. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to maintain the listing of the Common Stock on the
Principal Market and shall comply in all respects with the Company’s reporting,
filing and other obligations under the bylaws or rules and regulations of the
Principal Market. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall take any
action that would reasonably be expected to result in the delisting or
suspension of the Common Stock on the Principal Market. The Company shall
promptly, and in no event later than the following Business Day, provide to the
Investor copies of any notices it receives from any Person regarding the
continued eligibility of the Common Stock for listing on the Principal Market;
provided, however, that the Company shall not provide the Investor copies of any
such notice that the Company reasonably believes constitutes material non-public
information, and the Company would not be required to publicly disclose such
notice in any report or statement filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act
(including on Form 8-K) or the Securities Act. The Company shall pay all fees
and expenses in connection with satisfying its obligations under this
Section 5(c). The Company shall take all action necessary to ensure that its
Common Stock can be transferred electronically as DWAC Shares. The Principal
Market has not commenced any delisting proceedings against the Company.

(d) Prohibition of Short Sales and Hedging Transactions. The Investor agrees
that beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the date of
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 11, the Investor and its
agents, representatives and affiliates shall not in any manner whatsoever enter
into or effect, directly or indirectly, any (i) “short sale” (as such term is
defined in Rule 200 of Regulation SHO of the Exchange Act) of the Common Stock
or (ii) hedging transaction, which establishes a net short position with respect
to the Common Stock.

(e) Issuance of Commitment Shares. In consideration for the Investor’s execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Company shall cause the Transfer Agent to
issue 726,382 shares of Common Stock (the “Commitment Shares”) directly to the
Investor in accordance with Section 6 hereto and the Irrevocable Transfer Agent
Instructions. For the avoidance of doubt, all of the Commitment Shares shall be
fully earned as of the date of this Agreement, whether or not the Commencement
shall occur or any Purchase Shares are purchased by the Investor under this
Agreement and irrespective of any termination of this Agreement.

(f) Due Diligence; Non-Public Information. The Investor shall have the right,
from time to time as the Investor may reasonably deem appropriate upon providing
reasonable advanced notice, to perform reasonable due diligence on the Company
during normal business hours. The Company and its officers and employees shall
provide information and reasonably cooperate with the Investor in connection
with any reasonable request by the Investor related to the Investor’s due
diligence of the Company. Each party hereto agrees not to disclose any
Confidential Information of the other party to any third party and shall not use
the Confidential Information for any purpose other than in connection with, or
in furtherance of, the transactions contemplated hereby in full compliance with
applicable securities laws. Each party hereto acknowledges that the Confidential
Information shall remain the property of the disclosing party and agrees that it
shall take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of any Confidential
Information disclosed by the other party. The Company confirms that neither it
nor any other Person acting on its behalf shall provide the Investor or its
agents or counsel with any information that constitutes or might constitute
material, non-public information, unless a simultaneous public announcement
thereof is made by the Company in the manner contemplated by Regulation FD under
the Exchange Act. In the event of a breach of the foregoing covenant by the
Company or any Person acting on its behalf (as determined in the reasonable good
faith judgment of the Investor), in addition to any other remedy provided herein
or in the other Transaction Documents, if the Investor is holding any Securities
at the time of the disclosure of material, non-public information, the Investor
shall have the right to make a public disclosure, in the form of a press
release, public advertisement or otherwise, of such material, non-public
information without the prior approval by the Company; provided the Investor
shall have first provided notice to the Company that it believes it has received
information that constitutes material, non-public information, the Company shall

 

22



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

have at least two (2) Business Days to publicly disclose such material,
non-public information or demonstrate to the Investor in writing why such
information does not constitute material, non-public information, and (assuming
the Investor and Investor’s counsel disagree with the Company’s determination)
prior to any such disclosure by the Investor, and the Company shall have failed
to publicly disclose such material, non-public information within such time
period. The Investor shall not have any liability to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
stockholders or agents, for any such disclosure. The Company understands and
confirms that the Investor shall be relying on the foregoing covenants in
effecting transactions in securities of the Company.

(g) Purchase Records. The Investor and the Company shall each maintain records
showing the remaining Available Amount at any given time and the dates and
Purchase Amounts for each Regular Purchase, Accelerated Purchase and Additional
Accelerated Purchase or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to
the Investor and the Company.

(h) Taxes. The Company shall pay any and all transfer, stamp or similar taxes
that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of any shares of
Common Stock to the Investor made under this Agreement.

(i) Aggregation. From and after the date of this Agreement, neither the Company,
nor or any of its affiliates will, and the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that no Person acting on their behalf will, directly or
indirectly, make any offers or sales of any security or solicit any offers to
buy any security, under circumstances that would cause this offering of the
Securities by the Company to the Investor to be aggregated with other offerings
by the Company in a manner that would require stockholder approval pursuant to
the rules of the Principal Market on which any of the securities of the Company
are listed or designated, unless stockholder approval is obtained before the
closing of such subsequent transaction in accordance with the rules of such
Principal Market.

(j) Effective Registration Statement; Current Prospectus. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to keep the Registration Statement effective
pursuant to Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act and keep the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus current and available for issuances
and sales of all of the Securities by the Company to the Investor and for the
resale of Securities by the Investor during the term of this Agreement and for
the period prescribed by Registration Rights Agreement. The Company shall comply
with all applicable federal, state and foreign securities laws in connection
with the offer, issuance and sale of the Securities contemplated by the
Transaction Documents.

(k) Compliance with Laws. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall
maintain, or cause to be maintained, all material permits, licenses and other
Authorizations required by federal, state and local law in order to conduct
their businesses substantially as described in the SEC Documents, and the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall conduct their businesses, or cause
their businesses to be conducted, in substantial compliance with such permits,
licenses and Authorizations and with Applicable Laws, except where the failure
to maintain or be in compliance with such permits, licenses, Authorizations and
Applicable Laws would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company shall comply with all requirements imposed upon it by the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act and applicable U.S. state securities or
“Blue Sky” laws as from time to time may be in force in connection with the
offer, issuance and sale of the Securities contemplated by the Transaction
Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither the Company
nor any of its officers, directors or affiliates will take, directly or
indirectly, any action designed or intended to stabilize or manipulate the price
of any security of the Company, or which would reasonably be expected to cause
or result in, stabilization or manipulation of the price of any security of the
Company. The Company will conduct its affairs in such a manner so as to
reasonably ensure that neither it nor the Subsidiaries will be or become, at any
time prior to the termination of this Agreement, an “investment company,” as
such term is defined in the Investment Company Act, assuming no change in the
SEC’s current interpretation as to entities that are not considered an
investment company. Specifically, the Company and the Subsidiaries will use
their best efforts to comply with all effective applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act applicable to it.

 

23



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(l) Stop Orders. The Company shall advise the Investor promptly (but in no event
later than 24 hours) and shall confirm such advice in writing: (i) of the
Company’s receipt of notice of any request by the SEC for amendment of or a
supplement to the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any Prospectus
Supplement or for any additional information; (ii) of the Company’s receipt of
notice of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement or prohibiting or suspending the use of the
Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement, or of the Company’s receipt of any
notification of the suspension of qualification of the Securities for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or contemplated initiation of any
proceeding for such purpose; and (iii) of the Company becoming aware of the
happening of any event which makes any statement of a material fact made in the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement untrue or
which requires the making of any additions to or changes to the statements then
made in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement
in order to state a material fact required by the Securities Act to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements then made therein (in the
case of the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading, or of the necessity to
amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Prospectus or any Prospectus
Supplement to comply with the Securities Act or any other law. The Company shall
not be required to disclose to the Investor the substance or specific reasons of
any of the events set forth in clauses (i) through (iii) of the immediately
preceding sentence, but rather, shall only be required to disclose that the
event has occurred. The Company shall not deliver to the Investor any Regular
Purchase Notice, Accelerated Purchase Notice or Additional Accelerated Purchase
Notice, and the Investor shall not be obligated to purchase any shares of Common
Stock under this Agreement, during the continuation or pendency of any of the
foregoing events. If at any time the SEC shall issue any stop order suspending
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or prohibiting or suspending the
use of the Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal of such order at the
earliest possible time. The Company shall furnish to the Investor, without
charge, a copy of any correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the SEC to the
Company or its representatives relating to the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus, as the case may be.

(m) Amendments to Registration Statement; Prospectus Supplements. Except as
provided in this Agreement and other than periodic and current reports required
to be filed pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Company shall not file with the
SEC any amendment to the Registration Statement or any supplement to the Base
Prospectus that refers to the Investor, the Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, any Prospectus
Supplement filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents), in each case with respect to which (a) the Investor
shall not previously have been advised and afforded the opportunity to review
and comment thereon at least two (2) Business Days prior to filing with the SEC,
as the case may be, (b) the Company shall not have given due consideration to
any comments thereon received from the Investor or its counsel, or (c) the
Investor shall reasonably object, unless the Company reasonably has determined
that it is necessary to amend the Registration Statement or make any supplement
to the Prospectus to comply with the Securities Act or any other applicable law
or regulation, in which case the Company shall promptly (but in no event later
than 48 hours) so inform the Investor, the Investor shall be provided with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any disclosure referring to
the Investor, the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
thereby, as applicable, and the Company shall expeditiously furnish to the
Investor a copy thereof. In addition, for so long as, in the reasonable opinion
of counsel for the Investor, the Prospectus is required to be delivered in
connection with any acquisition or sale of Securities by the Investor, the
Company shall not file any Prospectus Supplement with respect to the Securities
without furnishing to the Investor as many copies of such Prospectus Supplement,
together with the Prospectus, as the Investor may reasonably request.

 

24



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(n) Prospectus Delivery. The Company consents to the use of the Prospectus (and
of each Prospectus Supplement thereto) in accordance with the provisions of the
Securities Act and with the securities or “blue sky” laws of the jurisdictions
in which the Securities may be sold by the Investor, in connection with the
offering and sale of the Securities and for such period of time thereafter as
the Prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be delivered in connection
with sales of the Securities. The Company will make available to the Investor
upon request, and thereafter from time to time will furnish to the Investor, as
many copies of the Prospectus (and each Prospectus Supplement thereto) as the
Investor may reasonably request for the purposes contemplated by the Securities
Act within the time during which the Prospectus is required by the Securities
Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities. If during such
period of time any event shall occur that in the reasonable judgment of the
Company and its counsel, or in the reasonable judgment of the Investor and its
counsel, is required to be set forth in the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus or any Prospectus Supplement or should be set forth therein in order
to make the statements made therein (in the case of the Prospectus or any
Prospectus Supplement, in light of the circumstances under which they were made)
not misleading, or if in the reasonable judgment of the Company and its counsel,
or in the reasonable judgment of the Investor and its counsel, it is otherwise
necessary to amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Prospectus or
any Prospectus Supplement to comply with the Securities Act or any other
applicable law or regulation, the Company shall forthwith prepare and, subject
to Section 5(m) above, file with the SEC an appropriate amendment to the
Registration Statement or an appropriate Prospectus Supplement and in each case
shall expeditiously furnish to the Investor, at the Company’s expense, such
amendment to the Registration Statement or such Prospectus Supplement, as
applicable, as may be necessary to reflect any such change or to effect such
compliance. The Company shall have no obligation to separately advise the
Investor of, or deliver copies to the Investor of, the SEC Documents, all of
which the Investor shall be deemed to have notice of.

(o) Use of Proceeds. The Company will use the net proceeds from the offering for
any corporate purpose at the sole discretion of the Company.

(p) Other Transactions. The Company shall not enter into, announce or recommend
to its stockholders any agreement, plan, arrangement or transaction in or of
which the terms thereof would restrict, materially delay, conflict with or
impair the ability or right of the Company to perform its obligations under the
Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, the obligation of the
Company to deliver the Securities to the Investor in accordance with the terms
of the Transaction Documents.

(q) Required Filings Relating to Purchases. To the extent required under the
Securities Act or under interpretations by the SEC thereof, as promptly as
practicable after the close of each of the Company’s fiscal quarters (or on such
other dates as required under the Securities Act or under interpretations by the
SEC thereof), the Company shall prepare a Prospectus Supplement, which will set
forth the number of Purchase Shares sold to the Investor during such quarterly
period (or other relevant period), the purchase price for such Purchase Shares
and the net proceeds received by the Company from such sales, and shall file
such Prospectus Supplement with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the
Securities Act (and within the time periods required by Rule 424(b) and Rule

quarterly report on Form 10-Q (as applicable) in respect of the quarterly period
that ended immediately before the filing of such report in which sales of
Purchase Shares were made to the Investor under this Agreement, and file such
report with the SEC within the applicable time period required by the Exchange
Act. The Company shall not file any Prospectus Supplement pursuant to this
Section 5(q), and shall not file any report containing disclosure relating to
such sales of Purchase

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shares, unless a copy of such Prospectus Supplement or disclosure has been
submitted to the Investor a reasonable period of time before the filing and the
Investor has not reasonably objected thereto (it being acknowledged and agreed
that the Company shall not submit any portion of any Form 10-K or Form 10-Q
other than the specific disclosure relating to any sales of Purchase Shares).
The Company shall also furnish copies of all such Prospectus Supplements to each
exchange or market in the United States on which sales of the Purchase Shares
may be made as may be required by the rules or regulations of such exchange or
market, if applicable.

(r) Limitation on Variable Rate Transactions. Until the later of (i) thirty-six
(36) months from the Execution Date or (ii) six (6) months following the later
of (A) Maturity Date or (B) the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 11, the Company shall be prohibited from effecting or entering into an
agreement to effect any issuance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of
Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (or a combination of units thereof)
involving a Variable Rate Transaction, other than in connection with an Exempt
Issuance (as defined below). The Investor shall be entitled to obtain injunctive
relief against the Company and its Subsidiaries to preclude any such issuance,
which remedy shall be in addition to any right to collect damages, without the
necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being
required. “Common Stock Equivalents” means any securities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries which entitle the holder thereof to acquire at any time Common
Stock, including, without limitation, any debt, preferred stock, rights,
options, warrants or other instrument that is at any time convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for, or otherwise entitles the holder thereof to
receive, Common Stock. “Variable Rate Transaction” means a transaction in which
the Company (i) issues or sells any debt or equity securities that are
convertible into, exchangeable or exercisable for, or include the right to
receive additional shares of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents either
(A) at a conversion price, exercise price, exchange rate or other price that is
based upon and/or varies with the trading prices of or quotations for the Common
Stock at any time after the initial issuance of such debt or equity securities
(including, without limitation, pursuant to any “cashless exercise” provision),
or (B) with a conversion, exercise or exchange price that is subject to being
reset at some future date after the initial issuance of such debt or equity
security or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or
indirectly related to the business of the Company or the market for the Common
Stock (including, without limitation, any “full ratchet” or “weighted average”
anti-dilution provisions, but not including any standard anti-dilution
protection for any reorganization, recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock
split, reverse stock split or other similar transaction), (ii) issues or sells
any debt or equity securities, including without limitation, Common Stock or
Common Stock Equivalents, either (A) at a price that is subject to being reset
at some future date after the initial issuance of such debt or equity security
or upon the occurrence of specified or contingent events directly or indirectly
related to the business of the Company or the market for the Common Stock (other
than standard anti-dilution protection for any reorganization, recapitalization,
non-cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar
transaction), or (B) that is subject to or contains any put, call, redemption,
buy-back, price-reset or other similar provision or mechanism (including,
without limitation, a “Black-Scholes” put or call right) that provides for the
issuance of additional debt or equity securities of the Company or the payment
of cash by the Company, or (iii) enters into any agreement, including, but not
limited to, an “equity line”, “at-the-market offering” that is not an Exempt
Issuance or other continuous offering or similar offering of Common Stock or
Common Stock Equivalents, whereby the Company may sell Common Stock or Common
Stock Equivalents at a future determined price. For the avoidance of doubt, the
offering and sale by the Company of a warrant with either (i) a customary
“cashless exercise” term, or (ii) a customary weighted average price
anti-dilution adjustment that is triggered by the Company’s subsequent sale of
equity securities at a price that is lower than the applicable conversion price,
shall not be deemed to be a prohibited Variable Rate Transaction. “Exempt
Issuance” means the issuance of (a) Common Stock, restricted stock units,
options or other equity incentive awards to employees, officers, directors or
vendors of the Company pursuant to any equity incentive plan duly adopted for
such purpose, by the Board of Directors or a majority of the members of a
committee of directors established for such purpose, (b) any Securities issued
to the Investor pursuant to this Agreement, (c) shares of Common Stock,

 

26



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Common Stock Equivalents or other securities issued to the Investor pursuant to
any other existing or future contract, agreement or arrangement between the
Company and the Investor, (d) shares of Common Stock, Common Stock Equivalents
or other securities upon the exercise, exchange or conversion of any shares of
Common Stock, Common Stock Equivalents or other securities held by the Investor
at any time, (e) any securities issued upon the exercise or exchange of or
conversion of any Common Stock Equivalents issued and outstanding on the date of
this Agreement, provided that such Common Stock Equivalents have not been
amended following the date of this Agreement to increase the number of
securities or Common Stock underlying such securities or to decrease the
exercise price, exchange price or conversion price of such securities, (other
than in connection with their terms or a reorganization, recapitalization,
non-cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other similar
transaction), (f) Common Stock Equivalents that are convertible into,
exchangeable or exercisable for, or include the right to receive shares of
Common Stock at a conversion price, exercise price, exchange rate or other price
(which may be below the then current market price of the Common Stock) that is
fixed at the time of initial issuance of such Common Stock Equivalents (subject
only to standard anti-dilution protection for any reorganization,
recapitalization, non-cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or other
similar transaction), which fixed conversion price, exercise price, exchange
rate or other price shall not at any time after the initial issuance of such
Common Stock Equivalent be based upon or varying with the trading prices of or
quotations for the Common Stock or subject to being reset at some future date,
(g) securities issued pursuant to acquisitions, divestitures, licenses,
partnerships, collaborations or strategic transactions approved by the Board of
Directors or a majority of the members of a committee of directors established
for such purpose, which acquisitions, divestitures, licenses, partnerships,
collaborations or strategic transactions can have a Variable Rate Transaction
component, provided that any such issuance shall only be to a Person (or to the
equity holders of a Person) which is, itself or through its subsidiaries, an
operating company or an asset in a business synergistic with the business of the
Company and shall provide to the Company additional benefits in addition to the
investment of funds, but shall not include a transaction in which the Company is
issuing securities primarily for the purpose of raising capital or to an entity
whose primary business is investing in securities, (h) Common Stock issued
pursuant to an “at-the-market offering” by the Company exclusively through a
registered broker-dealer acting as agent of the Company pursuant to a written
agreement between the Company and such registered broker-dealer or
(i) securities (such as warrants) or Common Stock issued in connection with
future financings or offerings of the Company, such as but not limited to,
registered direct offerings, rights offerings, and confidentially marketed
public offerings; provided such transactions do not involve a Variable Rate
Transaction.

representatives (including, without limitation, those retained in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (collectively, the
“Indemnitees”) from and against any and all actions, causes of action, suits,
claims, losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities and damages, and expenses in
connection therewith (irrespective of whether any such Indemnitee is a party to
the action for which indemnification hereunder is sought), and including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements (the “Indemnified Liabilities”),
incurred by any Indemnitee as a result of, or arising out of or relating to:
(a) any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by
the Company in the Transaction Documents or any other certificate, instrument or
document contemplated hereby or thereby, (b) any breach of any covenant,
agreement or obligation of the Company contained in the Transaction Documents or
any other certificate, instrument or document contemplated hereby or thereby,
(c) any cause of action, suit or claim brought or made against such Indemnitee
and arising out of or resulting from the execution, delivery, performance or
enforcement of the Transaction Documents or any other certificate, instrument or
document contemplated hereby or thereby, (d) any violation of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, state securities or “Blue Sky” laws, or the rules and
regulations of the Principal Market in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors or employees, (e) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained, or
incorporated by reference, in the Registration Statement or any amendment
thereto or any omission or alleged omission to state therein, or in any document
incorporated by reference therein, a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (f) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained, or
incorporated by reference, in the Registration Statement, or any omission or
alleged omission to state therein, or in any document incorporated by reference
therein, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; provided, however, that (I) the indemnity contained in clause
(c) of

 

30



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this Section 9 shall not apply to any Indemnified Liabilities which directly and
primarily result from the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of an
Indemnitee, (II) the indemnity contained in clauses (d), (e) and (f) of this
Section 9 shall not apply to any Indemnified Liabilities to the extent, but only
to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of
the Investor expressly for use in any Prospectus Supplement (it being hereby
acknowledged and agreed that the written information set forth on Exhibit D
hereto is the only written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf
of the Investor expressly for use in the Initial Prospectus Supplement), if the
Prospectus was timely made available by the Company to the Investor pursuant to
Section 5(l), (III) the indemnity contained in clauses (d), (e) and (f) of this
Section 9 shall not inure to the benefit of the Investor to the extent such
Indemnified Liabilities are based on a failure of the Investor to deliver or to
cause to be delivered the Prospectus made available by the Company, if such
Prospectus was timely made available by the Company pursuant to Section 5(l),
and if delivery of the Prospectus would have cured the defect giving rise to
such Indemnified Liabilities, and IV the indemnity in this Section 9 shall not
apply to amounts paid in settlement of any claim if such settlement is effected
without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. To the extent that the foregoing
undertaking by the Company may be unenforceable for any reason, the Company
shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of
the Indemnified Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law, provided
that no seller of Securities guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any seller of Securities who was not guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation. Payment under this indemnification shall be made within
thirty (30) days from the date the Indemnitee makes written request for it. A
certificate containing reasonable detail as to the amount of such
indemnification submitted to the Company by the Indemnitee shall be conclusive
evidence, absent manifest error, of the amount due from the Company to the
Indemnitee. If any action shall be brought against any Indemnitee in respect of
which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this Agreement, such Indemnitee shall
promptly notify the Company in writing, and the Company shall have the right to
assume the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnitee. Any Indemnitee shall have the right to employ
separate counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
Indemnitee, except to the extent that (i) the employment thereof has been
specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Company has failed
after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to employ counsel
or (iii) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of such separate
counsel, a material conflict on any material issue between the position of the
Company and the position of such Indemnitee, in which case the Company shall be
responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one such
separate counsel.

party (except as set forth below); provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 11(b) shall not be available to any
party if such party is then in breach of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or any representation or warranty of such party contained in this
Agreement fails to be true and correct such that the conditions set forth in
Section 8(e), as applicable, could not then be satisfied.

(c) At any time after the Commencement Date, the Company shall have the option

Agreement.

(h) No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is intended for the benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, and,
except as set forth in Section 9, is not for the benefit of, nor may any
provision hereof be enforced by, any other Person.

(i) Publicity. The Company shall afford the Investor and its counsel with the
opportunity to review and comment upon, shall consult with the Investor and its

Investor’s remedies provided in Section 9, shall be cumulative and in addition
to all other remedies available to the Investor under this Agreement, at law or
in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive
relief), no remedy of the Investor contained herein shall be deemed a waiver of
compliance with the provisions giving rise to such remedy and nothing herein
shall limit the Investor’s right to pursue actual damages for any failure by the
Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement. The Company acknowledges
that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to
the Investor and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate.
The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of any such breach or threatened
breach, the Investor shall be entitled, in addition to all other available
remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach, without the necessity of
showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.

hands of an attorney for enforcement or is enforced by the Investor through any
legal proceeding; (ii) an attorney is retained to represent the Investor in any
bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or other proceedings affecting
creditors’ rights and involving a claim under this Agreement; or (iii) an
attorney is retained to represent the Investor in any other proceedings
whatsoever in connection with this Agreement, then the Company shall pay to the
Investor, as incurred by the Investor, all reasonable costs and expenses
including attorneys’ fees incurred in connection therewith, in addition to all
other amounts due hereunder.

(o) Amendment and Waiver; Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver. No provision of this
Agreement may be amended other than by a written instrument signed by both
parties hereto and (ii) no provision of this Agreement may be waived other than
in a written instrument signed by the party against whom enforcement of such
waiver is sought. No failure or delay in the exercise of any power, right or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege.
