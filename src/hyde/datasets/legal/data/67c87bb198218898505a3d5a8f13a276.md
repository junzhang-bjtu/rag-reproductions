ARTICLE VII
COVENANTS

 

Section 7.1 Public Announcements. The Seller Parties shall not make, or permit
any Representative or Affiliate of theirs to make, any public statements or
otherwise communicate with any news media, including the issuance of any press
releases, with respect to this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
Contemplated Transactions without the prior written consent of Buyer (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless otherwise
required by applicable Law, in which case the Seller Parties shall allow Buyer
reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such
issuance. Buyer and the Seller Parties acknowledge and agree that, following the
Closing, Buyer, in its sole discretion, may make a customary public announcement
regarding consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 7.2 Restrictive Covenants. As a condition and material inducement to
Buyer’s willingness to enter into this Agreement and purchase the Shares
hereunder, and to protect the value and goodwill of the Business and the
substantial investment made by Buyer, each of the Seller Parties hereby
covenants and agrees as follows:

 

(a) Non-Solicitation and Non-Hire. Except with respect to soliciting business
from customers and vendors of Synergy Medical Laboratory as of the date hereof,
for a period of twenty-four (24) months immediately following the Closing Date,
no Seller Party will, and each Seller Party will cause its Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly:

 

(i) solicit the business of any Person who is a customer of the Company, Buyer,
or any of their respective Affiliates with respect to the Business;

 

(ii) cause or induce, or attempt to cause or induce, any customer, supplier,
vendor, licensee, licensor, franchisee, employee, contractor, consultant, or
other business relation of Buyer or any of its Affiliates to cease doing
business with such Person or to deal with any competitor of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, or in any way interfere with Buyer’s or any of its Affiliates’
relationship with any such Person;

 

-23-

 



 

(iii) cause or induce, or attempt to cause or induce, any customer, supplier,
vendor, licensee, licensor, franchisee, employee, contractor, consultant, or
other business relation of the Company as of, or at any time during the twelve
(12)-month period immediately preceding, the Closing Date, to cease doing
business with the Company, Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates or to
deal with any competitor of the Company, Buyer, or any of their respective
Affiliates, or in any way interfere with the Company’s, Buyer’s, or any of their
respective Affiliates’ relationship with any such Person; or

 

(iv) solicit, induce, hire, retain, or attempt to hire or retain any employee or
independent contractor of the Company, Buyer, or any of their respective
Affiliates (including any former employee or independent contractor if such
Person was an employee or independent contractor of the Company, Buyer, or any
of its Affiliates within the twelve (12)-month period prior to such
solicitation, inducement, hiring, retention, or attempt to hire or retain), or
in any way interfere with the relationship between the Company, Buyer, or any of
their respective Affiliates and any of such Person’s employees or independent
contractors.

 

(b) Confidentiality. From and after the Closing Date, each of the Seller Parties
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and, as applicable, their respective
Representatives to, keep confidential and not disclose or use any Confidential
Information, other than to disclose Confidential Information to Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such Seller Party or any of its Affiliates or,
as applicable, any of their respective Representatives (collectively, the
“Disclosing Party”) is requested or required by Law to disclose any Confidential
Information, the Disclosing Party will provide Buyer with notice of such request
or requirement as promptly as practicable (unless prohibited by Law) so that
Buyer may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive
compliance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.2(b). The Disclosing
Party will cooperate reasonably with Buyer in connection with Buyer’s efforts to
seek such an order or remedy. If Buyer does not obtain such an order or other
remedy, or waives compliance with the provisions of this Section 7.2(b), the
Disclosing Party will furnish only that portion of the applicable Confidential
Information that is legally required, and will exercise reasonable efforts to
obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded such disclosed
information.

 

(c) Equitable Remedies. Each Seller Party acknowledges and agrees that (i) Buyer
and its Affiliates would suffer irreparable and ongoing damages (including a
significant loss of the value and goodwill of the Shares and of the Business
purchased by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement) in the event that any provision
of this Section 7.2 were not performed in accordance with its terms or otherwise
were breached; and (ii) monetary damages, even if available, alone would not be
an adequate remedy for any such non-performance or breach. Accordingly, each
Seller Party agrees that in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any
provision of this Section 7.2, Buyer shall be entitled, in addition to all other
rights and remedies that it may have existing in its favor at law, in equity, or
otherwise, to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief (including a temporary
restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a final injunction) to prevent
any such breach or threatened breach and to enforce such provisions
specifically, without the necessity of posting a bond or other security or of
proving actual damages. The prevailing party in any action commenced under this
Section 7.2(c) (whether through a monetary judgment, injunctive relief, or
otherwise) also shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and
court costs incurred in connection with such action.

 

-24-

 

 



(d) General Acknowledgements. Each Seller Party acknowledges and agrees that (i)
the covenants applicable to such Seller Party set forth in this Section 7.2
constitute a material inducement to Buyer’s willingness to enter into this
Agreement and consummate the Contemplated Transactions and are an integral part
of the Contemplated Transactions; (ii) but for these covenants, Buyer would not
have entered into this Agreement or agreed to acquire the Shares; (iii) in view
of the highly competitive nature of the Business, the business objectives of
Buyer in acquiring the Shares, and the consideration paid for the Shares, each
of the covenants set forth in this Section 7.2 is reasonable with respect to its
scope, geographic area, and duration and is necessary to protect Buyer’s
legitimate business interests (including the value and goodwill of the Business
and the Shares purchased by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement), and (iv) the
Business, and the business engaged in by Buyer and its Affiliates, both have a
nationwide geographic scope.

 

Section 7.3 Further Assurances. At any time and from time to time following the
Closing, at the request of any party hereto and without further consideration,
each party hereto shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, such further documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be
taken, such further actions as any other party hereto may reasonably request or
as otherwise may be necessary or desirable to evidence and make effective the
Contemplated Transactions.

 

Section 7.4 Release of Claims.

 

(a) Release. For good and valuable consideration, effective upon the Closing,
each of the Seller Parties, on behalf of itself, himself, or herself and its,
his, or her heirs, executors, administrators, legal representatives, successors,
and assigns (collectively, the “Releasors”), hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably waives, releases, and forever discharges Buyer, the Company, their
respective Affiliates and subsidiaries, each of their respective predecessors,
successors, and assigns, and each of their respective current and former
equityholders, partners, members, directors, managers, officers, employees,
agents and other Representatives (collectively, the “Releasees”) of and from any
and all claims, demands, charges, complaints, obligations, causes of action,
suits, liabilities, indebtedness, sums of money, covenants, agreements,
instruments, contracts (written or oral, express or implied), controversies,

damages, and judgments, at law or in equity, in contract or tort, in United
States, state, foreign, or other judicial, administrative, arbitration, or other
proceedings, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or
unsuspected, previously, now or hereafter arising (collectively, the “Claims”),
that the Releasors ever had, now have, or hereafter shall or may have for or by
reason of, or in any way arising out of or relating to, any cause, matter, act,
omission, or thing whatsoever from the beginning of time through and including
the Closing Date, including any Claims arising out of or relating to any Seller
Party’s ownership of any Shares or service as a director, officer, employee,
agent, or other Representative of the Company. Except as expressly set forth in
Section 7.4(b), each of the Seller Parties acknowledges and understands that the
foregoing is a full and final release of all Claims that could have been
asserted in any legal or equitable proceeding against the Releasees, including
any right to recover against the Releasees for any indemnification or
contribution claims made against or paid by the Seller Parties pursuant to
ARTICLE VIII. To the maximum extent permitted by Law, each of the Seller Parties
expressly waives all rights afforded by any statute that limits the effect of a
release with respect to unknown claims in connection with the release expressly
granted by this Section 7.4(a).

 

-25-

 



 

(b) Exceptions. Nothing in Section 7.4(a) shall constitute a release of any
rights or obligations arising under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements.

 

(c) No Commencement of Released Claims. Each Releasor further covenants and
agrees, effective upon the Closing Date and to the fullest extent permitted by
Law, not to commence, join, assist, or aid in any manner whatsoever the making
of any claim or the bringing of any Action against the Releasees based upon any
of the Claims that are released pursuant to Section 7.4(a).

 

(d) No Assignment. Each of the Seller Parties, on behalf of itself, himself, or
herself and any Person claiming through such Seller Party, (i) represents and
warrants that neither such Seller Party nor any of such Persons has assigned and
(ii) covenants that neither such Seller Party nor any of such Persons will
assign, to any other Person any Claim or potential Claim released by Section
7.4(a).

 

Section 7.5 Tax Matters.

 

(a) Computation of Liabilities. Whenever it is necessary to determine the
Liability for Taxes for a Straddle Period relating to:

 

(i) Taxes of the Company imposed on a periodic basis (such as real property
Taxes or other ad valorem Taxes), the determination of the Taxes of the Company
for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including and the portion
of the Straddle Period beginning and ending after, the Closing Date shall be
calculated by allocating to the periods before and after the Closing Date pro
rata, based on the number of days of the Straddle Period in the period before
and ending on the Closing Date, on the one hand, and the number of days in the
Straddle Period in the period after the Closing Date, on the other hand; and

 

(ii) Taxes of the Company not described in Section 7.5(a)(i) (such as (A) Taxes
based on the income or receipts of the Company for a Straddle Period, (B) Taxes
imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or assignment of property
(including all sales and use Taxes) for a Straddle Period, and (C) withholding
and employment Taxes relating to a Straddle Period), the determination of the
Taxes of the Company for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and
including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning and ending after,
the Closing Date shall be calculated by assuming that the Straddle Period
consisted of two (2) taxable periods, one (1) which ended at the close of the
Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the
Closing Date and items of income, gain, deduction, loss, or credit of the
Company for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two (2) taxable
years or periods on a “closing of the books basis” by assuming that the books of
the Company were closed at the close of the Closing Date (and for such purpose,
the taxable period of any partnership or other pass-through entity in which the
Company holds a beneficial interest shall be deemed to terminate at such time).

 

-26-

 



 

(b) Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns.

 

(i) The Seller Party Representative shall, at the Seller Parties’ cost and
expense, (A) prepare, or cause to be prepared all Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns
required to be filed by or on behalf of the Company. All such Pre-Closing Period
Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner that is consistent with the
prior practice of the Company, except as required by applicable Law. The Seller
Party Representative shall deliver or cause to be delivered drafts of all such
Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns to Buyer for its review at least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date of any such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return; provided,
however, that such drafts of any such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return shall be
subject to Buyer’s review and approval, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed; and (B) pay all Pre-Closing Taxes due and
payable in respect of all Pre-Closing Period Tax Returns of the Company;
provided, however, that if any Pre-Closing Period Tax Return is due after the
Closing and is to be filed (or caused to be filed) by Buyer, the Seller Parties
shall pay (in immediately available funds) to Buyer the amount of all
Pre-Closing Taxes due and payable with respect of such Pre-Closing Period Tax
Return (determined pursuant to this Section 7.5) no later than three (3)
Business Days prior to the earlier of the date such Pre-Closing Period Tax
Return is filed or the due date of such Pre-Closing Period Tax Return.

 

(ii) Buyer shall, at its expense, prepare and timely file, or cause to be
prepared and timely filed, all Straddle Period Tax Returns required to be filed
by the Company. All Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a
manner that is consistent with the prior practice of the Company, except as
required by applicable Law. Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered drafts
of all Straddle Period Tax Returns to the Seller Party Representative for its
review at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date of any such Straddle
Period Tax Return and shall notify the Seller Party Representative of Buyer’s
calculation of the Seller Parties’ share of the Taxes of the Company for such
Straddle Period (determined in accordance with Section 7.5(a)); provided,
however, that such drafts of any such Straddle Period Tax Returns and such
calculations of the Seller Parties’ share of the Tax liability for such Straddle
Period (determined in accordance with Section 7.5(a)) shall be subject to the
Seller Party Representative’s review and approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. The Seller Parties shall pay (in
immediately available funds) to Buyer the amount of all Pre-Closing Taxes due
and payable with respect of any such Straddle Period Tax Return (determined
pursuant to this Section 7.5) no later than three (3) Business Days prior to the
earlier of the date such Straddle Period Tax Return is filed or the due date of
such Straddle Period Tax Return.

 

(c) Cooperation and Records Retention. The Seller Parties, the Seller Party
Representative, and Buyer shall (i) each provide the other, and Buyer shall
cause the Company to provide the Seller Parties and the Seller Party
Representative, with such assistance as may be reasonably requested by any of
them in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, audit, or other
examination by any Taxing Authority or judicial or administrative proceedings
relating to liability for Taxes, (ii) each retain and provide the other, and
Buyer shall cause the Company to retain and provide the Seller Parties and the
Seller Party Representative with, any records or other information that may be
relevant to such Tax Return, audit or examination, proceeding, or determination,
and (iii) each provide the others with any final determination of any such audit
or examination, proceeding, or determination that affects any amount required to
be shown on any Tax Return of the Company for any period. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall retain, and shall cause the Company to
retain, and the Seller Parties and the Seller Party Representative shall retain,
until the applicable statutes of limitations (including any extensions) have
expired, copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules and other records
or information that may be relevant to such returns for all Tax periods or
portions thereof ending before or including the Closing Date and shall not
destroy or otherwise dispose of any such records without first providing the
other parties hereto with a reasonable opportunity to review and copy the same.
Each party hereto shall bear its own expenses in complying with the foregoing
provisions.

(d) Omitted.

 

(e) Tax Proceedings.

 

(i) Buyer shall deliver a written notice to the Seller Party Representative
promptly following any demand, claim, or notice of commencement of a claim,
proposed adjustment, assessment, audit, examination, or other administrative or
court Action with respect to Taxes of the Company for which the Seller Parties
may be liable (each, a “Tax Contest”) and shall describe in reasonable detail
(to the extent known by Buyer) the facts constituting the basis for such Tax
Contest, the nature of the relief sought, and the amount of the claimed Losses
(including Taxes), if any (the “Tax Claim Notice”); provided, however, that the
failure or delay to so notify the Seller Party Representative shall not relieve
the Seller Parties of any obligation or Liability that the Seller Parties may
have to Buyer, except to the extent that the Seller Parties demonstrate that the
Seller Parties are materially and adversely prejudiced thereby.

 

(ii) With respect to Tax Contests for Taxes of the Company for a Pre-Closing
Period, the Seller Party Representative may elect to assume and control the
defense of such Tax Contest by written notice to Buyer within thirty (30) days
after delivery by Buyer to the Seller Party Representative of the Tax Claim
Notice. If the Seller Party Representative elects to assume and control the
defense of such Tax Contest, the Seller Party Representative (A) shall bear its
own costs and expenses, (B) shall be entitled to engage its own counsel, and (C)
may (1) pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings,
hearings, and conferences with any Taxing Authority, (2) either pay the Tax
claimed or sue for refund where applicable Law permits such refund suit, or (3)
contest, settle, or compromise the Tax Contest in any permissible manner;
provided, however, that Seller Party Representative shall not settle or
compromise (or take other actions described herein with respect to) any Tax
Contest without the prior written consent of Buyer (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned) if such settlement or compromise
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the Tax Liability of Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including the Company) for any Tax period ending after
the Closing Date. If the Seller Party Representative elects to assume the
defense of any Tax Contest, the Seller Party Representative shall (x) keep Buyer
reasonably informed of all material developments and events relating to such Tax
Contest (including promptly forwarding copies to Buyer of any related
correspondence, and shall provide Buyer with an opportunity to review and
comment on any material correspondence before the Seller Party Representative
sends such correspondence to any Taxing Authority), (y) consult with Buyer in
connection with the defense or prosecution of any such Tax Contest, and (z)
provide such cooperation and information as Buyer shall reasonably request, and
Buyer shall have the right to participate in (but not control) the defense of
such Tax Contest (including participating in any discussions with the applicable
Tax Authorities regarding such Tax Contests).

 

-28-

 



 

(iii) In connection with any Tax Contest that relates to Taxes of the Company
for a Pre-Closing Period that (A) the Seller Party Representative does not
timely elect to control pursuant to Section 7.5(e)(ii) or (B) the Seller Party
Representative fails to diligently defend, such Tax Contest shall be controlled
by Buyer (and the Seller Parties, jointly and severally, shall reimburse Buyer
for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Buyer relating to a Tax
Contest described in this Section 7.5(e)(iii)) and the Seller Parties and the
Seller Party Representative agree to cooperate with Buyer in pursuing such Tax
Contest.

 

(iv) In connection with any Tax Contest for Taxes of the Company for any
Straddle Period, such Tax Contest shall be controlled by Buyer; provided, that
Buyer shall not settle or compromise (or take such other actions described
herein with respect to) any Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the
Seller Party Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed. The Buyer shall (x) keep the Seller Party
Representative informed of all material developments and events relating to such
Tax Contest (including promptly forwarding copies to the Seller Party
Representative of any related correspondence and shall provide the Seller Party
Representative with an opportunity to review and comment on any material
correspondence before Buyer sends such correspondence to any Taxing Authority),
(y) consult with the Seller Party Representative in connection with the defense
or prosecution of any such Tax Contest, and (z) provide such cooperation and
information as the Seller Party Representative shall reasonably request, and, at
its own costs and expenses, the Seller Party Representative shall have the right
to participate in (but not control) the defense of such Tax Contest (including
participating in any discussions with the applicable Tax Authorities regarding
such Tax Contests).

 

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
procedures for all Tax Contests shall be governed exclusively by this Section
7.5(e) (and not Section 8.4(a)).

 

(f) Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer and the Company shall have the right to deduct and withhold any
required Taxes from any payments to be made hereunder. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been delivered and paid to the applicable recipient of payment in respect of
which such deduction and withholding was made.

 

(g) Adjustments to Purchase Price. The parties hereto agree to treat any amounts
payable after the Closing Date by any Seller Party to Buyer (or by Buyer to any
Seller Party) pursuant to this Agreement as an adjustment to the purchase price
payable hereunder, unless otherwise required by Law or the good faith resolution
of an audit.

 

-29-

 

 



(h) Omitted.

 

(i) Election Pursuant to Section 338 of the Code.

 

(i) At the Buyer’s option, the Company and Seller Parties shall join with the
Buyer in making an election under Code Section 338(h)(10) (and any corresponding
election under state, local and foreign Tax Law) with respect to the purchase
and sale of the Shares hereunder (collectively, a “Code Section 338(h)(10)
Election”). Seller Parties shall include any income, gain, loss, deduction or
other tax item resulting from the Code Section 338(h)(10) Election on their Tax
Returns and the Company’s Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable Law.

 

(ii) In the event that the Code Section 338(h)(10) Election is made in
accordance with the terms herein, the Buyer and the Seller Parties agree that
the Purchase Price payable hereunder and all other capitalizable costs will be
allocated among the assets of the Company for all purposes (including financial
accounting and Tax, to the extent required under the Code) by using the residual
method in a manner consistent Code Sections 1060 and 338 (if applicable) and the
regulations thereunder (the “Allocation”). Consistent with Code Section 1060 and
the regulations thereunder, the Buyer shall prepare the Allocation and shall
submit the Allocation to the Seller Party Representative for review, comment and
approval if the Buyer is contemplating making the Code Section 338(h)(10)
Election. If the Seller Party Representative notifies the Buyer in writing that
the Seller Party Representative is disputing the Allocation within twenty (20)
days following the Seller Party Representative’s receipt of the Allocation, then
the Seller Party Representative and the Buyer shall mutually negotiate the
Allocation in good faith. If the Seller Party Representative fails to notify the
Buyer in writing that the Seller Party Representative is disputing the
Allocation within such twenty (20)-day period, then the Seller Party
Representative and the Seller Parties shall be deemed to have accepted the
Allocation as prepared by the Buyer and such Allocation shall be final, binding
and conclusive on the parties hereto. If the Seller Party Representative
disputes the Allocation in a timely manner as provided in this Section
7.5(i)(ii) and the Seller Party Representative and the Buyer cannot agree on the
Allocation within twenty (20) days following the Buyer’s receipt of the Seller
Party Representative’s written notice of dispute, then either party may submit
the dispute for binding resolution to a nationally or regionally recognized
independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Buyer and the Seller
Party Representative (the “Accounting Firm”). All fees and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent
(50%) by the Seller Parties. If the Code Section 338(h)(10) Election is made,
then the Buyer and the Seller Parties shall file all Tax Returns (including
amended returns and claims for refund) and information reports in a manner
consistent with the Allocation.

 

(j) Survival. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
provisions of this Section 7.5 shall survive for the full period of all
applicable statutes of limitations (giving effect to any waiver, mitigation, or
extension thereof) plus sixty (60) days.

Section 7.6 Conduct of Business Prior to Closing. From the date hereof until the
Closing, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or consented to in
writing by Buyer, the Seller Parties shall, and shall cause the Company to, (x)
conduct the business of the Company in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice; and (y) use reasonable best efforts to maintain

and conditions of this ARTICLE VIII, each Seller Party, jointly and severally,
shall indemnify each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties against, and shall hold
each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, any and all
Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, any of the Buyer Indemnified

Buyer contained in this Agreement or any certificate required hereunder to be
delivered at the Closing by Buyer; or

 

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement, or obligation to
be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement.

 

Section 8.4 Indemnification Procedures.

 

(a) Third Party Claims. If any third party shall notify any party hereto (the
“Indemnified Party”) with respect to any matter (a “Third Party Claim”) which
may give rise to a claim by such Indemnified Party for indemnification against
any other party hereto (the “Indemnifying Party”) under this ARTICLE VIII, the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party (or the Seller Party
Representative in the case of an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 8.2)
prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice
shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
demonstrates that the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend or resolve such
claim is materially and adversely affected thereby. Such written notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe in reasonable detail (based on information then
available to the Indemnified Party) the Third Party Claim and the estimated
amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained
by the Indemnified Party.

 

(b) Direct Claims. If an Indemnified Party has a claim for indemnification
hereunder that does not involve a Third Party Claim (a “Direct Claim”), the
Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party (or the Seller Party
Representative in the case of an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 8.2)
prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice
shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
demonstrates that the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend or resolve such
Direct Claim is materially and adversely affected thereby. Such notice by the
Indemnified Party shall describe in reasonable detail (based on information then
available to the Indemnified Party) the Direct Claim and the estimated amount,
if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party (the “Claimed Amount”). Within thirty (30) days after delivery
of such notice, the Indemnifying Party (or the Seller Party Representative in
the case of an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 8.2) shall deliver to
the Indemnified Party a written response in which the Indemnifying Party (or the
Seller Party Representative in the case of an indemnification claim pursuant to
Section 8.2) shall (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive
all of the Claimed Amount (in which case such response shall be accompanied by a
payment by the Indemnifying Party of the Claimed Amount), (ii) agree that the
Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claimed
Amount (the “Agreed Amount”) (in which case such response shall be accompanied
by payment by the Indemnifying Party of the Agreed Amount), or (iii) in good
faith dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the
Claimed Amount. If the Indemnifying Party (or the Seller Party Representative in
the case of an indemnification claim pursuant to Section 8.2) timely disputes
the payment of all or part of the Claimed Amount, then the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party may assert all rights available to such party
hereunder. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within the applicable
time period set forth above, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
accepted such claim and shall pay the Claimed Amount in full.

 

-33-

 

 

Section 8.5 Exclusive Remedy. Except for (a) the remedies of specific
performance or injunctive or other equitable relief or (b) claims for fraud,
intentional misrepresentation or willful misconduct, the indemnification rights
set forth in this ARTICLE VIII shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy
of the parties hereto for any claim arising out of this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions.

 

Section 8.6 Additional Indemnification Provisions. Each party hereto
acknowledges and agrees that the representations, warranties, covenants, and
agreements in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties
hereto and represent an agreed-upon contractual allocation of risk among the
parties hereto. Each party hereto shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be
deemed to have relied upon, all of the representations, warranties, covenants,
and agreements of each other party hereto set forth herein (as qualified by the
Schedules hereto), and the rights to indemnification and payment of Losses under
this ARTICLE VIII based on a breach of any of the representations, warranties,
covenants, or agreements set forth in this Agreement (as qualified by the
Schedules hereto) shall not be affected by any investigation conducted (or
capable of being conducted) at any time, or any knowledge acquired (or capable
of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto with
respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any such
representations, warranties, covenants, or agreements.

under this Agreement (each, an “Authorized Action”) shall constitute a decision
of each Seller Party and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each Seller
Party, and Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively without inquiry or

or instruction of each Seller Party. Each Seller Party agrees to pay, and to
indemnify and hold harmless, each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and
against any Losses which they may suffer, sustain or become subject to as the
result of any claim by any Person that an Authorized Action is not binding on,
or enforceable against any Seller Party. In addition, each Seller Party hereby
releases and discharges each of the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against
any Losses arising out of or in connection with the Seller Party
Representative’s failure to distribute any amounts received by the Seller Party
Representative on behalf of the Seller Parties to the Seller Parties.

 

(d) The power of attorney granted hereby (i) is coupled with an interest, (ii)
shall survive and not be affected by the subsequent death, incapacity,

expense (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Seller Party
Representative’s attorneys) arising out of or in connection with any act or
failure to act of the Seller Party Representative hereunder, except to the
extent that such loss, liability or expense is finally adjudicated to have been
primarily caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Seller
Party Representative; provided, however, that no Seller Party shall be liable
under this Section 9.13(e) in excess of such Seller Party’s Pro Rata Percentage
of the Purchase Price.

 

(f) The Seller Party Representative may resign upon not less than fifteen (15)
Business Days’ prior written notice to Buyer and the Seller Parties. The Seller
Parties, by the vote of the holders of a majority-in-interest of the Shares
collectively owned by the Seller Parties immediately prior to the Closing, may
remove the Seller Party Representative from time to time upon not less than
fifteen (15) Business Days’ prior written notice to Buyer. Any vacancy in the
position of the Seller Party Representative (whether due to resignation,
removal, or otherwise) shall be filled by another Seller Party approved by the
holders of a majority-in-interest of the Shares collectively owned by the Seller
Parties immediately prior to the Closing, and any such successor Seller Party
Representative shall be subject to the prior written consent of Buyer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. Any
successor Seller Party Representative shall acknowledge in writing to Buyer his,
her, or its acceptance of the appointment as the Seller Party Representative in
accordance with the terms of this Section 9.13.

agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter hereof.
