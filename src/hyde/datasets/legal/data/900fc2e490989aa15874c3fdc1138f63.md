prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available
on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section 2.04 and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the
applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable
Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith upon written demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon,
for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules
on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
otherwise applicable to such Borrowing. If such Lender pays such amount to the
Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Term Loan
included in such Borrowing.



Section 2.05. Interest Elections. (a) The Borrower may elect from time to time
to (i) convert ABR Term Loans to Eurodollar Term Loans, (ii) convert Eurodollar
Term Loans to ABR Term Loans, provided that any such conversion of Eurodollar
Term Loans may only be made on the last day of an Interest Period with respect
thereto or (iii) continue any Eurodollar Term Loan as such upon the expiration
of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto.
(b) To make an Interest Election Request pursuant to this Section 2.05, the
Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone (i)
in the case of a conversion of ABR Term Loans to Eurodollar Term Loans under
Section 2.05(a)(i), not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, three (3)
Business Days (or, with respect to the initial Borrowing of Closing Date Term
Loans, two (2) Business Days) prior to the date of the requested conversion,
(ii) in the case of a continuation of Eurodollar Term Loans under Section
2.05(a)(iii), not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, three (3) Business
Days prior to the expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect
thereto and (iii) in the case of a conversion of Eurodollar Term Loans to ABR
Term Loans under Section 2.05(a)(ii), not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City
time, on the expiration date of the then current Interest Period with respect
thereto. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and
shall be
25
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a
written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent
and signed by the Borrower.
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the
following information in compliance with Section 2.01:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if
different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof,
the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case
the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall
be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election
Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar
Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period
to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a
period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with
respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at
the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, and upon the request of the Required Lenders,
(i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar
Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted
to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.



Section 2.06. Limitation on Eurodollar Tranches. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and continuations of
Eurodollar Term Loans and all selections of Interest Periods shall be in such
amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, (a) after giving effect
thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurodollar Term Loans comprising
each Eurodollar Tranche shall be equal to $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) no more than ten (10) Eurodollar Tranches
shall be outstanding at any one time.



Section 2.07. Interest on Term Loans.
(a) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, each ABR Term Loan shall bear
interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year
of three hundred sixty (360) days or, when the Alternate Base Rate is based on
the Prime Rate, a year with three hundred sixty-five (365) days or three hundred
sixty-six (366) days in a leap year) at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate
Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.
26
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(b) Subject to the provisions of Section 2.08, each Eurodollar Term Loan shall
bear interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a
year of three hundred sixty (360) days) at a rate per annum equal, during each
Interest Period applicable thereto, to the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period in
effect for such Borrowing plus the Applicable Margin.
(c) Accrued interest on all Term Loans shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date applicable thereto, on the Termination Date with respect
to such Term Loans and thereafter on written demand and (with respect to
Eurodollar Term Loans) upon any repayment or prepayment thereof (on the amount
repaid or prepaid); provided that in the event of any conversion of any
Eurodollar Term Loan to an ABR Term Loan, accrued interest on such Term Loan
shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.



Section 2.08. Default Interest. If the Borrower shall default in the payment of
the principal of or interest on any Term Loan or in the payment of any fee
becoming due hereunder, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise, the Borrower shall on written demand of the Administrative Agent
(which written demand shall be given at the request of the Required Lenders)
from time to time pay interest, to the extent permitted by law, on all overdue
amounts up to (but not including) the date of actual payment (after as well as
before judgment) at a rate per annum (computed on the basis of the actual number
of days elapsed over a year of three hundred sixty (360) days or, when the
Alternate Base Rate is applicable and is based on the Prime Rate, a year of
three hundred sixty-five (365) days or three hundred sixty-six (366) days in a
leap year) equal to (a) with respect to the principal amount of any Term Loan,
the rate then applicable for such Borrowings plus 2.0%, and (b) with respect to
interest and fees, the rate applicable for ABR Term Loans plus 2.0%.



Section 2.09. Alternate Rate of Interest.
(a) In the event, and on each occasion, that on the date that is two (2)
Business Days prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar
Term Loan, the Administrative Agent shall have reasonably determined (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower absent manifest
error) that reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable LIBO
Rate (including because the LIBO Screen Rate is not available or published on a
current basis), the Administrative Agent shall, as soon as practicable
thereafter, give written, facsimile or telegraphic notice of such determination
to the Borrower and the Lenders and, until the circumstances giving rise to such
notice no longer exist, any request by the Borrower for a Borrowing of
Eurodollar Term Loans hereunder (including pursuant to a refinancing with
Eurodollar Term Loans and including any request to continue, or to convert to,
Eurodollar Term Loans) shall be deemed a request for a Borrowing of ABR Term
Loans.
(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the Administrative Agent
determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that
(i) the circumstances set forth in this Section 2.09 have arisen and such
circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or (ii) the circumstances set forth
in this Section 2.09 have not arisen but the supervisor for the administrator of
the LIBO Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date
after which the LIBO Screen Rate shall no longer be used for determining
interest rates for loans, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall
endeavor to establish an alternate rate of interest to the LIBO Rate that gives
due consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a
rate of interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time, and
shall enter into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate
of interest and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be
applicable; provided that, if such alternate rate of interest as so determined
would be less than zero, such rate shall be deemed to be zero for the purposes
of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.08,
such amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of
any Lender so long as the Administrative
27
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Agent shall not have received, within five Business Days of the date notice of
such alternate rate of interest is provided to the Lenders, a written notice
from the Required Lenders stating that such Required Lenders object to such
amendment. Until an alternate rate of interest shall be determined in accordance
with this clause (b) (but, in the case of the circumstances described in clause
(ii) of the first sentence of this Section 2.09(b), only to the extent the LIBO
Screen Rate for such Interest Period is not available or published at such time
on a current basis), any request by the Borrower for a Borrowing of Eurodollar
Term Loans hereunder (including pursuant to a refinancing with Eurodollar Term
Loans and including any request to continue, or to convert to, Eurodollar Term
Loans) shall be deemed a request for a Borrowing of ABR Term Loans.



Section 2.10. Repayment of Term Loans; Evidence of Debt.
(a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the Administrative
Agent for the ratable account of each Lender the then unpaid principal amount of
each Term Loan then outstanding on the Termination Date.
(b) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account
or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting
from each Term Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and
interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record
(i) the amount of each Term Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the
Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest
due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender
hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent
hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof. The
Borrower shall have the right, upon reasonable notice, to request information
regarding the accounts referred to in the preceding sentence.
(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c)
of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of
the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in
any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Term Loans in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(e) Any Lender may request that Term Loans made by it be evidenced by a
promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver
to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) in a form
furnished by the Administrative Agent and reasonably acceptable to the Borrower.
Thereafter, the Term Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest
thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section
10.02) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to
the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a
registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns).



Section 2.11. Optional Termination or Reduction of Delayed Draw Commitments.
(a) Upon at least one (1) Business Day’s prior written notice to the
Administrative Agent, the Borrower may at any time in whole permanently
terminate, or from time to time in part permanently reduce, the unused Delayed
Draw Term Loan Commitments; provided that each such notice shall be revocable to
the extent such termination or reduction would have resulted from a refinancing
of the Obligations, which refinancing shall not be consummated or shall
otherwise be delayed. Each such reduction of the unused Delayed Draw Term Loan
Commitments shall be in the principal amount not less
28
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



than $5,000,000 and in an integral multiple of $1,000,000. Any reduction of the
Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be applied
on a pro rata basis.



Section 2.12. Mandatory Prepayment of Term Loans.
(a) The Borrower shall prepay the Term Loans in an amount necessary to comply
with Section 6.03, in each case as directed by the Borrower.
(b) All prepayments under this Section 2.12 shall be accompanied by accrued but
unpaid interest on the principal amount being prepaid to (but not including) the
date of prepayment, plus Fees and any losses, costs and expenses, as more fully
described in Sections 2.15 and 2.19 hereof.



Section 2.13. Optional Prepayment of Term Loans.
(a) The Borrower shall have the right, at any time and from time to time, to
prepay any Term Loans, in whole or in part, (i) with respect to Eurodollar Term
Loans, upon (A) telephonic notice followed promptly by written or facsimile
notice or (B) written or facsimile notice received by 1:00 p.m., New York City
time, three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed date of prepayment and (ii)
with respect to ABR Term Loans, upon written or facsimile notice received by
1:00 p.m., New York City time, one (1) Business Day prior to the proposed date
of prepayment; provided that ABR Term Loans may be prepaid on the same day
notice is given if such notice is received by the Administrative Agent by 12:00
noon, New York City time; provided further, however, that (A) each such partial
prepayment shall be in an amount not less than $5,000,000 and in integral
multiples of $1,000,000, (B) no prepayment of Eurodollar Term Loans shall be
permitted pursuant to this Section 2.13(a) other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto unless such prepayment is accompanied by the
payment of the amounts described in Section 2.15, and (C) no partial prepayment
of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Term Loans shall result in the aggregate principal
amount of the Eurodollar Term Loans remaining outstanding pursuant to such
Borrowing being less than $5,000,000.
(b) All prepayments under Section 2.13(a) shall be accompanied by accrued but
unpaid interest on the principal amount being prepaid to (but not including) the
date of prepayment, plus any Fees and any losses, costs and expenses, as more
fully described in Sections 2.15 and 2.19 hereof.
(c) Each notice of prepayment shall specify the prepayment date, the principal
amount of the Term Loans to be prepaid and, in the case of Eurodollar Term
Loans, the Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which made, shall be irrevocable
and shall commit the Borrower to prepay such Term Loan by the amount and on the
date stated therein; provided that the Borrower may revoke any notice of
prepayment under this Section 2.13 if such prepayment would have resulted from a
refinancing of any or all of the Obligations hereunder, which refinancing shall
not be consummated or shall otherwise be delayed. The Administrative Agent
shall, promptly after receiving notice from the Borrower hereunder, notify each
Lender of the principal amount of the Term Loans held by such Lender which are
to be prepaid, the prepayment date and the manner of application of the
prepayment.



Section 2.14. Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall:
(i) subject any Lender to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes or (B)
Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or
other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital
attributable thereto; or
29
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(ii) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar
requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit
extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement subject to Section
2.14(c)); or
(iii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition
(other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Term Loans made by
such Lender; and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the
cost to such Lender of converting any ABR Term Loan to a Eurodollar Term Loan or
making, maintaining or continuing any Eurodollar Term Loan (or of maintaining
its obligation to make any such Term Loan) or to reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest
or otherwise), then the Borrower will pay to such Lender, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or
reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender reasonably determines in good faith that any Change in Law
regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such
Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Term
Loans made by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such
Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking
into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s
holding company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time
to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts,
in each case as documented by such Lender to the Borrower as will compensate
such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered; it
being understood that to the extent duplicative of the provisions in Section
2.16, this Section 2.14(b) shall not apply to Taxes.
(c) The Borrower shall pay to each Lender (i) as long as such Lender shall be
required to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting
of or including Eurodollar funds or deposits, additional interest on the unpaid
principal amount of each Eurodollar Term Loan equal to the actual costs of such
reserves allocated to such Term Loan by such Lender (as determined by such
Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error) and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with
any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other central
banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the funding of
the Eurodollar Term Loans, such additional costs (expressed as a percentage per
annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five decimal places)
equal to the actual costs allocated to such Term Loan by such Lender (as
determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive
absent manifest error) which in each case shall be due and payable on each date
on which interest is payable on such Term Loan, provided the Borrower shall have
received at least fifteen (15) days’ prior notice (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent, and which notice shall specify the Statutory Reserve Rate,
if any, applicable to such Lender) of such additional interest or cost from such
Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice fifteen (15) days prior to the relevant
Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or cost shall be due and payable
fifteen (15) days from receipt of such notice.
(d) A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified
in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 2.14 shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within fifteen (15)
days after receipt thereof.
(e) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant
to this Section 2.14 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to
demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14 for
30
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



any increased costs or reductions incurred more than one hundred eighty (180)
days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in
Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s
intention to claim compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change
in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then
the one hundred eighty (180) day period referred to above shall be extended to
include the period of retroactive effect thereof. The protection of this Section
2.14 shall be available to each Lender regardless of any possible contention as
to the invalidity or inapplicability of the law, rule, regulation, guideline or
other change or condition which shall have occurred or been imposed.
(f) Any determination by a Lender of amounts owed pursuant to this Section 2.14
to such Lender due to any Change in Law, pursuant to the proviso in the
definition thereof shall be made in good faith in a manner generally consistent
with such Lender’s standard practice.



Section 2.15. Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of any
principal of any Eurodollar Term Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of the occurrence and
continuance of an Event of Default), (b) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Eurodollar Term Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) the assignment of any Eurodollar Term Loan
other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result
of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.18 or Section 10.08(d), then,
in any such event, at the request of such Lender, the Borrower shall compensate
such Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. Such
loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount
reasonably determined in good faith by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of
(i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of
such Term Loan had such event not occurred, at the applicable rate of interest
for such Term Loan (excluding, however the Applicable Margin included therein,
if any), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then
current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow,
convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for
such Term Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such
principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would
bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a
comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A
certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be delivered to the
Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within fifteen (15)
days after receipt thereof.



Section 2.16. Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any Obligation
of the Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made free
and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes;
provided that if any Indemnified Tax or Other Taxes are required to be withheld
from any amounts payable to a Recipient, as determined in good faith by the
applicable Withholding Agent, then (i) the sum payable by the Borrower shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.16), such
Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the applicable Withholding Agent shall make such
deductions and (iii) the applicable Withholding Agent shall timely pay the full
amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable law.


(b) In addition (and without duplication of any payments with respect to Other
Taxes pursuant to Section 2.16(a)), the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
31
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(c) The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient within thirty (30) days after
written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes paid by or on behalf of such Recipient on or with respect to any payment
by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other
Loan Document (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on
or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.16) and any penalties,
interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. After a Recipient
learns of the imposition of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, such party will
act in good faith to notify the Borrower promptly of its obligations thereunder.
A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the
Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section 2.16, the
Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified
copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment
to the extent available, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten
(10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Taxes attributable to such Lender
(but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the
Administrative Agent for such Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the
Borrower to do so) and (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to
comply with the provisions of Section 10.02(d) relating to the maintenance of a
Participant Register, in either case, that are payable or paid by the
Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes
were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered
to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest
error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and
apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan
Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any
other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this
paragraph (e).
(f) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding
tax with respect to payments under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
shall deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the
time or times prescribed by applicable law or as reasonably requested by the
Borrower, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by
applicable law or requested by the Borrower as will (i) enable the Borrower to
determine whether such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information
reporting requirements, and (ii) permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate; provided that a Foreign Lender shall not be
required to deliver any documentation pursuant to this Section 2.16(f) that such
Foreign Lender is not legally able to deliver.
(g) (1) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.16(f),
         (i) any Lender that is a U.S. Person (as such term is defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent (and
the Borrower at its request) on or prior to the date on which such Lender
becomes a party under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter when the
previously delivered certificates and/or forms expire, or upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such
Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
32
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



         (ii) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to
do so, deliver to the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be
requested by the recipient) (and the Borrower at its request) on or prior to the
date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a party under this Agreement (and from
time to time thereafter when the previously delivered certificates and/or forms
expire, or upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax
treaty to which the United States is a party, executed copies of Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable;
(2) executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI;
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for
portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate
substantially in the Form of Exhibit C-1 to the effect that (i) such Foreign
Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of
section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, and (C) a “controlled foreign corporation”
described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code, and (ii) the interest payments in
question are not effectively connected with the United States trade or business
conducted by such Lender (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) duly
completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as
applicable;
(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (for example,
where the Foreign Lender is a partnership or participating bank granting a
typical participation), an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY, accompanied by
a Form W-8ECI, W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit C-2 or C-3 (as applicable), Form W-9,
and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;
provided that, if the Foreign Lender is a partnership (and not a participating
bank) and one or more beneficial owners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the
portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit C-4 on behalf of
each such beneficial owner; or
(5) any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming
exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax duly completed
together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by
applicable law to permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction
required to be made.
If the Administrative Agent is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document, the
Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, on or prior to the date on
which it becomes the Administrative Agent (and from time to time thereafter when
the previously delivered forms expire, or upon the reasonable request of the
Borrower), such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by
applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower as will permit such
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.
The Administrative Agent and each Lender agrees that if any form or
certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate
in any respect, it shall update such form or
33
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in
writing of its legal inability to do so.
(2) If a payment made to a Lender under this Agreement or any Loan Document
would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender
were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA
(including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as
applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such
documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section
1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to comply with its obligations under
FATCA, to determine that such Lender has or has not complied with such Lender's
obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from
such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (2), “FATCA” shall include any
amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(h) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion
exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which
it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower
has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it shall pay over an
amount equal to such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity
payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section
2.16 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender incurred in
obtaining such refund (including Taxes imposed with respect to such refund) and
without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund); provided that the Borrower, upon the
request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount
paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed
by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such
Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay
such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this paragraph (h), in no event will the Administrative Agent or any
Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph
(h) if, and then only to the extent, the payment of such amount would place the
Administrative Agent or Lender in a less favorable net after-Tax position than
the Administrative Agent or Lender would have been in if the indemnification
payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.
This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any
Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to
its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.



Section 2.17. Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment.


(a) The Borrower shall make each payment or prepayment required to be made by it
hereunder (whether of principal, interest, or fees or of amounts payable under
Section 2.14 or 2.15, or otherwise) prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on
the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or
counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the
reasonable discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been
received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating
interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at
its offices at 383 Madison Avenue, New York, New York, pursuant to wire
instructions to be provided by the Administrative Agent, except that payments
pursuant to Sections 2.14, 2.15 and 10.04 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments
received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient
promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a
day that is not a Business Day, the
34
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in
the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for
the period of such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in the
applicable currency.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the
Administrative Agent to pay fully all Obligations then due hereunder, such funds
shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of Fees and expenses then due under
Sections 2.19 and 10.04 payable to the Administrative Agent, (ii) second,
towards payment of Fees and expenses then due under Sections 2.19 and 10.04
payable to the Arrangers and the Lenders and towards payment of interest then
due on account of the Term Loans, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of such Fees and expenses and interest then due to
such parties and (iii) third, towards payment of principal of the Term Loans
then due hereunder ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with
the amounts of principal then due to such parties.
(c) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such
payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such
payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the
Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally
agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so
distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of
payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the NYFRB Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules
on interbank compensation.
(d) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it
pursuant to Section 2.04(a), 8.04 or 10.04(c), then the Administrative Agent
may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply
any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of
such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all
such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
(e) Pro Rata Treatment. (i) Each payment by the Borrower of interest in respect
of the Term Loans shall be applied to the amounts of such obligations owing to
the Lenders pro rata according to the respective amounts then due and owing to
the Lenders.
(ii) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on account of
principal of and interest on the Term Loans shall be made pro rata according to
the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Term Loans then held by the
Lenders (except that any prepayment of Term Loans with the proceeds of
Refinancing Debt shall be applied solely to each applicable tranche of the
Indebtedness being refinanced). Amounts prepaid on account of the Term Loans may
not be reborrowed.



Section 2.18. Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders. (a) If the
Borrower is required to pay any additional amount or indemnification payment to
any Lender under Section 2.14 or to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for
the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16, then such Lender shall use
reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or
booking its Term Loans hereunder, to assign its rights and obligations hereunder
to another of its offices, branches or affiliates or to file any certificate or
document reasonably requested by the Borrower, if, in the judgment of such
Lender, such designation, assignment or filing (i) would eliminate or reduce
amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.14 or 2.16, as the case may be, in the
future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or
expense (other than immaterial costs and expenses) and would not otherwise be
materially disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all
reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.
35
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(b) If, after the date hereof, any Lender requests compensation under Section
2.14 or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender
or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section
2.16, or becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense
and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require
such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and
subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.02), all its interests,
rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume
such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment); provided that (i) such Lender shall have received payment of an
amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Term Loans, accrued interest
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts due, owing and payable to it
hereunder at such time, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding
principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all
other amounts) and (ii) in the case of payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 2.16, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and
delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or
otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment
and delegation cease to apply.
(c) Each party hereto agrees that (a) an assignment required pursuant to this
Section 2.18 may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance executed
by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and (b) the Lender
required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such
assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound
by the terms thereof; provided that, following the effectiveness of any such
assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver
such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by
the applicable Lender; provided, further that any such documents shall be
without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.



Section 2.19. Certain Fees.
(a) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent the fee set forth in that
certain Administrative Agent Fee Letter dated as of March 17, 2020 between the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower at the time set forth therein in
immediately available funds.
(b) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each
Lender holding outstanding Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitments, a commitment fee
(the “Delayed Draw Commitment Fee”) equal to (A) the average daily unused amount
of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitments of such Lender times (B) 0.15% per
annum. All fees referred to in this Section 2.19(b) shall be calculated on the
basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed and payable
quarterly in arrears on March 31, 2020, on June 30, 2020 and on the Delayed Draw
Commitment Termination Date of the applicable Delayed Draw Term Loan
Commitments.
(c) The Borrower shall pay on the Closing Date to each Lender, as compensation
for providing the Closing Date Term Loans and the Delayed Draw Term Loan
Commitments, an upfront fee (the “Upfront Fees”) in an amount equal to 0.50% of
the sum of such Lender’s (x) Closing Date Term Loans actually funded on the
Closing Date and (y) Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitments as of the Closing Date.
The Upfront Fees shall be in all respects fully earned, due and payable on the
Closing Date and non-refundable and non-creditable thereafter.
(d) All Fees shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to
the Administrative Agent as provided herein and in the Administrative Agent Fee
Letter. Once paid, none of the Fees shall be refundable under any circumstances.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Section 2.20. Right of Set-Off. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Event of Default pursuant to Section 7.01(b), the Administrative Agent
and each Lender (and their respective banking Affiliates) is hereby authorized
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final but excluding deposits in the Escrow Accounts, Payroll
Accounts and other accounts, in each case, held in trust for an identified
beneficiary) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by the
Administrative Agent and each such Lender (or any of such banking Affiliates) to
or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of any such
overdue amounts owing to such Lender (or any of such banking Affiliates) or the
Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not
the Administrative Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand under any
Loan Document; provided that each Lender agrees promptly to notify the
Administrative Agent after any such set off and application made by such Lender;
provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of
such setoff and application; provided, further, that in the event that any
Defaulting Lender exercises any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off
will be paid over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further
application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.22(b) and, pending
such payment, will be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds
and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders and (y) the Defaulting Lender will provide promptly to the
Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations
owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.
Each Lender and the Administrative Agent agree promptly to notify the Borrower
after any such set-off and application made by such Lender or the Administrative
Agent (or any of such banking Affiliates), as the case may be, provided that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and
application. The rights of each Lender and the Administrative Agent under this
Section 2.20 are in addition to other rights and remedies which such Lender and
the Administrative Agent may have upon the occurrence and during the continuance
of any Event of Default.



Section 2.21. Payment of Obligations. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01,
upon the maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) of any of the
Obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents of the
Borrower, the Lenders shall be entitled to immediate payment of such
Obligations.



Section 2.22. Defaulting Lenders(a) . (a) Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, no Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fees
accruing pursuant to Section 2.19 during the period that such Lender is a
Defaulting Lender (without prejudice to the rights of the Non-Defaulting Lenders
in respect of such fees).
(b)  Any amount paid by the Borrower or otherwise received by the Administrative
Agent for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to the Term Loan
Facility under this Agreement (whether on account of principal, interest, fees,
indemnity payments or other amounts) will not be paid or distributed to such
Defaulting Lender, but shall instead be retained by the Administrative Agent in
a Escrow Account until the termination of the Facility and payment in full of
all obligations of the Borrower hereunder and will be applied by the
Administrative Agent, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the making of
payments from time to time in the following order of priority: First to the
payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative
Agent, second to the payment of the default interest and then current interest
due and payable to the Lenders which are Non-Defaulting Lenders, ratably among
them in accordance with the amounts of such interest then due and payable to
them, third to the payment of fees then due and payable to the Non-Defaulting
Lenders, ratably among them in accordance with the amounts of such fees then due
and payable to them, fourth to the ratable payment of other amounts then due and
payable to the Non-Defaulting Lenders and fifth after the termination of the
Facility and payment in full of all obligations of the Borrower, to pay amounts
owing
37
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



under this Agreement to such Defaulting Lender or as a court of competent
jurisdiction may otherwise direct.
(c) If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender
that is a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting
Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the Lenders, whereupon as of the
effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth
therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any amounts then held in
the Escrow Account), such Lender shall purchase at par such portions of
outstanding Term Loans of the other Lenders, and/or make such other adjustments,
as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Lenders
to hold Term Loans on a pro rata basis in accordance with their respective
applicable Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitments and/or Closing Date Term Loan
Commitments, whereupon such Lender shall cease to be a Defaulting Lender and
will be a Non-Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments shall be made
retroactively with respect to fees accrued while such Lender was a Defaulting
Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly
agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to
Non-Defaulting Lender shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any
party hereunder arising from such Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.



Section 2.23. Incremental Term Loans.
(a) Borrower Request. The Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative
Agent from time to time, request an increase to the existing Term Loan Facility
(the commitments thereunder, the “Incremental Commitments”) in an amount not
less than $50,000,000 individually and not to exceed the applicable Incremental
Amount from one or more Incremental Lenders (which may include any existing
Lender) willing to provide such Incremental Commitments in their sole
discretion; provided that each Incremental Lender (which is not an existing
Lender) shall be subject to the approval requirements of Section 10.02. Each
such notice shall specify (i) the date (each, an “Increase Effective Date”) on
which the Borrower proposes that the proposed Incremental Commitments shall be
effective, which shall be a date not less than ten (10) Business Days after the
date on which such notice is delivered to the Administrative Agent and (ii) the
identity of each Eligible Assignee to whom the Borrower proposes any portion of
such Incremental Commitments be allocated and the amounts of such allocations
(each provider of the Incremental Commitments referred to herein as an
“Incremental Lender”); provided that any existing Lender approached to provide
all or a portion of the proposed Incremental Commitments may elect or decline,
in its sole discretion, to provide such Incremental Commitment.
(b) Conditions. Any Incremental Commitments shall become effective as of the
applicable Increase Effective Date; provided that:
(i) all representations and warranties contained in this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of
such Increase Effective Date (both before and after giving effect thereto and,
in the case of each Borrowing of Term Loans pursuant to Incremental Commitments,
the application of proceeds therefrom) with the same effect as if made on and as
of such date except to the extent such representations and warranties expressly
relate to an earlier date and in such case, such representations and warranties
shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such date; provided
that any representation or warranty that is qualified by materiality, “Material
Adverse Change” or “Material Adverse Effect” shall be true and correct in all
respects, as though made on and as of the applicable date, before and after
giving effect to such Borrowing of Term Loans;
(ii) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or
would result from the Borrowings to be made on such Increase Effective Date;
provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that no Default or Event of Default in
respect of Section 6.03 shall have occurred and be
38
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



continuing nor result from the making of such Borrowing on and as of the
applicable Increase Effective Date, without giving effect to any Asset Coverage
Ratio Cure Period;
(iii) after giving effect to the incurrence of such Incremental Commitments, the
Aggregate Exposure with respect to all Lenders shall not exceed $4,000,000,000;
and
(iv) the Borrower shall have duly executed and delivered to the Administrative
Agent a Short Form Mortgage granting first priority Liens and security interests
in any additional Pool Assets required to maintain compliance with Section 6.03
(subject to Liens permitted under Section 6.01(a)) in favor of the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders, and shall have caused such
Short Form Mortgage to be filed with the FAA in order to perfect the Liens on
such additional Pool Assets, and a stamped version thereof will be provided to
the Administrative Agent and no later than 2 business days after the applicable
Increase Effective Date (or such longer period that is reasonably acceptable to
the Administrative Agent) the Borrower shall register the International Interest
in connection with the applicable Short Form Mortgage with the International
Registry.
(c) Terms of Incremental Commitments. The terms and provisions of Term Loans
made pursuant to the Incremental Commitments shall be identical to the existing
Term Loans. For the avoidance of doubt, Term Loans made in respect of
Incremental Commitments made in reliance on this Section 2.23 are intended to be
fully fungible with the Closing Date Term Loans and any Delayed Draw Term Loans.
Prior to any funding of Term Loans pursuant to Incremental Commitments, the
Administrative Agent shall have received a Borrowing Request pursuant to Section
2.03 with respect to such Borrowing.
The Incremental Commitments shall be effected by a joinder agreement (the
“Increase Joinder”) executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each
Incremental Lender making such Incremental Commitment, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to each of them. The Increase Joinder may, without the
consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the opinion of the
Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.23. In
addition, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all references in Loan
Documents to Term Loans shall be deemed, unless the context otherwise requires,
to include references to Term Loans made pursuant to Incremental Commitments
made pursuant to this Agreement.



Section 3.
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
In order to induce the Lenders to make Term Loans hereunder, the Borrower
represents and warrants as follows:



Section 3.01. Organization and Authority. (a) The Borrower and each of its
Material Subsidiaries are duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of their organization and are duly qualified
and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify
would have a Material Adverse Effect, (b) the Borrower has the requisite
corporate or limited liability company power and authority to effect the
Transactions, and (c) the Borrower and each of its Material Subsidiaries have
all requisite power and authority and the legal right to own or lease and
operate their properties, and to conduct their business as now or currently
proposed to be conducted. On the Closing Date, the Borrower has no Material

States” as defined in Section 40102(a)(15) of Title 49 and as that statutory
provision has been interpreted by the DOT pursuant to its policies (a “United
States Citizen”). The Borrower possesses all necessary certificates, franchises,
licenses, permits, rights, designations, authorizations, exemptions,
concessions, frequencies and consents which relate to the operation of the
routes flown by it and the conduct of its business and operations as currently
conducted except where failure to so possess would not, in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.03. Due Execution. The execution, delivery and performance by the
Borrower of each of the Loan Documents to which it is a party (a) are within its
corporate powers, have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action,
including the consent of shareholders where required, and do not (i) contravene
the charter or by-laws of the Borrower, (ii) violate any applicable law
(including, without limitation, the Exchange Act) or regulation (including,
without limitation, Regulations T, U or X of the Board), or any order or decree
of any court or Governmental Authority, other than violations by the Borrower
which would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or
(iii) conflict with or result in a breach of, constitute a default under, or
create an adverse liability or rights under, any material indenture, mortgage or
deed of trust or any material lease, agreement or other instrument binding on
the Borrower or any of its properties, which, in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and (b) do not require the
consent, authorization by or approval of or notice to or filing or registration
with any Governmental Authority or any other Person, other than (i) approvals,
consents and exemptions that have been obtained on or prior to the Closing Date
and remain in full force and effect and (ii) consents, approvals and exemptions
that the failure to obtain in the aggregate would not be reasonably expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each Loan Document has been duly executed
and delivered by the Borrower. This Agreement is, and each of the other Loan
Documents to which the Borrower is or will be a party, when delivered hereunder
or thereunder, will be, a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Borrower,
enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and subject to general principles of
equity, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.



Section 3.04. Financial Statements; Material Adverse Change.
(a) The Borrower has furnished to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the
Lenders copies of the audited consolidated financial statements of the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, reported on by
Ernst & Young LLP. Such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, in accordance with GAAP, the financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated
basis as of the date thereof and for the period covered thereby (subject to
normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of footnotes in the case of
the unaudited financial statements). Documents required to be delivered pursuant
to this Section 3.04(a) which are made available via EDGAR, or any successor
system of the SEC, in the Borrower’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, shall be deemed
delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders on the date such documents
are made so available.
(b) Except as disclosed in (i) the Borrower’s current report on Form 8-K, dated
March 10, 2020, and (ii) the Borrower’s current report on Form 8-K, dated March
13, 2020 (in each case, including exhibits and other information incorporated by
reference therein, but excluding any disclosures included therein to the extent
they are predictive or forward-looking in nature), since December 31, 2019,
there has been no Material Adverse Change.

working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries (including the repayment of Indebtedness and the payment of fees
and transaction costs as contemplated hereby and as referred to in Section
2.19), and no part of the proceeds of any Term Loan will be used for any purpose
which would violate, or be inconsistent with, any of the margin regulations of
the Board.



Section 3.06. Litigation and Compliance with Laws.
(a) There are no actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, to
the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against or affecting the Borrower or
any of its properties (including any Pool Assets), before any court or
governmental department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality,
domestic or foreign, (i) that are likely to have a Material Adverse Effect or

validity, binding effect or enforceability of the Loan Documents or, in any
material respect, the rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders thereunder or in connection with the Transactions.
(b) Except with respect to any matters that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect, (i) the
Borrower and each of its Material Subsidiaries are currently in compliance with
all applicable statutes, regulations and orders of, and all applicable
restrictions imposed by, all Governmental Authorities in respect of the conduct
of their business and ownership of their property (including compliance with all
applicable Environmental Laws governing their business), and (ii) none of the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries has (x) become subject to any Environmental
Liability, or (y) received written notice of any pending or, to the knowledge of
the Borrower, threatened claim with respect to any Environmental Liability.



Section 3.07. Investment Company Act. The Borrower is not, and is not required
to be, registered as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended.



Section 3.08. ERISA. No Termination Event has occurred or is reasonably expected
to occur that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.09. Title to Pool Assets(a) . The Borrower and each of its Material
Subsidiaries own all of the Pool Assets which are owned or used in connection
with their business, except to the extent that such failure would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.



Section 3.10. Payment of Taxes. Each of the Borrower and its Material
Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be filed all Tax returns and reports
required to have been filed and has paid or caused to be paid when due all Taxes
required to have been paid by it, except and solely to the extent that, in each
case (a) such Taxes are being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
and the Borrower or such Material Subsidiary, as applicable, has set aside on
its books adequate reserves therefor in accordance with GAAP or (b) the failure
to do so would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.11. Economic Sanctions.
(a) Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of
the Borrower, any director, officer or employee of the Borrower or such

permitted hereunder, in its reasonable business judgment, keep and maintain, and
cause each of its Material Subsidiaries to keep and maintain, all property
material to the conduct of its business in good working order and condition

time cause to be delivered subsequent Appraisal Reports if it believes that any
affected Pool Asset has a higher Appraised Value than that reflected in the most
recent Appraisal Report delivered.
(b) (i) No later than 14 days after the Closing Date (or such longer period that

Company shall succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right
and power of, the Borrower under this Agreement with the same effect as if such
Successor Company had been named as the Borrower herein. No such consolidation
or merger shall have the effect of releasing the Borrower or any Successor

the remaining Pool Assets (as determined by an Appraisal Report of all Pool
Assets performed at (or relatively contemporaneously with) the time of such
removal) shall satisfy the Asset Coverage Test, and (y) prior to effecting the
removal, the Borrower shall have delivered an Officer’s Certificate to the
Administrative Agent certifying that, and providing calculations demonstrating
that, after giving effect to such removal, the Appraised Value of the Pool
Assets shall satisfy the Asset Coverage Test, and otherwise certifying
compliance with this Section 6.05 and attaching to such certificate Appraisal
Report of all Pool Assets obtained in connection with such removal.

that if any such failure, breach or default shall be waived or cured (as

ordering any of the foregoing shall be entered; or

be valid and binding on the Borrower, or the Borrower shall so assert in any
pleading filed in any court; or
(k) any final judgment in excess of $200,000,000 (exclusive of any judgment or

52
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(l) any Termination Event that could reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred;
then, and in every such event and at any time thereafter during the continuance

actions, at the same or different times: (i) terminate forthwith the Delayed
Draw Term Loan Commitments; (ii) declare the Term Loans or any portion thereof

and under any other Loan Document, shall become forthwith due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or any other notice of any kind, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrower, anything contained herein or
in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding; and (iii) exercise
any and all remedies under the Loan Documents and under applicable law available
to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders. In case of any event with respect

automatically, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind,
all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower. Any payment received as a result
of the exercise of remedies hereunder shall be applied in accordance with
Section 2.17(b).

Section 8.
THE AGENTS



Section 8.01. Administration by Agents. (a) Each of the Lenders hereby
irrevocably appoints JPMCB to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together
with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
(b) It is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” herein or in
any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the
Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied
(or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law.
Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to
create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting
parties.



Section 8.02. Rights of Administrative Agent. Any institution serving as the
Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its
capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not the Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall,
unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires,
include the institution serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its
individual capacity. Such institution and its Affiliates may accept deposits
from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any
other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with
the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such institution
were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account
therefor to the Lenders.



Section 8.03. Liability of the Administrative Agent.
(a) The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except
those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties
hereunder and thereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) the Administrative Agent
53
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of
whether an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, (ii) the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or
exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the
Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be
necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.08 or in the other
Loan Documents) and (iii) except as expressly set forth herein and in the other
Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose,
and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates that is communicated to or
obtained by the institution serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its
Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be
necessary, or as the Administrative Agent will believe in good faith shall be
necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.08 and the final
paragraph of Article 7) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have
knowledge of any Event of Default unless and until written notice thereof is
given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for, or have any duty to ascertain
or inquire into, (A) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (B) the contents of
any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or
in connection herewith or therewith, (C) the performance or observance of any of
the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or
therein or the occurrence of any Event of Default, (D) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (E) the satisfaction
of any condition set forth in Section 4 or elsewhere herein, other than to
confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent, and (iv) the Administrative Agent will not be required to
take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose
the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document
or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt, any action that may be
in violation of the automatic stay under any Federal, state or foreign
bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect
or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a
Defaulting Lender in violation of any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy,
insolvency, or similar law now or hereafter in effect.
(b) The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur
any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic
message, internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by
it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the
proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to
it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper
Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The
Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the
Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall
not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the
advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
(c) The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise
its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through
any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all of its
duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their respective Related
Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to
any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and
any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection
with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as
activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for the
54
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of
competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the
Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the
selection of such sub-agents.



Section 8.04. Reimbursement and Indemnification. Each Lender agrees (a) to
reimburse on demand the Administrative Agent for such Lender’s Aggregate
Exposure Percentage of any expenses and fees incurred for the benefit of the
Lenders under this Agreement and any of the Loan Documents, including, without
limitation, counsel fees and compensation of agents and employees paid for
services rendered on behalf of the Lenders, and any other expense incurred in
connection with the operations or enforcement thereof, not reimbursed by the
Borrower and (b) to indemnify and hold harmless the Administrative Agent and any
of its Related Parties, on demand, in the amount equal to such Lender’s
Aggregate Exposure Percentage, from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses, or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against it or any of them in any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or any action taken
or omitted by it or any of them under this Agreement or any of the Loan
Documents to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower (except such as shall
result from its gross negligence or willful misconduct).



Section 8.05. Successor Agents. The Administrative Agent may at any time give
notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any
such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the
consent (provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) of the
Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a
successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an
Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have
accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as
shall be agreed by the Required Lenders with the consent of the Borrower (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)) (the “Resignation Effective
Date”), then the retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated
to), in consultation with the Borrower, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a
successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. For
the avoidance of doubt, whether or not a successor Administrative Agent has been
appointed, the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation shall nonetheless
become effective in accordance with such notice of resignation on the
Resignation Effective Date. With effect from the Resignation Effective Date, (a)
the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and (b) except for any
indemnity payments owed to the retiring Administrative Agent, all payments,
communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the
Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until
such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative
Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become
vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments owed to the
retiring Administrative Agent), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative
Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise
agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring
Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents,
the provisions of this Article and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for
the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as the
Administrative Agent.
Section 8.06. Independent Lenders. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other
Lender or any of their
55
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their
Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from
time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or
not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or
any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.



Section 8.07. Advances and Payments.
(a) On the date of each Term Loan, the Administrative Agent shall be authorized
(but not obligated) to advance, for the account of each of the Lenders, the
amount of the Term Loan to be made by it in accordance with its Closing Date
Term Loan Commitment or Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitment, as applicable,
hereunder. Should the Administrative Agent do so, each of the Lenders agrees
forthwith to reimburse the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds
for the amount so advanced on its behalf by the Administrative Agent, together
with interest at the NYFRB Rate if not so reimbursed on the date due from and
including such date but not including the date of reimbursement.
(b) Any amounts received by the Administrative Agent in connection with this
Agreement (other than amounts to which the Administrative Agent is entitled
pursuant to Sections 2.18, 2.19, 8.04 and 10.04), the application of which is
not otherwise provided for in this Agreement, shall be applied in accordance
with Section 2.17(b). All amounts to be paid to a Lender by the Administrative
Agent shall be credited to that Lender, after collection by the Administrative
Agent, in immediately available funds either by wire transfer or deposit in that
Lender’s correspondent account with the Administrative Agent, as such Lender and
the Administrative Agent shall from time to time agree.



Section 8.08. Sharing of Setoffs. Each Lender agrees that, except to the extent
this Agreement expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular
Lender or to the Lenders under the Term Loan Facility, if it shall, through the
exercise either by it or any of its banking Affiliates of a right of banker’s
lien, setoff or counterclaim against the Borrower, including, but not limited
to, a secured claim under Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code or other security
or interest arising from, or in lieu of, such secured claim and received by such
Lender (or any of its banking Affiliates) under any applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law, or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of its
Term Loans as a result of which the unpaid portion of its Term Loans is
proportionately less than the unpaid portion of the Term Loans of any other
Lender (a) it shall promptly purchase at par (and shall be deemed to have
thereupon purchased) from such other Lender a participation in the Term Loans of
such other Lender, so that the aggregate unpaid principal amount of each
Lender’s Term Loans and its participation in Term Loans of the other Lenders
shall be in the same proportion to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all
Term Loans then outstanding, as the principal amount of its Term Loans prior to
the obtaining of such payment was to the principal amount of all Term Loans
outstanding, prior to the obtaining of such payment and (b) such other
adjustments shall be made from time to time as shall be equitable to ensure that
the Lenders under the Term Loan Facility share such payment pro-rata, provided
that if any such non-pro-rata payment is thereafter recovered or otherwise set
aside, such purchase of participations shall be rescinded (without interest).
The Borrower expressly consents to the foregoing arrangements and agrees, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, that any Lender holding (or deemed to be
holding) a participation in a Term Loan acquired pursuant to this Section or any
of its banking Affiliates may exercise any and all rights of banker’s lien,
setoff or counterclaim with respect to any and all moneys owing by the Borrower
to such Lender as fully as if such Lender was the original obligee thereon, in
the amount of such participation.
56
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Section 8.09. Other Agents. No Agent (other than the Administrative Agent) shall
have any right, power, obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this
Agreement other than those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting
the foregoing, no such Agent shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary
relationship with any Lender. Each Lender acknowledges that it has not relied,
and will not rely, on any such Agent in deciding to enter into this Agreement or
in taking or not taking action hereunder.



Section 8.10. Withholding Taxes. To the extent required by any applicable law,
the Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount
equivalent to any withholding tax applicable to such payment. If the Internal
Revenue Service or any other Governmental Authority asserts a claim that the
Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for
the account of any Lender for any reason, or the Administrative Agent has paid
over to the Internal Revenue Service applicable withholding tax relating to a
payment to a Lender but no deduction has been made from such payment, without
duplication of any indemnification obligations set forth in Section 8.04, such
Lender shall indemnify the Administrative Agent fully for all amounts paid,
directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as tax or otherwise,
including any penalties or interest and together with any expenses incurred.



Section 8.11. Certain ERISA Matters(a) . (a) Each Lender (x) represents and
warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y)
covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date
such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the
Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit
of the Borrower, that at least one of the following is and will be true:
(i) such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42)
of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans with respect to such
Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of
the Term Loans and this Agreement,
(ii) the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE 84-14
(a class exemption for certain transactions determined by independent qualified
professional asset managers), PTE 95-60 (a class exemption for certain
transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class
exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate
accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank
collective investment funds) or PTE 96-23 (a class exemption for certain
transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect
to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and
performance of the Term Loans and this Agreement,
(iii) (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional
Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified
Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf of such Lender
to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Term Loans and this
Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and
performance of the Term Loans and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of
sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84- 14 and (D) to the best
knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I of PTE
84-14 are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation
in, administration of and performance of the Term Loans and this Agreement, or
(iv) such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in
writing between the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, and such
Lender.
(b) In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding
clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has provided another
representation, warranty and
57
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause
(a), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person
became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person
became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party
hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance
of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower, that the Administrative Agent
is not a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such
Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of
the Term Loans and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation
or exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any
Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).

of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without
such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise
transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this
Section 10.02. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be
construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent
provided in paragraph (d) of this Section 10.02) and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.
(b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any
Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its
Term Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:
(A) the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the Administrative
Agent shall be required if the assignee is a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender;
and
(B) the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for
an assignment (i) if an Event of Default under Section 7.01(b), Section 7.01(f)
or Section 7.01(g) has occurred and is continuing or (ii) if the assignee is a
Lender or an Eligible Affiliate Assignee; provided further, that the Borrower
will be deemed to have consented to any assignment of Term Loans unless it shall
object thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10)
Business Days after having received written notice thereof;
(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
(A) any assignment of any portion of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitments or
Term Loans shall be made to an Eligible Assignee;
(B) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender
or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s
Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitments or Term Loans, the amount of such Delayed
Draw Term Loan Commitments or Term Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each
such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not
be less than $1,000,000, and after giving effect to such assignment, the portion
of the Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitments or Term Loans held by the assigning
Lender shall not be less than $1,000,000, in each case unless the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent otherwise consent, provided that any such assignment
shall be in increments of $500,000 in excess of the minimum amount described
above;
(C) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate
part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement;
59
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(D) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together with a processing
and recordation fee of $3,500 for the account of the Administrative Agent
(unless otherwise agreed); and
(E) the assignee, if it was not a Lender immediately prior to such assignment,
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative questionnaire in a
form as the Administrative Agent may require.
(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv)
of this Section 10.02, from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and,
to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have
the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning
Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
2.14, 2.16 and 10.04). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 10.02
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (d) of
this Section.
(iv) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its offices a copy of each
Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of
the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the principal amount (and stated
interest) of the Term Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof
from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no assignment may
be made hereunder to any Defaulting Lender or any of its subsidiaries, or any
Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the
foregoing Persons described in this clause (v).
(vi) In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any
Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment will be effective unless and
until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties
to the assignment make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in
an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which
may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or
subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the
consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata
share of Term Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting
Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably
consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by
such Defaulting Lender to the Borrower and Administrative Agent (and interest
accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata
share of all outstanding Term Loans and in accordance with its Aggregate
Exposure Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any
assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder becomes
effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this
paragraph, then the assignee of such interest will be deemed to be a Defaulting
Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.

#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(c) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by
an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed administrative
questionnaire in a form as the Administrative Agent may require (unless the
assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation
fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such
assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent
shall accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained
therein in the Register; provided that if either the assigning Lender or the
assignee shall have failed to make any payment required to be made by it
pursuant to Section 2.04(a), 8.04 or 10.04(c), the Administrative Agent shall
have no obligation to accept such Assignment and Acceptance and record the
information therein in the Register unless and until such payment shall have
been made in full, together with all accrued interest thereon. No assignment
shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in
the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(d) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Delayed Draw Term Loan
Commitments and Term Loans); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under
this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely
responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations
and (C) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall continue to
deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without
the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in the first proviso to Section 10.08(a) that affects such
Participant. Subject to paragraph (d)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees
that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14 and
2.16 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by
law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 8.08 as
though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to the
requirements of Section 8.08 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells
a participation, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the
Borrower, shall maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of
each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participant’s interest in the Term Loans or other obligations under this
Agreement (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any
obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any
Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to
a Participant’s interest in any Delayed Draw Term Loan Commitments, Term Loans
or its other obligations under this Agreement or any Loan Document) except to
the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Delayed Draw
Term Loan Commitments, Term Loan or other obligation is in registered form under
Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in
the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such
Lender, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall treat each person whose
name is recorded in the Participant Register pursuant to the terms hereof as the
owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding
notice to the contrary.
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 2.16 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with
respect to the participation sold to such Participant. A Participant that would
be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 2.16 unless such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to
comply with Sections 2.16(f), 2.16(g), 2.16(h) and 2.18 as though it were a
Lender.
61
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(e) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such
Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction
over such Lender, and this Section 10.02 shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(f) Any Lender may, in connection with any assignment or participation or
proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section 10.02, disclose to
the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant, any information
relating to the Borrower furnished to such Lender by or on behalf of the
Borrower; provided that prior to any such disclosure, each such assignee or
participant or proposed assignee or participant are advised of and agree to be
bound by either the provisions of Section 10.03 or other provisions at least as
restrictive as Section 10.03.



Section 10.03. Confidentiality. Each Lender and each Agent agrees to keep any
information delivered or made available by or on behalf of the Borrower to it
confidential, in accordance with its customary procedures, from anyone other
than persons employed or retained by such Lender or Agent who are or are
expected to become engaged in evaluating, approving, structuring or
administering the Term Loans, and who are advised by such Lender or Agent of the
confidential nature of such information; provided that nothing herein shall
prevent any Lender or Agent from disclosing such information (a) to any of its
Related Parties and their respective agents, legal counsel, auditors and other
advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made
will be informed of the confidential nature of such information and instructed
to keep such information confidential, and the applicable Lender or Agent shall
be responsible for compliance by such Persons with such obligation) or to any
other Lender, (b) upon the order of any court or administrative agency, (c) upon
the request or demand of any regulatory agency or authority (including in
connection with any audit or examination by a bank examiner exercising
examination or regulatory authority over such Lender or Agent), (d) which has
been publicly disclosed other than as a result of a disclosure by any Lender or
Agent which is not permitted by this Agreement, (e) in connection with any
litigation to which any Lender or Agent, or their respective Affiliates may be a
party to the extent reasonably required, (f) to the extent reasonably required
in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder, (g) with the Borrower’s
consent, (h) to any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to
information about a Lender or Agent’s investment portfolio in connection with
ratings issued with respect to such Lender or Agent and (i) to any actual or
proposed participant or assignee of all or part of its rights hereunder or to
any direct or indirect contractual counterparty (or the professional advisors
thereto) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its
obligations, in each case, subject to the proviso in Section 10.02(f) (with any
reference to any assignee or participant set forth in such proviso being deemed
to include a reference to such contractual counterparty for purposes of this
Section 10.03(i)). If any Lender or Agent is in any manner requested or required
to disclose any of the information delivered or made available to it by the
Borrower under clauses (b) or (e) of this Section, such Lender or Agent will, to
the extent permitted by law, provide the Borrower with prompt notice, to the
extent reasonable, so that the Borrower may seek, at its sole expense, a
protective order or other appropriate remedy or may waive compliance with this
Section. In addition, any Lender or Agent may disclose information pertaining to
this Agreement routinely provided by arrangers to data service providers,
including league table providers, that serve the lending industry.



Section 10.04. Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver(a) . (a) (i) The Borrower
shall pay or reimburse: (A) all reasonable fees and reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers (limited in the case of
legal fees and expenses, to the reasonable fees, disbursements and other charges
of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, as counsel to the
62

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Administrative Agent) associated with the syndication of the credit facility
provided for herein, and the preparation, execution, delivery and administration
of the Loan Documents and (in the case of the Administrative Agent) any
amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated); and
(B) all fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders (limited in the case of legal fees and expenses, to one (1) outside
counsel to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, taken as a whole (and, in
the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest, an additional counsel
to all such similarly situated affected parties)) in connection with the
enforcement of the Loan Documents.
(ii) The Borrower shall pay or reimburse all reasonable fees and reasonable
expenses of the Administrative Agent and the Appraisers incurred in connection
with the Administrative Agent’s (x) periodic appraisals and (y) other monitoring
of Pool Assets as allowed hereunder.
(iii) All payments or reimbursements pursuant to the foregoing clauses (a)(i)
and (ii) shall be paid within thirty (30) days of written demand together with
back-up documentation supporting such reimbursement request.
(b) The Borrower shall indemnify each Agent and each Lender, and each Related
Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
“Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (limited in the case
of legal fees and expenses, to one (1) outside counsel to all Indemnitees, taken
as a whole (and, in the case of an actual or perceived conflict of interest, an
additional counsel to all such similarly situated affected Indemnitees))
incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection
with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties
hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the
Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Term Loan
or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) in connection with clauses (i) and
(ii) above, any Release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or
operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental
Liability related to or asserted against the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation
or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort
or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto
and whether or not the same are brought by the Borrower, its equity holders,
affiliates or creditors or any other Person; provided that such indemnity shall
not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to (x) have resulted from the
material breach of the obligations of such Indemnitee under the Loan Documents
or the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (y) arise
from disputes solely among the Indemnitees (other than any dispute involving
claims against any Person in its capacity as an Agent or similar role hereunder)
that do not involve an act or omission by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, no Indemnitee shall be liable for any
damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials
obtained through electronic, telecommunications or other information
transmission systems, except to the extent any such damages are found by a final
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to arise from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. This Section 10.04(b)
shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than Taxes that represent losses or
damages arising from any non-Tax claim.
(c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid
by it to the Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section
10.04, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such
portion of the unpaid amount equal to such Lender’s Aggregate Exposure
Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense
or indemnity payment is sought); provided that the unreimbursed expense or
indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability
63
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, neither the Borrower nor any
Indemnitee shall have any liability for special, indirect, consequential or
punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in
connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Term Loan or the use of
the proceeds thereof (other than in respect of such damages incurred or paid by
an Indemnitee to a third party).



Section 10.05. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a)
This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of
the State of New York.
(b) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself
and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the
State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States District
Court of the Southern District of New York sitting in New York County, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment,
and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
that all claims in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law, in
such Federal court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in
any such action or proceeding shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or
in any other manner provided by law.
(c) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any court referred to in
paragraph (b) of this Section 10.05. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
court.
(d) Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in
the manner provided for notices in Section 10.01. Nothing in this Agreement will
affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other
manner permitted by law.



Section 10.06. No Waiver. No failure on the part of the Administrative Agent or
any of the Lenders to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or
remedy hereunder or any of the other Loan Documents shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or
remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.



Section 10.07. Extension of Maturity. Should any payment of principal of or
interest or any other amount due hereunder become due and payable on a day other
than a Business Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next
succeeding Business Day and, in the case of principal, interest shall be payable
thereon at the rate herein specified during such extension.



Section 10.08. Amendments, etc.
(a) Except as set forth in Sections 2.09, Section 2.23 and 5.10 or as otherwise
set forth in this Agreement, no modification, amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement, and
64
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



no consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Lenders
(or signed by the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required
Lenders), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific instance and for the purpose for which given; provided, however, that
no such modification or amendment shall without the prior written consent of:
(i) each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (A) increase the Delayed
Draw Term Loan Commitment of any Lender or extend the Delayed Draw Commitment
Period (it being understood that a waiver of an Event of Default shall not
constitute an increase in or extension of the termination date of the Delayed
Draw Term Loan Commitment of a Lender), or (B) reduce the principal amount of
any Term Loan or the rate of interest payable thereon (provided that only the
consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary for a waiver of default
interest referred to in Section 2.08), or extend any date for the payment of
principal, interest or Fees hereunder or reduce any Fees payable hereunder or
extend the final maturity of the Borrower’s obligations hereunder or (B) amend,
modify or waive any provision of Sections 2.17(b) or (e); and
(ii) all of the Lenders (A) amend or modify any provision of this Agreement
which provides for the unanimous consent or approval of the Lenders or (B) amend
this Section 10.08 that has the effect of changing the number or percentage of
Lenders that must approve any modification, amendment, waiver or consent or
modify the percentage of the Lenders required in the definition of Required
Lenders.
(b) No such amendment or modification shall adversely affect the rights and
obligations of the Administrative Agent hereunder without its prior written
consent.
(c) No notice to or demand on the Borrower shall entitle the Borrower to any
other or further notice or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances.
Each assignee under Section 10.02(b) shall be bound by any amendment,
modification, waiver, or consent authorized as provided herein, and any consent
by a Lender shall bind any Person subsequently acquiring an interest on the Term
Loans held by such Lender. No amendment to this Agreement shall be effective
against the Borrower unless signed by the Borrower.
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 10.08(a),
(i) in the event that the Borrower requests that this Agreement be modified or
amended in a manner which would require the unanimous consent of all of the
Lenders or the consent of all Lenders directly and adversely affected thereby
and, in each case, such modification or amendment is agreed to by the Required
Lenders, then the Borrower may replace any non-consenting Lender in accordance
with Section 10.02; provided that such amendment or modification can be effected
as a result of the assignment contemplated by such Section (together with all
other such assignments required by the Borrower to be made pursuant to this
clause (i)); (ii) no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to approve or
disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder, except that the Delayed
Draw Term Loan Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended
without the consent of such Lender (it being understood that the Delayed Draw
Term Loans and the outstanding Term Loans held or deemed held by any Defaulting
Lender shall be excluded for a vote of the Lenders hereunder requiring any
consent of the Lenders), (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
any Extension Agreement effected in accordance with Section 2.22 may be made
without the consent of the Required Lenders and (iv) if the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower shall have jointly identified any ambiguity, mistake,
typographical error or other obvious error or any error or omission of a
technical or immaterial nature in any provision of the Loan Documents (including
the exhibits and schedules thereto), then the Administrative Agent and the
65
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Borrower shall be permitted to amend such provision and such amendment shall
become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any
Loan Document.
(e) In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
10.08(a), this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, may be
amended with the written consent of the Administrative Agent (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Borrower and the lenders providing the
relevant Replacement Term Loans (as defined below) as may be necessary or
appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower (x) to permit the refinancing, replacement or modification of all
outstanding Term Loans (“Refinanced Term Loans”) with a replacement term loan
tranche (“Replacement Term Loans”) hereunder (any such amendment, a “Refinancing
Amendment”) and (y) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit
facilities in any determination of Required Lenders; provided that (i) the
aggregate principal amount of such Replacement Term Loans shall not exceed the
aggregate principal amount of such Refinanced Term Loans, (ii) the Applicable
Margins for such Replacement Term Loans shall not be higher than the Applicable
Margins for such Refinanced Term Loans, (iii) the Weighted Average Life to
Maturity of such Replacement Term Loans shall not be shorter than the Weighted
Average Life to Maturity of such Refinanced Term Loans at the time of such
refinancing (except to the extent of nominal amortization for periods where
amortization has been eliminated as a result of prepayment of the applicable
Term Loans) and (iv) all other terms applicable to such Replacement Term Loans
shall be substantially identical to, or less favorable to the Lenders providing
such Replacement Term Loans than those applicable to such Refinanced Term Loans,
except to the extent necessary to provide for covenants and other terms
applicable to any period after the latest Term Loan Maturity Date in effect
immediately prior to such refinancing. The effectiveness of (and the borrowing
under) any Refinancing Amendment shall be subject to the satisfaction on the
date thereof of each of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01(f) (other than
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.04(b) and 3.06(a))
and 4.01(g) (it being understood that all references to the making or borrowing
of Term Loans or similar language in such Section 4.01 shall be deemed to refer
to the effective date of such Refinancing Amendment) and such other conditions
as the parties thereto shall agree.
(f) In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
10.08, the Borrower may from time to time deliver to the Administrative Agent an
updated Schedule 6.05 to replace the then-existing Schedule 6.05 in connection
with (x) any disposition, transfer or removal by the Borrower or any Subsidiary
of the Borrower of any Pool Asset pursuant to Section 6.05 or (y) any
designation of Additional Pool Assets as Pool Assets as contemplated by the
definition of Additional Pool Assets set forth in Section 1.01 hereof.



Section 10.09. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.



Section 10.10. Headings. Section headings used herein are for convenience only
and are not to affect the construction of or be taken into consideration in
interpreting this Agreement.



Section 10.11. Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be
considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall
survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Term
Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its
behalf and notwithstanding that the
66
#10384228v33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Event
of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is
extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the
principal of or any accrued interest on any Term Loan or any other amount
payable under this Agreement is outstanding. The provisions of Sections 2.14,
2.15, 2.16 and 10.04 and Section 8 shall survive and remain in full force and
effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
the repayment of the Term Loans or the termination of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.



Section 10.12. Execution in Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This
Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on
different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of
which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement
constitutes the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter
hereof and supersedes any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral
or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section
4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by
the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received

of the Patriot Act hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the
requirements of the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record
information that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name
and address of the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to
identify the Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act.



Section 10.14. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO ANY OF THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY (WHETHER
BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES
THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF

Section 10.15. No Fiduciary Duty. Each Agent, each Lender and their Affiliates
(collectively, solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Lenders”), may have
economic interests that conflict with those of the Borrower, its stockholders
and/or its affiliates. The Borrower agrees that nothing in the Loan Documents or
otherwise related to the Transactions will be deemed to create an advisory,
fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any
Lender, on the one hand, and the Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates,
on the other hand. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that (i) the
transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including the exercise of
rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm’s-length commercial
transactions

between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, on
the other hand, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading
thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in
favor of the Borrower, its stockholders or its affiliates with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby (or the exercise of rights or remedies with
respect thereto) or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any
Lender has advised, is currently advising or will advise the Borrower, its
stockholders or its affiliates on other matters) or any other obligation to the
Borrower except the obligations expressly set forth in the Loan Documents and
(y) each Lender is acting solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary
of the Borrower, its management, stockholders, affiliates, creditors or any
other Person. The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the Borrower has
consulted its own legal and financial advisors to the extent it deemed
appropriate and that it is responsible for making its own independent judgment
with respect to such transactions and the process leading thereto. The Borrower
agrees that it will not claim that any Lender has rendered advisory services of
any nature or respect, or owes a fiduciary or similar duty to the Borrower, in
connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.



Section 10.16. Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial
Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or
in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties,
each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial
Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is
unsecured, may be subject to the write down and conversion powers of the
applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and
agrees to be bound by:
(a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable
Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be
payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
(b) the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if
applicable:
(i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other
instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent
undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise
conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be
accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the
exercise of the write down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution
Authority.
