Borrower. Upon tender of each Draft the Borrower shall pay to the Lender the fee
specified in Section 5.1 with respect to such Draft.
(b)
Sale of Bankers’ Acceptances. It shall be the responsibility of each Lender
unless otherwise requested by the Borrower, to purchase its Bankers’ Acceptances

subject Bankers’ Acceptances, the Agent will make BA Discount Proceeds received
by it from the Lenders available to the Borrower on the Borrowing Date by wiring
such amount to the bank account of the Borrower identified to the Agent.

Acceptances or perform their other obligations under this Agreement with respect
to Bankers’ Acceptances, then upon at least two Business Days’ written notice by

Section 2.5 requesting a Borrowing by way of Bankers’ Acceptances, shall advise
each Lender of the aggregate Face Amount and term(s) of the Bankers’ Acceptances
to be accepted by it, which term(s) shall be identical for all Lenders. The
aggregate Face Amount of Bankers’ Acceptances to be accepted by a Lender shall
be determined by the Agent by reference to the respective Commitments of the

particulars to the Borrower) as soon as possible of the discount rate at which
it has sold or purchased its Bankers’ Acceptances;

(iii)
if the Borrower requests the Lenders not to purchase the subject Bankers’
Acceptances, each Lender will forward the subject Bankers’ Acceptances to the
Agent for delivery against payment of the applicable Bankers’ Acceptance Fees;
and

(iv)
if the Agent determines that all the conditions precedent to a Borrowing
specified in this Agreement have been met or waived, it shall advance to the
Borrower the amount delivered by each Lender by wiring such amount to the

invest them in an overnight investment as orally instructed by each Lender until
such time as the Advance is made.

(d)

Bankers’ Acceptance at maturity notwithstanding the fact that a Lender may be
the holder of the Bankers’ Acceptance which has been accepted by such Lender.

(e)
Collateralization.

(i)
If any Bankers’ Acceptance is outstanding on the Demand Date or the Maturity

(ii)
All funds received by the Agent pursuant to Section 2.8(e)(i) shall be held by
the Agent for set-off on the maturity date of the Bankers’ Acceptance against
the liability of the Borrower to the Lender in respect of such Bankers’
Acceptance and, until then, shall be invested from time to time in such form of
investment at the Branch designated by the Borrower and approved by the Agent,
for a term corresponding to the maturity date of the applicable Bankers’
Acceptance and shall bear interest at the rate payable by the Agent on deposits
of similar currency, amount and maturity. The balance of all such funds
(together with interest thereon) held by the Agent will be applied to repayment
of all debts and liabilities of the Borrower to the Lender under this Agreement
and the Loan Documents and following repayment of all such debts and liabilities
any amount remaining shall be paid to the Borrower or as otherwise required by
law.

(f)
Notice of Rollover or Conversion. The Borrower shall give the Agent notice in
the form attached as Schedule 2(B) or Schedule 2(C) hereto, as applicable, not
later than 11:00 a.m. on the Business Day prior to the maturity date of Bankers’
Acceptances, specifying the Accommodation into which the Bankers’ Acceptances
will be renewed or converted on maturity.

(g)
Obligations Absolute. The obligations of the Borrower with respect to Bankers’
Acceptances under this Agreement shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and
shall be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including, without limitation, the following circumstances:

(i)
any lack of validity or enforceability of any Draft accepted by a Lender as a
Bankers’ Acceptance; or

shall be funded and paid by the Borrower from its own resources, by 11:00 a.m.
(Calgary time) on the day of the Borrowing or may be advanced as a Prime Rate
Loan if the Borrower is otherwise entitled to such Accommodation and the Agent
will apply such Prime Rate Loan to discharge the obligations of the Borrower
under such Bankers’ Acceptance. Any such Prime Rate Loan so made shall be
subject to the terms and provisions of this Agreement, including payment of
interest at the rates specified in Section 4.1.
(i)
Depository Bills and Notes Act.  At the option of any Lender (and
notwithstanding Section 2.8 (a)), Bankers’ Acceptances under this Agreement to

Depository Bills and Notes Act (Canada). All Depository Bills so issued shall be
governed by the provisions of this Section 2.8, as applicable.

(j)
BA Equivalent Loans. Whenever the Borrower requests an Advance that includes
Banker’s Acceptances, each Lender that is not permitted by Applicable Law or by
customary market practice to accept a Banker’s Acceptance (a "Non BA Lender")
shall, in lieu of accepting its pro rata amount of such Banker’s Acceptances,
make available to the Borrower on the Borrowing Date a non‑interest bearing loan
(a "BA Equivalent Loan") in Canadian Dollars in an amount equal to the BA
Discount Proceeds of its pro rata amount of the Banker’s Acceptances, based on
the BA Discount Rate applicable to such Lender. Each Non BA Lender shall also be
entitled to deduct from the BA Equivalent Loan an amount equal to the Banker’s
Acceptance Fee that would have been applicable had it been able to accept
Banker’s Acceptances. The BA Equivalent Loan shall have a term equal to the term
of the Banker’s Acceptances that the Non BA Lender would otherwise have accepted
and the Borrower shall, at the end of that term, be obligated to pay the Non BA
Lender an amount equal to the aggregate Face Amount of the Banker’s Acceptances
that it would otherwise have accepted. All provisions of this Agreement
applicable to Banker’s Acceptances and Lenders that accept Banker’s Acceptances
shall apply mutatis mutandis to BA Equivalent Loans and Non BA Lenders and,
without limiting the foregoing, Accommodations shall include BA Equivalent
Loans.

2.9
LIBOR Loans.

(a)
If the Agent determines in (which determination shall be made in good faith and
shall be conclusive and binding) in connection with any request for a LIBOR Loan
or a conversion or continuation thereof that (a) U.S. Dollar deposits are not
being offered to banks in the applicable offshore U.S. Dollar market for the
applicable amount and LIBOR Interest Period of such LIBOR Loan, or adequate and
reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for such LIBOR
Loan, or (b) if the Majority Lenders determine and notify the Agent that the
LIBOR Rate for such LIBOR Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost
to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Loan, then the Agent shall promptly notify
the Borrower and all Lenders. Thereafter, the obligation of the Lenders to make
or maintain LIBOR Loans shall be suspended until the Agent revokes such notice.
Upon receipt of such notice of suspension, the Borrower may revoke any pending
request for a LIBOR Loan, or conversion or continuation of a LIBOR Loan, or,
failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a
U.S. Base Rate Loan in the amount specified therein.

(b)
The Borrower shall give the Agent notice in writing not later than 10:00 a.m. on
the third Business Day prior to the expiry of the LIBOR Interest Period in
respect of a LIBOR Loan specifying the new LIBOR Interest Period (if the LIBOR
Loan is to be renewed) or the Accommodation into which the LIBOR Loan will be
converted on such expiry.

(c)
If no notice is given by the Borrower as provided in clause (a) or (b) above,
the LIBOR Loan will be automatically converted on the expiration of the then
applicable LIBOR Interest Period to a U.S. Base Rate Loan, without prejudice to
the Lenders’ rights in respect of the failure to give the notice and whether or
not a Default or Event of Default has occurred, in the principal amount of the
funds required to be provided to the Agent for the account of the Lenders
pursuant to this Section.

(d)
If any LIBOR Loan is outstanding on the Demand Date or the Maturity Date, the
Borrower shall on such date pay to the Agent for the account of the Lenders at
the Branch in U.S. Dollars an amount equal to the principal amount of such LIBOR
Loan.

(e)
All funds received by the Agent pursuant to clause (d) shall be held by the
Agent for set-off on the maturity date of the LIBOR Loan against the liability
of the Borrower to the Lenders in respect of such LIBOR Loan and, until then,
shall be invested from time to time in such form of investment at the Branch
designated by the Borrower and approved by the Agent, for a term corresponding
to the maturity date of the applicable LIBOR Loan and shall bear interest at the
rate payable by the Agent on deposits of similar currency, amount and maturity.
The balance of all such funds (together with interest thereon) held by the Agent
will be applied to repayment of all debts and liabilities of the Borrower to the
Lenders under this Agreement and the Loan Documents and following repayment of
all such debts and liabilities any amount remaining shall be paid to the
Borrower or as otherwise required by law.

(f)
Each Lender shall advance its Applicable Percentage of each LIBOR Loan in
accordance with the following provisions:

(i)
the Agent shall advise each Lender of its receipt of a notice from a Borrower
pursuant to Section 2.5 on the day such notice is received and shall, as soon as
possible, advise each Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of any
Borrowing by way of LIBOR Loan requested by the notice;

(ii)
each Lender shall deliver its share of the Borrowing to the Agent’s Account at
the Branch not later than 11:00 a.m. on the Borrowing Date; and

(iii)
when the Agent determines that all the conditions precedent to a Borrowing
specified in this Agreement have been met, it shall advance to the Borrower the
amount delivered by each Lender by wiring such amount to the account of the
Borrower, but if the conditions precedent to the Borrowing are not met by 2:30
p.m. on the Borrowing Date, the Agent shall return the funds to the Lenders or
invest them in an overnight investment as orally instructed by each Lender until
such time as the LIBOR Loan is advanced.

2.10
Safekeeping of Drafts.

The responsibility of the Agent and the Lenders in respect of the safekeeping of
Drafts, Bankers’ Acceptances and other bills of exchange which are delivered to
any of them hereunder shall be limited to the exercise of the same degree of
care which such party gives to its own property, provided that such party shall
not be deemed to be an insurer thereof.

2.11
Certification to Third Parties.

The Agent will promptly provide to the Borrower and third parties at the request
of the Borrower a certificate as to the Canadian Dollar Amount of Accommodations
outstanding from time to time under this Agreement, and giving such other

request.

2.12
Successor LIBOR and CDOR Rate.

(a)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Agent
determines (which determination shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the
Borrower absent manifest error), or the Borrower or the Majority Lenders notify
the Agent (with, in the case of the Majority Lenders, a copy to Borrower) that
the Borrower or the Majority Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that:

(i)
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR or the CDOR
Rate for any requested Contract Period, including because the Reuters Screen
LIBOR01 Page or the “CDOR Page” (or any display substitutes therefor) of Reuters
(or any successor thereof or Affiliate thereof) (collectively, the “Screen
Rate”) is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances
are unlikely to be temporary; or

(ii)
the administrator of the applicable Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority
having jurisdiction over the Agent has made a public statement identifying a
specific date after which the applicable Screen Rate shall no longer be made
available, or used for determining the interest rate of loans (such specific
date, the “Scheduled Unavailability Date”); or

(iii)
syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language similar to
that contained in this Section 2.12, are being executed or amended (as
applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace (x)
LIBOR or the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page or (y) the CDOR Rate or the “CDOR Page”
(or any display substitutes therefor) of Reuters (or any successor thereof or
Affiliate thereof), as applicable,

then, reasonably promptly after such determination by the Agent or receipt by
the Agent of such notice, as applicable, the Agent and the Borrower may amend
this Agreement to replace LIBOR or the CDOR Rate, as applicable, with an
alternate benchmark rate selected by the Agent and the Borrower (including any
mathematical or other adjustments to the benchmark (if any) incorporated
therein), giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention
for similar multi-

currency syndicated credit facilities for such alternative benchmarks (any such
proposed rate, a “Successor Rate”), together with any proposed Successor Rate
Conforming Changes, and any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m.,
Toronto time, on the fifth Business Day after the Agent shall have posted such
proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time,
the Lenders comprising the Majority Lenders have delivered to the Agent written
notice that the Majority Lenders do not accept such amendment.
(b)
If no Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under Section
2.12(a) exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable),
the Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, the
Lenders shall not be required to honour any Advance or Borrowing Notice, as
applicable, requesting a Borrowing by way of a LIBOR Loan or BA Instrument, as
applicable, under this Agreement. Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Borrower
may revoke any pending request for a conversion to or rollover of such LIBOR
Loan or BA Instrument, as applicable (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Loan,
BA Instrument or Contract Period, as applicable) or, failing that, will be
deemed to have converted such request into a request for conversion or rollover
to a U.S. Base Rate Loan or Prime Rate Loan, as applicable, in the amount
specified therein, and (B) the Borrower hereby instructs the Agent to repay each
affected (x) LIBOR Loan with the proceeds of a U.S. Base Rate Loan in the amount
of such affected LIBOR Loan, and (y) BA Instrument with the proceeds of a Prime
Rate Loan, as applicable, in each case to be drawn down on the last day of the
then current Contract Period.

(c)
Notwithstanding anything else herein, any definition of “Successor Rate” shall
provide that in no event shall such Successor Rate be less than zero for
purposes of this Agreement.

(d)
For purposes of this Section 2.12, “Successor Rate Conforming Changes” means,
with respect to any proposed Successor Rate, any conforming changes to the
definitions of U.S. Base Rate, Federal Funds Rate, Prime Rate, LIBOR Interest
Period, Contract Period, timing and frequency of determining rates and making
payments of interest and other administrative matters as may be appropriate, in
the discretion of the Agent, to reflect the adoption of such Successor Rate and
to permit the administration thereof by the Agent in a manner substantially
consistent with market practice (or, if the Agent determines that adoption of
any portion of such market practice is not administratively feasible or that no
market practice for the administration of such Successor Rate exists, in such
other manner of administration as the Agent determines in consultation with the
Borrower).

the date the payment was to be made until the date it is actually made, at the
prevailing interbank rate. A certificate of the Documentary Credit Lender,
submitted to the relevant Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this
Section shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

(c)
If, at any time after the Documentary Credit Lender has made a payment under any
Documentary Credit and has received from the Lenders their pro rata share of
such payment, the Documentary Credit Lender receives a payment in respect of the
Documentary Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise), the
Documentary Credit Lender will distribute to the Lenders their pro rata share of
such payment; provided, however, if any payment so received by the Documentary
Credit Lender shall be required to be returned by the Documentary Credit Lender,
each Lender shall return to the Documentary Credit Lender the portion thereof
previously distributed to it.

(b)
The reimbursement obligation of the Borrower under any Documentary Credit shall
be unconditional and irrevocable and shall be paid strictly in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement under all circumstances, including (i) any lack of
validity or enforceability of a Documentary Credit, (ii) the existence of any
claim, set-off, defence or other right which the Borrower may have at any time
against a Beneficiary, the Documentary Credit Lender or any other Person,
whether in connection with the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated
therein or any other transaction (including any underlying transaction between
the Borrower and the Beneficiary), (iii) any certificate or other document
presented with a Documentary Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid
or any statement in it being untrue or inaccurate, (iv) the existence of any act
or omission or any misuse of, a Documentary Credit or misapplication of proceeds
by the Beneficiary, including any fraud in any certificate or other document
presented with a Documentary Credit in each case unless, before payment of a
Documentary Credit, (x) the Borrower has delivered to the Documentary Credit
Lender a written notice of the fraud together with a written request that it
refuse to honour such drawing, (y) the fraud by the Beneficiary has been
established to the knowledge of the Documentary Credit Lender so as to make the
fraud clear or obvious to the Documentary Credit Lender, and (z) in the case of
fraud in the underlying transaction between the Borrower and the Beneficiary,
the fraud is of such character as to make the demand for payment by the
Beneficiary under the Documentary Credit a fraudulent one, (v) payment by the
Documentary Credit Lender under the Documentary Credit against presentation of a
certificate or other document which does not comply with the terms of the
Documentary Credit, unless such payment is inconsistent with the standards of
reasonable care specified in the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
Credits (1993 Revision), ICC Publication 500 (or any replacement publication),
or (vi) the existence of a Default or Event of Default.

(c)
The Documentary Credit Lender shall not be responsible for (i) the validity or

ineffective for any reason, (ii) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in
transmission or delivery of any messages by mail, facsimile or otherwise, (iii)
errors in interpretation of technical terms, (iv) any loss or delay in the
transmission of any document required in order to make a drawing, and (v) any
consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Documentary Credit
Lender, including the acts or omissions, whether rightful or wrongful, of any
Governmental Authority. None of the above shall affect, impair, or prevent the
vesting of any of the Documentary Credit Lender’s rights or powers under this
Agreement. Any action taken or omitted by the Documentary Credit Lender under or
in connection with any Documentary Credit or the related certificates, if taken
or omitted in good faith, shall not put the Documentary Credit Lender under any
resulting liability to the Borrower provided that the Documentary Credit Lender
acts in accordance with the standards of reasonable care specified in the
Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1993 Revision), ICC
Publication 500 (or any replacement publication).

as provided in Section 4.1) payable by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement
that are not paid when due at the Prime Rate plus 2% per annum, in the case of
amounts payable in Canadian Dollars, or the U.S. Base Rate plus 2% per annum, in
the case of amounts payable in U.S. Dollars, in each case calculated daily and

with interest on overdue interest at the same rate.

4.4
Other Interest.

The Borrower shall pay interest on all amounts payable hereunder at the rate

amount payable is in U.S. Dollars and otherwise at the Prime Rate calculated
daily and compounded monthly, from the date due until paid in full (both before

4.5
Interest Act (Canada).

For the purpose of the Interest Act (Canada), the yearly rate of interest to

equivalent is the rate of interest as so determined multiplied by the actual
number of days in such year divided by 360 or 365, respectively.
The Borrower and the General Partner acknowledge and confirm that this Section
4.5 satisfies the requirements of Section 4 of the Interest Act (Canada) to the
extent it applies to the expression or statement of any interest payable under
this Agreement and that each of the Borrower and the General Partner is able to
calculate the yearly rate or percentage of interest payable under this Agreement
based upon the methodology set out in this Section 4.5. The Borrower and the
General Partner each agree not to plead or assert, whether by way of defence or
otherwise, in any proceeding relating to this Agreement, that the interest
payable hereunder and the calculation of interest herein have not been
adequately disclosed to them, whether pursuant to Section 4 of the Interest Act
(Canada) or any other Applicable Law or legal principle.

4.6
Deemed Reinvestment Principle.

For the purpose of the Interest Act (Canada), the principle of deemed
reinvestment of interest shall not apply to any interest calculation under this

shall repay in full all outstanding Accommodations to each Lender on the

provided that the decision of any Lender to extend the Maturity Date in respect

continuation of any Accommodation shall have been made unlawful or prohibited
due to compliance by any of the Agent and the Lenders in good faith with any
change made after the date hereof in any law or governmental rule, regulation,
guideline or order, or in any interpretation or application of any law or
governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order by any competent authority, or

under this Agreement will be made not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date when due,

the Borrower and the Agent or any of the Lenders or any other Person and free
and clear of, and without reduction for or on account of, any present or future
levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or other withholdings, and if

Accommodation shall be repaid by the Borrower to the Agent or a Lender as
required under this Agreement in the currency in which such Accommodation was

particular currency (the “Proper Currency”) required by any authority having
jurisdiction to be made (or which a Lender elects to accept) in a currency (the
“Other Currency”) other than the Proper Currency, whether pursuant to a judgment
or order of any court or tribunal or otherwise, shall constitute a discharge of
the Borrower’s obligations under this Agreement only to the extent of the amount
of the Proper Currency which each applicable Lender is able, as soon as
practicable after receipt by it of such payment, to purchase with the amount of
the Other Currency so received. If the amount of the Proper Currency which a
Lender is so able to purchase is less than the amount of the Proper Currency
originally due to it, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold such Lender harmless
from and against all losses, costs, damages or expenses which such Lender may
sustain, pay or incur as a result of such deficiency. This indemnity shall
constitute an obligation separate and independent from any other obligation
contained in this Agreement, shall give rise to a separate and independent cause
of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted by the Lenders
from time to time, shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any
judgment or order for a liquidated sum in respect of an amount due under this
Agreement or under any judgment or order and shall not merge in any order of
foreclosure made in respect of any of the security given by the Borrower to or
for the benefit of any Lender.

7.6
General Indemnity.

The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and the Lenders and their directors,
officers, employees, attorneys and agents against and hold each of them harmless
from any loss, liabilities, damages, claims, costs and expenses (including fees
and expenses of counsel to the Agent and the Lenders on a solicitor and his own
client basis and reasonable fees and expenses of all independent consultants)
(each a “Claim”) suffered or incurred by any of them arising out of, resulting

(a)
any Environmental Matter, Environmental Liability or Environmental Proceeding;
and

(b)
any loss or expense incurred in liquidating or re-employing deposits from which
such funds were obtained, which the Agent or Lender may sustain or incur as a
consequence of:

(i)
failure by the Borrower to make payment when due of the principal amount of or
interest on any LIBOR Loan;

(ii)
failure by the Borrower in proceeding with a Borrowing after the Borrower has
given a Borrowing Notice;

(iii)
failure by the Borrower in repaying a Borrowing after the Borrower has given a
Notice of Repayment;

(iv)
any breach, non-observance or non-performance by the Borrower of any of its
obligations, covenants, agreements, representations or warranties contained in
this Agreement; and

(v)
except as otherwise provided in Section 6.1(c)the repayment of any LIBOR Loan
otherwise than on the expiration of any applicable LIBOR Interest Period or the
repayment of any Bankers’ Acceptance otherwise than on the maturity date
thereof.

The indemnity set forth herein shall be in addition to any other obligations or
liabilities of the Borrower to any of the Agent and the Lenders at common law or
otherwise and this Section shall survive the repayment of the Accommodation and
the termination of this Agreement. A certificate of the Lender as to any such
loss or expense, providing details of the calculation of such loss or expense,
shall be prima facie evidence.

7.7
Early Termination of LIBOR Interest Period.

Without limiting Section 7.6, if the Agent is required to arrange for early
termination of any LIBOR Interest Period or to arrange to acquire funds for any
period other than a LIBOR Interest Period to permit the Borrower to repay any
LIBOR Loan, the Borrower shall reimburse the Lenders for all losses and
reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them as a result of the early
termination of the LIBOR Interest Period in question or as a result of entering
into the new arrangement to the extent that such losses and expenses result from
such payment. If any such early termination or new arrangement cannot be
effected by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, the Borrower shall continue to
pay interest to the Agent in U.S. Dollars at the LIBOR Rate specified hereunder
upon an amount of U.S. Dollars equal to the amount of the principal repayment
for the remainder of the then current LIBOR Interest Period. The indemnity set
forth herein shall be in addition to any other obligations or liabilities of the
Borrower to any of the Agent and the Lenders at common law or otherwise and this
Section shall survive the repayment of the Accommodation and the termination of
this Agreement. A certificate of a Lender or Lenders as to any such loss or
expense, providing details of the calculation of such loss or expense, shall be
prima facie evidence.

7.8
Outstanding Bankers’ Acceptances.

If the Credit Facility is terminated at any time prior to the maturity date of
any Bankers’ Acceptance issued hereunder, the Borrower shall pay to the Lenders,
on demand, an amount with respect to each such Bankers’ Acceptance equal to the
total amounts which would be required to purchase in the Canadian Dollars
market, as of 10:00 a.m. on the date of payment of such demand, Government of
Canada treasury bills in an aggregate amount equal to the Face Amount of such
Bankers’ Acceptance having a term to maturity similar to the period from such
demand to maturity of such Bankers’ Acceptance. Upon payment by the Borrower as
required under this paragraph, the Borrower shall have no further liability in
respect of each such Bankers’ Acceptance and the Lenders shall be entitled to
all of the benefits of, and be responsible for all payments to third parties
under, such Bankers’ Acceptance and the Lenders shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Borrower in respect of all amounts which the Borrower may be
required to pay under each such Bankers’ Acceptance to any party other than the
Lenders.

is in writing and shall not operate to excuse the Borrower from full and
complete compliance with this ARTICLE 11 or any other provision hereof on future
occasions.

12.2
Remedies.

Upon the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, and at any time
thereafter if the Default or Event of Default shall then be continuing, the
Lenders in their sole discretion may direct the Agent to give notice to the
Borrower that no further Accommodation will be available hereunder while the
Default or Event of Default continues, whereupon the Lenders shall not be
obliged to provide any further Borrowings to the Borrower while the Default or
Event of Default continues. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, and at
any time thereafter if the Event of Default shall then be continuing, the
Lenders in their sole discretion, and the Agent acting on their behalf, may take
any or all of the following actions:
(a)
demand payment of any principal, accrued interest, fees and other amounts which
are then due and owing in respect of the Accommodation under the Credit Facility
without presentment, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived by the Borrower;

(b)
declare by notice to the Borrower the Credit Facility terminated, whereupon the
same shall terminate immediately without any further notice of any kind;

(c)
commence such legal action or proceedings as it, in its sole discretion, may
deem expedient, including the commencement of enforcement proceedings under the
Loan Documents, all without any additional notice, presentation, demand,
protest, notice of dishonour, entering into of possession of any of the assets,

12.3
Remedies Cumulative.

The rights and remedies of the Lenders and the Agent under this Agreement and

for any other rights or remedies. Nothing contained herein or in the Loan
Documents with respect to the indebtedness or liability of the Borrower to the
Agent and the Lenders or any part thereof, nor any act or omission of the Agent
and the Lenders with respect to the Loan Documents shall in any way prejudice or
affect the rights, remedies and powers of the Agent and the Lenders hereunder or
under the Loan Documents.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 75 -




12.4
Appropriation of Moneys Received.

The Lenders, and the Agent on behalf of the Lenders as between the Lenders and
the Borrower, may from time to time when an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing appropriate any monies received from the Borrower in or toward
payment of such of the obligations of the Borrower hereunder as the Lenders in
their sole discretion may see fit.



12.5
Non-Merger.

The taking of any action or dealing whatsoever by the Lender or the Agent in
respect of the Borrower or any security shall not operate as a merger of any of
the obligations of the Borrower to the Lenders or the Agent or in any way
suspend payment or affect or prejudice the rights, remedies and powers, legal or
equitable, which the Lenders or the Agent may have under Section 12.3 in
connection with such obligations.

12.6
Waiver.

No delay on the part of the Lenders or the Agent in exercising any right or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof. No Default or Event of
Default shall be waived except by a written waiver in accordance with Section
21.1. Each written waiver shall apply only to the Default or Event of Default to
which it is expressed to apply. No written waiver shall preclude the subsequent
exercise by the Lenders or the Agent of any right, power or privilege hereunder
or extend to or apply to any other Default or Event of Default.

12.7
Set-off.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each
Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent
permitted by law (including general principles of common law), to set off and
apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or
final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by it to or for
the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the obligations
of the Borrower under any of the Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not
the Lender has made demand under any of the Loan Documents and although such
obligations may be unmatured or contingent. If an obligation is unascertained,
the Lender may, in good faith, estimate the obligation and exercise its right of
set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to providing the Borrower with an
accounting when the obligation is finally determined. Each Lender shall promptly
notify the Borrower after any set-off and application is made by it, provided
that the failure to give notice shall not affect the validity of the set-off and
application. The rights of the Lenders under this Section 12.7 are in addition
to other rights and remedies (including all other rights of set-off) which the
Lenders may have.

YIELD PROTECTION

Increased Costs.

(a)
Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:

(i)
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan,
insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for
the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender;



RBC – AltaLink (AILP) – 2020 $200M Credit Agreement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 77 -




(ii)
subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this
Agreement or any Accommodations made by it, or change the basis of taxation of
payments to such Lender in respect thereof, except for Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes covered by Section 13.2 and the imposition, or any change in the
rate, of any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender; or

(iii)
impose on any Lender or any applicable interbank market any other condition,
cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Accommodations made by such Lender,
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Accommodation (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Accommodation), or to increase the cost to such
Lender, or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender
hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), then upon
request of such Lender the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered.

(b)
Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting
such Lender, or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender’s holding
company, if any, regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of
reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such
Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the
Commitments of such Lender or the Accommodations made by such Lender, to a level
below that which such Lender or its holding company could have achieved but for
such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the
policies of its holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from
time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or
amounts as will compensate such Lender or its holding company for any such
reduction suffered.



RBC – AltaLink (AILP) – 2020 $200M Credit Agreement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 78 -




(c)
Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as
the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section
(“Additional Compensation”), including a description of the event by reason of
which it believes it is entitled to such compensation, and supplying reasonable
supporting evidence (including, in the event of a Change in Law, a photocopy of
the Applicable Law evidencing such change) and reasonable detail of the basis of
calculation of the amount or amounts, and delivered to the Borrower shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount
shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof. In
the event the Lender subsequently recovers all or part of the Additional
Compensation paid by the Borrower, it shall promptly repay an equal amount to
the Borrower. The obligation to pay such Additional Compensation for subsequent
periods will continue until the earlier of termination of the Accommodation or
the Commitment affected by the Change in Law, change in capital requirement or
the lapse or cessation of the Change in Law giving rise to the initial
Additional Compensation. A Lender shall make reasonable efforts to limit the
incidence of any such Additional Compensation and seek recovery for the account
of the Borrower upon such Borrower’s request at such Borrower’s expense,
provided such Lender in its reasonable determination suffers no appreciable
economic, legal, regulatory or other disadvantage. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions, a Lender shall only be entitled to rely upon the provisions of this
Section 13.1 if and for so long as it is not treating the Borrower in any
materially different or in any less favourable manner than is applicable to any
other customers of such Lender, where such other customers are bound by similar
provisions to the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.1.

(d)
Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand
compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such
Lender’s right to demand such compensation, except that the Borrower shall not
be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased
costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date
that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim
compensation therefore, unless the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
costs or reductions is retroactive, in which case the nine-month period referred
to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

13.2
Taxes.

(a)
Payments Subject to Taxes. If any Credit Party, the Agent or any Lender is
required by Applicable Law to deduct or withhold any Indemnified Taxes
(including any Other Taxes) in respect of any payment by or on account of any
obligation of a Credit Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document, then
(i) the sum payable shall be increased by that Credit Party when payable as
necessary so that after making or allowing for all required deductions and
withholds (including deductions and withholds applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section) the Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions or
withholds been required, (ii) the Credit Party shall make any such deductions or
withholds required to be made by it under Applicable Law and (iii) the Credit
Party shall timely pay the full amount required to be deducted or withheld to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.

(b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the provisions of
paragraph (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law.

(c)
Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the Agent and each
Lender, within 15 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section)
paid by the Agent or such Lender and any penalties, interest and reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted
by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such
payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the
Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error. In the event the Lender subsequently recovers
all or part of the payment made under this Section paid by the Borrower, it
shall promptly repay an equal amount to the Borrower. A Lender shall make
reasonable efforts to limit the incidence of any payments under this Section and
seek recovery for the account of the Borrower upon the Borrower’s request at the
Borrower’s expense, provided such Lender in its reasonable determination suffers
no appreciable economic, legal, regulatory or other disadvantage.

(d)
Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes by a Credit Party to a Governmental Authority, the Credit
Parties shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the
return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 80 -




(e)
Status of Lenders. Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or
reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which the
Borrower is resident for tax purposes, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction
is a party, with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document
shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the Borrower (with a copy to
the Agent), at the time or times prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Agent, such properly completed and executed
documentation prescribed by Applicable Law as will permit such payments to be
made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition any
Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Agent to determine
whether or not such Lender is subject to withholding or information reporting
requirements.

(f)
Treatment of Certain Refunds and Tax Reductions. If the Agent or a Lender
determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes
or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with
respect to which a Credit Party has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 13.2 or that, because of the payment of such Taxes or Other Taxes, it
has benefited from a reduction in Excluded Taxes otherwise payable by it, it
shall pay to the Borrower or other Credit Party, as applicable, an amount equal
to such refund or reduction (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made,
or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower or other Credit Party under this
Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund or
reduction), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Agent or such Lender, as
the case may be, and without interest (other than any net after-Tax interest
paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund). The
Borrower or other Credit Party as applicable, upon the request of the Agent or
such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower or other
Credit Party (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the
relevant Governmental Authority) to the Agent or such Lender if the Agent or
such Lender is required to repay such refund or reduction to such Governmental
Authority. This paragraph shall not be construed to require the Agent or any
Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to
its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person, to
arrange its affairs in any particular manner or to claim any available refund or
reduction.

- 81 -




(g)
FATCA. If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to
U.S. federal withholding Taxes imposed by FATCA, if such Lender were to fail to
comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those
contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as
applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent at the time
or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including
as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such
additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as
may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations
under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s
obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from
such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (g), “FATCA” shall include any
amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

The Agreements in this Section 13.2 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

13.3
Mitigation Obligations: Replacement of Lenders.

(a)
Designation of a Different Lending Office. If any Lender requests compensation
under Section 13.1, or requires the Borrower to pay any additional amount to any
Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 13.2, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
different lending office for funding or booking its Accommodations hereunder or
to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices,
branches or Affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender (with the prior
consent of the Borrower), such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or
reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 13.1 or Section 13.2, as the case may
be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed
cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The
Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.



RBC – AltaLink (AILP) – 2020 $200M Credit Agreement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 82 -




(b)
Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under Section 13.1,
if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 13.2,
if any Lender’s obligations are suspended pursuant to Section 13.4 or if any
Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Accommodations hereunder, then the
Borrower may either, at its sole expense and effort, upon 10 days’ notice to
such Lender and the Agent: (i) repay all outstanding amounts due to such
affected Lender (or such portion which has not been acquired pursuant to clause
(ii) below) and thereupon such Commitment of the affected Lender shall be
permanently cancelled and the aggregate Commitment shall be permanently reduced
by the same amount and the Commitment of each of the other Lenders shall remain
the same; or (ii) require such Lender to assign, without recourse (in accordance
with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,
Article 20), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement
and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations
(which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment),
provided that:

(i)
the Borrower pays the Agent the assignment fee specified in Section 20.1(b)(vi);

(ii)
the assigning Lender receives payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
principal of its Accommodations outstanding and participations in disbursements
under Documentary Credits, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other
amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including
any breakage costs and amounts required to be paid under this Agreement as a
result of prepayment to a Lender) from the assignee (to the extent of such
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the
case of all other amounts);

(c)
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 13.1 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 13.2, such
assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments
thereafter; and

(d)
such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Law.

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if,
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation
cease to apply.

13.4
Illegality.

If any Lender determines that any Applicable Law has made it unlawful, or that
any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or
its applicable lending office to make or maintain any Accommodations, or to
determine or charge interest rates based upon any particular rate, then, on
notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower through the Agent, any obligation
of such Lender with respect to the activity that is unlawful shall be suspended
until such Lender notifies the Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances
giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice,
the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Agent),
prepay or, if conversion would avoid the activity that is unlawful, convert any
Accommodations, or take any necessary steps with respect to any Documentary
Credits in order to avoid the activity that is unlawful. Upon any such
prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the
amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate a different
lending office if such designation will avoid the need for such notice and will
not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially
disadvantageous to such Lender.

ARTICLE 14    
RIGHT OF SETOFF

14.1
Right of Setoff.

If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each of the Lenders and
each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from
time to time to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time
or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and
other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any
such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of any Credit Party against
any and all of the obligations of the Borrower or any guarantor now or hereafter
existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender has made any demand under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Credit
Party may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such
Lender different from the branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on
such indebtedness. The rights of each the Lenders and their respective
Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of setoff, consolidation of accounts and bankers’ lien)
that the Lenders or their respective Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to
promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent after any such setoff and
application, but the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity
of such setoff and application. If any Affiliate of a Lender exercises any
rights under this Section 14.1, it shall share the benefit received in
accordance with Section 15.1 as if the benefit had been received by the Lender
of which it is an Affiliate.

ARTICLE 15    
SHARING OF PAYMENTS BY LENDERS

15.1
Sharing of Payments by Lenders.

If any Lender, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise,
obtains any payment or other reduction that might result in such Lender
receiving payment or other reduction of a proportion of the aggregate amount of
its Accommodations and accrued interest thereon or other obligations hereunder
greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender
receiving such payment or other reduction shall (a) notify the Agent of such
fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the
Accommodations outstanding and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or
make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all
such payments shall be shared by the Lenders rateably in accordance with the
aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective
Accommodations outstanding and other amounts owing them, provided that:
(a)
if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment
giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest;

(b)
the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any
payment made by any Credit Party pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration
for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Accommodations or
participations in disbursements under Documentary Credits to any assignee or
Participant, other than to any Credit Party or any Affiliate of a Credit Party
(as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply); and

(c)
the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (w) any
payment made while no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing in respect
of obligations of the Borrower to such Lender that do not arise under or in
connection with the Loan Documents, (x) any payment made in respect of an
obligation that is secured by a Permitted Lien or that is otherwise entitled to
priority over the Borrower’s obligations under or in connection with the Loan
Documents, (y) any reduction arising from an amount owing to a Credit Party upon
the termination of derivatives entered into between the Credit Party and such
Lender, or (z) any payment to which such Lender is entitled as a result of any
form of credit protection obtained by such Lender.

The Credit Parties consent to the foregoing and agree, to the extent they may
effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each
Credit Party rights of setoff and counterclaim and similar rights of Lenders
with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct
creditor of each Credit Party in the amount of such participation.

ARTICLE 16    
AGENT’S CLAWBACK

16.1
Agent’s Clawback.

(a)
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Agent. Unless the Agent shall have received
notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any advance of funds that
such Lender will not make available to the Agent such Lender’s share of such
advance, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on
such date in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement concerning funding
by Lenders and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the
Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made
its share of the applicable advance available to the Agent, then the applicable
Lender shall pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with
interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made
available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at
a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with prevailing banking industry
practice on interbank compensation. If such Lender pays such amount to the
Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Accommodation included in
such advance. If the Lender does not do so forthwith, the Borrower shall pay to
the Agent forthwith on written demand such corresponding amount with interest
thereon at the interest rate applicable to the advance in question. Any payment
by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have
against a Lender that has failed to make such payment to the Agent.

(b)
Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Agent. Unless the Agent shall have
received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due
to the Agent for the account of any Lender hereunder that the Borrower will not
make such payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment
on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
distribute the amount due to the Lenders. In such event, if the Borrower has not
in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to
the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with
interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at a rate
determined by the Agent in accordance with prevailing banking industry practice
on interbank compensation.

ARTICLE 17    
AGENCY

17.1
Appointment and Authority.

Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Agent to act on its behalf
as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The provisions of this
Article are solely for the benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, and no Credit
Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions.

17.2
Rights as a Lender.

The Person serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers
in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as
though it were not the Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless
otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include
the Person serving as the Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such
Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the
financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in
any kind of business with any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof as if such
Person were not the Agent and without any duty to account to the Lenders.

17.3
Exculpatory Provisions.

(a)
The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set
forth herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Agent:

(i)
shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of
whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

(ii)
shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any
discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly
contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to
exercise as directed in writing by the Majority Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for in the Loan
Documents), but the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its
opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent to liability or that
is contrary to any Loan Document or Applicable Law; and

(iii)
shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents,
have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose,
any information relating to the Borrower or any of their Affiliates that is
communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Agent or any of its
Affiliates in any capacity.



RBC – AltaLink (AILP) – 2020 $200M Credit Agreement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 87 -




(b)
The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with
the consent or at the request of the Majority Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as is necessary, or as the Agent believes in good
faith is necessary, under the provisions of the Loan Documents) or (ii) in the
absence of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Agent shall be
deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing
the Default is given to the Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.

(c)
Except as otherwise expressly specified in this Agreement, the Agent shall not
be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any
statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate,
report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection
herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the
covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein
or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition
specified in this Agreement, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly
required to be delivered to the Agent.


17.4
Reliance by Agent.

The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for
relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument,
document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or
intranet posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have
been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability
for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to
the making of an Accommodation that by its terms must be fulfilled to the
satisfaction of a Lender, the Agent may presume that such condition is
satisfactory to such Lender unless the Agent shall have received notice to the
contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Accommodation or the
issuance of such Documentary Credit. The Agent may consult with legal counsel
(who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

17.5
Indemnification of Agent.

Each Lender agrees to indemnify the Agent and hold it harmless (to the extent
not reimbursed by the Borrower), rateably according to its Applicable Percentage
(and not jointly or jointly and severally) from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges
and disbursements of any counsel, which may be incurred by or asserted against
the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan Documents or the
transactions therein contemplated. However, no Lender shall be liable for any
portion of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses
resulting from the Agent’s gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- 88 -




17.6
Delegation of Duties.

The Agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and
powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or through any one or more
sub-agents appointed by the Agent from among the Lenders (including the Person
serving as Agent) and their respective Affiliates. The Agent and any such
sub-agent may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and
powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The provisions of this
Article and other provisions of this Agreement for the benefit of the Agent
shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and
any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection
with the syndication of the Credit Facilities provided for herein as well as
activities as Agent.

17.7
Replacement of Agent.

(a)
The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the
Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Majority Lenders
shall have the right, with the prior consent of the Borrower, to appoint a
successor, which shall be a Lender having an office in Toronto, Ontario or
Calgary Alberta or an Affiliate of any such Lender with an office in Toronto or
Calgary. The Agent may also be removed at any time by the Majority Lenders upon
30 days’ notice to the Agent and the Borrower as long as the Majority Lenders,
with the prior consent of the Borrower, appoint and obtain the acceptance of a
successor within such 30 days, which shall have an office in Toronto/Calgary, or
an Affiliate of any such Lender with an office in Toronto/Calgary.

(b)
If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Majority Lenders and
shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent
gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Agent may on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications specified in
Section 17.7(a), provided that if the Agent shall notify the Borrower and the
Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such
resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice
and (a) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any
collateral security held by the Agent on behalf of the Lenders under any of the
Loan Documents, the retiring Agent shall continue to hold such collateral
security until such time as a successor Agent is appointed); and (b) all
payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or
through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until
such time as the Majority Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for
above in the preceding paragraph.



RBC – AltaLink (AILP) – 2020 $200M Credit Agreement

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 89 -




(c)
Upon a successor’s appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed
to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of
the former Agent, and the former Agent shall be discharged from all of its
duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not
already discharged therefrom as provided in the preceding paragraph). The fees
payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable
to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such
successor. After the termination of the service of the former Agent, the
provisions of this ARTICLE 17 and of ARTICLE 19 shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such former Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related
Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
while the former Agent was acting as Agent.


17.8
Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders.

Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such
documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or
any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and
information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its
own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished
hereunder or thereunder.

17.9
Collective Action of the Lenders.

Each of the Lenders hereby acknowledges that to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, any collateral security and the remedies provided under the Loan
Documents to the Lenders are for the benefit of the Lenders collectively and
acting together and not severally and further acknowledges that its rights
hereunder and under any collateral security are to be exercised not severally,
but by the Agent upon the decision of the Majority Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for in the Loan
Documents). Accordingly, notwithstanding any of the provisions contained herein
or in any collateral security, each of the Lenders hereby covenants and agrees
that it shall not be entitled to take any action hereunder or thereunder
including, without limitation, any declaration of default hereunder or
thereunder but that any such action shall be taken only by the Agent with the
prior written agreement of the Majority Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for in the Loan
Documents). Each of the Lenders hereby further covenants and agrees that upon
any such written agreement being given, it shall co-operate fully with the Agent
to the extent requested by the Agent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
absence of instructions from the Lenders and where in the sole opinion of the
Agent, acting reasonably and in good faith, the exigencies of the situation
warrant such action, the Agent may without notice to or consent of the Lenders
take such action on behalf of the Lenders as it deems appropriate or desirable
in the interest of the Lenders.

17.10
No Other Duties, etc.

Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of the bookrunners,
arrangers or holders of similar titles, if any, specified in this Agreement
shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities

Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, including any collateral security, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement

21.2
Judgment Currency.

(a)
If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to
convert a sum due to a Lender in any currency (the “Original Currency”) into
another currency (the “Other Currency”), the parties agree, to the fullest
extent that they may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be
that at which, in accordance with normal banking procedures, such Lender could
purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency on the Business Day
preceding the day on which final judgment is given or, if permitted by
Applicable Law, on the day on which the judgment is paid or satisfied.

(b)
The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due in the Original
Currency from it to any Lender under any of the Loan Documents shall,

extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Lender of any sum
adjudged to be so due in the Other Currency, the Lender may, in accordance with
normal banking procedures, purchase the Original Currency with such Other
Currency. If the amount of the Original Currency so purchased is less than the
sum originally due to the Lender in the Original Currency, the Borrower agrees,
as a separate obligation and notwithstanding the judgment, to indemnify the
Lender, against any loss, and, if the amount of the Original Currency so
purchased exceeds the sum originally due to the Lender in the Original Currency,
the Lender shall remit such excess to the Borrower.
