(iii)All obligations arising from the conduct of the PEO Business by Buyer after
the Closing under the Assumed Contracts and the Assumed Leases, but in each case
only to the extent such obligations do not arise from or relate to any breach or
violation by Seller on or prior to the Closing.

(b) Excluded Liabilities.

 



 

(i)Any and all obligations and liabilities of Seller and its direct or indirect
subsidiaries, including SHCM, whether accrued or contingent, known or unknown,
due or not due, that are not Assumed Liabilities (including any liabilities of
Seller relating to successor liability doctrines on the transfer of all or
substantially all the assets of Seller and/or of the PEO Business) shall be and
remain the sole obligations and liabilities of Seller to pay and discharge, and
Buyer shall not be obligated in any respect therefor (collectively, the
“Retained Liabilities”). For the avoidance of doubt and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Retained Liabilities include (a) any
liabilities or obligations arising from the ShiftPixy Business, including the
operations of SHCM, (b) any liabilities or obligations (including Taxes) arising
from Seller’s and/or SHCM’s conduct of the PEO Business prior to the Closing,
(c) all liabilities of any kind of Seller and/or SHCM’s owed to any of its
respective Affiliates, and (d) any event, circumstance or condition first
occurring or existing on or prior to the Closing that with notice, lapse of time
or both would constitute or result in a breach of any provision of any Client
Agreement, in each case notwithstanding the purchase by Buyer of the Purchased
Assets or the Shift Equity Interests at the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt,
workers compensation program liabilities of Seller and SHCM, including reserve
or other liabilities with respect to current or former workers compensation
programs and including the remaining unpaid balance on any settlement related to
any current or former workers’ compensation carriers, shall be Retained
Liabilities. Seller hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and releases
Buyer and its Affiliates from all Retained Liabilities, including any such
liabilities created by statute or common law.



 

(c) Survival; Reimbursement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, Section 2.3(a) and Section 2.3(b) shall survive the
Closing indefinitely. To the extent Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) is required
to and actually pays or satisfies any Retained Liabilities, then Seller hereby
agrees to reimburse Buyer promptly upon request from Buyer accompanied with
reasonable evidence of such Retained Liabilities and payment or satisfaction.

 

ARTICLE 3

PURCHASE PRICE

 

3.1 Aggregate Purchase Price. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the aggregate purchase price (the “Purchase Price”) for the Purchased
Assets and for the Non-Competition Agreement, to be paid by Buyer (or its
designee) to Seller is Nineteen Million and 00/100 Dollars ($19,000,000.00)
(subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) plus the
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, which purchase price shall be comprised
of, and paid in the manner, as follows:

 

(a) An amount equal to Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100 Dollars
($9,500,000.00) (the “Closing Payment”) plus or minus, as applicable, (i) the
amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working Capital exceeds Target Working
Capital, or by which Target Working Capital exceeds the Estimated Working
Capital, as applicable, minus (ii) the Estimated Indebtedness, and minus (iii)
the Estimated Transaction Expenses, payable at Closing by wire transfer of
immediately available funds in accordance with the wire transfer instructions
set forth on Schedule 3.1(a).

 

(b) An amount (the “Installment Amount”), subject to the right of offset
pursuant to Section 8.5 and to the adjustments as set forth in Section 3.5(c)
and Section 7.14, equal to (i) Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand and 00/100
Dollars ($9,500,000.00), payable as set forth in Section 3.4.

 



 -11-

  



 

3.2 Allocation of Purchase Price.

 

(a) The Parties agree to allocate the Purchase Price (plus the Assumed
Liabilities that are properly included in Buyer’s tax basis for the Purchased
Assets) among the Purchased Assets in accordance with Schedule 3.2(a) and this
Section 3.2.

 

(b) The Parties agree that the Purchase Price, including any adjustments
thereto, shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets based on the book value
of such assets for financial accounting purposes, as set forth in Section 3.2
and agree to report the transaction to all Taxing Authorities for all Tax
purposes in accordance with such allocation (including without limitation the
filing of IRS Form 8594, or any successor form, and any state Tax
equivalent(s)). Each Party shall notify and provide the other Parties with
reasonable assistance in the event of an examination, audit or other proceeding
regarding any allocation of the Purchase Price determined pursuant to this
Section 3.2. Except as required by applicable Law, no Party shall not take any
position in any Tax Return, Tax proceeding or audit that is inconsistent with
such allocation.

 

(c) Any indemnification payment treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
shall be reflected as an adjustment to the price allocated to the specific
asset, if any, giving rise to the adjustment and if any such adjustment does not
relate to a specific asset, such adjustment shall be allocated among the
Purchased Assets in a manner consistent with Schedule 3.2(a).

 

3.3 Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer and each of its Affiliates may deduct and withhold from amounts
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
legally obligated to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of any federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the relevant Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made. To the extent any amounts are so withheld by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, such amounts shall be remitted to the appropriate Governmental
Authority within five (5) Business Days of such withholding and Buyer or any of
its Affiliates shall promptly report such withholding and remittance to Seller
and the appropriate Governmental Authority.

 

3.4 Payment of Installment Amount.

 

(a) Installment Payments. Buyer (or its designee) shall pay to Seller the
Installment Amount, in forty-eight (48) consecutive equal monthly installments
in the amount of $197,916.66 (with the exception of the final monthly
installment payment, which shall be equal to the remaining balance of the
Installment Amount as of the day of such payment) (each, an “Installment
Payment”), due no later than the 15th day of each month beginning in April 2020
and ending April, 2024 (such period, the “Installment Period”); provided that if
the Installment Amount is adjusted pursuant to Section 3.5(c) or Section 7.14,
the resulting Installment Amount (the “Adjusted Installment Amount”) shall be
payable in equal monthly installments equal to (i) the Adjusted Installment
Amount minus the amount of the Installment Payments previously paid by Buyer
pursuant to this Section 3.4 divided by (ii) the number of Installment Payments
remaining in the Installment Period (with the exception of the final monthly
installment payment, which amount shall be equal to the remaining balance of the
Adjusted Installment Amount as of the day of such payment); provided, further,
that Buyer (or its designee) shall not pay to Seller any Installment Payments
until and unless Seller complies with its obligations set forth in Section
7.8(e).

 



 -12-

  



 

(b) Subordination.

 

(i) Payment of each of the Installment Payments is subordinate to all
indebtedness, liabilities or other obligations of Buyer under any agreement with
a non-Affiliate, third party evidencing or restricting any indebtedness of the
Buyer including any existing or future indebtedness, supplements, amendments,
restatements, or replacements thereto (collectively, as may be amended from time
to time, the “Buyer Financing Agreements”). The Parties hereby covenant and
agree that no Installment Payment shall be made if there exists, or would exist
after giving effect to any proposed payment, a default or event of default
(either in itself or with the giving of notice or passage of time or both) under
the terms of any Buyer Financing Agreement or if the conditions to making such
proposed payment are not, or would not after giving effect to such proposed
payment be, satisfied under any such Buyer Financing Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any portion of any Installment Payment would not result in a
default or event of default (either in itself or with the giving of notice or
passage of time or both) under the terms of any Buyer Financing Agreement and
the conditions to making such proposed payment are satisfied under such Buyer
Financing Agreement, then the Buyer shall make the largest partial payment which
would not result in such a default or event of default and the balance of the
payment shall not be made. Once the conditions giving rise to any such delay
have been remedied, the Buyer shall, to the extent permitted under the terms of
the applicable Buyer Financing Agreements (or any subordination agreement), pay
to Seller the amount of such delayed payment.

 

(ii) Seller agrees, upon request by (i) any agent (the “Agent”) for any of the
lenders under any such Buyer Financing Agreement (each a “Senior Lender”) or
(ii) any Senior Lender, to execute and deliver a subordination agreement in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Agent or such Senior Lender, as
applicable.

 

3.5 Purchase Price Adjustment.

 

(a) Estimated Working Capital. At least three days prior to the Closing, Seller
shall deliver to Buyer the Estimated Closing Statement.

 

(b) Post-Closing Determination of Actual Purchase Price. Within ninety (90)
calendar days after the Effective Date, Buyer will cause to be prepared and
delivered to Seller a statement setting forth Buyer’s calculation of the Working
Capital and the Purchase Price, minus any Seller Interim Transfers and plus any
Buyer Interim Payable and Expenses (the “Proposed Closing Statement”), prepared
consistently with methods used to prepare the Estimated Closing Statement.
Following receipt of the Proposed Closing Statement, if Seller has any
objections to such calculation as prepared by Buyer, Seller shall deliver
written notice to Buyer of such dispute within thirty (30) days after the date
of such receipt. In the event that Seller does not notify Buyer of a dispute
with respect to the Proposed Closing Statement within such thirty (30) day
period, the Proposed Closing Statement shall be final and binding as the “Final
Closing Statement” in accordance with Section 3.5(c). In the event that Seller
does notify Buyer of a dispute with respect to the Proposed Closing Statement
within such thirty (30) day period, any item in the Proposed Closing Statement
which Seller does not dispute in such notice shall be final and binding on the
parties, and Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve each item
which Seller did dispute in such notice, and, upon Seller’s request, Buyer shall
provide Seller and its Representatives with reasonable access to such Books and
Records of Seller as relate to the specific items of dispute, provided that
access shall be subject to customary confidentiality arrangements and shall not
be provided to the extent such access would breach attorney-client privilege of
Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding such good faith effort, if Buyer
and Seller fail to resolve such dispute within thirty (30) days (or such longer
period, if any, as Buyer and Seller may mutually agree in writing) after Seller
provide such written notice of dispute to Buyer, the specific matter or matters
in dispute will be submitted to an independent, regionally recognized accounting
firm mutually selected by Buyer and Seller (the “Accounting Firm”), which firm
will make a final and binding determination as to such matter or matters in
dispute (and no other matters). If Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on the
Accounting Firm, then the Accounting Firm will be Dixon Hughes Goodman LLP. As
soon as practicable, the Accounting Firm will send to Buyer and Seller its
written determination as to such disputed matter or matters, which, absent
manifest error having a material effect, will be binding on the Parties and
deemed final as of the date delivered to Buyer and Seller (provided that in
resolving any item, the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any such item
greater than the maximum value or less than the minimum value for each such item
claimed by Seller in the Estimated Closing Statement or by Buyer in the Proposed
Closing Statement, as applicable). The Accounting Firm shall allocate its fees,
costs and expenses between Buyer on the one hand, and Seller on the other hand,
based upon the percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded
to each such Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party and each
of Buyer and Seller shall promptly pay their respective share of such fees,
costs and expenses in accordance with the Accounting Firm’s allocation.

 



 -13-

  



 

(c) Payments. Upon resolution of all disagreements related to the Proposed
Closing Statement, the Proposed Closing Statement, as and if modified by Buyer
and Seller pursuant to written agreement, or (as applicable) as may be modified
by the Accounting Firm pursuant to a written report, will be binding on the
Parties and will be referred to as the “Final Closing Statement.” Subject to the
right of offset pursuant to Section 8.5, if the Working Capital on the Final
Closing Statement (the “Final Closing Working Capital”) is less than the
Estimated Working Capital, then Seller shall be obligated to pay to Buyer an
amount equal to (i) the difference between the Estimated Working Capital and the
Final Closing Working Capital plus (ii) any Seller Interim Transfers minus (iii)
any Buyer Interim Payable Expenses by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to or as directed by Buyer within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Closing Statement has been finalized; provided that, if Seller fails to make
such payment within such period, Buyer shall have the right (as its option) to
elect immediately to reduce the Installment Amount by the aggregate amount of
such payment not so made by providing written notice of such election to Seller.
If the Final Closing Working Capital is greater than Estimated Working Capital,
then an amount equal to (x) the difference between the Final Closing Working
Capital and Estimated Working Capital minus (y) any Seller Interim Transfers
plus (z) any Buyer Interim Payable Expenses shall be added to the balance of the
Installment Amount. Any such payment or adjustment under this Section 3.5(c)
shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, which jurisdiction
is listed on Schedule 5.1(a) and has all requisite power and authority to own

Seller has delivered to Buyer true and complete copies of the Governing
Documents for Seller. SHCM is duly qualified or licensed to conduct business as
a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction set forth on
Schedule 5.1(a), which jurisdictions comprise all of the jurisdictions in which
the nature of the PEO Business or the ownership or leasing of SHCM’s assets and
properties makes such qualification or registration necessary.

 

(b) Seller does not own or otherwise hold, directly or indirectly, any stock,
membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or other
equity interest in any Person.

 

5.2 Power and Authority. Seller has all requisite power and authority to enter
into, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and all other
Transaction Agreements and to carry out the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other
Transaction Agreements by Seller, and the consummation of the transactions

Transaction Agreements are, and any documents or instruments to be executed and
delivered by Seller pursuant hereto will be, legal, valid and binding
obligations of Seller enforceable in accordance with their terms.

 

5.3 Governmental Authorizations. None of the execution, delivery and performance
by Seller of this Agreement or any Transaction Agreement requires or will
require any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental
Authority.

 

5.4 Non-Contravention; Consents; Restrictive Documents.

 

(a) Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.4(a), the execution, delivery and
performance by Seller of this Agreement and each of the Transaction Agreements
does not (i) violate the Governing Documents of Seller, (ii) violate, in any
material respect, any applicable Law or Order, (iii) require any filing with or
consent or approval of, or require the giving of any notice to (including under

Seller is or will be a party as of the Closing), (iv) result in a material
violation or breach of, conflict in any material way with, constitute (with or
without due notice or lapse of time or both) a material default under, or give
rise to any right of termination, cancellation, or acceleration of, any right or
obligation of Seller, or to a loss of any material benefit to which Seller is
entitled, under any agreement or other instrument binding upon or providing
rights to Seller or any franchise, permit, license, or other similar
authorization held by Seller, or (v) result in the creation or imposition of any
Lien on any Purchased Asset.

 

(b) Seller is not subject to, or a party to, any charter, bylaw, mortgage, Lien,
lease, license, franchise, permit, instrument, Law, Order, or any other
restriction that (a) to the Knowledge of Seller, has had or would reasonably be

would prevent consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Transaction Agreements, compliance by Seller with this Agreement and the
Transaction Agreements, or the continued operation of the PEO Business in the
Ordinary Course of Business, or (c) to the Knowledge of Seller, would restrict

 -17-

  



 

5.5 Financial Statements.

 

(a) Attached hereto as Exhibit F are true and complete copies of the (i) audited
financial statements of Seller as of August 31, 2017, August 31, 2018, and
August 31, 2019 and the related audited statements of income, members’ equity
and cash flows and all notes and schedules thereto for the periods of twelve
(12) months then ended, and (ii) unaudited balance sheet of Seller as at
November 30, 2019, and the related unaudited statement of income for the period
of three (3) months then ended (clause (ii), the “Interim Financial Statements”
and clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the “Financial Statements”). Each
Financial Statement: (1) is true, accurate and complete in all material
respects, (2) was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated therein, subject to normal year-end adjustments
and the absence of notes, none of which would be material, either individually
or in the aggregate, (3) is consistent with the Books and Records of Seller
(which, in turn, are accurate and complete in all material respects) and (4)
fairly presents the financial condition of Seller as of the respective dates
thereof and the operating results of Seller for the periods covered thereby.

 

(b) Neither Seller nor SHCM has any material liabilities (contingent or
otherwise) in respect of the PEO Business and there is no existing condition,
fact or set of circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liabilities of Seller or SHCM in respect of the PEO Business, except
for: (i) performance obligations under Contracts described in Section 5.7, none
of which involves non-performance, default or a breach, (ii) liabilities
reflected and adequately reserved in all material respects for on the face of
the balance sheet included in the Interim Financial Statements, (iii)
liabilities of the type set forth on the face of the balance sheet included in
the Interim Financial Statements which have arisen on or after the date of such
balance sheet in the Ordinary Course of Business of Seller or SHCM (none of
which is a liability for breach of contract or violation of Law or involves a
tort, infringement, claim, lawsuit, warranty or environmental, health or safety
matter), and (iv) as described in Schedule 5.5(b).

 

(c) Seller and SHCM have established and adhered to a system of internal
accounting controls which are reasonably designed to provide assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting of the PEO Business. There has not been
(i) any material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls used by
Seller or SHCM in respect of the PEO Business, (ii) any fraud, willful
misconduct or misrepresentation with respect to the PEO Business that involves
an employee of Seller or SHCM who has or had a role in the preparation of
financial statements or the internal accounting controls used by Seller or SHCM,
in case each, in connection with the preparation of such financial statements or
adherence to such internal accounting controls or (iii) any claim or allegation
in writing regarding any of the foregoing.

 

5.6 Title, Condition and Sufficiency of Purchased Assets; Workers Compensation
Reserves.

 

(a) Seller has, and at the Closing Seller will transfer to Buyer, good, valid
and marketable title to all of the Purchased Assets free and clear of all Liens,
and subject to no restrictions with respect to transferability.

 

(b) All of the Equipment and Other Tangible Personal Property included within
the Purchased Assets is in good operating condition and repair and free from any
defects, except for such minor defects arising from ordinary wear and tear that
do not materially interfere with the continued use thereof in the conduct of
normal operations.

 



 -18-

  



 

(c) The Purchased Assets are sufficient for the conduct of the PEO Business and
constitute all of the assets reasonably necessary for the conduct of the PEO
Business, in each instance in the Ordinary Course of Business.

 

(d) SHCM maintains adequate workers’ compensation insurance liability loss
reserves for its self-insured retention risks under the workers’ compensation
insurance policies issued to SHCM and its Affiliates (“Workers’ Compensation
Reserves”) to conduct its business as presently conducted as of the Closing
Date. Any reserves for self-insured worker’s compensation risks of SHCM on the
Closing Date have been computed to fund known and unknown liabilities in
accordance with commonly accepted actuarial standards consistently applied, and
they are fairly stated in accordance with sound actuarial principles. SHCM has
not made any material change in its accounting methods, principles or practices
relating to its Workers’ Compensation Reserves, or to its reserving practices
for its Workers’ Compensation Reserves, except as required by GAAP or applicable
Law.

 

5.7 Contracts and Commitments.

 

(a) Except for this Agreement and the Transaction Agreements and except as
disclosed on Schedule 5.7, none of Seller, SHCM or their respective Affiliates
is a party to or bound by any of the following agreements in respect of the PEO

Material Adverse Effect;

historically operated;

 

 

 

 

(xix)any other Contract involving $10,000 or more that is not cancelable by
Seller or SHCM on thirty (30) days’ or less notice without penalty; or

 

 

 

 

(xx)any other Contract not made in the Ordinary Course of Business that is
material to Seller, taken as a whole.

6.4 No Breach. The consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and the
execution, delivery and consummation of this Agreement and the Transaction

organizational documents of Buyer or (b) any applicable Laws.

 

6.5 Independent Investigation. The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it has
conducted to its satisfaction, its own independent investigation of the
condition, operations and business of the Seller and SHCM and, in making its

7.2 Employee and Employee Benefits Matters.

 

(a) Offer of Employment.

 



 

(i)Effective as of the date of the Closing, Seller shall cause the employment of
all Employees (other than those individuals who are not actively employed due to
short-term disability or approved leave of absence, whose employment shall be
terminated upon their return to active employment) listed in Schedule 7.2(a)(i)
to be terminated and shall promptly pay each such Employee for all wages,
salary, bonuses and commissions earned and for all vacation or sick time accrued
by such Employee through the date of such termination of employment. Except as
set forth on Schedule 7.2(a)(i), effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall offer
employment to Employees terminated in accordance with the preceding sentence
(except that with respect to those individuals on short-term disability or an
approved leave of absence, subject to their commencement of active employment
with Buyer within 30 days of their expected return date, Buyer shall offer
employment to such individuals upon their return from short-term disability or
approved leave of absence), subject to such Employee satisfying Buyer’s standard
pre-employment background check and drug screening, on terms and conditions
substantially equivalent (in the aggregate) to those in effect on the Agreement
Date. All Employees to whom Buyer offers employment and who accept such
employment are herein referred to as the “Transferred Employees.” Nothing in
this Section 7.2 shall limit Buyer’s authority to terminate the employment of
any Transferred Employee at any time and for whatever reason.

 

 

 

 

(ii)Seller shall be solely responsible for any liability, claim or expense with
respect to any Seller Benefit Plan, compensation, or any employment related
matter of any nature, whether incurred before or after the Closing, that arises
out of or relates to the employment relationship between Seller or any of its
Affiliates and any Employee or former employee. Without limiting the foregoing,
Seller shall be responsible for the payment of any benefits under any Seller
Benefit Plan that become due to any Employees as a result of their termination
by Seller in accordance with Section 7.2(a)(i) and Seller shall be solely
responsible for any claim for severance by an Employee or former employee of
Seller arising solely as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



 

(b) Service Credit. Buyer shall cause the Transferred Employees to receive
service credit for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting and solely
in cases of vacation and severance benefits, benefit accruals (“Service Credit”)
under any employee benefit plan, program or policy (including any vacation or
paid time off program or policy, but excluding any equity or equity-based plan,
program or policy) sponsored, maintained or contributed to by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates for the Transferred Employees after the Closing, to the same
extent service is recognized under comparable plans, programs and policies
sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Seller immediately prior to the
Closing. Nothing in this Section 7.2(b) shall require the crediting of service
that would operate to duplicate any benefits or funding of any such benefits.

 

(c) Terms of Coverage. With respect to the welfare benefit plans, programs and
arrangements in which the Transferred Employees participate after the Closing,
Buyer shall waive, or cause to be waived, any limitations on benefits relating
to pre-existing conditions (if any) or requirement for evidence of insurability
to the extent such limitation had already been satisfied under the Seller
Benefit Plans.

 

(d) Employment-at-Will. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
7.2, the Transferred Employees employed by Buyer are employed-at-will and the
terms of the provisions of this Section 7.2 do not confer employee contract
rights to any of the Transferred Employees.

 



 -31-

  



 

(e) COBRA Benefits. To the extent required by Law with respect to Transferred
Employees, Buyer will make available continuation coverage pursuant to the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended (“COBRA”)
under a group health plan or insurance policy maintained by Buyer to each
individual who becomes an “M&A Qualified Beneficiary” (as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 54.4980B-5 Q&A-4) as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

7.3 Use of Names and Logos. Seller hereby agrees that upon the Closing, Seller
shall cease, and shall cause its Affiliates to cease, and Buyer shall have the
sole right to the use of the Marks and other names that are Purchased Assets and
any substantially similar Marks or other names and any Marks, other names,
identifying symbols, logos, emblems, signs or insignia related thereto or
containing or comprising the foregoing, or otherwise used in the PEO Business,
including any name or Mark confusingly similar thereto and the Marks related
thereto (collectively, the “Company Marks”). Seller shall not, and shall not
permit its Affiliates to, use any of the Company Marks or any confusingly
similar variation or simulation thereof in any manner anywhere in the world
after Closing. At the Closing, Seller shall take all actions necessary to convey
any domain names included in the Purchased Assets to Buyer. Seller hereby
appoints Buyer as its attorney-in-fact to file all documents and to update all
information necessary to reflect such conveyance on or after the Closing. As
soon as practicable after the Closing, but no later than two (2) Business Days
following the Closing, Seller shall file, and shall cause Affiliates to file,
all documentation required to change its name and any “d/b/a” of it or any of
its Affiliates to a name that does not include the word “Shiftable” or “SHCM,”
or any confusingly similar words, and Seller will not, thereafter adopt such
name in connection with any business. If reasonably requested by Buyer, Seller
shall provide evidence of compliance with this Section 7.3 to the Buyer.

 

7.4 Confidential Information. Seller will treat and hold as confidential all of
the Confidential Information and refrain from using any of the Confidential
Information except in connection with the Transaction Agreements or as may be
necessary or appropriate in the operation of the PEO Business prior to Closing.
In the event that Seller is requested or required pursuant to written or oral
question or a request for information or documents from any Governmental
Authority, including the Securities Exchange Commission, to disclose any
Confidential Information, the Seller shall notify Buyer promptly of the request
or requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or waive
compliance with the provisions of this Section 7.4. If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller is, on the advice
of counsel, compelled to disclose any Confidential Information to any
Governmental Authority, or Seller is compelled by a court order or subpoena to
disclose to private party, such Person may disclose the Confidential Information
to the Governmental Authority; provided, however, that such Person shall first,
at Buyer’s sole cost and expense, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, at
the reasonable request of Buyer, an order or other assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to such portion of the Confidential Information
required to be disclosed by such Person as Buyer shall designate. The foregoing
provisions shall not apply to any Confidential Information that is generally
available to the public immediately prior to the time of disclosure unless such
Confidential Information is so available due to the actions of Seller or its
respective Affiliates or Representatives.

 

7.5 Inquiries; UCC Matters. From and after the Closing, Seller will promptly
refer all inquiries with respect to ownership of the Purchased Assets or the PEO
Business to Buyer. In addition, Seller shall execute such documents and
financing statements as Buyer may reasonably request from time to time to
evidence transfer of the Purchased Assets to Buyer, including any necessary
assignment of financing statements.

 



 -32-

  



 

7.6 Actions of Governmental Authorities. In the event any fines, penalties,
notices of violation, complaints or enforcement actions of any Governmental
Authority occur(s) or are threatened because of or in connection with a breach
of any of the representations and warranties set forth in Article 5, without
limiting any other rights, remedies, obligations or liability hereunder, Seller
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such fine, penalty, notice of
violation, complaint or other action to be issued in the name of and/or directed
to the Seller if such action is reasonably based on the act or omission of
Seller.

 

7.7 Access to Data Servers. Seller shall provide continuing access to its data
servers storing data of the PEO Business and/or of the Purchased Assets and will
use its reasonable best efforts to ensure the transfer of all of the PEO
Business’ data and information to Buyer in a generally useable format.

 

7.8 Tax Matters.

 

(a) Payroll Tax Reporting. Buyer and Seller agree that for the taxable year that
includes the date prior to the Effective Date, they will follow the Alternate
Procedure of Rev. Proc. 2004-53, 2004-34 IRB 320, so that Buyer shall be
responsible for employment Tax reporting with respect to Transferred Employees
for that calendar year; provided that Seller provides Buyer with all employment
tax information reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with Buyer’s
preparation and filing of employment Tax Returns for the Transferred Employees
for that year. Nothing in this Section 7.8 shall relieve Seller of any liability
for failure to properly withhold or pay over any such employment Taxes for the
portion of the year during which the Transferred Employees are employed by
Seller.

 

(b) Mutual Cooperation. Buyer and Seller jointly covenant and agree that, from
and after the Closing, Buyer and Seller will each use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with each other in connection with any action, suit,
proceeding, investigation or audit of the other relating to (a) the preparation
of an audit of any Tax Return of Seller or Buyer for all periods prior to the
Closing Date and (b) any audit of Buyer and/or any audit of Seller with respect
to the sales, transfer and similar Taxes imposed by the laws of any state or
political subdivision thereof, relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In furtherance hereof, Buyer and Seller further covenant and agree to
promptly respond to all reasonable inquiries related to such matters and to
provide, to the extent reasonably possible, substantiation of transactions and
to make available and furnish appropriate documents and personnel in connection
therewith. Seller and Buyer shall (i) each provide the other with such
assistance as may reasonably be requested by either of them in connection with
the preparation of any Tax Return, any audit or other examination by any Taxing
authority or any judicial or administrative proceeding with respect to Taxes,
(ii) each retain and provide the other with any records or other information
which may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit, examination or proceeding, and
(iii) each provide the other with any final determination of any such audit or
examination, proceeding or determination that affects any amount required to be
shown on any Tax Return of the other for any period (which shall be maintained
confidentially). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall
retain, until the applicable statutes of limitations (including any extensions)
have expired, copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules and other
records or information that may be relevant to such Tax Returns for all Tax
periods or portions thereof ending before the Effective Date and shall not
destroy or otherwise dispose of any such records without first providing Buyer
with a reasonable opportunity to review and copy the same.

 

(c) No new elections with respect to Taxes, or any changes in current elections
with respect to Taxes, affecting the Purchased Assets or the PEO Business shall
be made after the date hereof without the prior written consent of Buyer.

 



 -33-

  



 

(d) Seller shall be responsible for all state and local sales, use, transfer,
real property transfer, documentary stamp, recording and other similar Taxes
arising from and with respect to the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets
(collectively, “Transaction Taxes”). To the extent permitted by applicable Law,
Buyer and Seller agree to reasonably cooperate with each other to complete any
and all exemption certificates or other documents that exempt any of the
Purchase Price from any of the Transaction Taxes prior to either the Closing or
the due date for such Transaction Tax.

 

(e) Promptly after Closing, (i) in no event later than 7 days following Closing,
Seller shall pay (on behalf of SHCM, in the case of liabilities of SHCM) all
Taxes that were due and payable (including past due amounts) from Seller or SHCM
as of January 1, 2020 to the appropriate Taxing Authority, and (ii) in no event
later than January 31, 2020, (x) all payroll Taxes (including those for which
Seller or SHCM is responsible as a withholding agent) for which Seller or SHCM
is liable in connection with payments made prior to January 1, 2020 and (y) all
Damages related thereto to the appropriate Taxing Authority and provide
evidence, by February 15, 2020, to Buyer, satisfactory to Buyer in its sole
discretion, of such payment.

 

7.9 Proration of Expenses and Taxes. Except to the extent already accounted for
in Working Capital, any expenses, payments in lieu of Taxes, rents, utility
expenses, prepaid expenses, insurance, if any, and other similar matters shall
be prorated (based on the number of days in the particular period in question)
as of the Effective Date. Seller shall pay those expenses that equitably relate
to periods of time prior to the Effective Date, and Buyer shall pay those
expenses that equitably relate to periods of time after the Effective Date. At
Closing and at all appropriate times after Closing, Seller and Buyer shall
promptly pay to the other such amounts as are required to effectuate such
proration.

 

7.10 Third Party Payments.

 

(a) Following the Closing, if any Party receives a payment from a third party
that, pursuant to the terms hereof, should have been paid to another Party, the
Party who receives the payment agrees to hold in trust and promptly remit such
payment to the Party entitled thereto. If either Party receives a payment from a
customer that cannot be identified to a specific invoice or obligation, the
recipient shall, if reasonable under the circumstances, inquire of the customer
as to the intended application thereof and, lacking a response, the payment
shall be applied to the oldest outstanding undisputed invoice relating to the
payor.

 

(b) Following the Closing, Seller agrees to pay in full and discharge, or
otherwise fully and promptly resolve, all of the Retained Liabilities (a) in the
Ordinary Course of Business and, in any event, in accordance with their stated
terms, if applicable, and (b) in a manner that is not detrimental to any
relationships of the Buyer or the PEO Business with lessors, employees,
contractors, customers, suppliers or others.

 

(c) If and to the extent that it is determined that (i) legal title to or
beneficial or other interest in all or part of any Excluded Assets or (ii)
obligation or liability in all or part of any Retained Liability (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, and Tax liability) has been transferred to Buyer, or
that legal title to or beneficial or other interest in all or part of any
Purchased Assets has not been transferred to Buyer, the Parties, as applicable,
shall, promptly upon the request of another Party, (a) execute all such
agreements, deeds or other documents as may be necessary for the purposes of
transferring such assets (or part thereof) or liability or the relevant
interests or obligation in them to the other Party; (b) complete all such
further acts or things as the other Party may reasonably direct in order to
transfer such assets or liability or the relevant interests or obligations in
them to the other Party; and (c) hold the asset (or part thereof), or liability
or relevant interest or obligation in the asset or liability, on trust for the
other Party (to the extent permitted by applicable Law) until such time as the
transfer is validly effected to vest the asset (or part thereof) or relevant
interest in the asset to the other Party.

 



 -34-

  



 

7.11 Transition Assistance. Seller agrees to take steps to facilitate Buyer’s
relationship with customers, suppliers, lessors, licensors and other business
associates of the PEO Business, and will not in any manner take any action which
is designed, intended, or might reasonably be anticipated to have the effect of
discouraging customers, suppliers, lessors, licensors and other business
associates of the PEO Business from maintaining the same business relationships
with Buyer after the Closing as were maintained with Seller prior to the
Closing.

 

7.12 Public Announcements. Except to the extent required by Law, none of the
Parties shall issue, or cause to be issued, any press release or public
announcement of any kind concerning the transactions contemplated hereby without
the consent of the other Parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); and in the event any such press release,
public announcement or other disclosure is required by Law, the Parties will
consult prior to the making thereof and use their best efforts to agree upon a
mutually satisfactory text.

 

7.13 Nonassignable Contracts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
this Agreement and the other agreements and documents contemplated hereby shall
not be deemed to constitute an assignment of any Assumed Contract if the consent
of a third party is required for such assignment and such consent is not given
or if such assignment otherwise would constitute a breach of, or cause a loss of
contractual benefits under, any such Assumed Contract, and the Buyer shall
assume no liabilities under any such Assumed Contract. Without in any way
limiting Seller’s obligation to obtain all consents and waivers necessary for
the assignment of the Contracts to the Buyer hereunder, if any such Assumed
Contract is not assigned at Closing pursuant to this Section 7.13, Seller shall
cooperate with the Buyer following the Closing in any reasonable arrangement
designed to provide the Buyer with the rights and benefits (subject to the
obligations) under any such Assumed Contract, including enforcement for the
benefit of the Buyer of any and all rights of each applicable Seller against any
other party arising out of any such Assumed Contract by such other party and, if
requested by the Buyer, acting as an agent on behalf of the Buyer or as the
Buyer shall otherwise reasonably require. With respect to any such Assumed
Contract, following the Closing Seller shall continue use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consents or waivers. Upon the receipt of any
such consent or waiver, Seller shall promptly assign such Assumed Contract to
the Buyer for no additional consideration.

 

7.14 Payment Obligations. Notwithstanding the obligations in Article 3, or
anything else to the contrary herein, Buyer and Seller agree that if in the
12-month period after the Effective Date, the total gross payroll processed from
the client service agreements with customers of Seller included in the Assigned
Contracts as of the date hereof and from all New Contracts, taken as whole,
during such 12-month period (the “Total Annual Post-Closing Payroll”) decreases
below 90% of the gross payroll that was processed by Seller for the twelve (12)
months ended December 31, 2019 (the “Baseline TTM Payroll”), the aggregate
Purchase Price payable hereunder shall be reduced by a percentage equal to the
difference between (i) 90% and (ii) the percentage that the Total Annual
Post-Closing Payroll as of the 12th month following the Effective Date
represents of the Baseline TTM Payroll (the total dollar amount of such
reduction, the “Purchase Price Reduction”), and such Purchase Price Reduction
shall be satisfied in the manner and order of recovery set forth in clauses (a)
through and including (b) of Section 8.5. Buyer shall be permitted to conduct
its business after the Closing based on the business judgment of Buyer and its
authorized representatives; provided, however, that Buyer shall not take any
actions, or omit to take any actions, in bad faith with the specific intent and
purpose of causing a Purchase Price Reduction to occur.

(vi) the increase of premium due to carriers under worker’s compensation
insurance arrangements for periods prior to Closing versus the estimated

hold harmless, defend and indemnify Seller, its stockholders, members,
directors, managers, officers, employees, agents, representatives, successors
and assigns (each hereinafter individually referred to as a “Seller Indemnified
Party” and, collectively, the “Seller Indemnified Parties”), from and against

associated Damages for purposes of determining indemnification shall be $200.

8.2 Survival.

 

(a) The representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement shall survive the Closing and expire as follows (the period through
the relevant expiration date being referred to as the “Indemnification Period”
in this Agreement):

 



 

(i)the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.1 (Organization;
Capitalization; Subsidiaries), 5.2 (Power and Authority), 5.3 (Governmental

with Laws; Governmental Authorizations) and 5.18 (Environmental Protection) (the

expiration of the last to expire of any applicable statute of limitations
period;

 

 

 

 

(iii)all other representations and warranties set forth in Article 5 and Article
6 of this Agreement shall survive until the second (2nd) anniversary of the
Closing; and

 

 

 

 

(iv)all covenants and other agreements of the Parties contained in this
Agreement will survive the Closing indefinitely or for the period explicitly
specified therein.



 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims for indemnification pursuant to this
Article 8 for breaches of any representations and warranties or covenants
arising from fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach of this
Agreement shall survive indefinitely.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, any representation or warranty in
respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the
time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentence
with respect to any claim for Damages with respect to which any Indemnified
Party has validly given notice in accordance with Section 8.3 on or prior to the
date such indemnification would otherwise terminate in accordance with this
Section 8.2 that is pending or settled but not paid (an “Outstanding Claim”), as
to which the obligation of the Indemnifying Party shall continue solely with
respect to the Outstanding Claim until the liability of the Indemnifying Party
shall have been determined pursuant to this Article 8.

 

8.3 Claim Procedure.

 

(a) Claim Notice. An Indemnified Party seeking indemnity under this Article 8
shall give written notice (a “Claim Notice”) to the Party from whom
indemnification is sought (an “Indemnifying Party”) promptly upon becoming aware
of the matters forming the basis of such claim, whether the Damages sought arise
from matters solely between the Parties. The Claim Notice shall contain (i) a
description and, if known, estimated amount (the “Claimed Amount”) of any
Damages incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party,
(ii) a reasonable explanation of the basis for the Claim Notice to the extent of
facts then known by the Indemnified Party, and (iii) a demand for payment of
those Damages.

 



 -37-

  



 

(b) Response to Claim Notice. Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice,
the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response
(the “Response”) in which the Indemnifying Party shall either:

 



 

(i)agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the Claimed Amount in accordance
with a payment and distribution method reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party; or

 

 

 

 

(ii)dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed
Amount (in such an event, the Response shall be referred to as an “Objection
Notice”);



 

provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, the failure to deliver an Objection
Notice within 30 days after the delivery of a Claim Notice shall constitute an
agreement to the Claimed Amount in accordance with Section 8.3(b)(i).

 

(c) Contested Claims. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its obligation to pay a
Claimed Amount pursuant to an Objection Notice, the Indemnifying Party and
Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to reach an agreement as to the disputed
matter. If the Indemnifying Party and Indemnitee shall have failed to resolve
such disputed matters within 30 days from the Indemnitee’s receipt of the
Objection Notice, then the Parties may submit the matter to a court of competent
jurisdiction as set forth in Section 10.8 prior to the expiration of the
relevant Indemnification Period set forth in Section 8.2.

 

(d) Third Party Claims.

 



 

(i)If an Indemnified Party receives notice or otherwise learns of the assertion
by a Person other than a Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party of
any claim with respect to which the Indemnifying Party may be obligated to
provide indemnification under this Article 8, the Indemnified Party shall give
written notification to the Indemnifying Party within five days thereafter. Such
notice shall be accompanied by reasonable supporting documentation submitted by
such third party (to the extent then in the possession of the Indemnified Party)
and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified
Party) the facts constituting the basis for such suit or proceeding and the
amount of the claimed Damages; provided, however, that no delay or deficiency on
the part of the Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying Party shall
relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation hereunder except
and then solely to the extent of any Damage caused by or arising out of such
failure or to the extent such delay or deficiency prejudices or otherwise
adversely affects the rights of the Indemnifying Party with respect thereto.
Within 20 days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may,
upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of
such suit or proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party may not assume control of
the defense of a suit or proceeding involving criminal liability or if the
Damages thereunder may exceed the Indemnity Cap. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so assume control of such defense, the Indemnified Party shall control such
defense.



 



 -38-

  



 



 

(ii)The Party not controlling such defense (the “Non-controlling Party”) may
participate therein at its own expense; provided, however, that if the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party
concludes, upon the written opinion of counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests or defenses available with
respect to such suit or proceeding, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
to the Indemnified Party shall be considered “Damages” for purposes of this
Agreement. The Party controlling such defense (the “Controlling Party”) shall
keep the Non-controlling Party reasonably advised of the status of such suit or
proceeding and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The
Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with such information
as it may have with respect to such suit or proceeding (including copies of any
summons, complaint or other pleading that may have been served on such Party and
any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or
asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with and assist the
Controlling Party in the defense of such suit or proceeding.

 

 

 

 

(iii)The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry
of any judgment arising from, any such suit or proceeding without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that the
consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required for non-criminal matters
if the Indemnifying Party agrees to pay any amounts payable pursuant to such
settlement or judgment and such settlement or judgment includes a full, complete
and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from further Liability. The
Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any such suit or proceeding without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).



 

8.4 Limitations Upon Seller’s and Buyer’s Liability.

 

(a) Threshold Amount. Subject to clause (c) below, no Indemnified Party shall
make a claim against an Indemnifying Party for indemnification for Damages under
this Article 8 until the aggregate amount of all Damages (including costs and
expenses) incurred by Indemnitees for Seller Misrepresentations or Buyer
Misrepresentations, as applicable, exceeds $100,000 (the “Threshold Amount”), in
which event the indemnification obligations of the Indemnifying Party shall be
effective and apply with respect to the first dollar of such Damages and not
just the amount that exceeds the Threshold Amount.

 

(b) Indemnity Cap. Subject to clause (c) below, notwithstanding anything else
contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the maximum liability of an
Indemnifying Party for claims for indemnification arising out of any and all
Misrepresentations shall not exceed $5,000,000 (the “Indemnity Cap”).

 



 -39-

  



 

(c) Limitation. In no event shall the Threshold Amount or the Indemnity Cap
apply to any claims for Damages arising or resulting from (i) any Seller
Misrepresentation or any Buyer Misrepresentation with respect to Fundamental
Representations, or (ii) fraud, gross negligence or intentional breach of this
Agreement; and no indemnification payment made by any Indemnifying Party by
reason of, resulting from or arising out of any Fundamental Representations,
fraud, gross negligence or intentional breach of this Agreement shall be
considered in determining whether the Threshold Amount or Indemnity Cap has been
exceeded. In no event shall the Threshold Amount apply to any claims for Damages
arising or resulting from Seller Misrepresentations with respect to Special
Representations, and no indemnification payment made by any Indemnifying Party
by reason of, resulting from or arising out of any Special Representations shall
be considered in determining whether the Threshold Amount has been exceeded.

 

(d) Investigation. The representations, warranties and covenants of Seller made
herein, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties hereunder, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by or
as a result of any information furnished to, or any investigation made by or
knowledge of, Buyer.

 

(e) Materiality Qualifiers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, for purposes of determining (a) whether a breach of a representation or
warranty exists for purposes of this Agreement, (b) the amount of Damages
arising from such a breach for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller
Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under this Agreement and (c)
whether the Threshold Amount or Indemnity Cap has been exceeded, each such
representation and warranty shall be read without giving effect to any
qualification that is based on materiality, including the words “material,”
“Material Adverse Effect,” “Material Adverse Change,” “in any material respect”
and other uses of the word “material” or words of similar meaning (and shall be
treated as if such words were deleted from such representation or warranty).

 

(f) Insurance Proceeds. The amount of any Damages that may be subject to
indemnification hereunder will be determined net of the sum of any amounts
actually recovered by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under insurance policies in
respect of the related matter, in each case net of (i) any reasonable,
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in collecting such proceeds
(including any insurance deductible or retention amount) and (ii) the present
value of any insurance premium increases resulting therefrom.

 

8.5 Order of Recovery. Any indemnification or payment to which Buyer Indemnified
Parties are entitled under this Agreement shall be satisfied, in the following
priority:

 

(a) First, by offset against the remaining unpaid portion of the Installment
Amount; and

 

(b) Second, to the extent such indemnification or payment obligation exceeds the
remaining unpaid portion of the Installment Amount, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from Seller.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for any claims for indemnification pursuant to
Section 8.1(a) relating directly or indirectly to any failure by Seller (or any
Affiliate of Seller) to (i) make when due all required federal, state and local
Tax filings, and timely pay all Taxes due, in each case, related to the
compensation processed by Seller (or any Affiliate of Seller) on behalf of a
customer with respect to its employees or (ii) timely pay all wages or other
compensation due to the employees of such customer in accordance with such
customer’s employee payroll practices and the requirements of its service
agreement with Seller, the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have the right to
seek satisfaction of such claim by any method provided in clauses (a)-(b) above
in their sole discretion without regard to priority.

8.6 Characterization of Payments. All indemnification payments made under this
Agreement shall be treated by the Parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
to the extent permitted by Law.

9.6 Governing Law. All matters arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement and its exhibits and schedules (whether arising in contract, tort,
equity or otherwise), including the construction and interpretation thereof,
shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to
conflicts of laws principles that would result in the application of the laws of
another jurisdiction to any such matters.

 

9.7 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED
AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT THE OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH
WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO

9.8 Submission to Jurisdiction. Each Party irrevocably agrees that any legal
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by the other
Party or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined in any State
or federal court in the State of Delaware, in Wilmington, Delaware, and each of
the Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, with regard to any such action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the Transaction Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. Each of the Parties agrees not to commence any
legal proceeding relating thereto except in the courts described above in
Delaware, other than legal proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction to
enforce any judgment, decree or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as
described herein. Each of the Parties further agrees that notice as provided
herein shall constitute sufficient service of process and the Parties further
waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of
motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Transaction Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (a) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in Delaware as described
herein for any reason, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise)
and (c) that (i) the legal proceeding in any such court is brought in an
inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such legal proceeding is improper or (iii)
this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

 

9.9 Headings. The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and
do not constitute a part of this Agreement.

 

9.10 Schedules and Exhibits. All of the Schedules and Exhibits attached hereto
are incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement by reference thereto.

 

9.11 Legal Representation of the Parties. This Agreement was negotiated by the
Parties with the benefit of legal representation and any rule of construction or
interpretation otherwise requiring this Agreement to be construed or interpreted
against any Party shall not apply to any construction or interpretation hereof
or to any other Transaction Agreement and this Agreement shall instead be deemed
to have been drafted by all the Parties.

 



 -43-

  



 

9.12 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each Party shall pay all
costs and expenses incurred by such Party incident to the preparation and
execution of this Agreement, the Transaction Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

9.13 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement
or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

 

9.14 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as set forth expressly to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the
Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing
herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person
any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever, under
or by reason of this Agreement.

 

9.15 Specific Performance. Each Party acknowledges and affirms that in the event
any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or otherwise are breached, money damages would be
inadequate (and therefore the non-breaching Party would have no adequate remedy
at law) and the non-breaching Party would be irreparably damaged. Accordingly,
each Party agrees that each other Party shall be entitled to specific
performance, an injunction or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or
other security or needing to prove irreparable harm) to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the
terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted in any court of the United
States or any state thereof having jurisdiction over the Parties and the matter,
in addition to any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled, at Law or
in equity.

 

9.16 Prevailing Party. If any legal action or other proceeding is brought for
the enforcement or interpretation of any of the rights or provisions of this
Agreement, or because of an alleged dispute, breach, default or
misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement,
the successful or prevailing Party will be entitled to recover reasonable
attorneys’ fees and all other costs and expenses incurred in that action or
proceeding, in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.

 

9.17 No Recourse. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in
this Agreement or any agreement or document delivered contemporaneously
herewith, each Party by and on behalf of itself, agrees and acknowledges that,
in respect of either Party’s obligations hereunder, no Person other than the
Parties (and their successors and assigns) shall have any obligation hereunder
and that neither Party nor any of their Affiliates has any rights of recovery
hereunder against, or any recourse hereunder or under any agreement or document
delivered contemporaneously herewith or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith against, (a) any
former, current or future equityholder, manager, member, partner, trustee,
officer, employee, representative or agent of the other Party (or any successor
or assignee thereof) or (b) any former, current or future equityholder, manager,
member, partner, trustee, officer, employee, representative or agent of any
equityholder, member, manager or partner of the other Party or any Affiliate
thereof (each, a “Party Affiliate”), whether by or through attempted piercing of
the corporate veil, by or through a claim (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) by or on behalf of either Party against any of the Party Affiliates,
by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable Proceeding, or
by virtue of any statute, regulation or other Law, or otherwise; it being
expressly agreed and acknowledged that no personal liability whatsoever shall
attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Party Affiliate, as
such, for any obligations of either Party under this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, under any documents or instruments delivered
contemporaneously herewith, in respect of any oral representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, or for any claim
(whether in tort, contract or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, such obligations or their creation. Each Party Affiliate is expressly
intended as a third-party beneficiary of this Section 9.17.
