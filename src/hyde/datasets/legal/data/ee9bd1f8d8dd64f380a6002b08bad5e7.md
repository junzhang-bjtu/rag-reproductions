Company of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other

be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, will not be subject to
preemptive rights of any other shareholder of the Company, and will effectively
vest in the Purchasers good title to all such securities, free and clear of all
Liens, except restrictions imposed by the Securities Act and any applicable
state, foreign or other securities Laws. Upon any conversion of any Shares into
shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of
Designations, such shares of Class A Common Stock issued upon such conversion

preemptive rights of any other shareholder of the Company, and will effectively
vest in the Purchasers good title to all such securities, free and clear of all

(1)               The Company has filed, on a timely basis, all required
reports, proxy statements, forms, and other documents with the SEC since April
1, 2018 (collectively, the “SEC Documents”). Each of the SEC Documents, as of
its respective filing date complied in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and
the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such
SEC Documents, and, except to the extent that information contained in any SEC
Document has been revised or superseded by a later filed SEC Document filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement, none of the SEC
Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.

 

(2)               The Company (i) has implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act)
that are reasonably designed to ensure that material information (both financial
and non-financial) relating to the Company, including its consolidated
Subsidiaries, is made known to the individuals responsible for the preparation
of the Company’s filings with the SEC and (ii) has disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company’s outside
auditors and the Board of Director’s audit committee (A) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the
Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company’s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information and (B)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Company’s internal controls over financial
reporting. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company,
there is no reason that its outside auditors and its chief executive officer and
chief financial officer will not be able to give the certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, without qualification, when next
due.

 

(3)               There is no transaction, arrangement or other relationship
between the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries and an unconsolidated or
other off-balance sheet entity that is required to be disclosed by the Company
in its SEC Documents and is not so disclosed.

 

(4)               The financial statements of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries included in the SEC Documents (i) complied as to form in all
material respects with applicable accounting requirements and the published
rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, in each case as of the
date such SEC Document was filed, and (ii) have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in
such financial statements or the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited
quarterly statements, to the absence of footnote disclosures and normal year-end
audit adjustments).

(g)               Brokers and Finders. Except for J.P. Morgan Securities LLC
pursuant to that certain engagement letter dated March 29, 2020, the fees and
expenses of which will be paid by the Company on behalf of the independent
special committee of the Board of Directors, neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents
has employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any financial
advisory fees, brokerage fees, commissions or finder’s fees, and no broker or
finder has acted directly or indirectly for the Company in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(h)               Litigation. There is no action, suit, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened (including
“cease and desist” letters or invitations to take patent license) against, nor
any outstanding judgment, order, writ or decree against, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets before or by any Governmental
Entity, which individually or in the aggregate has had, or, would reasonably be
expected to have (including for this purpose, assuming an adverse determination
of any such matter), a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any judgment, order or decree of any Governmental
Entity.

 

(i)                 Indebtedness. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, immediately prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, in default in the payment of any material indebtedness or in default
under any agreement relating to its material indebtedness.

 

(j)                 Listing and Maintenance Requirements. The Class A Common
Stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, and the
Company has taken no action designed to, or which to the Knowledge of the
Company is reasonably likely to, have the effect of, terminating the
registration of the Class A Common Stock under the Exchange Act nor has the
Company received as of the date of this Agreement any notification that the SEC
is contemplating terminating such registration.

 

(k)               No Additional Representations. Except for the representations
and warranties made by the Company in this Section 2.1, neither the Company nor
any other Person makes any express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to the Company or any Subsidiaries or their respective businesses,
operations, assets, liabilities, employees, employee benefit plans, conditions
or prospects, and the Company hereby disclaims any such other representations or

2.2              Representations and Warranties of the Purchasers. Each
Purchaser hereby represents and warrants to the Company, as of the date hereof
and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent made only as of a specified
date in which case as of such date), severally and not jointly, that:

 

(a)               Organization and Authority. The Purchaser (i) is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of
Delaware, (ii) has all requisite limited partnership power and authority to own
its properties and assets and conduct its business as presently conducted and
(iii) is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in all
jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its
business requires it to be so qualified, except, in the case of this clause
(iii), where failure to be so qualified has not and would not reasonably be
expected to materially and adversely affect the Purchaser’s ability to perform
its obligations under this Agreement or consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby on a timely basis.

 

(b)               Authorization.

 

(1)               The Purchaser has the limited partnership power and authority
to enter into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and to carry
out its obligations hereunder and thereunder. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents by the
Purchaser and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby have been duly authorized by all requisite action on the part of the
Purchaser, and no further approval or authorization by any of its stockholders,
partners, members or other equity owners, as the case may be, is required. This
Agreement has been, and (as of the Closing) the other Transaction Documents will
be, duly and validly executed and delivered by the Purchaser and assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement is, and (as
of the Closing) each of the other Transaction Documents will be, a valid and
binding obligation of the Purchaser enforceable against the Purchaser in
accordance with its terms (except as enforcement may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and
similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights
or by general equity principles). No other organizational proceedings are
necessary for the execution and delivery by the Purchaser of this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents, the performance by it of its obligations
hereunder or thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

 

(2)               Neither the execution, delivery and performance by the
Purchaser of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, nor compliance
by the Purchaser with any of the provisions hereof or thereof, will (i) require
notice, consent or approval pursuant to, violate, conflict with, or result in a
breach of any provision of, or constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in
the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or result in a
right of termination or acceleration of, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties or assets of the Purchaser under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of (A) its organizational documents or (B) any note,
bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other
instrument or obligation to which the Purchaser is a party or by which it may be
bound, or to which the Purchaser or any of the properties or assets of the
Purchaser may be subject, or (ii) subject to compliance with the statutes and
regulations referred to in the next paragraph, violate any law, statute,
ordinance, rule or regulation, permit, concession, grant, franchise or any
judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction or decree applicable to the Purchaser
or any of their respective properties or assets except in the case of clauses
(i)(B) and (ii) for such violations, conflicts and breaches as would not
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or have a material adverse effect on
the Purchaser’s ability to fully perform its respective covenants and
obligations under this Agreement.

(3)               Other than (i) the securities or blue sky Laws of the various
states and (ii) filings pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange
Act, no notice to, registration, declaration or filing with, exemption or review
by, or authorization, order, consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity,
nor expiration or termination of any statutory waiting period, is necessary for
the execution, delivery and performance by the Purchaser of this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents or the consummation by the Purchaser of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.

 

(c)               Financial Capability. At the Closing, the Purchaser will have
access to available funds necessary to consummate the Closing on the terms and
conditions contemplated by this Agreement. The Purchaser is not aware of any
reason why the funds sufficient to fulfill its obligations under Article I
(including paying the Purchase Price) will not be available on the Closing Date.

 

(d)               Brokers and Finders. Neither the Purchaser nor its Affiliates
or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents has employed
any broker or finder for which the Company will incur any liability for any
financial advisory fees, brokerage fees, commissions or finder’s fees in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e)               Purchase for Investment. The Purchaser is an accredited
investor (as defined in Rule 501 of the Securities Act) and acknowledges that
the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act or under any state
securities Laws. The Purchaser (i) acknowledges that it is acquiring the Shares
and the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the
Shares pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
solely for investment with no present intention to distribute any of the Shares
or the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Shares
to any person in violation of applicable securities Laws, (ii) will not sell,
transfer, or otherwise dispose of any of the Shares or shares of Class A Common

Laws, (iii) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters
and in investments of this type that it is capable of evaluating the merits and

decision, and (iv) without prejudice to any claim of Purchaser hereunder for
breach of the Company’s representations and warranties or for actual and
intentional fraud, (A) has been furnished with or has had full access to all the
information that it considers necessary or appropriate to make an informed
investment decision with respect to the Shares and the shares of Class A Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Shares, (B) has had an opportunity to
discuss with management of the Company the intended business and financial
affairs of the Company and to obtain information (to the extent the Company
possessed such information or could acquire it without unreasonable effort or
expense) necessary to verify any information furnished to it or to which it had
access and (C) can bear the economic risk of (1) an investment in the Shares and
the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Shares
indefinitely and (2) a total loss in respect of such investment. The Purchaser
has such knowledge and experience in business and financial matters so as to
enable it to understand and evaluate the risks of and form an investment
decision with respect to, its investment in the Shares and the shares of Class A
Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the Shares and to protect its own
interest in connection with such investment.

 



(f)                No Additional Representations. Each of Purchaser and its
Affiliates acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and
warranties contained in Section 2.1, neither the Company nor any other Person,
makes any express or implied representation or warranty with respect to the
Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective businesses, operations, assets,
liabilities, employees, employee benefit plans, conditions or prospects, and the
Company hereby disclaims any such other representations or warranties. In
particular, without limiting the foregoing disclaimer, neither the Company nor
any other Person, makes or has made any representation or warranty to the
Purchaser, or any of its Affiliates or representatives, with respect to (i) any
financial projection, forecast, estimate, budget or prospect information
relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective business, or (ii)
except for the representations and warranties made by the Company in Section
2.1, any information presented to the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or
representatives in the course of their due diligence investigation of the
Company, the negotiation of this Agreement or in the course of the transactions
contemplated hereby. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, except
with respect to the representations and warranties contained in Section 2.1,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall have any liability to
Purchaser or its Affiliates or representatives on any basis (including in
contract or tort, under federal or state securities Laws or otherwise) based
upon any other representation or warranty, either express or implied, included
in any information or statements (or any omissions therefrom) provided or made
available by the Company or its Subsidiaries to Purchaser or its Affiliates or
representatives in the course of their due diligence investigation of the
Company, the negotiation of this Agreement or in the course of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 2.2(f) shall limit, preclude or prohibit any claim of actual and
intentional fraud.

3.1              Filings; Other Actions.

 

(a)               As set forth in the Certificate of Designations, the Shares
shall be initially issued to the Purchasers without voting rights in the
election of directors of the Company. After issuance and following the
expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “HSR Act”), the Shares shall
gain the right to vote as Class A Common Stock of the Company, pursuant to, and
in accordance with, the terms of the Certificate of Designations (the “Purchaser
Election”). The Purchasers and the Company shall use all reasonable best efforts
to obtain or submit, as the case may be, as promptly as practicable following
the date hereof, the approvals and authorizations of, filings and registrations
with, and notifications to, or expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period, under the HSR Act and other applicable antitrust Laws in
connection with the Purchaser Election (the “Anti-Trust Approval”). Without
limiting the foregoing, the Purchasers and the Company shall each prepare and
file within five (5) business days after the date hereof a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In connection with such undertakings, each of
the Purchasers, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will
cooperate and consult with the other and use reasonable best efforts to prepare
and file all necessary documentation, to effect all necessary applications,
notices, petitions, filings and other documents, and to obtain all necessary
permits, consents, orders, approvals and authorizations of, or any exemption by,
all third parties and Governmental Entities, necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including obtaining
the Anti-Trust Approval. Each of the Purchasers and the Company shall execute
and deliver both before and after the Closing such further certificates,
agreements and other documents and take such other actions as the other party
may reasonably request to consummate or implement such transactions or to
evidence such events or matters.

 

(b)               The Purchasers and the Company will have the right to review
in advance, and to the extent practicable, each will consult with the other, in
each case, subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
all the information relating to such other party, and any of their respective
Affiliates, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials
submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including obtaining the Anti-Trust
Approval. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto agrees
to act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Each party hereto agrees to
keep the other party apprised of the status of matters referred to in this
Section 3.1. Each Purchaser shall promptly furnish the Company, and the Company
shall promptly furnish each Purchaser, to the extent permitted by Law, with
copies of written communications received by it or its Subsidiaries from any
Governmental Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including obtaining the Anti-Trust Approval. Neither the Purchasers
nor the Company shall participate in any substantive meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including obtaining the Anti-Trust Approval unless it consults with
the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate therein or thereat.

3.2              Reasonable Best Efforts to Close. During the Pre-Closing

of the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable and otherwise
to enable consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall
cooperate reasonably with the other party hereto to that end.

 

3.3              Authorized Class A Common Stock. At any time that any Shares
are outstanding, the Company shall from time to time take all lawful action
within its control to cause the authorized share capital of the Company to

all Shares then issued and outstanding. All shares of Class A Common Stock
delivered upon conversion of the Shares shall be newly issued shares or shares
held in treasury by the Company, shall have been duly authorized and validly
issued and shall be fully paid and nonassessable, and free and clear of any
Liens (other than Liens created by a Purchaser or restrictions on Transfer

bring a proceeding with respect to the Applicable Matters (or that could affect
any Applicable Matter) other than in such Chosen Court and not to challenge or
enforce in another jurisdiction a judgment of such Chosen Court. Process in any
such proceeding may be served on any Person with respect to such Applicable

is $0.0001 per share.

of Convertible Preferred Stock is one hundred and fifty two thousand two hundred
and fifty (152,250); provided, however that, by resolution of the Board of
Directors, the total number of authorized shares of Convertible Preferred Stock
may hereafter be reduced to a number that is not less than the number of shares
of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding.

 

(c)           Form, Dating and Denominations.

 

(i)            Form and Date of Certificates Representing Convertible Preferred
Stock. Each Certificate representing any Convertible Preferred Stock will bear

Stock will be issued only in registered form and only in whole numbers of
shares.

 

(iv)          Registration Numbers. Each Certificate representing any
Convertible Preferred Stock will bear a unique registration number that is not
affixed to any other Certificate representing any other outstanding share of
Convertible Preferred Stock.

 

(d)           Method of Payment; Delay When Payment Date is Not a Business Day.

 

(i)             Method of Payment. The Company will pay all cash amounts due on
any Convertible Preferred Stock by check issued in the name of the Holder
thereof; provided, however, that if such Holder has delivered to the Company, no
later than the time set forth in the next sentence, a written request to receive
payment by wire transfer to an account of such Holder within the United States,
then the Company will pay all such cash amounts by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such account. To be timely, such written request must be
delivered no later than the Close of Business on the following date: (x) with
respect to the payment of any declared cash Participating Dividend due on a
Dividend Payment Date for the Convertible Preferred Stock, the related Record
Date; and (y) with respect to any other payment, the date that is fifteen (15)
calendar days immediately before the date such payment is due.

 

(ii)            Delay of Payment when Payment Date is Not a Business Day. If the
due date for a payment on any Convertible Preferred Stock as provided in this
Certificate of Designations is not a Business Day, then, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, such payment may
be made on the immediately following Business Day and no interest, dividend or
other amount will accrue or accumulate on such payment as a result of the
related delay. Solely for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, a day
on which the applicable place of payment is authorized or required by law or
executive order to close or be closed will be deemed not to be a “Business Day.”

 

(e)           Register. The Company will, or will retain another Person (who may
be to the Transfer Agent) to act as registrar who will, keep a record (the
“Register”) of the names and addresses of the Holders, the number of shares of
Convertible Preferred Stock held by each Holder and the transfer, exchange,
repurchase, Redemption and conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock. Absent
manifest error, the entries in the Register will be conclusive, and the Company
and the Transfer Agent may treat each Person whose name is recorded as a Holder
in the Register as a Holder for all purposes. The Register will be in written
form or in any form capable of being converted into written form reasonably
promptly. The Company will promptly provide a copy of the Register to any Holder
upon its request.

(f)            Legends.

 

(i)            Restricted Stock Legend.

 

(1)               Each Certificate representing any share of Convertible
Preferred Stock that is a Transfer-Restricted Security will bear the Restricted
Stock Legend.

 

(2)               If any share of Convertible Preferred Stock is issued in
exchange for, in substitution of, or to effect a partial conversion of, any
other share(s) of Convertible Preferred Stock (such other share(s) being
referred to as the “old share(s)” for purposes of this Section 3(f)(i)(2)),
including pursuant to Section 3(h) or 3(j), then the Certificate representing
such share will bear the Restricted Stock Legend if the certificate representing
such old share(s) bore the Restricted Stock Legend at the time of such exchange
or substitution, or on the related Conversion Date with respect to such
conversion, as applicable; provided, however, that the Certificate representing
such share need not bear the Restricted Stock Legend if such share does not
constitute a Transfer-Restricted Security immediately after such exchange or
substitution, or as of such Conversion Date, as applicable.

 

(ii)           Other Legends. The Certificate representing any Convertible
Preferred Stock may bear any other legend or text, not inconsistent with this
Certificate of Designations, as may be required by applicable law or by any
securities exchange or automated quotation system on which such Convertible
Preferred Stock is traded or quoted or as may be otherwise reasonably determined
by the Company to be appropriate.

 

(iii)          Legends on Conversion Shares.

 

(1)               Each Conversion Share will bear a legend substantially to the
same effect as the Restricted Stock Legend if the Convertible Preferred Stock
upon the conversion of which such Conversion Share was issued was (or would have
been had it not been converted) a Transfer-Restricted Security at the time such
Conversion Share was issued; provided, however, that such Conversion Share need
not bear such a legend if the Company determines, in its reasonable discretion,
that such Conversion Share need not bear such a legend.

 

(2)               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
3(f)(iii)(1), a Conversion Share need not bear a legend pursuant to Section
3(f)(iii)(1) if such Conversion Share is issued in an uncertificated form that
does not permit affixing legends thereto, provided the Company takes measures
(including the assignment thereto of a “restricted” CUSIP number) that it
reasonably deems appropriate to enforce the transfer restrictions referred to in
such legend.

 

(g)          Transfers and Exchanges; Transfer Taxes; Certain Transfer
Restrictions.

 

(i)            Provisions Applicable to All Transfers and Exchanges.

 

(1)               Generally. Subject to this Section 3(g), Convertible Preferred
Stock represented by any Certificate may be transferred or exchanged from time
to time, and the Company will cause each such transfer or exchange to be
recorded in the Register.

 



 - 16 -

 

 

(2)               No Services Charge; Transfer Taxes. The Company will not
impose any service charge on any Holder for any transfer, exchange or conversion
of any Convertible Preferred Stock, but the Company may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer, exchange or conversion of Convertible
Preferred Stock, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 3(h) or Section 3(o)
not involving any transfer.

 

(3)               No Transfers or Exchanges of Fractional Shares.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations,
all transfers or exchanges of Convertible Preferred Stock must be in an amount
representing a whole number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, and no
fractional share of Convertible Preferred Stock may be transferred or exchanged.

Convertible Preferred Stock that is issued upon transfer of, or in exchange for,
another share of Convertible Preferred Stock will bear each legend, if any,
required by Section 3(f).

 

(5)               Settlement of Transfers and Exchanges. Upon satisfaction of
the requirements of this Certificate of Designations to effect a transfer or
exchange of any Convertible Preferred Stock as well as the delivery of all
documentation reasonably required by the Transfer Agent or the Company in order
to effect any transfer or exchange, the Company will cause such transfer or
exchange to be effected as soon as reasonably practicable but in no event later
than the second (2nd) Business Day after the date of such satisfaction.

 

(ii)           Transfers of Shares Subject to Redemption, Repurchase or
Conversion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate of
Designations, the Company will not be required to register the transfer of or
exchange any share of Convertible Preferred Stock:

 

(1)               that has been surrendered for conversion;

 

(2)               that has been called for Redemption pursuant to a Redemption
Notice, except to the extent that the Company fails to pay the related
Redemption Price when due; or

 

(3)               as to which a Change of Control Repurchase Notice has been
duly delivered, and not withdrawn, pursuant to Section 8(f), except to the
extent that the Company fails to pay the related Change of Control Repurchase
Price when due.

(h)          Exchange and Cancellation of Convertible Preferred Stock to Be
Converted or to Be Repurchased Pursuant to a Repurchase Upon Change of Control
or a Redemption.

 

(i)            Partial Conversions of Certificates and Partial Repurchases of
Certificates Pursuant to a Repurchase Upon Change of Control. If only a portion
of a Holder’s Convertible Preferred Stock represented by a Certificate (such
Certificate being referred to as the “old Certificate” for purposes of this
Section 3(h)(i)) is to be converted pursuant to Section 10 or repurchased
pursuant to a Repurchase Upon Change of Control, then, as soon as reasonably
practicable after such Certificate is surrendered for such conversion or
repurchase, as applicable, the Company will cause such Certificate to be
exchanged for (1) one or more Certificates that each represent a whole number of
shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and, in the aggregate, represent a total
number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares of
Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such old Certificate that are not to
be so converted or repurchased, as applicable, and deliver such Certificate(s)
to such Holder; and (2) a Certificate representing a whole number of shares of
Convertible Preferred Stock equal to the number of shares of Convertible
Preferred Stock represented by such old Certificate that are to be so converted
or repurchased, as applicable, which Certificate will be converted or
repurchased, as applicable, pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of
Designations; provided, however, that the Certificate referred to in this clause
(2) need not be issued at any time after which such shares subject to such
conversion or repurchase, as applicable, are deemed to cease to be outstanding
pursuant to Section 3(n).

 

(ii)           Cancellation of Convertible Preferred Stock that Is Converted and
Convertible Preferred Stock that Is Repurchased Pursuant to a Repurchase Upon
Change of Control or a Redemption. If a Holder’s Convertible Preferred Stock
represented by a Certificate (or any portion thereof that has not theretofore
been exchanged pursuant to Section 3(h)(i)) (such Certificate being referred to
as the “old Certificate” for purposes of this Section 3(h)(ii)) is to be
converted pursuant to Section 10 or repurchased pursuant to a Repurchase Upon
Change of Control or a Redemption, then, promptly after the later of the time
such Convertible Preferred Stock is deemed to cease to be outstanding pursuant
to Section 3(n) and the time such Certificate is surrendered for such conversion
or repurchase, as applicable, (A) such Certificate will be cancelled pursuant to
Section 3(l); and (B) in the case of a partial conversion or repurchase, the
Company will issue, execute and deliver to such Holder, and cause the Transfer
Agent to countersign, one or more Certificates that (x) each represent a whole
number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and, in the aggregate, represent
a total number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock equal to the number of
shares of Convertible Preferred Stock represented by such old Certificate that
are not to be so converted or repurchased, as applicable; (y) are registered in
the name of such Holder; and (z) bear each legend, if any, required by Section
3(f).

 

(i)           Status of Retired Shares. Upon any share of Convertible Preferred
Stock ceasing to be outstanding, such share will be deemed to be retired and to
resume the status of an authorized and unissued share of preferred stock of the
Company, and such share cannot thereafter be reissued as Convertible Preferred
Stock.

 



 - 18 -

 

 

(j)            Replacement Certificates. If a Holder of any Convertible
Preferred Stock claims that the Certificate(s) representing such Convertible
Preferred Stock have been mutilated, lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, then
the Company will issue, execute and deliver, and cause the Transfer Agent to
countersign, in each case in accordance with Section 3(c), a replacement
Certificate representing such Convertible Preferred Stock upon surrender to the
Company or the Transfer Agent of such mutilated Certificate, or upon delivery to
the Company or the Transfer Agent of evidence of such loss, destruction or
wrongful taking reasonably satisfactory to the Transfer Agent and the Company.
In the case of a lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken Certificate representing
any Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company and the Transfer Agent may require
the Holder thereof to provide such security or indemnity that is reasonably
satisfactory to the Company and the Transfer Agent to protect the Company and
the Transfer Agent from any loss that any of them may suffer if such Certificate
is replaced.

 

Every replacement Convertible Preferred Stock issued pursuant to this Section
3(j) will, upon such replacement, be deemed to be outstanding Convertible
Preferred Stock, entitled to all of the benefits of this Certificate of
Designations equally and ratably with all other Convertible Preferred Stock then
outstanding.

 

(k)          Registered Holders. Only the Holder of any Convertible Preferred
Stock will have rights under this Certificate of Designations as the owner of
such Convertible Preferred Stock.

 

(l)           Cancellation. The Company may at any time deliver Convertible
Preferred Stock to the Transfer Agent for cancellation. The Company will cause
the Transfer Agent to promptly cancel all shares of Convertible Preferred Stock
so surrendered to it in accordance with its customary procedures.

 

(m)          Shares Held by the Company or its Affiliates. Without limiting the
generality of Section 3(n), in determining whether the Holders of the required
number of outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock (and, if applicable,
Voting Parity Stock) have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, shares
of Convertible Preferred Stock owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
will be deemed not to be outstanding.

 

(n)          Outstanding Shares.

 

(i)            Generally. The shares of Convertible Preferred Stock that are
outstanding at any time will be deemed to be those shares of Convertible
Preferred Stock that, at such time, have been duly executed by the Company and
countersigned by the Transfer Agent, excluding those shares of Convertible
Preferred Stock that have theretofore been (1) cancelled by the Transfer Agent
or delivered to the Transfer Agent for cancellation in accordance with Section
3(l); (2) paid in full upon their conversion or upon their repurchase pursuant
to a Repurchase Upon Change of Control or a Redemption in accordance with this
Certificate of Designations; or (3) deemed to cease to be outstanding to the
extent provided in, and subject to, clause (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of this
Section 3(n).

 

(ii)           Replaced Shares. If any Certificate representing any share of
Convertible Preferred Stock is replaced pursuant to Section 3(j), then such
share will cease to be outstanding at the time of such replacement, unless the
Transfer Agent and the Company receive proof reasonably satisfactory to them
that such share is held by a “bona fide purchaser” under applicable law.

 



 - 19 -

 

 

(iii)          Shares to Be Repurchased Pursuant to a Redemption. If, on a
Redemption Date, the Company has segregated, solely for the benefit of the
applicable Holders, consideration in kind and amount that is sufficient to pay
the aggregate Redemption Price due on such date, then (unless there occurs a
default in the payment of the Redemption Price) (1) the Convertible Preferred
Stock to be redeemed on such date will be deemed, as of such date, to cease to
be outstanding; (2) Regular Dividends will cease to accumulate on such
Convertible Preferred Stock from and after such Redemption Date; and (3) the
rights of the Holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock, as such, will
terminate with respect to such Convertible Preferred Stock, other than the right
to receive the Redemption Price as provided in Section 7.

 

(iv)          Shares to Be Repurchased Pursuant to a Repurchase Upon Change of
Control. If, on a Change of Control Repurchase Date, the Company has segregated,
solely for the benefit of the applicable Holders, consideration in kind and
amount that is sufficient to pay the aggregate Change of Control Repurchase
Price due on such date, then (unless there occurs a default in the payment of
the Change of Control Repurchase Price) (1) the Convertible Preferred Stock to
be repurchased on such date will be deemed, as of such date, to cease to be
outstanding; (2) Regular Dividends will cease to accumulate on such Convertible
Preferred Stock from and after such Change of Control Repurchase Date; and (3)
the rights of the Holders of such Convertible Preferred Stock, as such, will
terminate with respect to such Convertible Preferred Stock, other than the right
to receive the Change of Control Repurchase Price as provided in Section 8 and,
if applicable, Section 16.

 

(v)           Shares to Be Converted. If any Convertible Preferred Stock is to
be converted, then, at the Close of Business on the Conversion Date for such
conversion (unless there occurs a default in the delivery of the Conversion
Consideration due pursuant to Section 10 upon such conversion): (1) such
Convertible Preferred Stock will be deemed to cease to be outstanding; (2)
Regular Dividends will cease to accumulate on such Convertible Preferred Stock
from and after such Conversion Date; and (3) the rights of the Holders of such
Convertible Preferred Stock, as such, will terminate with respect to such
Convertible Preferred Stock, other than the right to receive such Conversion
Consideration as provided in Section 10 and, if applicable, Section 16.

 

(o)           Notations and Exchanges. Without limiting any rights of Holders
pursuant to Section 9, if any amendment, supplement or waiver to the Certificate
of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations changes the terms of any
Convertible Preferred Stock, then the Company may, in its discretion, require
the Holder of the Certificate representing such Convertible Preferred Stock to
deliver such Certificate to the Transfer Agent so that the Transfer Agent may
place an appropriate notation prepared by the Company on such Certificate and
return such Certificate to such Holder. Alternatively, at its discretion, the
Company may, in exchange for such Convertible Preferred Stock, issue, execute
and deliver, and cause the Transfer Agent to countersign, in each case in
accordance with Section 3(c), a new Certificate representing such Convertible
Preferred Stock that reflects the changed terms. The failure to make any
appropriate notation or issue a new Certificate representing any Convertible
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3(o) will not impair or affect the
validity of such amendment, supplement or waiver.

 

 - 20 -

 



 

Section 4.                Ranking. The Convertible Preferred Stock will rank (a)
senior to (i) Dividend Junior Stock with respect to the payment of dividends;
and (ii) Liquidation Junior Stock with respect to the distribution of assets
upon the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up; (b) equally with (i)
Dividend Parity Stock with respect to the payment of dividends; and (ii)
Liquidation Parity Stock with respect to the distribution of assets upon the
Company’s liquidation, dissolution or winding up; and (c) junior to (i) Dividend
Senior Stock with respect to the payment of dividends; and (ii) Liquidation
Senior Stock with respect to the distribution of assets upon the Company’s
liquidation, dissolution or winding up.

 

Section 5.                Dividends.

 

(a)          Generally.

 

(i)            Regular Dividends.

 

(1)               Accumulation and Payment of Regular Dividends. The Convertible
Preferred Stock will accumulate cumulative dividends at a rate per annum equal
to the Regular Dividend Rate on the Liquidation Preference thereof (calculated
in accordance with Section 5(a)(i)(2)), regardless of whether or not declared or
funds are legally available for their payment (such dividends that accumulate on
the Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this sentence, “Regular Dividends”).
Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5 (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, Section 5(a)(ii)(1)), such Regular Dividends will be payable
semi-annually in arrears on each Regular Dividend Payment Date. Regular
Dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock will accumulate from, and
including, the last date to which Regular Dividends have been paid (or, if no
Regular Dividends have been paid, from, and including, the Initial Issue Date)
to, but excluding, the next Regular Dividend Payment Date.

 

(2)               Computation of Accumulated Regular Dividends. Accumulated
Regular Dividends will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of
twelve 30-day months. Regular Dividends on each share of Convertible Preferred
Stock will accrue on the Liquidation Preference of such share as of immediately
before the Close of Business on the preceding Regular Dividend Payment Date (or,
if there is no preceding Regular Dividend Payment Date, on the Initial
Liquidation Preference of such share).

 



 - 21 -

 

 

(ii)           Method of Payment; Payments in Kind.

 

(1)               Generally. Regular Dividends will be paid on the Convertible
Preferred Stock on each Regular Dividend Payment Date by adding (without
duplication), effective immediately before the Close of Business on such Regular
Dividend Payment Date, to the Liquidation Preference of each share of
Convertible Preferred Stock outstanding as of such time, an amount equal to the
unpaid Regular Dividends that have accumulated on such share to, but excluding,
such Regular Dividend Payment Date. Such payment and addition will occur
automatically, without the need of any action on the part of the Company or any
other Person.

 

(2)               Construction. Any Regular Dividends the amount of which is
added to the Liquidation Preference thereof pursuant to Section 5(a)(ii)(1) will
be deemed to be “declared” and “paid” on the Convertible Preferred Stock for all
purposes of this Certificate of Designations.

 

(b)          Participating Dividends.

 

(i)            Generally. Subject to Section 5(b)(ii), no dividend or other
distribution on the Common Stock (whether in cash, securities or other property,
or any combination of the foregoing) will be declared or paid on the Common
Stock unless, at the time of such declaration and payment, an equivalent
dividend or distribution is declared and paid, respectively, on the Convertible
Preferred Stock (such a dividend or distribution on the Convertible Preferred
Stock, a “Participating Dividend,” and such corresponding dividend or
distribution on the Common Stock, the “Common Stock Participating Dividend”),
such that (1) the Record Date and the payment date for such Participating
Dividend occur on the same dates as the Record Date and payment date,
respectively, for such Common Stock Participating Dividend and (2) the kind and
amount of consideration payable per share of Convertible Preferred Stock in such
Participating Dividend is the same kind and amount of consideration that would
be payable in the Common Stock Participating Dividend in respect of a number of
shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that would
be issuable (determined in accordance with Section 10 but without regard to
Section 10(e)(ii), Section 10(e)(iii) and Section 10(h)) in respect of one (1)
share of Convertible Preferred Stock that is converted pursuant to an Optional
Conversion with a Conversion Date occurring on such Record Date (subject to the
same arrangements, if any, in such Common Stock Participating Dividend not to
issue or deliver a fractional portion of any security or other property, but
with such arrangement applying separately to each Holder and computed based on
the total number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock held by such Holder on
such Record Date).

 

(ii)           Common Stock Change Events and Stock Splits, Dividends and
Combinations. Section 5(b)(i) will not apply to, and no Participating Dividend
will be required to be declared or paid in respect of, a Common Stock Change
Event, or an event for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required
pursuant to Section 10(f)(i)(1), as to which Section 10(i) or Section
10(f)(i)(1), respectively, will apply.

 

(iii)          Treatment of Participating Dividends Upon Redemption, Repurchase
Upon Change of Control or Conversion. If the Redemption Date, Change of Control
Repurchase Date or Conversion Date of any share of Convertible Preferred Stock
is after a Record Date for a declared Participating Dividend on the Convertible
Preferred Stock and on or before the next Dividend Payment Date, then the Holder
of such share at the Close of Business on such Record Date will be entitled,
notwithstanding the related Redemption, Repurchase Upon Change of Control or
conversion, as applicable, to receive, on or, at the Company’s election, before
such Dividend Payment Date, such declared Participating Dividend on such share.

 



 - 22 -

 

 

Section 6.                Rights Upon Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.

 

(a)          Generally. If the Company liquidates, dissolves or winds up,
whether voluntarily or involuntarily, then, subject to the rights of any of the
Company’s creditors or holders of any outstanding Liquidation Senior Stock, each
share of Convertible Preferred Stock will entitle the Holder thereof to receive
payment for the greater of the amounts set forth in clause (i) and (ii) below
out of the Company’s assets or funds legally available for distribution to the
Company’s stockholders, before any such assets or funds are distributed to, or
set aside for the benefit of, any Liquidation Junior Stock:

 

(i)            the sum of:

 

(1)               the Liquidation Preference per share of Convertible Preferred
Stock; and

 

(2)               all unpaid Regular Dividends that will have accumulated on
such share to, but excluding, the date of such payment; and

 

(ii)           the amount such Holder would have received in respect of the
number of shares of Common Stock that would be issuable upon conversion of such
share of Convertible Preferred Stock assuming the Conversion Date of such
conversion occurs on the date of such payment.

 

Upon payment of such amount in full on the outstanding Convertible Preferred
Stock, Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock will have no rights to the
Company’s remaining assets or funds, if any. If such assets or funds are
insufficient to fully pay such amount on all outstanding shares of Convertible
Preferred Stock and the corresponding amounts payable in respect of all
outstanding shares of Liquidation Parity Stock, if any, then, subject to the
rights of any of the Company’s creditors or holders of any outstanding
Liquidation Senior Stock, such assets or funds will be distributed ratably on
the outstanding shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and Liquidation Parity
Stock in proportion to the full respective distributions to which such shares
would otherwise be entitled.

 

(b)          Certain Business Combination Transactions Deemed Not to Be a
Liquidation. For purposes of Section 6(a), the Company’s consolidation or
combination with, or merger with or into, or the sale, lease or other transfer
of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets (other than a sale, lease or
other transfer in connection with the Company’s liquidation, dissolution or
winding up) to, another Person will not, in itself, constitute the Company’s
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, even if, in connection therewith, the
Convertible Preferred Stock is converted into, or is exchanged for, or
represents solely the right to receive, other securities, cash or other
property, or any combination of the foregoing.

 



 - 23 -

 

 

Section 7.                Right of the Company to Redeem the Convertible
Preferred Stock.

 

(a)           No Right to Redeem Before the Redemption Trigger Date. The Company
may not redeem the Convertible Preferred Stock at its option at any time before
Redemption Trigger Date.

 

(b)           Right to Redeem the Convertible Preferred Stock on or After
Redemption Trigger Date. Subject to the terms of this Section 7, the Company has
the right, at its election, to redeem all, but not less than all, of the
Convertible Preferred Stock, at any time, on a Redemption Date on or after
Redemption Trigger Date, for a cash purchase price equal to the Redemption
Price.

 

(c)           Redemption Prohibited in Certain Circumstances. The Company will
not call for Redemption, or otherwise send a Redemption Notice in respect of the
Redemption of, any Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 7 unless
(i) the Company has sufficient funds legally available, and is permitted under
the terms of its indebtedness for borrowed money, to fully pay the Redemption
Price in respect of all shares of Convertible Preferred Stock called for
Redemption; and (ii) the Common Stock Liquidity Conditions are satisfied with
respect to such Redemption.

 

(d)          Redemption Date. The Redemption Date for any Redemption will be a
Business Day of the Company’s choosing that is no more than sixty (60), nor less
than thirty (30), calendar days after the Redemption Notice Date for such
Redemption.

 

(e)           Redemption Price. The Redemption Price for any share of
Convertible Preferred Stock to be repurchased pursuant to a Redemption is an
amount in cash equal to the Liquidation Preference of such share at the Close of
Business on the Redemption Date for such Redemption plus accumulated and unpaid
Regular Dividends on such share to, but excluding, such Redemption Date (to the
extent such accumulated and unpaid Regular Dividends are not included in such
Liquidation Preference).

 

(f)            Redemption Notice. To call any share of Convertible Preferred
Stock for Redemption, the Company must send to the Holder of such share a notice
of such Redemption (a “Redemption Notice”). Such Redemption Notice must state:

 

(i)            that such share has been called for Redemption;

 

(ii)           the Redemption Date for such Redemption;

Section 8.                Right of Holders to Require the Company to Repurchase
Convertible Preferred Stock upon a Change of Control.

 

(a)          Right of Holders to Require the Company to Repurchase Convertible
Preferred Stock upon a Change of Control. Subject to the other terms of this
Section 8, if a Change of Control occurs, then each Holder will have the right
(the “Change of Control Repurchase Right”) to require the Company to repurchase
all, or any whole number of shares that is less than all, of such Holder’s
Convertible Preferred Stock on the Change of Control Repurchase Date for such
Change of Control for a cash purchase price equal to the Change of Control
Repurchase Price.

 

(b)          Funds Legally Available for Payment of Change of Control Repurchase
Price; Covenant Not to Take Certain Actions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 8, but subject to Section 16, (i) the rights of the
Holders to receive payment of the Change of Control Repurchase Price pursuant to
this Section 8 upon the occurrence of a Change of Control are subject to the
prior repayment in full of the loans and all other obligations that are accrued
and payable under the terms of the Company’s First Lien Credit Agreement and the
termination of the commitments and the termination of all outstanding letters of
credit to the extent required under such First Lien Credit Agreement; (ii) the
Company will not be obligated to pay the Change of Control Repurchase Price of
any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock to the extent, and only to the extent,
the Company does not have sufficient funds legally available to pay the same;
and (iii) if the Company does not have sufficient funds legally available to pay
the Change of Control Repurchase Price of all shares of Convertible Preferred
Stock that are otherwise to be repurchased pursuant to a Repurchase Upon Change
of Control, then (1) the Company will pay the maximum amount of such Change of
Control Repurchase Price that can be paid out of funds legally available for
payment, which payment will be made pro rata to each Holder based on the total
number of shares of Convertible Preferred Stock of such Holder that were
otherwise to be repurchased pursuant to such Repurchase Upon Change of Control;
and (2) the Company will cause all such shares as to which the Change of Control
Repurchase Price was not paid to be returned to the Holder(s) thereof, and such
shares will be deemed to remain outstanding. The Company will not voluntarily
take any action, or voluntarily engage in any transaction, that would result in
a Change of Control unless the Company has (and will have through the date of
payment) sufficient funds legally available to fully pay the maximum aggregate
Change of Control Repurchase Price that would be payable in respect of such
Change of Control on all shares of Conversion Preferred Stock then outstanding.

 

(c)          Change of Control Repurchase Date. The Change of Control Repurchase
Date for any Change of Control will be a Business Day of the Company’s choosing
that is no more than thirty five (35), nor less than twenty (20), Business Days
after the date the Company sends the related Change of Control Notice pursuant
to Section 8(e).

(d)          Change of Control Repurchase Price. The Change of Control
Repurchase Price for any share of Convertible Preferred Stock to be repurchased
upon a Repurchase Upon Change of Control following a Change of Control is an
amount in cash equal to one hundred and fifty percent (150%) (or, if the Change
of Control Repurchase Date for such Change of Control is on or after the sixth
(6th) Regular Dividend Payment Date, one hundred percent (100%)) of the sum of
(i) the Liquidation Preference of such share at the Close of Business on such
Change of Control Repurchase Date; and (ii) accumulated and unpaid Regular
Dividends on such share to, but excluding, such Change of Control Repurchase
Date (to the extent such accumulated and unpaid Regular Dividends are not
included in such Liquidation Preference).

 

(e)          Change of Control Notice. On or before the Business Day after the
effective date of a Change of Control, the Company will send to each Holder a
notice of such Change of Control (a “Change of Control Notice”). Such Change of

(ii)           the expected effective date of such Change of Control;

 

(iii)          the procedures that a Holder must follow to require the Company

(f)            Procedures to Exercise the Change of Control Repurchase Right.

Repurchase Right for any share(s) of Convertible Preferred Stock following a
Change of Control, the Holder thereof must deliver to the Company:

If any Holder delivers to the Company any such withdrawal notice withdrawing any
share(s) of Convertible Preferred Stock from any Change of Control Repurchase
Notice previously delivered to the Company, and such share(s) have been
surrendered to the Company, then such share(s) will be returned to the Holder
thereof.

 

(g)           Payment of the Change of Control Repurchase Price. Subject to
Section 8(b), the Company will cause the Change of Control Repurchase Price for

 - 27 -

Certificate of Designations to the contrary, in connection with any offer to
repurchase by the Company in connection with a Change of Control, the Company
will, if required, (i) comply with the provisions of Rule 13e-4, Rule 14e-1 and
any other tender offer rules under the Exchange Act; (ii) file a Schedule TO or
any other required filing under the Exchange Act; and (iii) otherwise comply

Section 9.               Voting Rights. The Convertible Preferred Stock will
have no voting rights except as set forth in this Section 9 or as provided in
the Certificate of Incorporation or required by the Delaware General Corporation
Law.

 

(a)          Voting and Consent Rights with Respect to Specified Matters.

 

(i)            Generally. Subject to the other provisions of this Section 9(a),
while any Convertible Preferred Stock is outstanding, each following event will
require, and cannot be effected without, the affirmative vote or consent of
Holders, and holders of each class or series of Voting Parity Stock, if any,
with similar voting or consent rights with respect to such event, representing
at least two thirds (2/3rds) of the combined outstanding voting power of the
Convertible Preferred Stock and such Voting Parity Stock, if any:

 

(1)               any amendment or modification of the Certificate of
Incorporation to authorize or create, or to increase the authorized number of
shares of, any class or series of Dividend Parity Stock, Liquidation Parity
Stock, Dividend Senior Stock or Liquidation Senior Stock;

 

(2)               any amendment, modification or repeal of any provision of the
Certificate of Incorporation or this Certificate of Designations that adversely
affects the rights, preferences or voting powers of the Convertible Preferred
Stock (other than an amendment, modification or repeal permitted by Section
9(a)(iii)); or

 

(3)               the Company’s consolidation or combination with, or merger
with or into, another Person, or any binding or statutory share exchange or
reclassification involving the Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case unless:

 

(A)             the Convertible Preferred Stock either (x) remains outstanding
after such consolidation, combination, merger, share exchange or
reclassification; or (y) is converted or reclassified into, or is exchanged for,
or represents solely the right to receive, preference securities of the
continuing, resulting or surviving Person of such consolidation, combination,
merger, share exchange or reclassification, or the parent thereof;

 



 - 28 -

 

 

(B)              the Convertible Preferred Stock that remains outstanding or
such preference securities, as applicable, have rights, preferences and voting
powers that, taken as a whole, are not materially less favorable to the Holders
or the holders thereof, as applicable, than the rights, preferences and voting
powers, taken as a whole, of the Convertible Preferred Stock immediately before
the consummation of such consolidation, combination, merger, share exchange or
reclassification; and

 

(C)              the issuer of the Convertible Preferred Stock that remains
outstanding or such preference securities, as applicable, is a corporation duly
organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America, any State
thereof or the District of Columbia that, if not the Company, will succeed to
the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the Convertible Preferred
Stock;

 

provided, however, that (x) a consolidation, combination, merger, share exchange
or reclassification that satisfies the requirements of clauses (A), (B) and (C)
of Section 9(a)(i)(3) will not require any vote or consent pursuant to Section
9(a)(i)(1) or 9(a)(i)(2); and (y) each of the following will be deemed not to
adversely affect the rights, preferences or voting powers of the Convertible
Preferred Stock (or cause any of the rights, preferences or voting powers of any
such preference securities to be “materially less favorable” for purposes of
Section 9(a)(i)(3)(B)) and will not require any vote or consent pursuant to
Section 9(a)(i)(1), 9(a)(i)(2) or 9(a)(i)(3):

 

(I)            any increase in the number of the authorized but unissued shares
of the Company’s undesignated preferred stock;

 

(II)           the creation and issuance, in and of itself, or increase in the
authorized or issued number, of any class or series of stock that constitutes
both Dividend Junior Stock and Liquidation Junior Stock; and

 

(III)          the application of Section 10(i), including the execution and
delivery of any supplemental instruments pursuant to Section 10(i)(iii) solely
to give effect to such provision.

 

(ii)           Where Some But Not All Classes or Series of Stock Are Adversely
Affected. If any event set forth in Section 9(a)(i)(1), 9(a)(i)(2) or 9(a)(i)(3)
would require the approval of one or more, but not all, classes or series of
Voting Parity Stock (which term, solely for purposes of this sentence, includes
the Convertible Preferred Stock), then those classes or series whose approval is
not required pursuant to their terms will be deemed not to have voting or
consent rights with respect to such event. Furthermore, an amendment,
modification or repeal described in Section 9(a)(i)(2) above that adversely
affects the special rights, preferences or voting powers of the Convertible
Preferred Stock cannot be effected without the affirmative vote or consent of
Holders, voting separately as a class, of at least two thirds (2/3rds) of the
Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding.

 



 - 29 -

 

 

(iii)          Certain Amendments Permitted Without Consent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 9(a), the Company may amend, modify or
repeal any of the terms of the Convertible Preferred Stock without the vote or
consent of any Holder to:

 

(1)               cure any ambiguity or correct any omission, defect or
inconsistency in this Certificate of Designations or the Certificates
representing the Convertible Preferred Stock, including the filing of a
certificate of correction, or a corrected instrument, pursuant to Section 103(f)
of the Delaware General Corporation Law in connection therewith; or

 

(2)               make any other change to the Certificate of Incorporation,
this Certificate of Designations or the Certificates representing the
Convertible Preferred Stock that does not, individually or in the aggregate with
all other such changes, adversely affect the rights of any Holder (other than
any Holders that have consented to such change), as such, in any material
respect.

 

(b)          Right to Vote with Holders of Common Stock on an As-Converted
Basis. Subject to the other provisions of, and without limiting the other voting
rights provided in, this Section 9, and except as provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation or required by the Delaware General Corporation Law, the Holders
will have the right, from and after the Antitrust Clearance Date, to vote
together as a single class with the holders of the Common Stock on each matter
submitted for a vote or consent by the holders of the Common Stock, and, solely
for these purposes, (i) the Convertible Preferred Stock of each Holder will
entitle such Holder to cast a number of votes on such matter equal to the number
of votes such Holder would have been entitled to cast if such Holder were the
holder of record, as of the record or other relevant date for such matter, of a
number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Common Stock
that would be issuable (determined in accordance with Section 10(e), including
Section 10(e)(ii), but without regard to Section 10(e)(iii)) upon conversion of
such Convertible Preferred Stock assuming such Convertible Preferred Stock were
converted pursuant to an Optional Conversion with a Conversion Date occurring on
such record or other relevant date; and (ii) the Holders will be entitled to
notice of all stockholder meetings or proposed actions by written consent in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws of the Company, and
the Delaware General Corporation Law as if the Holders were holders of Common
Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, the voting rights set forth in this Section
9(b) (i) will be limited or eliminated, as applicable, to the same extent to
which the right to convert the Convertible Preferred Stock is limited or
eliminated pursuant to Section 10(h); and (ii) will not apply at any time before
the Antitrust Clearance Date. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting
the voting rights set forth in this Section 9(b), no Holder of Convertible
Preferred Stock will be treated as the holder of the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of such Convertible Preferred Stock before the time set
forth in Section 10(d)(iv) in connection with the conversion of such Convertible
Preferred Stock.

 



 - 30 -

 

 

(c)           Procedures for Voting and Consents.

 

(i)            Voting Power of the Convertible Preferred Stock and Voting Parity
Stock. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to one vote on
each matter on which the Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock are entitled
to vote separately as a class and not together with the holders of any other
class or series of stock. The respective voting powers of the Convertible
Preferred Stock and all classes or series of Voting Parity Stock entitled to
vote on any matter together as a single class will be determined (including for
purposes of determining whether a plurality, majority or other applicable
portion of votes has been obtained) in proportion to their respective
liquidation amounts. Solely for purposes of the preceding sentence, the
liquidation amount of the Convertible Preferred Stock or any such class or
series of Voting Parity Stock will be the maximum amount payable in respect of
the Convertible Preferred Stock or such class or series, as applicable, assuming
the Company is liquidated pursuant to Section 6 on the record date for the
applicable vote or consent (or, if there is no record date, on the date of such
vote or consent).

 

(ii)           Written Consent in Lieu of Stockholder Meeting. A consent or
affirmative vote of the Holders pursuant to Section 9(a) may be given or
obtained either in writing without a meeting or in person or by proxy at a
regular annual meeting or a special meeting of stockholders.

 

Section 10.            Conversion.

 

(a)           Generally. Subject to the provisions of this Section 10, the
Convertible Preferred Stock may be converted only pursuant to a Mandatory
Conversion or an Optional Conversion.

 

(b)          Conversion at the Option of the Holders.

 

(i)            Conversion Right; When Shares May Be Submitted for Optional
Conversion. Subject to the provisions of this Section 10, Holders will have the
right to submit all, or any whole number of shares that is less than all, of
their shares of Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to an Optional Conversion
at any time after the date on which the Company has first held a meeting of its
stockholders for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Certificate of Designations and in addition to any other requirements for
Optional Conversion of such shares of Convertible Preferred Stock,

 

(1)               if a Change of Control Repurchase Notice is validly delivered
pursuant to Section 8(f)(i) with respect to any share of Convertible Preferred
Stock, then such share may not be submitted for Optional Conversion, except to
the extent (A) such share is not subject to such notice; (B) such notice is
withdrawn in accordance with Section 8(f)(iii); or (C) the Company fails to pay
the Change of Control Repurchase Price for such share in accordance with this
Certificate of Designations;

 

(2)               shares of Convertible Preferred Stock that are called for
Redemption may not be submitted for Optional Conversion after the Close of
Business on the Business Day immediately before the related Redemption Date (or,
if the Company fails to pay the Redemption Price due on such Redemption Date in
full, at any time until such time as the Company pays such Redemption Price in
full); and

 



 - 31 -

 

 

(3)               shares of Convertible Preferred Stock that are subject to
Mandatory Conversion may not be submitted for Optional Conversion after the
Close of Business on the Business Day immediately before the related Mandatory
Conversion Date.

 

(ii)           Conversions of Fractional Shares Not Permitted. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Certificate of Designations, in no event will
any Holder be entitled to convert a number of shares of Convertible Preferred
Stock that is not a whole number.

 

(c)           Mandatory Conversion at the Company’s Election.

 

(i)            Mandatory Conversion Right. Subject to the provisions of this
Section 10, the Company has the right (the “Mandatory Conversion Right”),
exercisable at its election, to designate any Business Day after the Initial
Issue Date as a Conversion Date for the conversion (such a conversion, a
“Mandatory Conversion”) of all, but not less than all, of the outstanding shares
of Convertible Preferred Stock, but only if the Last Reported Sale Price per
share of Common Stock exceeds the product of the Mandatory Conversion Threshold
Price Percentage and the Conversion Price on each of at least twenty (20)
Trading Days (whether or not consecutive) during the thirty (30) consecutive
Trading Days ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately before the
Mandatory Conversion Notice Date for such Mandatory Conversion.

 

(ii)           Mandatory Conversion Prohibited in Certain Circumstances. The
Company will not exercise its Mandatory Conversion Right, or otherwise send a
Mandatory Conversion Notice, with respect to any Convertible Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Section 10(c) unless (1) the Common Stock Liquidity Conditions
are satisfied with respect to the Mandatory Conversion; and (2) either (x) the
Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained or (y) the Company has previously
held one or more meetings of stockholders for the purposes of obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval and the Mandatory Conversion Date for such
Mandatory Conversion occurs after the sixth (6th) Regular Dividend Payment Date.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10(c), the Company’s
exercise of its Mandatory Conversion Right, and any related Mandatory Conversion
Notice, will not apply to any share of Convertible Preferred Stock as to which a
Change of Control Repurchase Notice has been duly delivered, and not withdrawn,
pursuant to Section 8(f).

 

(iii)          Mandatory Conversion Date. The Mandatory Conversion Date for any
Mandatory Conversion will be a Business Day of the Company’s choosing that is no
more than fifteen (15), nor less than ten (10), Business Days after the
Mandatory Conversion Notice Date for such Mandatory Conversion.

 



 - 32 -

 

 

(iv)          Mandatory Conversion Notice. To exercise its Mandatory Conversion
Right with respect to any shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, the Company
must send to each Holder of such shares a written notice of such exercise (a
“Mandatory Conversion Notice”). Such Mandatory Conversion Notice must state:

 

(1)               that the Company has exercised its Mandatory Conversion Right
to cause the Mandatory Conversion of the shares;

 

(2)               the Mandatory Conversion Date for such Mandatory Conversion
and the date scheduled for the settlement of such Mandatory Conversion;

 

(3)               that shares of Convertible Preferred Stock subject to
Mandatory Conversion may be converted earlier at the option of the Holders
thereof pursuant to an Optional Conversion at any time before the Close of
Business on the Business Day immediately before the Mandatory Conversion Date;
and

 

(4)               the Conversion Price and the Conversion Rate in effect on the
Mandatory Conversion Notice Date for such Mandatory Conversion.

 

(d)           Conversion Procedures.

 

(i)            Mandatory Conversion. If the Company duly exercises, in
accordance with this Section 10(c), its Mandatory Conversion Right with respect
to any share of Convertible Preferred Stock, then (1) the Mandatory Conversion
of such share will occur automatically and without the need for any action on
the part of the Holder(s) thereof; and (2) the shares of Common Stock due upon
such Mandatory Conversion will be registered in the name of, and, if applicable,
the cash due upon such Mandatory Conversion will be delivered to, the Holder(s)
of such share of Convertible Preferred Stock as of the Close of Business on the
related Mandatory Conversion Date.

 

(ii)           Requirements for Holders to Exercise Optional Conversion Right.

 

(1)               Generally. To convert any share of Convertible Preferred Stock
pursuant to an Optional Conversion, the Holder of such share must (w) complete,
manually sign and deliver to the Company a Conversion Notice; (x) deliver any
Physical Certificate representing such Convertible Preferred Stock to the
Company (at which time such Optional Conversion will become irrevocable); (y)
furnish any endorsements and transfer documents that the Company may require;
and (z) if applicable, pay any documentary or other taxes as pursuant to Section
11(d).

 

(2)               Optional Conversion Permitted only During Business Hours.
Convertible Preferred Stock may be surrendered for Optional Conversion only
after the Open of Business and before the Close of Business on a day that is a
Business Day.

 

(iii)          No Adjustments for Accumulated Regular Dividends. Without
limiting any adjustments to the Liquidation Preference required by this
Certificate of Designations, the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted to account
for any accumulated and unpaid Regular Dividends on any Convertible Preferred
Stock being converted.

 



 - 33 -

 

 

(iv)          When Holders Become Stockholders of Record of the Shares of Common
Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. The Person in whose name any share of Common
Stock is issuable upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock will be
deemed to become the holder of record of such share as of the Close of Business
on the Conversion Date for such conversion.

 

(e)           Settlement upon Conversion.

 

(i)            Generally. Subject to Section 10(e)(ii), Section 10(e)(iii),
Section 10(h) and Section 14(b), the consideration due upon settlement of the
conversion of each share of Convertible Preferred Stock will consist of a number
of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the Conversion Rate in
effect immediately before the Close of Business on the Conversion Date for such
conversion; and (B) the quotient obtained by dividing (I) the sum of (x) the
Liquidation Preference of such share of Convertible Preferred Stock immediately
before the Close of Business on such Conversion Date; (y) an amount equal to
accumulated and unpaid Regular Dividends on such share of Convertible Preferred
Stock to, but excluding, such Conversion Date (but only to the extent such
accumulated and unpaid Regular Dividends are not included in the Liquidation
Preference referred to in the preceding clause (x)); and (z) the Dividend
Make-Whole Amount for such conversion, by (II) the Initial Liquidation
Preference per share of Convertible Preferred Stock.

 

(ii)           Payment of Cash in Lieu of any Fractional Share of Common Stock.
Subject to Section 14(b), in lieu of delivering any fractional share of Common
Stock otherwise due upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock, the
Company will, to the extent it is legally able to do so, pay cash based on the
Last Reported Sale Price per share of Common Stock on the Conversion Date for
such conversion (or, if such Conversion Date is not a Trading Day, the
immediately preceding Trading Day).

 

(iii)          Company’s Right to Settle Optional Conversions in Cash. If any
Convertible Preferred Stock is to be converted pursuant to an Optional
Conversion, then the Company will have the right to settle such Optional
Conversion of such Convertible Preferred Stock (or any portion thereof that
represents a whole number of shares) solely in cash in an amount equal to the
product of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock that would be issuable upon
such Optional Conversion of such Convertible Preferred Stock (or such portion
thereof), determined in accordance with this Section 10 but without regard to
Section 10(e)(ii) or this Section 10(e)(iii)); and (2) the Last Reported Sale
Price per share of Common Stock on the Conversion Date for such Optional
Conversion. Such right can be exercised by Company solely by providing written
notice to the Holder of such Convertible Preferred Stock no later than the
Business Day after such Conversion Date, which notice states (x) that the
Company has elected to cash settle such Optional Conversion; and (y) the number
of shares of such Convertible Preferred Stock as to which such election is made.
Once such written notice is so provided exercising such right, such exercise
will be irrevocable with respect to such Optional Conversion (without affecting
the Company’s right to exercise or not exercise such right with respect to any
other Optional Conversion). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 10(e)(iii), the Company will not be entitled to exercise its right to
settle any Optional Conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock in cash pursuant
to this Section 10(e)(iii) unless the Company has sufficient funds legally
available, and is permitted under the terms of its indebtedness for borrowed
money, to fully pay the cash amounts that would be payable in respect of such
election

 



 - 34 -

 

 

(iv)          Delivery of Conversion Consideration. The Company will pay or
deliver, as applicable, the Conversion Consideration due upon conversion of any
Convertible Preferred Stock on or before the second (2nd) Business Day
immediately after the Conversion Date for such conversion.

 

(f)            Conversion Rate Adjustments.

 

(i)            Events Requiring an Adjustment to the Conversion Rate. The
Conversion Rate will be adjusted from time to time as follows:

 

(1)               Stock Dividends, Splits and Combinations. If the Company
issues solely shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on all or
substantially all shares of the Common Stock, or if the Company effects a stock
split or a stock combination of the Common Stock (in each case excluding an
issuance solely pursuant to a Common Stock Change Event, as to which Section
10(i) will apply), then the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the
following formula:

 

[tm2014143d1_ex10-1img01.jpg]

 

where:

 

CR0= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Close of Business on
the Record Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately before the
Close of Business on the effective date of such stock split or stock
combination, as applicable;

 

CR1= the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on
such Record Date or effective date, as applicable;

 

OS0= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before the
Close of Business on such Record Date or effective date, as applicable, without
giving effect to such dividend, distribution, stock split or stock combination;
and

 

OS1= the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving
effect to such dividend, distribution, stock split or stock combination.

 



 - 35 -

 

 

If any dividend, distribution, stock split or stock combination of the type
described in this Section 10(f)(i)(1) is declared or announced, but not so paid
or made, then the Conversion Rate will be readjusted, effective as of the date
the Board of Directors, or any Officer acting pursuant to authority conferred by
the Board of Directors, determines not to pay such dividend or distribution or
to effect such stock split or stock combination, to the Conversion Rate that
would then be in effect had such dividend, distribution, stock split or stock
combination not been declared or announced.

 

(2)               Degressive Issuances. Subject to Section 10(h), if, at any
time during the period from, and including, the Initial Issue Date to, and
including, the Degressive Issuance Sunset Date, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries issues or otherwise sells any shares of Common Stock, or any
Equity-Linked Securities, in each case at an Effective Price per share of Common
Stock that is less than the Conversion Price in effect (before giving effect to
the adjustment required by this Section 10(f)(i)(2)) as of the date of the
issuance or sale of such shares or Equity-Linked Securities (such an issuance or
sale, a “Degressive Issuance”), then, effective as of the Close of Business on
such date, the Conversion Rate will be increased to an amount equal to (x) the
Initial Liquidation Preference per share of Convertible Preferred Stock, divided
by (y) such Effective Price per share of Common Stock; provided, however, that
(A) the Conversion Rate will not be adjusted pursuant to this Section
10(f)(i)(2) as a result of an Exempt Issuance; (B) the issuance of shares of
Common Stock pursuant to any such Equity-Linked Securities will not constitute
an additional issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock for purposes of this
Section 10(f)(i)(2) (it being understood, for the avoidance of doubt, that the
issuance or sale of such Equity-Linked Securities, or any re-pricing or
amendment thereof, will be subject to this Section 10(f)(i)(2)); and (C) in no
event will the Conversion Rate be decreased pursuant to this Section
10(f)(i)(2).

 

For purposes of this Section 10(f)(i)(2), any re-pricing or amendment of any
Equity-Linked Securities (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
Equity-Linked Securities existing as of the Initial Issue Date) will be deemed
to be the issuance of additional Equity-Linked Securities, without affecting any
prior adjustments theretofore made to the Conversion Rate.

 

(ii)           No Other Required Adjustments. Without limiting the operation of
Sections 5(a)(ii)(1) and 10(e)(i), the Company will not be required to adjust
the Conversion Rate except pursuant to Section 10(f)(i).

 

(iii)          Determination of the Number of Outstanding Shares of Common
Stock. For purposes of Section 10(f)(i), the number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding at any time will (1) include shares issuable in respect of scrip
certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock; and (2)
exclude shares of Common Stock held in the Company’s treasury (unless the
Company pays any dividend or makes any distribution on shares of Common Stock
held in its treasury).

 

(iv)          Calculations. All calculations with respect to the Conversion Rate
and adjustments thereto will be made to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of
Common Stock (with 5/100,000ths rounded upward).

 

(v)           Notice of Conversion Rate Adjustments. Upon the effectiveness of
any adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10(f)(i), the Company
will promptly send notice to the Holders containing (1) a brief description of
the transaction or other event on account of which such adjustment was made; (2)
the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such adjustment; and (3) the
effective time of such adjustment.

 



 - 36 -

 

 

(g)          Voluntary Conversion Rate Increases.

 

(i)            Generally. To the extent permitted by law and applicable stock
exchange rules, the Company, from time to time, may (but is not required to)
increase the Conversion Rate by any amount if (1) the Board of Directors
determines that such increase is in the Company’s best interest or that such
increase is advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax imposed on holders of
Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock as a result of any dividend or
distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) of Common Stock or any
similar event; (2) such increase is in effect for a period of at least twenty
(20) Business Days; and (3) such increase is irrevocable during such period.

 

(ii)           Notice of Voluntary Increase. If the Board of Directors
determines to increase the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10(g)(i), then,
no later than the first Business Day of the related twenty (20) Business Day
period referred to in Section 10(g)(i), the Company will send notice to each
Holder of such increase to the Conversion Rate, the amount thereof and the
period during which such increase will be in effect.

 

(iii)          Limitation on Voluntary Conversion Rate Increases.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10(g) to the contrary, unless and until
the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company may not increase the
Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10(g)(i) to the extent such increase would
cause the Conversion Price to be less than $13.94 per share of Common Stock
(subject to proportionate adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits or stock
combinations with respect to the Common Stock).

 

(h)           Restriction on Conversions and Certain Degressive Issuances.

 

(i)            Limitation on Conversion Right. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Certificate of Designations, unless and until the Requisite
Stockholder Approval is obtained, no shares of Common Stock will be issued or
delivered upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock of any Holder, and
no Convertible Preferred Stock of any Holder will be convertible, in each case
to the extent, and only to the extent, that such issuance, delivery, conversion
or convertibility would result in such Holder or a “person” or “group” (within
the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning in
excess of nineteen and ninety-nine-one-hundredths percent (19.99%) of the
then-outstanding Stockholder Voting Power (the restrictions set forth in this
sentence, the “Ownership Limitation”). For these purposes, beneficial ownership
and calculations of percentage ownership will be determined in accordance with
Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act.

 



 - 37 -

 

 

Any purported delivery of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the
Convertible Preferred Stock will be void and have no effect to the extent, but
only to the extent, that such delivery would result in any Holder becoming the
beneficial owner of shares of Common Stock outstanding at such time in excess of
the Ownership Limitation. For the avoidance of doubt, a Holder may effect an
Optional Conversion, and the Company may, upon exercise of its Mandatory
Conversion Right, force conversion of, a portion of such Holder’s Convertible
Preferred Stock up to the Ownership Limitation, in each case subject to the
other requirements of this Certificate of Designations applicable to such
Optional Conversion or Mandatory Conversion, as applicable.

 

If any Conversion Consideration otherwise due upon the conversion of any
Convertible Preferred Stock is not delivered as a result of the Ownership
Limitation, then the Company’s obligation to deliver such Conversion
Consideration will not be extinguished, and the Company will deliver such
Conversion Consideration as soon as reasonably practicable after the Holder of
such Convertible Preferred Stock provides written evidence satisfactory to the
Company that such delivery will not contravene the Ownership Limitation. A
Holder will provide such evidence as soon as reasonably practicable after its
beneficial ownership is such that additional shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock may be delivered without
contravening the Ownership Limitation.

 

(ii)           Limitation of Adjustments for, and Prohibition of, Certain
Degressive Issuances. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Certificate of Designations, unless and until the Requisite Stockholder Approval
is obtained, no adjustment will be made to the Conversion Rate pursuant to
Section 10(f)(i)(2) to the extent, but only to the extent, such adjustment would
cause the Conversion Price to be less than $13.94 per share of Common Stock
(subject to proportionate adjustment for stock dividends, stock splits or stock
combinations with respect to the Common Stock). Unless and until the Requisite
Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Company will not, without the prior
written consent of Holders of a majority of the Convertible Preferred Stock then
outstanding, effect any Degressive Issuance if the adjustment on account of such
Degressive Issuance pursuant to Section 10(f)(i)(2) would be limited by the
preceding sentence. If the Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained at any
time after any adjustment to the Conversion Rate is limited pursuant to the
first sentence of this Section 10(h)(ii), then, effective as of the time such
Requisite Stockholder Approval is obtained, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted
to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect assuming that the first
sentence of this Section 10(h)(ii) had not applied to any prior adjustment to
the Conversion Rate.

 

(iii)          Covenant to Seek the Requisite Stockholder Approval; Adjustment
to Regular Dividend Rate. The Company will use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the Requisite Stockholder Approval, including by seeking such approval,
if not previously obtained, at each future regular annual meeting of its
stockholders and endorsing its approval in the related proxy materials. The
Company will promptly notify the Holders if the Requisite Stockholder Approval
is obtained. If the Requisite Stockholder Approval is not obtained on or before
the Requisite Stockholder Approval Deadline Date, then the Regular Dividend Rate
will be increased by one percent (1%), with such increase applying from, and
including, the Requisite Stockholder Approval Deadline Date and continuing to
apply to, but excluding, the date when the Requisite Stockholder Approval is
first obtained, if at all.

 



 - 38 -

 

 

(i)            Effect of Common Stock Change Event.

 

(i)            Generally. If there occurs any:

 

(1)               recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common
Stock, other than (x) changes solely resulting from a subdivision or combination
of the Common Stock, (y) a change only in par value or from par value to no par
value or no par value to par value or (z) stock splits and stock combinations
that do not involve the issuance of any other series or class of securities;

 

(2)               consolidation, merger, combination or binding or statutory
share exchange involving the Company;

 

(3)               sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person;
or

 

(4)               other similar event,

 

and, as a result of which, the Common Stock is converted into, or is exchanged
for, or represents solely the right to receive, other securities, cash or other
property, or any combination of the foregoing (such an event, a “Common Stock
Change Event,” and such other securities, cash or property, the “Reference
Property,” and the amount and kind of Reference Property that a holder of one
(1) share of Common Stock would be entitled to receive on account of such Common
Stock Change Event (without giving effect to any arrangement not to issue or
deliver a fractional portion of any security or other property), a “Reference
Property Unit”), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Certificate of Designations,

 

(A)       from and after the effective time of such Common Stock Change Event,
(I) the consideration due upon conversion of any Convertible Preferred Stock
will be determined in the same manner as if each reference to any number of
shares of Common Stock in this Section 10 or in Section 11, or in any related
definitions, were instead a reference to the same number of Reference Property
Units; (II) for purposes of Section 10(c), each reference to any number of
shares of Common Stock in such Section (or in any related definitions) will
instead be deemed to be a reference to the same number of Reference Property
Units; and (III) for purposes of the definition of “Change of Control,” the
terms “Common Stock” and “common equity” will be deemed to mean the common
equity (including depositary receipts representing common equity), if any,
forming part of such Reference Property; and

 



 - 39 -

 

 

(B)       for these purposes, the Last Reported Sale Price of any Reference
Property Unit or portion thereof that does not consist of a class of securities
will be the fair value of such Reference Property Unit or portion thereof, as
applicable, determined in good faith by the Company (or, in the case of cash
denominated in U.S. dollars, the face amount thereof).

 

If the Reference Property consists of more than a single type of consideration
to be determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election, then the
composition of the Reference Property Unit will be deemed to be the weighted
average of the types and amounts of consideration actually received, per share
of Common Stock, by the holders of Common Stock. The Company will notify the
Holders of such weighted average as soon as practicable after such determination
is made.

 

(ii)           Compliance Covenant. The Company will not become a party to any
Common Stock Change Event unless its terms are consistent with this Section
10(i).

 

(iii)          Execution of Supplemental Instruments. On or before the date the
Common Stock Change Event becomes effective, the Company and, if applicable, the
resulting, surviving or transferee Person (if not the Company) of such Common
Stock Change Event (the “Successor Person”) will execute and deliver such
supplemental instruments, if any, as the Company reasonably determines are
necessary or desirable to (1) provide for subsequent adjustments to the
Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10(f)(i) in a manner consistent with this
Section 10(i); and (2) give effect to such other provisions, if any, as the
Company reasonably determines are appropriate to preserve the economic interests
of the Holders and to give effect to Section 10(i)(i). If the Reference Property
includes shares of stock or other securities or assets of a Person other than
the Successor Person, then such other Person will also execute such supplemental
instrument(s) and such supplemental instrument(s) will contain such additional
provisions, if any, that the Company reasonably determines are appropriate to
preserve the economic interests of Holders.

 

(iv)          Notice of Common Stock Change Event. The Company will provide
notice of each Common Stock Change Event to Holders no later than the effective
date of the Common Stock Change Event.

 

Section 11.            Certain Provisions Relating to the Issuance of Common
Stock.

 

(a)           Equitable Adjustments to Prices. Whenever this Certificate of
Designations requires the Company to calculate the average of the Last Reported
Sale Prices, or any function thereof, over a period of multiple days (including
to calculate an adjustment to the Conversion Rate), the Company will make
appropriate adjustments, if any, to those calculations to account for any
adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to Section 10(f)(i) that becomes
effective, or any event requiring such an adjustment to the Conversion Rate
where the Ex-Dividend Date, effective date or Expiration Date, as applicable, of
such event occurs, at any time during such period.

 

(b)           Reservation of Shares of Common Stock. The Company will reserve,
out of its authorized, unreserved and not outstanding shares of Common Stock,
for delivery upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock, a number of
shares of Common Stock that would be sufficient to settle the conversion of all
shares of Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding, if any. To the extent
the Company delivers shares of Common Stock held in the Company’s treasury in
settlement of any obligation under this Certificate of Designations to deliver
shares of Common Stock, each reference in this Certificate of Designations to
the issuance of shares of Common Stock in connection therewith will be deemed to
include such delivery.

 

 - 40 -

 



 

(c)           Status of Shares of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock
delivered upon conversion of on the Convertible Preferred Stock of any Holder
will be a newly issued or treasury share and will be duly and validly issued,
fully paid, non-assessable, free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or
adverse claim (except to the extent of any lien or adverse claim created by the
action or inaction of such Holder or the Person to whom such share of Common
Stock will be delivered). If the Common Stock is then listed on any securities
exchange, or quoted on any inter-dealer quotation system, then the Company will
cause each such share of Common Stock, when so delivered, to be admitted for
listing on such exchange or quotation on such system.

 

(d)          Taxes Upon Issuance of Common Stock. The Company will pay any
documentary, stamp or similar issue or transfer tax or duty due on the issue of
any shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock of
any Holder, except any tax or duty that is due because such Holder requests
those shares to be registered in a name other than such Holder’s name.

 

Section 12.            No Preemptive Rights. Without limiting the rights of any
Holder set forth in this Certificate of Designations (including in connection
with the issuance of Common Stock or Reference Property upon conversion of the
Convertible Preferred Stock), the Convertible Preferred Stock will not have any
preemptive rights to subscribe for or purchase any of the Company’s securities.

 

Section 13.           Tax Treatment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Certificate of Designations, for U.S. federal and other applicable state
and local income tax purposes, it is intended that (a) the Convertible Preferred
Stock will not be treated as “preferred stock” within the meaning of Section
305(b)(4) of Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.305-5(a); and (b) no Holder
will be required to include in income any amounts in respect of the Convertible
Preferred Stock by operation of Section 305(b) or (c) of the Code. The Company
will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and agents to, report consistently with,
and take no positions or actions inconsistent with, the foregoing treatment
(including by way of withholding) unless otherwise required by a determination
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code. The Company will not, and
will not cause or permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue any securities or
otherwise take any action that could reasonably be expected to affect the
treatment described in clause (b).

 

 - 41 -

 

 

 

 

Section 14.            Calculations.

 

(a)               Responsibility; Schedule of Calculations. Except as otherwise
provided in this Certificate of Designations, the Company will be responsible
for making all calculations called for under this Certificate of Designations or
the Convertible Preferred Stock, including determinations of the Conversion
Rate, the Last Reported Sale Prices and accumulated Regular Dividends on the
Convertible Preferred Stock. The Company will make all calculations in good
faith, and, absent manifest error, its calculations will be final and binding on
all Holders. The Company will provide a schedule of such calculations to any
Holder upon written request.

 

(b)               Calculations Aggregated for Each Holder. The composition of
the Conversion Consideration due upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred
Stock of any Holder will be computed based on the total number of shares of
Convertible Preferred Stock of such Holder being converted with the same
Conversion Date. For these purposes, any cash amounts due to such Holder in
respect thereof will be rounded to the nearest cent.

 

Section 15.            Notices. The Company will send all notices or
communications to Holders pursuant to this Certificate of Designations in
writing and delivered personally, by facsimile or e-mail (with confirmation of
receipt from the recipient, in the case of e-mail), or sent by a nationally
recognized overnight courier service to the Holders’ respective addresses shown
on the Register. Notwithstanding anything in the Certificate of Designations to
the contrary, any defect in the delivery of any such notice or communication
will not impair or affect the validity of such notice or communication and the
failure to give any such notice or communication to all the Holders will not
impair or affect the validity of such notice or communication to whom such
notice is sent.

 

Section 16.            Legally Available Funds. Without limiting the rights of
any Holder (including pursuant to Section 6), if the Company does not have
sufficient funds legally available to fully pay any cash amount otherwise due on
the Convertible Preferred Stock, then the Company will pay the deficiency
promptly after funds thereafter become legally available therefor.

 

Section 17.            No Other Rights. The Convertible Preferred Stock will
have no rights, preferences or voting powers except as provided in this
Certificate of Designations or the Certificate of Incorporation or as required
by applicable law.

ascribed to them in the Investment Agreement.

 

As of the date hereof, the undersigned (“Stockholder”) is the record or

be heard first in the Delaware Court of Chancery, and, if applicable, in any
state or federal court located in of Delaware in which appeal from the Court of
Chancery may validly be taken under the laws of the State of Delaware (each a
“Chosen Court” and collectively, the “Chosen Courts”), and the parties agree to

proceeding brought in any such Chosen Court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum. Such Persons further covenant not to bring a proceeding with respect to
the Applicable Matters (or that could affect any Applicable Matter) other than
in such Chosen Court and not to challenge or enforce in another jurisdiction a
judgment of such Chosen Court. Process in any such proceeding may be served on
any Person with respect to such Applicable Matters anywhere in the world,
whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such Chosen Court. AS A
SPECIFICALLY BARGAINED FOR INDUCEMENT FOR EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO ENTER
INTO THIS SUPPORT AGREEMENT (AFTER HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH

LAWSUIT OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO OR ARISING IN ANY WAY FROM THIS SUPPORT

agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
Neither party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use
of electronic transmission by a facsimile machine or via email to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through such electronic transmission as a defense to
the formation of a contract and each such party forever waives any such defense.
This Support Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which
will be an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same
agreement binding on each party hereto.

 

(e)Neither party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of
this Support Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Support Agreement, unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or
remedy is expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and
delivered on behalf of such party; and any such waiver shall not be applicable
or have any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. No
failure on the part of either party to exercise any power, right, privilege or
remedy under this Support Agreement, and no delay on the part of either party in
exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Support Agreement,
shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy; and no
single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right,
privilege or remedy.

director and the other of whom shall be a Group III director under the
Certificate of Incorporation as designated by MDP; and

 

(ii)              one nominee until the first time when the Voting Percentage of
MDP and its Affiliates is less than 5%, who shall be either a Group II director
or a Group III director under the Certificate of Incorporation;

 

provided that no reduction in the Voting Percentage of MDP and its Affiliates
shall shorten the term of any director serving on the Board. The initial MDP
Designated Directors as of the Effective Date are Vahe A. Dombalagian (who has
been named as a Group III director) and Matthew W. Raino (who has been named as
a Group II director).

 

(b)               Subject to Section 2.02(c), the Company shall take all actions
(to the extent such actions are permitted by applicable law) to (i) include each
MDP Designated Director in the slate of director nominees for election by the
Company’s stockholders and (ii) include each MDP Designated Director in the
proxy statement prepared by the Company in connection with soliciting proxies
for every meeting of the stockholders of the Company called with respect to the
election of members of the Board, and at every adjournment or postponement
thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent of the Board with
respect to the election of members of the Board.

 

(c)               The Company’s obligations pursuant to Section 2.02(b) shall be
subject to each MDP Designated Director providing, fully and completely, (i) any
information that is required to be disclosed in any filing or report under the
listing standards of the Securities Exchange and applicable law, (ii) any
information that is required in connection with determining the independence
status of the MDP Designated Directors under the listing standards of the
Securities Exchange and applicable law, and (iii) if required by applicable law,
such individual’s written consent to being named in a proxy statement as a
nominee and to serving as director if elected.

 

(d)               If an MDP Designated Director is not appointed, nominated or
elected to the Board because of such person’s death, disability,
disqualification, withdrawal as a nominee or for other reason, (i) MDP shall be
entitled to designate another nominee and shall do so as promptly as practicable
following the failure of such MDP Designated Director to be appointed, nominated
or elected to the Board and (ii) the director position for which the original
MDP Designated Director was nominated shall not be filled pending such
designation.

 



 

 

 

(e)               If a vacancy occurs because of the death, disability,
disqualification, resignation or removal of a MDP Designated Director or for any
other reason, MDP shall be entitled to designate such person’s successor
(regardless of the Voting Percentage held by MDP at the time of such replacement
designation), and the Board shall promptly fill the vacancy with such successor,
it being understood that any such successor designee shall serve the remainder
of the term of the MDP Designated Director whom such designee replaces. MDP
shall designate a successor pursuant to this Section 2.02(e) as promptly as
practicable following any such vacancy.

Director’s participation in the meetings of the Board or any committee of the

reasonable and documented travel, lodging and meal expenses, in each case to the
same extent as the Company reimburses the other non-executive members of the
Board for such expenses.

 

Section 2.04        Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

 

(a)               The Company shall maintain in effect at all times directors’
and officers’ indemnity insurance covering the MDP Designated Directors to the
same extent and on the same terms as any directors’ and officers’ indemnity
insurance maintained by the Company with respect to the other non-executive
members of the Board. Any directors’ and officers’ indemnity insurance shall be
secondary to any insurance coverage for any of the MDP Designated Directors
maintained by MDP.

 

(b)               The Company shall not amend or alter any right to
indemnification, exculpation or the advancement of expenses covering or
benefiting any MDP Designated Director contained in the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the Effective Date without the prior
written consent of the MDP, except to the extent (i) required by applicable law
or the listing standards of the Securities Exchange (and in such cases, in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws) or (ii) such
amendment or alteration provides a broader right to indemnification, exculpation
or advancement of expenses than those previously contained in the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws, as applicable.

 

Section 2.05        Corporate Policies. Except as otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation, MDP acknowledges that each MDP Designated Director
will be subject to all applicable corporate governance, conflict of interest,
confidentiality, stock ownership and insider trading policies and guidelines of
the Company, each as approved by the Board from time to time to the extent such
policies and guidelines are applicable to all non-executive directors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no confidentiality policy shall preclude any MDP
Designated Director that is an employee of MDP or its Affiliates from sharing
information with MDP (but not MDP’s portfolio companies); provided that MDP
maintains the confidentiality of such information.
