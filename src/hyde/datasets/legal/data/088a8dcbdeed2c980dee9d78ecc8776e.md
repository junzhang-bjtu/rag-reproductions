Section 1.05.      [Reserved].

 

Section 1.06.      Interest Rates; LIBOR Notification. The interest rate on
Euro-Currency Loans is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate, which is
derived from the London interbank offered rate. The London interbank offered
rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks may obtain
short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July
2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that, after the end of
2021, it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate
submissions to the ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to
the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the “IBA”) for purposes of the IBA setting the
London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in
2022, the London interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no
longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine the
interest rate on Euro-Currency Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and
private sector industry initiatives are currently underway to identify new or
alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered
rate. In the event that the London interbank offered rate is no longer available
or in certain other circumstances as set forth in Section 2.13(b) of this
Agreement, such Section 2.13(b) provides a mechanism for determining an
alternative rate of interest. The Administrative Agent will notify the Company,
pursuant to Section 2.13, in advance of any change to the reference rate upon
which the interest rate on Euro-Currency Loans is based. However, the
Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and
shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or
availability of the London interbank offered rate or other rates in the
definition of “LIBO Rate” or with respect to any alternative or successor rate
thereto, or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the
composition or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement
reference rate, as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.13(b),
will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence of, the
LIBO Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank
offered rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability (other than, for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to its obligation to apply the definition of
such rate in accordance with its terms and comply with its obligations in
Article 2 (including Section 2.13) of this Agreement).

 

 

25

 



Section 1.07.      Certain Calculations. No Default or Event of Default shall
arise as a result of any limitation or threshold set forth in Dollars in
‎Articles 6 and 8 under this Agreement being exceeded solely as a result of
changes in currency exchange rates from those rates applicable on the last day
of the fiscal quarter of the Company immediately preceding the fiscal quarter of
the Company in which the applicable transaction or occurrence requiring a
determination occurs.

 

Section 1.08.      Divisions. For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in
connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any
comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset,
right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right,
obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have
been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if
any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have
been organized and acquired on the first date of its existence by the holders of
its equity interests at such time.

 

Article 2
The Credits

 

Section 2.01.      Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth

that, immediately after each such Loan is made, the amount of each Lender’s

Section 2.02.      Loans and Borrowings. (a) Each Revolving Loan shall be made
as part of a Borrowing consisting of Revolving Loans made by the Lenders ratably
in accordance with their respective Commitments. The failure of any Lender to
make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of
its obligations hereunder; provided that the Commitments of the Lenders are
several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to
make Loans as required. Each Lender may, at its option, make any Loan available
to any foreign Subsidiary Borrower by causing any foreign or domestic branch or
Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such
option shall not affect the obligation of such foreign Subsidiary Borrower to
repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

(b)         Subject to Section 2.13, each Revolving Borrowing shall be comprised
entirely of ABR Loans or Euro-Currency Loans as the Borrower may request in
accordance herewith. Each Lender at its option may make any Euro-Currency Loan
by causing any domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make
such Loan; provided that any exercise of such option shall not affect the
obligation of the Borrower to repay such Loan in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement.

 



26

 

 

(c)         At the time that any Revolving Borrowing is made, such Borrowing
shall be (i) in the case of a Dollar-Denominated Revolving Borrowing, in an
aggregate Dollar Amount that is not less than $10,000,000 and an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 and (ii) in the case of a Borrowing denominated in an
Alternative Currency, in an aggregate amount in such Alternative Currency that
is not less than 10,000,000 units of such Alternative Currency and an integral
multiple of 1,000,000 units of such Alternative Currency; provided that an ABR
Revolving Borrowing may be in an aggregate amount that is equal to the entire
unused balance of the total Commitments. Borrowings of more than one Type and
Class may be outstanding at the same time; provided that there shall not at any
time be more than a total of ten Euro-Currency Borrowings outstanding.

 

(d)         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower
shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue, any
Borrowing if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after
the Maturity Date.

 

Section 2.03.      Requests for Revolving Borrowings. To request a Revolving
Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request
(a) in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, by irrevocable written notice (via a
written Borrowing Request) not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, three
Euro-Dollar Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing, (b) in the

Day in the case of an ABR Revolving Borrowing and a Euro-Currency Business Day

(iii)            in the case of a Revolving Borrowing in Dollars, whether such
Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Euro-Dollar Borrowing;

 

(iv)            in the case of a Euro-Currency Borrowing, the initial Interest
Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated by the
definition of the term “Interest Period”; and

 

(v)             the location and number of the Borrower’s account to which funds
are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.06.

 



27

 

 

If no election as to the Type of Revolving Borrowing denominated in Dollars is
specified, then the requested Revolving Borrowing shall be a Euro-Dollar
Borrowing with an Interest Period of one month’s duration. If no Interest Period
is specified with respect to any requested Euro-Currency Borrowing, then the
Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month’s
duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with
this Section, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details
thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s Loan to be made as part of the
requested Borrowing.

 

Section 2.04.      [Reserved].

 

Section 2.05.      [Reserved].

 

Section 2.06.      Funding of Borrowings. (a) Each Lender shall make each Loan
to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof solely by wire transfer:

 

(i)            if such Borrowing is to be made in Dollars, not later than 12:00
noon (New York City time), in funds immediately available in New York City, to
the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated for such
purpose by notice to the Lenders; or

 

(ii)            if such Borrowing is to be made in an Alternative Currency, not
later than 12:00 noon (New York City time), in such Alternative Currency (in
such funds as may then be customary for the settlement of international
transactions in such Alternative Currency) to the account of the Administrative
Agent as shall have most recently been designated by the Administrative Agent
for such purpose by notice to the Lenders.

 

The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by
promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the
Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request.

 

Each Lender may, at its option, make any Loan available to any Borrower not
organized in the United States by causing any foreign or domestic branch or
Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan; provided that any exercise of such
option shall not affect the obligation of such Borrower to repay such Loan in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

(b)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not
make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such
share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share
of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the
applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative
Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the
Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
the NYFRB Rate (if such amount was distributed in Dollars) or the rate per annum
at which one-day deposits in the relevant currency are offered by the principal
London office of the Administrative Agent in the London interbank market (if
such amount was distributed in an Alternative Currency).

Section 2.07.      Interest Elections. (a) Each Dollar-Denominated Revolving
Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing
Request and, in the case of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, shall have an initial
Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the
applicable Borrower may elect to convert any Revolving Borrowing to a different
Type or to continue any such Borrowing and, in the case of a Euro-Dollar
Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.
The applicable Borrower may elect different options with respect to different
portions of any affected Revolving Borrowing, in which case each such portion
shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such
Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a
separate Borrowing.

 

(b)         To make an election pursuant to Section 2.07(a) in respect of a
Revolving Borrowing, the applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative
Agent of such election by irrevocable written notice (via a written Interest
Request) by the time that a Revolving Borrowing Request for a Revolving
Borrowing would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting
a Dollar-Denominated Loan of the Type resulting from such election to be made on
the effective date of such election.

 

(c)         Each Interest Election Request shall specify the following
information:

 

(i)            the Revolving Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request
applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different
portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting
Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to
paragraphs (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting
Borrowing);

 

(ii)            the effective date of the election made pursuant to such
Interest Election Request, which shall be a Domestic Business Day in the case of
an ABR Borrowing and a Euro-Dollar Business Day in the case of a Euro-Dollar
Borrowing;

 

(iii)            whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a
Euro-Dollar Borrowing; and

 

(iv)            if the resulting Borrowing is a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, the
Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election,
which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest
Period”.

 

If any such Interest Election Request requests a Euro-Dollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to
have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.

 

(d)         Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.

 



29

 

 

(e)         If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest
Election Request with respect to a Euro-Dollar Borrowing prior to the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Revolving Borrowing is
repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Revolving
Borrowing shall be continued as a Euro-Dollar Borrowing with an Interest Period
of one month’s duration. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at
the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the applicable Borrower, then,
so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving
Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Euro-Dollar Borrowing and (ii)
unless repaid, each Euro-Dollar Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing
at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

 

(f)          Each Revolving Loan that is an Alternative Currency Loan shall have
an initial Interest Period as specified in the applicable Borrowing Request.
Thereafter, the applicable Borrower may elect to continue such Revolving
Borrowing and may elect Interest Periods therefor, by notifying the
Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time and at the office
that a Revolving Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such
Borrower were requesting an Alternative Currency Loan to be made on the
effective date of such election. The applicable Borrower may elect different
options with respect to different portions of the affected Revolving Borrowing
(each in a minimum Dollar Amount of $10,000,000), in which case each such
portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans
comprising any such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall
be considered a separate Borrowing. Promptly following receipt of such Interest
Election Request the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the
details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing. If the
applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with
respect to an Alternative Currency Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, or any Interest Election Request fails to specify an
Interest Period, then unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, such
Borrower shall be deemed to have elected a subsequent Interest Period of one
month’s duration.

 

Section 2.08.      Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) Unless
previously terminated, the Commitments shall terminate on the Maturity Date.

 

(b)         The Company may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce,
the Commitments; provided that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in
an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than
$10,000,000 and (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the Commitments
if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance
with Section 2.10, the Total Revolving Credit Exposure of all Lenders would
exceed the total Commitments.

 



30

 

 

(c)         Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the acquisition of one Lender by
another Lender, or the merger, consolidation or other combination of any two or
more Lenders (any such acquisition, merger, consolidation or other combination
being referred to hereinafter as a “Combination” and each Lender which is a
party to such Combination being hereinafter referred to as a “Combined Lender”),
the Company may notify the Administrative Agent that it desires to reduce the
Commitment of the Lender surviving such Combination (the “Surviving Lender”) to
an amount equal to the Commitment of that Combined Lender which had the largest
Commitment of each of the Combined Lenders party to such Combination (such
largest Commitment being the “Surviving Commitment” and the Commitments of the
other Combined Lenders being hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the
“Retired Commitments”). If the Required Lenders (determined as set forth below)
and the Administrative Agent agree to such reduction in the Surviving Lender’s
Commitment, then (i) the aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be reduced by
the Retired Commitments effective upon the effective date of the Combination (or
such later date as the Company may specify in its request), provided that, on or
before such date the Borrowers have paid in full the outstanding principal
amount of the Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other
amounts payable to it hereunder of each of the Combined Lenders other than the
Combined Lender whose Commitment is the Surviving Commitment, (ii) from and
after the effective date of such reduction, the Surviving Lender shall have no
obligation with respect to the Retired Commitments, and (iii) the Company shall
notify the Administrative Agent whether it wants such reduction to be a
permanent reduction or a temporary reduction. If such reduction is to be a
temporary reduction, then the Company shall be responsible for finding one or
more financial institutions (which for the avoidance of doubt may be an existing
Lender) (each, a “Replacement Lender”), acceptable to the Administrative Agent
(such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
willing to assume the obligations of a Lender hereunder with aggregate
Commitments up to the amount of the Retired Commitments. The Administrative
Agent may require the Replacement Lenders to execute such documents, instruments
or agreements as the Administrative Agent reasonably deems necessary or
desirable to evidence such Replacement Lenders’ agreement to become parties
hereunder. For purposes of this Section 2.08(c), Required Lenders shall be
determined as if the reduction in the aggregate amount of the Commitments
requested by the Company had occurred (i.e., the Combined Lenders shall be
deemed to have a single Commitment equal to the Surviving Commitment and the
aggregate amount of the Commitments shall be deemed to have been reduced by the
Retired Commitments).

 

(d)         The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to
terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least
three (3) Domestic Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination
or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly
following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the
Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant
to this Section shall be irrevocable; provided that a notice of termination or
reduction of the Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice
is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or other
matters specified therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the
Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified
effective date) if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction
of the Commitments shall be permanent. Each reduction of the Commitments under
this Section 2.08 shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with
their respective Commitments.

 

(e)         In addition, the Commitments shall be permanently and irrevocably
reduced as and when provided in Section 2.10(c).

 

Section 2.09.      Repayment of Loans; Evidence of Debt.

 

(a)           The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender the then unpaid principal
amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date.

 



31

 

 

(b)         Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an
account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender
resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal
and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.

 

(c)         The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall
record (i) the currency and amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and
Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any
principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the
applicable Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum
received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders
and each Lender’s share thereof.

 

(d)         The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to
paragraph (b) or (c) of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the
existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein; provided that the
failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or
any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers
to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

(e)         Any Lender may request that Loans made by it to any Borrower be
evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, such Borrower shall prepare,
execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender and
its registered assigns and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and
interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to
Section 12.04) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form
payable to the payee named therein and its registered assigns.

 

Section 2.10.      Prepayment of Loans. (a) Each Borrower shall have the right
at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part,
subject to prior notice in accordance with paragraph (b) of this Section.

 

(b)         The applicable Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed by facsimile) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case
of prepayment of a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York
City time, three Euro-Dollar Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii)
in the case of prepayment of an Alternative Currency Borrowing, not later than
11:00 a.m., New York City time, three Euro-Currency Business Days before the
date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Revolving
Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Domestic Business
Day before the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and
shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or
portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that (A) if a notice of prepayment is
given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments
as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked
if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08 and (B)
a notice of prepayment by any Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned
upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or other matters specified
therein, in which case such notice may be revoked by the applicable Borrower (by
notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date)
if such condition is not satisfied. Promptly following receipt of any such
notice relating to a Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise
the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Revolving
Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an
advance of a Revolving Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02.
Each prepayment under this Section 2.10 shall be applied ratably to the Loans
included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by (i)
accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.12 and (ii) break funding
payments required by Section 2.15.

 



32

 

 

(c)         In the event and on each occasion that any Net Cash Proceeds are
received by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from either
(i) the incurrence of any Specified Indebtedness or (ii) the issuance of any
Specified Equity, the Company shall in each case, with respect to any Loans then
outstanding, within five (5) Business Days after such Net Cash Proceeds are
received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, prepay the principal amount
of such Loans then outstanding (if any) in an amount equal to the lesser of (x)
the principal amount of Loans then outstanding and (y) 100% of the amount of
such Net Cash Proceeds, which proceeds shall be applied in each case to
minimize, to the extent reasonably practicable, any additional amounts required
under Section 2.15 (it being understood and agreed that nothing in such Section
2.15 or with respect to the amounts required thereunder in respect of such
application of proceeds shall delay the application of such proceeds as
contemplated by this Section 2.10(c)), and, regardless of whether any Loans were
outstanding and required to be so prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.10(c),
there shall be an immediate, permanent and irrevocable ratable reduction of the
Commitments then outstanding (1) effective as of the date such Net Cash Proceeds
are received by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in an amount equal to
the amount by which 100% of the amount of such Net Cash Proceeds exceeds the
principal amount of Loans then outstanding, and (2) upon the earlier of such
prepayment of outstanding Loans described above and such fifth (5th) Business
Day after the receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds in an amount equal to the
principal amount of Loans then outstanding. The Company shall provide prior
written notice to the Administrative Agent regarding each prepayment and
commitment reduction pursuant to this Section 2.10(c).

 

Section 2.11.      Fees. (a) Subject to Section 2.23, the Company agrees to pay
to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee in
Dollars, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily unused amount of
the Commitment of such Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) during the period
from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such
Commitment terminates. Accrued commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on
the twentieth (20th) day following the last day of March, June, September and
December of each year and on the date on which the Commitments terminate,
commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. If the date on
which accrued commitment fees are payable is not a Domestic Business Day, the
date for payment of such fees shall be extended to the next succeeding Domestic
Business Day. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including
the first day but excluding the last day).

 

(b)         On September 30, 2020, the Company agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a duration fee in Dollars of
0.10% of the Commitment then outstanding held by such Lender on September 30,
2020.

 



33

 

 

(c)         All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent for distribution, in
the case of commitment fees and duration fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto.
Fees paid in accordance with this Section 2.11 shall not be refundable under any
circumstances.

 

Section 2.12.      Interest. (a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall
bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate.

 

(b)         The Loans comprising each Euro-Currency Borrowing shall bear
interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such
Borrowing plus the Applicable Rate.

 

(c)         [Reserved].

 

(d)         Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on
any Loan or any fee or other amount payable by any Borrower hereunder is not
paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such
overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate
per annum equal to (i) in the case of overdue principal of or interest on any
Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the
preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2%
plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this
Section.

 

(e)         Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date for such Loan, on the Maturity Date for such Loan and, in
the case of Revolving Loans, upon termination of the Commitments; provided that
(i) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable
on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other
than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Availability
Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be
payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of
any conversion of any Euro-Dollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest
Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective
date of such conversion.

 

(f)          All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days, except that (i) interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base
Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) and
(ii) interest computed with respect to Loans denominated in Pound Sterling (if
any) shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days, and in each case
shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day
but excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO
Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination
shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error.

 

Section 2.13.      Alternate Rate of Interest. (a) If prior to the commencement
of any Interest Period for a Euro-Currency Borrowing:

 

(i)       the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive and binding absent demonstrable error) that adequate and reasonable
means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate for
deposits in the relevant currency for such Interest Period; or

  

34

 



 

 

 

 

 

(ii)       the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the
Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate applicable to Euro-Currency Borrowings in
the relevant currency for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included
in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;

 

then the Administrative Agent shall give notice (in reasonable detail) thereof
to the Company and the Lenders by telephone or facsimile as promptly as
practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company
and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer
exist (which the Administrative Agent shall do promptly after becoming aware
thereof), (A) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any
Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a
Euro-Currency Borrowing of the affected currency shall be ineffective, (B) if
any Borrowing Request requests a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be
made as an ABR Borrowing and (C) if any Borrowing Request requests a
Euro-Currency Borrowing denominated in any affected Alternative Currency, such
Borrowing Request shall be deemed ineffective.

 

(b)       Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at any time the Administrative Agent
determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error),
or the Company notifies the Administrative Agent that the Company has
determined, that (i) the circumstances set forth in clause (a)(i) have arisen
and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or (ii) the circumstances
set forth in clause (a)(i) have not arisen but either (w) the supervisor for the
administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate has made a public statement that the
administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate is insolvent (and there is no successor
administrator that will continue publication of the LIBO Screen Rate), (x) the
administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate has made a public statement identifying a
specific date after which the LIBO Screen Rate will permanently or indefinitely
cease to be published by it (and there is no successor administrator that will
continue publication of the LIBO Screen Rate), (y) the supervisor for the
administrator of the LIBO Screen Rate has made a public statement identifying a
specific date after which the LIBO Screen Rate will permanently or indefinitely
cease to be published or (z) the supervisor for the administrator of the LIBO
Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the
Administrative Agent has made a public statement identifying a specific date
after which the LIBO Screen Rate may no longer be used for determining interest
rates for loans, then the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall endeavor
to establish an alternate rate of interest to the LIBO Rate that gives due
consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of
interest for syndicated loans in the United States at such time, and shall enter
into an amendment to this Agreement to reflect such alternate rate of interest
and such other related changes to this Agreement as may be applicable; provided
that, if such alternate rate of interest as so determined would be less than
0.50%, such rate shall be deemed to be 0.50% for the purposes of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12.02, such amendment shall
become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to
this Agreement so long as the Administrative Agent shall not have received,
within five Business Days of the date notice of such alternate rate of interest
(along with the amendment to this Agreement giving effect to the changes hereto
in respect of such alternate rate of interest) is provided to the Lenders, a
written notice from the Required Lenders stating that such Required Lenders
object to such amendment and the basis for such objection. Until an alternate
rate of interest shall be determined in accordance with this clause (b) (but, in
the case of the circumstances described in clause (ii)(w), clause (ii)(x) or
clause (ii)(y) of the first sentence of this Section 2.13(b), only to the extent
the LIBO Screen Rate for the relevant currency and such Interest Period is not
available or published at such time on a current basis), (x) any Interest
Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, a Euro-Currency Borrowing of the
affected currency shall be ineffective, (y) if any Borrowing Request requests a
Euro-Dollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing and (z)
if any Borrowing Request requests a Euro-Currency Borrowing denominated in any
affected Alternative Currency, such Borrowing Request shall be deemed
ineffective.

 



35

 

 

Section 2.14.      Increased Costs. (a) If any Change in Law shall

 

(i)            impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit,
liquidity or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or its Applicable Lending Office
(except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or

 

(ii)            impose on any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or the
London interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or
Euro-Currency Loans made by such Lender or participation therein;

 

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) of making, continuing, converting or
maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender (or its
Applicable Lending Office) (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then
the Company will pay (or will cause the relevant Borrower to pay) to such Lender
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.

 

(b)         If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or
liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding
company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by such
Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company
could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such
Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect
to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Company will pay
(or will cause the relevant Borrower to pay) to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding
company for any such reduction suffered.

 

(c)         If a Change in Law shall subject any Lender to any Taxes (other than
Indemnified Taxes and Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of
credit, commitments, or other obligations hereunder, or its deposits, reserves,
other liabilities or capital attributable thereto, and the result shall be to
increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any Loan (or of
maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to reduce the amount of any
sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal,
interest or otherwise), then the Company will pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs
incurred or reduction suffered.

 



36

 

 

(d)         A certificate of a Lender setting forth the amount or amounts
necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case may be,
as specified in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section and the calculation of
such amount or amounts in reasonable detail shall be delivered to the Company
and shall be conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error; provided that such
Lender shall not be required to disclose any information to the extent
prohibited by law or regulation. The Company or the relevant Borrower, as the
case may be, shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such
certificate free of clearly demonstrable error within 15 days after receipt
thereof. In requesting any compensation pursuant to this Section, each Lender
will use good faith efforts to treat the applicable Borrower in substantially
the same manner as such Lender treats other similarly situated borrowers under
similar circumstances.

 

(e)         Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to
demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section 2.14 for any increased costs or
reductions incurred more than 90 days prior to the date that such Lender
notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions and of such Lender’s claim to receive compensation therefor;
provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions is retroactive, then the 90-day period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

 

Section 2.15.      Break Funding Payments. In the event of (a) the payment of
any principal of any Euro-Currency Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of
Default), (b) the conversion of any Euro-Dollar Loan other than on the last day
of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert,
continue or prepay any Euro-Currency Loan on the date specified in any notice
delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked
under Section 2.10(b) and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the
assignment of any Euro-Currency Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the relevant Borrower shall compensate
each Lender for the loss (excluding loss of margin), cost and expense
attributable to such event. Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be
deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any,
of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount
of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would
have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to
the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a
failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the
Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest which would
accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such
Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for
deposits in Dollars or other applicable currency of a comparable amount and
period from other banks in the London interbank market; provided, however, that
such Borrower shall not be required to compensate any Lender for any costs of
terminating or liquidating any hedge or trading position (including any rate
swap, basis swap, forward rate transaction, interest rate option, cap, collar or
floor transaction, or any similar transaction). A certificate of any Lender
setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section and the calculation of such amount or amounts in
reasonable detail shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive
absent clearly demonstrable error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount
shown as due on any such certificate free of clearly demonstrable error within
10 days after receipt thereof.

Section 2.16.      Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of any Credit Party under the Loan Documents shall be made free and
clear of and without deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable
law. If any Credit Party or the Administrative Agent (the “Withholding Agent”)
shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from or in
respect of any sum payable under the Loan Documents to any Lender or the
Administrative Agent, then (i) the sum payable by such Credit Party shall be
increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the
Administrative Agent or such Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount
equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii)
the Withholding Agent shall make such deductions and (iii) the Withholding Agent
shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law.

 

(b)         In addition, each Credit Party shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

 

(c)         The relevant Credit Party shall indemnify the Administrative Agent
and each Lender, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full
amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent
or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on
account of any obligation of such Credit Party under the Loan Documents
(including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or
attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest
and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or
not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority; provided that the relevant
Credit Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Administrative Agent or
such Lender, as the case may be, pursuant to this Section in respect of
penalties, interest or similar liabilities arising therefrom or with respect
thereto to the extent such penalties, interest or similar liabilities are
attributable to the gross negligence or willful misconduct by the Administrative
Agent or such Lender, as the case may be. A certificate as to the amount of such
payment or liability delivered to the relevant Credit Party by a Lender or by
the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be
conclusive absent clearly demonstrable error.

 

(d)         As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by any Credit Party to a Governmental Authority, such Credit Party
shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a
receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of
the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

 



38

 

 

(e)         Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding Tax with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to
the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times
reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, such properly
completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably
requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will permit such
payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. In addition, any
Lender, if requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver
such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by
the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the
Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any
withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting
requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two
sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other
than such documentation set forth in Section 2.16(f), (g), (h) and (i) below)
shall not be required if in the Lender’s judgment such completion, execution or
submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or
expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such
Lender.

 

(f)          Without limiting the foregoing, at the times indicated herein, each
Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, provide the
Company and the Administrative Agent with duly and accurately executed originals
of Internal Revenue Service form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8IMY (accompanied by a form
W-8ECI, W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-9 and other certification documents from each
beneficial owner, as applicable) or W-8ECI (in each case accompanied by any
statements which may be required under applicable Treasury regulations), as
appropriate, or any successor form prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service,
certifying that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement
(i) without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income Taxes
or (ii) subject to a reduced rate of United States federal withholding Tax. Such
forms shall be provided (x) on or prior to the date of the Lender’s execution
and delivery of this Agreement in the case of each Lender listed on the
signature pages hereof, and on or prior to the date on which it becomes a Lender
in the case of each other Lender, and (y) on or before the date that such form
expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a
change in the most recent form so delivered by the Lender.

 

(g)         Any Lender that is a “United States person” within the meaning of
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Company and the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a
Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request
of the Company or the Administrative Agent), duly and accurately executed
originals of Internal Revenue Service form W-9 certifying, to the extent such
Lender is legally entitled to do so, that such Lender is not subject to U.S.
federal backup withholding Tax. For the avoidance of doubt, such Tax is an
“Excluded Tax”.

 

(h)         If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be
subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to
fail to comply with the applicable requirements of FATCA (including those
contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender
shall deliver to the Company and the Administrative Agent at the time or times
prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company
or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such
additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the
Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Company or the Administrative
Agent to comply with its obligations under FATCA, to determine that such Lender
has or has not complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to
determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for the
purposes of this Section 2.16(h), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to
FATCA after the date of this Agreement, whether or not included in the
definition of FATCA.

 



39

 

 

(i)           Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously
delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall
update such form or certification or promptly notify the Company and the
Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.

 

(j)           If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole
discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with respect to
which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 2.16, it
shall pay over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity
payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section
2.16 with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such
refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses with respect to such refund of the
Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund); provided that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative
Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus
any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the
Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any
other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the
Borrower or any other Person.

 

(k)         Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent,
within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the applicable
Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the such
Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to
comply with the provisions of Section 12.04(c) relating to the maintenance of a
Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender,
in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection
with this Agreement, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or
asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount
of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing
to such Lender under this Agreement or otherwise payable by the Administrative
Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the
Administrative Agent under this paragraph (k).

 

(l)           Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.16 shall survive any
assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the resignation or
replacement of the Administrative Agent, the termination of the Commitments and
the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other obligations under this
Agreement.

 



40

 

 

Section 2.17.      Foreign Subsidiary Costs. If the cost to any Lender of making
or maintaining any Loan to a Subsidiary Borrower is increased, or (except as
permitted by Section 2.16) the amount of any sum received or receivable by any
Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) is reduced in each case by an amount
deemed by such Lender to be material, by reason of the fact that such Subsidiary
Borrower is incorporated in, or conducts business in, a jurisdiction outside the
United States, the Company shall indemnify such Lender for such increased cost
or reduction within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent). A certificate of such Lender claiming compensation under
this Section 2.17 and setting forth the additional amount or amounts to be paid
to it hereunder (and a calculation thereof in reasonable detail) shall be
delivered to the Company contemporaneously with any such demand and shall be
conclusive in the absence of clearly demonstrable error. In requesting any
compensation pursuant to this Section, each Lender will use good faith efforts
to treat the Company in substantially the same manner as such Lender treats
other similarly situated borrowers under similar circumstances.

 

Section 2.18.      Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and interest on, the
Dollar-Denominated Loans, and of fees hereunder, not later than 12:00 noon (New
York City time) on the date when due, in Dollars in funds immediately available
in New York City. The Borrower shall make each payment of principal of, and
interest on, the Alternative Currency Loans denominated in an Alternative
Currency in the relevant Alternative Currency in such funds as may then be
customary for the settlement of international transactions in such Alternative
Currency. Each such payment shall be made without reduction by reason of any
set-off, recoupment or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any
date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been
received on the next succeeding Domestic Business Day (in the case of amounts
denominated in Dollars) or Euro-Currency Business Day (in the case of amounts
denominated in an Alternative Currency) for purposes of calculating interest
thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its
offices at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York, except that payments pursuant to
Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 12.03 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments
received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient
promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a
day that is not a Domestic Business Day (in the case of ABR Loans denominated in
Dollars) or a Euro-Currency Business Day (in the case of Euro-Currency Loans
denominated in an Alternative Currency), the date for payment shall be extended
to the next succeeding Domestic Business Day (in the case of ABR Loans
denominated in Dollars) or Euro-Currency Business Day (in the case of
Euro-Currency Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency), and, in the case of
any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period
of such extension.

 

(b)         If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to
the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and
fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment
of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled
thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such
parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder,
ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal then due to such parties.

 



41

 

 

(c)         If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Revolving Loans resulting in such Lender receiving
payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans
and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender,
then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at
face value) participations in the Revolving Loans of other Lenders to the extent
necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the
Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and
accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans; provided that (i) if any
such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving
rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the
purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and
(ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any
payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for
the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee
or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof
(as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). Each Borrower
consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so
under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the
foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of set-off and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

 

(d)         Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the
Company or the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders that a Borrower will
not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower
has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance
upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders, the amount due. In such event,
if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders
severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the
amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from
and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the
date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) the NYFRB Rate (if such
distribution was made in Dollars) or (ii) the rate per annum at which one-day
deposits in the relevant currency are offered by the principal London office of
the Administrative Agent in the London interbank market (if such distribution
was made in an Alternative Currency).

 

(e)         If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by
it pursuant to Section 2.06(b), 2.18(d) or 12.03(c), then the Administrative
Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof,
(i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Lender under this Agreement for the benefit of the
Administrative Agent to satisfy such Lender’s obligations to it under such
Section until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or (ii) hold
any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application
to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under any such Section, in the
case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the
Administrative Agent in its discretion.

 





42

 

 



Section 2.19.      Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

 

(a)         If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.14 or 2.17, or
if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any
Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.16,
then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different
Applicable Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches
or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section
2.14, 2.16 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject
such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

 

(b)         If any Lender or Participant of any Lender requests compensation
under Section 2.14 or 2.17, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional
amount to any Lender, any Participant of any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender (or a Participant) pursuant to Section
2.16, or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender or invokes Section 2.22, or
if any Lender shall refuse to consent to any waiver, amendment or other
modification that would otherwise require such Lender’s consent but to which the
Required Lenders have consented, or if the credit (or similar) rating of any
Lender (or any Parent thereof) by one or more of S&P or Moody’s or any other
nationally recognized statistical rating organization shall at any time be lower
than BBB/Baa2 (or the equivalent), or if, as to any Lender, such Lender (or
Parent thereof) shall at any time have no credit (or similar) rating in effect
by at least one such organization, or if any Lender or its Parent has become the
subject of a Bail-In Action (or any case or other proceeding in which a Bail-In
Action may occur), or if any Lender is a Disqualified Institution at the time it
becomes a Lender or any Lender assigns or participates all or any portion of its
Loans and/or Commitments to a Disqualified Institution in violation of Section
12.04, without the written consent of the Borrower, then the Company may, at its
sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative
Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 12.04), all
its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that
shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender
accepts such assignment); provided that (i) the Company shall have received the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, conditioned or delayed and (ii) such Lender shall have
received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans,
accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it
hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and
accrued interest and fees) or the Company or the relevant Borrower (in the case
of all other amounts). Each party hereto agrees that (1) an assignment required
pursuant to this paragraph may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and
Assumption executed by the Company, the Administrative Agent and the assignee
(or, to the extent applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and
Assumption by reference pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform as to which
the Administrative Agent and such parties are participants), and (2) the Lender
required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such
assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound
by the terms thereof; provided that, following the effectiveness of any such
assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver
such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by
the applicable Lender, provided that any such documents shall be without
recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if a Lender has become the subject
of a Bail-In Action (or any case or other proceeding in which a Bail-In Action
may occur) (each, a “Bail-In Lender”), then the Company may terminate such
Bail-In Lender’s Commitment hereunder, provided that (A) no Default or Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such Commitment
termination, (B) in the case of a Bail-In Lender, the Company shall concurrently
terminate the Commitment of each other Lender that is a Bail-In Lender at such
time, (C) the Administrative Agent and the Required Lenders shall have consented
to each such Commitment termination (such consents not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, but may include consideration of the adequacy
of the liquidity of the Company and its Subsidiaries) and (D) such Bail-In
Lender shall have been paid all amounts then due to it under this Agreement and
each other Loan Document (which, for the avoidance of doubt, the respective
Borrowers may pay in connection with any such termination without making ratable
payments to any other Lender (other than another Lender that has a Commitment
that concurrently is being terminated under this Section 2.19(b))).

 



43

 

 

Section 2.20.      Currency Equivalents. (a) The Administrative Agent shall
determine the Dollar Amount of: (i) each Alternative Currency Loan on each of
the following: (x) the date of the Borrowing of such Loan and (y) each date of a
conversion or continuation of such Loan pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;
and (ii) any Borrowing, on any additional date as the Administrative Agent may
determine at any time when an Event of Default exists. Each day upon or as of
which the Administrative Agent determines Dollar Amounts as described in the
preceding clauses (i) and (ii) is herein described as a “Computation Date” with
respect to each Loan and/or Borrowing for which a Dollar Amount is determined on
or as of such day, and the Administrative Agent shall notify the Company and the
Lenders of all such determinations and related computations on such Computation
Date.

 

(b)         If, other than as a result of fluctuations in currency exchange
rates, after giving effect to any such determination of a Dollar Amount, the
Total Revolving Credit Exposure of all Lenders exceed the aggregate amount of
the Commitments or if at any time, solely as a result of fluctuations in
currency exchange rates, the aggregate Dollar Amount of Loans exceeds 105% of
the aggregate amount of the Commitment, the Borrowers shall within five
Euro-Currency Business Days prepay outstanding Loans (as selected by the Company
and notified to the Lenders through the Administrative Agent not less than three
Euro-Currency Business Days prior to the date of prepayment) or take other
action to the extent necessary to eliminate any such excess.

 

Section 2.21.      Margin Determinations. The Administrative Agent shall
determine the Applicable Rate from time to time in accordance with the
provisions set forth below:

 

The “Euro-Currency Margin” at any date is a rate per annum equal to the then
applicable rate set forth in the “Pricing Grid” below under the column headed
“Euro-Currency Margin.”

 

The “ABR Margin” at any date is a rate per annum equal to the then applicable
rate set forth in the “Pricing Grid” below under the column headed “ABR Margin.”

 



44

 

 

 

The “Commitment Fee Rate” at any date is a rate per annum equal to the then
applicable rate set forth in the “Pricing Grid” below under the column headed
“Commitment Fee.”

 

Pricing Grid Pricing
Level Commitment
 Fee Euro-Currency
Margin ABR
Margin I 0.20% 1.25% 0.25% II 0.30% 1.50% 0.50% III 0.35% 1.75% 0.75% IV 0.40%
1.875% 0.875% V 0.50% 2.00% 1.00%

 

For purposes of the foregoing table, the following terms have the following
meanings, subject to the further provisions of this Section:

 

“Level I Pricing” applies at any date if, at such date, the Company’s senior
unsecured long-term debt is rated A+ or higher by S&P and A1 or higher by
Moody’s.

 

“Level II Pricing” applies at any date if, at such date (i) no better Pricing
Level applies and (ii) the Company’s senior unsecured long-term debt is rated A
by S&P and A2 by Moody’s.

 

“Level III Pricing” applies at any date if, at such date (i) no better Pricing
Level applies and (ii) the Company’s senior unsecured long-term debt is rated A-
by S&P and A3 by Moody’s.

 

“Level IV Pricing” applies at any date if, at such date, (i) no better Pricing
Level applies and (ii) the Company’s senior unsecured long-term debt is rated
BBB+ by S&P and Baa1 by Moody’s.

 

“Level V Pricing” applies at any date if, at such date, no other Pricing Level
applies.

 

“Pricing Level” refers to the determination of which of Level I, Level II, Level
III, Level IV or Level V Pricing applies at any date. A “better” Pricing Level
is one with a lower roman numeral.

 

“Rating Agency” means S&P or Moody’s (and their successors).

 

In determining the applicable Pricing Level: (a) if ratings are available from
the two Rating Agencies but are not equivalent, then (i) if the ratings
differential is one ratings level, the Pricing Level shall be that applicable to
the higher of the two ratings and (ii) if the ratings differential is two rating
levels or more, the Pricing Level shall be that which would be applicable to a
rating which is one rating level below the higher of the two ratings, (b) if a
rating from only one Rating Agency is available, then the Pricing Level shall be
that applicable to such rating and (c) if ratings are not available from either
of the two Rating Agencies, then Level V Pricing shall apply.

  

45

 



 

The credit ratings to be utilized for purposes of this Section are those
assigned by S&P or Moody’s to the senior unsecured long-term debt securities of
the Company without third-party credit enhancement, and any rating assigned to
any other debt security of the Company shall be disregarded; provided that if no
such rating is available from any one or more of the two Rating Agencies, the
ratings used for purposes of determining the Pricing Level with respect to each
such Rating Agency shall be the corporate family rating assigned by such Rating
Agency to the Company. The rating in effect at any date is that in effect at the
close of business on such date. If the rating system of any Rating Agency shall
change, or if any Rating Agency shall cease to be in the business of rating
corporate debt obligations, the Company and the Administrative Agent shall
negotiate in good faith to amend this Section to reflect such changed rating
system or the nonavailability of ratings from such Rating Agency and, pending
the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Pricing Level shall be determined
by reference to the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or
cessation.

 

Section 2.22.      Illegality. (a) If, after the Effective Date, the adoption of
any applicable law, rule or regulation, or any change in any applicable law,
rule or regulation, or any change in the interpretation or administration
thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender
(or its Euro-Currency Lending Office) with any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) of any such authority, central bank or comparable
agency shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender (or its Euro-Currency
Lending Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Currency Loans to any
Borrower and such Lender shall so notify the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the other Lenders
and the Company, whereupon until such Lender notifies the Company and the
Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no
longer exist (which such Lender shall do promptly after becoming aware thereof),
the obligation of such Lender to make Euro-Currency Loans to such Borrower, or
to convert outstanding Loans to such Borrower into Euro-Dollar Loans, shall be
suspended. If such notice is given with respect to Euro-Dollar Loans, each
Euro-Dollar Loan of such Lender then outstanding shall be converted to an ABR
Loan either (i) on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable
to such Euro-Dollar Loan if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and
fund such Euro-Dollar Loan to such day or (ii) immediately if such Lender shall
determine that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such
Euro-Dollar Loan to such day. If such notice is given with respect to
Alternative Currency Loans, the relevant Borrower shall prepay such Alternative
Currency Loans either (i) on the last day of the then current Interest Period
applicable to such Alternative Currency Loan if such Lender may lawfully
continue to maintain and fund such Alternative Currency Loan to such day or (ii)
immediately if such Lender shall determine that it may not lawfully continue to
maintain and fund such Alternative Currency Loan to such day.

 

(b)         If it is unlawful for any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office)
to make or maintain Loans to any Subsidiary Borrower and such Lender shall so
notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give
notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Company, whereupon until such Lender
notifies the Company and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances giving
rise to such suspension no longer exist (which such Lender shall do promptly
after becoming aware thereof), the obligation of such Lender to make or maintain
Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower shall be suspended. If such notice is given,
each Loan of such Lender then outstanding to such Subsidiary Borrower shall be
prepaid either (i) in the case of a Euro-Currency Loan, on the last day of the
then current Interest Period applicable thereto if such Lender may lawfully
continue to maintain such Loan to such day or (ii) immediately if clause (i)
does not apply.

Lenders and the Company. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall
have the right, in consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor. If no
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have

warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y)
covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date
such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the
Administrative Agent, and each Arranger and their respective Affiliates, and

other Credit Party, that at least one of the following is and will be true:

 

(i)            such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of the
Plan Asset Regulations) of one or more Benefit Plans in connection with the
Loans or the Commitments,

to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and
performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement, and the conditions
for exemptive relief thereunder are and will continue to be satisfied in

Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I

subsection (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such
Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of
the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement, or

 

64

 

 

  

(iv)            such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be
agreed in writing between the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, and
such Lender.

 

(b)         In addition, unless sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding
clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or such Lender has provided another
representation, warranty and covenant as provided in sub-clause (iv) in the
immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and
warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y)
covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date
such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the
Administrative Agent, and the Arrangers, the Syndication Agents, the
Documentation Agents or any of their respective Affiliates, and not, for the
avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Company or any other Credit
Party, that none of the Administrative Agent, or the Arrangers, the Syndication
Agents, the Documentation Agents or any of their respective Affiliates is a
fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in the Loans, the
Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or
exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any
Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).

 

(c)         Each of the Administrative Agent and each Arranger hereby informs
the Lenders that each such Person is not undertaking to provide impartial
investment advice, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, in connection with

interest in the transactions contemplated hereby in that such Person or an
Affiliate thereof (i) may receive interest or other payments with respect to the
Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement, (ii) may recognize a gain if it
extended the Loans or the Commitments for an amount less than the amount being
paid for an interest in the Loans or the Commitments by such Lender or (iii) may

be obligated to, make any Communications available to the Lenders by posting the
Communications on IntraLinks™, DebtDomain, SyndTrak, ClearPar or any other
similar electronic platform chosen by the Administrative Agent reasonably and in
good faith to be its electronic transmission system and used by it for such
purpose with respect to its credit facilities generally (the “Approved
Electronic Platform”).

 



65

 

 

(b)         Although the Approved Electronic Platform and its primary web portal
are secured with generally-applicable security procedures and policies
implemented or modified by the Administrative Agent from time to time
(including, as of the Effective Date, a user ID/password authorization system)
and the Approved Electronic Platform is secured through a per-deal authorization
method whereby each user may access the Approved Electronic Platform only on a
deal-by-deal basis, each of the Lenders and the Company acknowledges and agrees
that the distribution of material through an electronic medium is not
necessarily secure, that the Administrative Agent is not responsible for
approving or vetting the representatives or contacts of any Lender that are
added to the Approved Electronic Platform, and that there may be confidentiality
and other risks associated with such distribution. Each of the Lenders and the
Company hereby approves distribution of the Communications through the Approved
Electronic Platform and understands and assumes the risks of such distribution,
other than risks arising from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of any of the foregoing parties (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment).

 

(c)         THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE COMMUNICATIONS ARE PROVIDED
“AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. THE APPLICABLE PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT
WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS, OR THE ADEQUACY OF
THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS OR
OMISSIONS IN THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM AND THE COMMUNICATIONS. NO
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD
PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY THE
APPLICABLE PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS OR THE APPROVED
ELECTRONIC PLATFORM. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY ARRANGER,
ANY DOCUMENTATION AGENT, ANY SYNDICATION AGENT OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE
RELATED PARTIES (COLLECTIVELY, “APPLICABLE PARTIES”) HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO ANY
CREDIT PARTY, ANY LENDER OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND,
INCLUDING DIRECT OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
LOSSES OR EXPENSES (WHETHER IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF ANY
CREDIT PARTY’S OR THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT’S TRANSMISSION OF COMMUNICATIONS
THROUGH THE INTERNET OR THE APPROVED ELECTRONIC PLATFORM, OTHER THAN DIRECT
ACTUAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of any applicable party (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment).

 

(d)         Each Lender agrees that notice to it (as provided in the next
sentence) specifying that Communications have been posted to the Approved
Electronic Platform shall constitute effective delivery of the Communications to
such Lender for purposes of the Loan Documents. Each Lender agrees (i) to notify
the Administrative Agent in writing (which could be in the form of electronic
communication) from time to time of such Lender’s email address to which the
foregoing notice may be sent by electronic transmission and (ii) that the
foregoing notice may be sent to such email address.

 



66

 

 

(e)         Each of the Lenders and the Company agrees that the Administrative
Agent may, but (except as may be required by applicable law) shall not be
obligated to, store the Communications on the Approved Electronic Platform in
accordance with the Administrative Agent’s generally applicable document
retention procedures and policies.

 

(f)          Nothing herein shall prejudice the right of the Administrative
Agent, any Lender to give any notice or other communication pursuant to any Loan
Document in any other manner specified in such Loan Document.

guarantees the full and punctual payment (whether at stated maturity, upon
acceleration or otherwise) of the principal of and interest on each Loan made to
each other Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, and the full and punctual
payment of all other amounts payable by each other Borrower under this
Agreement. Upon failure by any other Borrower to pay punctually any such amount,
the Company agrees that it shall forthwith on demand pay the amount not so paid
at the place and in the manner specified in this Agreement.

 

Section 11.02.  Guaranty Unconditional. The obligations of the Company hereunder
shall be unconditional, irrevocable and absolute and, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, shall not be released, discharged or otherwise
affected by:

 

(a)         any extension, renewal, settlement, compromise, waiver or release in
respect of any obligation of any Borrower or any other Person under any Loan
Document or by operation of law or otherwise (except to the extent the foregoing
expressly releases the Company’s obligations under this Article 11);

 

(b)         any modification or amendment of or supplement to any Loan Document
(other than any modification, amendment or supplement of this Article 11
effected in accordance with Section 12.02);

 

(c)         any release, impairment, non-perfection or invalidity of any direct
or indirect security for any obligation of any Borrower or any other Person
under any Loan Document;

 

(d)         any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of any
Borrower or any other Person or any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or
other similar proceeding affecting any Borrower or any other Person or its
assets or any resulting release or discharge of any obligation of any Borrower
or any other Person contained in any Loan Document;

 

(e)         the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which the
Company may have at any time against any other Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, any Lender or any other Person, whether in connection herewith or with
any unrelated transactions; provided that nothing herein shall prevent the
assertion of any such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;

 

(f)          any invalidity or unenforceability relating to or against any
Borrower or any other Person for any reason of any Loan Document, or any
provision of applicable law or regulation purporting to prohibit the payment by
any Borrower of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other amount
payable by it under any Loan Document; or

 

(g)         any other act or omission to act or delay of any kind by any
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any other Person or any other
circumstance whatsoever which might, but for the provisions of this paragraph,

obligations hereunder (in each case other than payment in full of the
obligations guaranteed hereunder).

 



68

 

 

Section 11.03.  Discharge Only Upon Payment in Full; Reinstatement in Certain
Circumstances. Each of the Company’s obligations hereunder shall remain in full
force and effect until the Commitments shall have terminated and the principal
of and interest on the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder by the
Company and each other Borrower under this Agreement shall have been paid in
full in cash (or backed by a standby letter of credit or cash collateralized, in
each case in amounts and on terms satisfactory to the Administrative Agent). If
at any time any payment of the principal of or interest on any Loan or any other
amount payable by any other Borrower under this Agreement is rescinded or must
be otherwise restored or returned upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or

hereunder with respect to such payment shall be reinstated at such time as

of its guaranty under this Article 11, presentment, demand (except as provided
in Section 11.01), protest and any notice not provided for herein, as well as,
solely for purposes of Article 11 any requirement that at any time any action be

Borrower hereunder, the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the payee
against such Borrower with respect to such payment; provided that the Company

principal of and interest on the Loans to such Borrower and all other amounts
payable by such Borrower under this Agreement have been paid in full in cash.

 

Section 11.06.  Stay of Acceleration. If acceleration of the time for payment of
any amount payable by any Borrower under this Agreement is stayed upon
insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of such Borrower, all such amounts
otherwise subject to acceleration under the terms of this Agreement shall
nonetheless be payable by the Company hereunder forthwith on demand by the
Administrative Agent made at the request of the Required Lenders.

 

Section 11.07.  Continuing Guaranty. The Company’s guaranty hereunder is a
continuing guaranty, shall be binding on the Company and its successors and
assigns, and shall be enforceable by the Lenders. If all or part of any Lender’s
interest in any obligation guaranteed by the Company is assigned or otherwise
transferred, the transferor’s rights under the Company’s guaranty, to the extent
applicable to the obligation so transferred, shall automatically be transferred
with such obligation.

Section 12.02.  Waivers; Amendments. (a) No failure or delay by the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising any right or power under any
Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under the Loan Documents are cumulative
and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.
No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by
any Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be
permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent
shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which
given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan
shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default at the time.

 

(b)         Except as provided in Section 2.13(b), no Loan Document nor any
provision thereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an
agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Company and the Required
Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall:

 



70

consent of such Lender (provided that an amendment, modification, waiver or
consent with respect to any condition precedent, covenant, mandatory prepayment
pursuant to Section 2.20(b), Event of Default or Default shall not constitute an
increase in the Commitment of any Lender), (B) reduce the principal amount of
any Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon (other than with respect to the
incremental 2% included in the determination of the applicable interest rate
under Section 2.12(d)), or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the
written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, (C)
postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or
any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of,
waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration
of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly and
adversely affected thereby (other than any reduction of the amount of, or any
extension of the payment date for, the mandatory prepayments required under
Section 2.20(b), in each case which shall only require the approval of the
Required Lenders), (D) change Section 2.08(d) or Section 2.18(b) or Section
2.18(c) in a manner that would alter the ratable reduction of Commitments or pro
rata sharing of payments required thereby, or change any provision requiring
that funding of amounts by the Lenders be on a ratable basis, without the
written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby, (E)
change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of “Required
Lenders” or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or
percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder

consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (F) release the Company from
its guaranty under Article 11 hereof, or limit its liability in respect of such
guaranty, without the written consent of each Lender, (G) change any of the
provisions of Section 2.23 without the consent of the Administrative Agent or

(ii)            amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the
Administrative Agent under any Loan Document without the prior written consent
of the Administrative Agent; or

 

(iii)            (A) subject any Subsidiary Borrower to any additional
obligation without the written consent of such Borrower, (B) increase the
principal of or rate of interest on any outstanding Loan of any Subsidiary
Borrower without the written consent of such Borrower, (C) accelerate the stated
maturity of any outstanding Loan of any Subsidiary Borrower without the written

71

 

 

(c)         Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, as to any
amendment, amendment and restatement or other modifications otherwise approved
in accordance with this Section, it shall not be necessary to obtain the consent
or approval of any Lender that, upon giving effect to such amendment, amendment
and restatement or other modification, would have no Commitment or outstanding
Loans so long as such Lender receives payment in full of the principal of and
interest accrued on each Loan made by, and all other amounts owing to, such
Lender or accrued for the account of such Lender under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents at the time such amendment, amendment and restatement or
other modification becomes effective.

 

(d)         Notwithstanding any provisions herein to the contrary, if the
Administrative Agent and the Company acting together identify any ambiguity,
omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect in any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, then the Administrative Agent and the
Company shall be permitted to amend, modify or supplement such provision to cure
such ambiguity, omission, mistake, typographical error or other defect, and such
amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any
other party to this Agreement, so long as, in each case, the Lenders shall have
received at least ten Domestic Business Days’ prior written notice thereof and
the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within ten Domestic Business
Days of the date of such notice to the Lenders, a written notice from the
Required Lenders stating that the Required Lenders object to such amendment.

 

Section 12.03.  Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver. (a) The Company shall pay
(i) all reasonable, documented and invoiced out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Administrative Agent, and its Affiliates, including the reasonable,
documented and invoiced fees, charges and disbursements of one counsel for the
Administrative Agent, in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of the Loan
Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof
(whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be
consummated) and (ii) all reasonable, documented and invoiced out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in
connection with the Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section, or
in connection with the Loans made, including all such out-of-pocket expenses
incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such
Loans.

 

(b)         The Company shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Arranger,
each Lender and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such
Person being called an “Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless
from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related reasonable
and documented costs and expenses, including the reasonable fees, charges and
disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against
any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of any actual
or prospective claim, litigation, investigation, arbitration or proceeding,
whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether
any Indemnitee is a party thereto, relating to (i) the execution or delivery of
the Loan Documents or any agreement or instrument contemplated thereby, the
performance by the parties thereto of their respective obligations thereunder or
the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated
thereby, (ii) any Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom or (iii) any actual
or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property
owned or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (i) the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates or
representatives, (ii) from the material breach in bad faith by such Indemnitee
of its express obligations under the Loan Documents or (iii) a dispute solely
among Indemnitees (other than a dispute involving a claim against an Indemnitee
in its capacity as an arranger or agent in respect of the Agreement, and in any
such event described in this clause (iii) solely to the extent that the
underlying dispute does not arise as a result of any action, inaction,
representation or misrepresentation of, or information provided, or that was
failed to be provided, by or on behalf of, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries).

 



72

 

 

(c)         To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required to
be paid by it to the Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this
Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such
Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable
unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.

 

(d)         To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Credit Party shall
not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory
of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as
opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of, the Loan Documents or any agreement or instrument contemplated
thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

 

(e)         All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after
written demand therefor.

 

Section 12.04.  Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) no Credit
Party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by any Credit Party without such consent shall be null
and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

(b)         (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below,
any Lender may assign to one or more Persons (other than an Ineligible
Institution) all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to
it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) of:

 



73

 

 

(A)            the Company; provided that (x) no consent of the Company shall be
required for (1) an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an
Approved Fund (it being understood that the Company shall nevertheless receive
prompt notice, either prior to or promptly after such assignment, of any such
assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund) (provided
further, notwithstanding the preceding clause (1), so long as no Event of
Default under paragraph (b), (c), (g) or (h) of Article 8 has occurred and is
continuing, the consent of the Company shall be required if, after giving effect
to such assignment, the assignee, collectively with its affiliated Lenders and
affiliated Approved Funds, would, as a result of such assignment, hold more than
fifteen percent (15%) of the aggregate amounts of Loans and unused Commitments)
or, (2) if an Event of Default under paragraph (b), (c), (g) or (h) of Article 8
has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee and (y) the Company shall be
deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object thereto
by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten Euro-Currency Business
Days after receipt of written notice thereof; and

 

(B)            the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the
Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment to an assignee that is
a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender immediately prior to giving effect to such
assignment.

 

(ii)            Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
conditions:

 

(A)            except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate
of a Lender or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
Lender’s Commitment, the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender
subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and
Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative
Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Company and the
Administrative Agent otherwise consent; provided that no such consent of the
Company shall be required if an Event of Default under paragraph (b), (c), (g)
or (h) of Article 8 has occurred and is continuing;

 

(B)            each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under
this Agreement;

 

(C)            the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent (x) an Assignment and Assumption or (y) to the extent
applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference
pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform as to which the Administrative Agent
and the parties to the Assignment and Assumption are participants, together with
a processing and recordation fee of $3,500;

 

(D)            the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire;

  

74

 



 

 

 

   

(E)            in the case of an assignment to a CLO (as defined below), the
assigning Lender shall retain the sole right to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, provided that the
Assignment and Assumption between such Lender and such CLO may provide that such
Lender will not, without the consent of such CLO, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver described in paragraph (i) of the first proviso to
Section 12.02(b) that affects such CLO; and

 

(F)            no assignment, whether in whole or in part (including
participations), may be made to (i) the Company or any of its Affiliates or
subsidiaries, (ii) any Defaulting Lender or any Person who, upon becoming a
Lender, would constitute a Defaulting Lender, (iii) a natural Person (or holding
company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary
benefit of, a natural Person) or (iv) Disqualified Institution without the prior
written consent of the Company.

 

For the purposes of this Section 12.04, the terms “Approved Fund”, “CLO” and
“Disqualified Institution” have the following meanings:

 

“Approved Fund” means (a) a CLO and (b) with respect to any Lender that is a
fund which invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit, any other
fund that invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit and is managed
by the same investment advisor as such Lender or by an Affiliate of such
investment advisor.

 

“CLO” means any entity (whether a corporation, partnership, trust or otherwise)
that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in bank
loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business
and is administered or managed by a Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender.

 

“Disqualified Institution” means (i) those Persons identified by the Company to
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in writing prior to the Effective Date,
(ii) those Persons that are reasonably determined by the Company to be
competitors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and that have been
specifically identified by the Company to the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders in writing prior to the Effective Date and (iii) in the case of each of
clauses (i) and (ii) (and any supplements thereto as contemplated below), any of
their respective Affiliates, to the extent any such Affiliate (x) is clearly
identifiable as an Affiliate of the applicable Person solely by similarity of
such Affiliate’s name and (y) is not a bona fide debt investment fund that is an
Affiliate of such Person; provided that, the Company, by notice to the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders after the Effective Date, shall be
permitted to supplement from time to time in writing by name the list of Persons
that are Disqualified Institutions to the extent that the Persons added by such
supplements are competitors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or
Affiliates of competitors that are not bona fide debt investment funds). Each
such supplement shall become effective three (3) Domestic Business Days after
delivery thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (including through
an Approved Electronic Platform) in accordance with Section 12.01, but shall not
apply retroactively to disqualify any Persons that have previously acquired an
assignment or participation interest in the Loans (but solely with respect to
such Loans). It is understood and agreed that (A) the Administrative Agent shall
have no responsibility, liability or duty, to ascertain, inquire, monitor or
enforce whether any Lender or potential Lender is a Disqualified Institution,
(B) the Company’s failure to deliver such list (or supplement thereto) in
accordance with Section 12.01 shall render such list (or supplement) not
received and not effective and (C) “Disqualified Institution” shall exclude any
Person that the Company has designated as no longer being a “Disqualified
Institution” by written notice delivered to the Administrative Agent (which
notice may be distributed to the Lenders) from time to time in accordance with
Section 12.01.

  

75

 



 

(iii)            Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering
all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 12.03). Any assignment or
transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
comply with this Section 12.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement
as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

 

(iv)            The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a
non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and each Borrower, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and any Lender, at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

 

(v)            Upon its receipt of (x) a duly completed Assignment and
Assumption executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee or (y) to the extent
applicable, an agreement incorporating an Assignment and Assumption by reference
pursuant to an Approved Electronic Platform as to which the Administrative Agent
and the parties to the Assignment and Assumption are participants, the
assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall
already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to
in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment
required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept
such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in
the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement
unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

 



76

 

 

(c)         (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of any Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a “Participant”), other than an Ineligible Institution, in all or a portion of
such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (A) such
Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (B) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations, (C) each Borrower, the Administrative Agent and
the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and
(D) in the case of any sale of a participation to a Disqualified Institution,
the Borrower shall have provided its prior written consent thereto. Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that
such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver described in paragraph (i) of the first
proviso to Section 12.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph
(c)(ii) of this Section, each Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16 and Section 2.17 to the
same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each
Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 12.08 as though it
were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c)
as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting
solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of each Borrower, maintain a
register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the
principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the
Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the “Participant Register”);
provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion
of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any
Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any
commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under this
Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish
that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in
registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) or Proposed Section 1.163-5(b) of the
United States Treasury Regulations (or, in each case, any amended or successor
version) or, if different, under Sections 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code. The
entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent clearly
demonstrable error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all
purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.

 

(ii)            A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.14, 2.16 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have
been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such
Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made
with the Borrower’s prior written consent. A Participant shall not be entitled
to the benefits of Section 2.16 unless the Participant complies with the
obligations of (e), (f), (g), (h) and (i) of Section 2.16, as applicable, as if
it were a Lender (it being understood that the documentation required shall be
delivered to the participating Lender and, if required by law for reduced
withholding, copies shall be delivered to the Company and the Administrative
Agent).

 



77

 

 

(d)         Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of
such Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a
Federal Reserve Bank or any central bank having jurisdiction over such Lender,
and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security
interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest
shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any
such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

 

(e)         The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like
import in any Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall be deemed to include
electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of
which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a
manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as
the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law,
including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act,
the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar
state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.

 

(f)          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12.04, or
elsewhere in this Agreement, the consent of the Company shall be required (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) for an assignment to an
assignee that is an Affected Financial Institution unless an Event of Default
under paragraph (b), (c), (g) or (h) of Article 8 has occurred and is continuing
at the time of such assignment.

 

(g)         Disqualified Institutions.

 

(i)            No assignment or participation shall be made to any Person that
was a Disqualified Institution as of the date (the “Trade Date”) on which the
assigning Lender entered into a binding agreement to sell and assign or grant a
participation in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement to such Person (unless the Company has consented to such assignment or
participation in writing in its sole and absolute discretion, in which case such
Person will not be considered a Disqualified Institution for the purpose of such
assignment or participation). For the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any
assignee or Participant that becomes a Disqualified Institution after the
applicable Trade Date (including as a result of the delivery of a notice
pursuant to, and/or the expiration of the notice period referred to in, the
definition of “Disqualified Institution”), (x) such assignee or Participant
shall not retroactively be disqualified from being a Lender or Participant and
(y) the execution by the Company of an Assignment and Assumption with respect to
such assignee will not by itself result in such assignee no longer being
considered a Disqualified Institution. Any assignment or participation in
violation of this clause (g)(i) shall not be void, but the other provisions of
this clause (g) shall apply.

 



78

 

 

(ii)            If any assignment or participation is made to any Disqualified
Institution without the Company’s prior written consent in violation of clause
(i) above, or if any Person becomes a Disqualified Institution after the
applicable Trade Date, the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon
notice to the applicable Disqualified Institution and the Administrative Agent,
require such Disqualified Institution to assign, without recourse (in accordance
with and subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 12.04), all of
its interest, rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more Persons
(other than an Ineligible Institution) at the lesser of (x) the principal amount
thereof and (y) the amount that such Disqualified Institution paid to acquire
such interests, rights and obligations in each case plus accrued interest,
accrued fees and all other amounts (other than principal amounts) payable to it
hereunder.

 

(iii)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Disqualified Institutions to whom an assignment or participation is
made in violation of clause (i) above (A) will not have the right to (x) receive
information, reports or other materials provided to Lenders by the Company, the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender, (y) attend or participate in meetings
attended by the Lenders (or any of them) and the Administrative Agent, or (z)
access any electronic site established for the Lenders or confidential
communications from counsel to or financial advisors of the Administrative Agent
or the Lenders and (B) (x) for purposes of any consent to any amendment, waiver
or modification of, or any action under, and for the purpose of any direction to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender to undertake any action (or refrain from
taking any action) under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, each
Disqualified Institution will be deemed to have consented in the same proportion
as the Lenders that are not Disqualified Institutions consented to such matter,
and (y) for purposes of voting on any plan of reorganization, each Disqualified
Lender party hereto hereby agrees (1) not to vote on such plan of
reorganization, (2) if such Disqualified Lender does vote on such plan of
reorganization notwithstanding the restriction in the foregoing clause (1), such
vote will be deemed not to be in good faith and shall be “designated” pursuant
to Section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision in any other
applicable laws), and such vote shall not be counted in determining whether the
applicable class has accepted or rejected such plan of reorganization in
accordance with Section 1126(c) of the Bankruptcy Code (or any similar provision
in any other applicable laws) and (3) not to contest any request by any party
for a determination by the Bankruptcy Court (or other applicable court of
competent jurisdiction) effectuating the foregoing clause (2).

 

(iv)            The Administrative Agent shall have the right, and the Company
hereby expressly authorizes the Administrative Agent, to (A) post the list of
Disqualified Institutions provided by the Company and any updates thereto from
time to time (collectively, the “DQ List”) on an Approved Electronic Platform,
including that portion of such Approved Electronic Platform that is designated
for “public side” Lenders and/or (B) provide the DQ List to each Lender or
potential Lender requesting the same.

 

(v)            The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible or have any
liability for, or have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce,
compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Disqualified Institutions.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall
not ‎(x) be obligated to ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender
or Participant or prospective Lender or Participant is a Disqualified
‎Institution or (y) have any liability with respect to or arising out of any
assignment or participation of Loans, or disclosure of confidential information,
by any other Person to any ‎Disqualified Institution.

Section 12.05.  Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Company and any other Borrower herein and in the
certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to
this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties
hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
making of any Loans, regardless of any investigation made by any such other
party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any
Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any
accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this
Agreement is outstanding and unpaid (other than those backed by a standby letter
of credit or cash collateralized, in each case in amounts and on terms
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) and so long as the Commitments have
not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and
12.03 and Article 9 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless
of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of
the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination
of this Agreement or any provision hereof.

 

Section 12.06.  Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other
Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable
to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when
the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy, e-mailed .pdf or any other
electronic means that reproduces an image of the actual executed signature page
shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this
Agreement. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” “delivery,” and words
of like import in or relating to any document to be signed in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to
include Electronic Signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records in
electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or
enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or
the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent
and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic
Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform
Electronic Transactions Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Borrowers hereby (i) agree that, for all purposes, including without
limitation, in connection with any workout, restructuring, enforcement of
remedies, bankruptcy proceedings or litigation among the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders and the Borrowers, electronic images of this Agreement or any other
Loan Documents (in each case, including with respect to any signature pages
thereto) shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as any
paper original, and (ii) waive any argument, defense or right to contest the
validity or enforceability of the Loan Documents based solely on the lack of
paper original copies of any Loan Documents, including with respect to any
signature pages thereto.

 



80

 

 

Section 12.07.  Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

 

Section 12.08.  Right of Set-off. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing and the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated under Article
8, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and
from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set-off and apply
any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final,
but excluding deposits held in a trustee, fiduciary, agency or similar capacity
or otherwise for the benefit of a third party) at any time held and other
obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit
or the account of any Credit Party against any of and all the obligations of
such Credit Party now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such
Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand
under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The rights
of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of set-off) which such Lender may have. Each Lender
agrees to notify the Company and the Administrative Agent promptly after any
such setoff and application; provided that the failure to give such notice shall
not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

 

Section 12.09.  Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process. (a)
This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the
internal law of the State of New York.

 

(b)         Each of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that, notwithstanding the governing law provisions of
any applicable Loan Document, any claims brought against the Administrative
Agent by any Lender relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document or the
consummation or administration of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the law of the
State of New York.

 

(c)         Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits,
for itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan (or if such court lacks subject matter jurisdiction,
the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan),
and any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
transactions relating hereto or thereto, or for recognition or enforcement of
any judgment arising out of or relating to any Loan Document or the transactions
relating hereto or thereto, and each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally agrees that all claims in respect of any such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in such Federal (to the extent permitted
by law) or New York State court. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. Nothing in any Loan Document shall affect any right that the
Administrative Agent or any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or
proceeding relating to any Loan Document against any Credit Party or its
properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.

 



81

 

 

(d)         Each Credit Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document in any court referred
to in paragraph (c) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
court.

 

(e)         Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided for notices in Section 12.01; provided that each
Subsidiary Borrower irrevocably appoints the Company as agent of process and
consents to service of process to the Company in the manner provided for notices
in Section 12.01. Nothing in any Loan Document will affect the right of any
party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

 

Section 12.10.  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO ANY LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY
OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK
TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER
PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

 

Section 12.11.  Judgment Currency. If, under any applicable law and whether
pursuant to a judgment being made or registered against any Borrower or for any
other reason, any payment under or in connection with any Loan Document is made
or satisfied in a currency (the “Other Currency”) other than that in which the
relevant payment is due (the “Required Currency”) then, to the extent that the
payment (when converted into the Required Currency at the rate of exchange on
the date of payment or, if it is not practicable for the party entitled thereto
(the “Payee”) to purchase the Required Currency with the Other Currency on the
date of payment, at the rate of exchange as soon thereafter as it is practicable
for it to do so) actually received by the Payee falls short of the amount due
under the terms of any Loan Document, such Borrower shall, to the extent
permitted by law, as a separate and independent obligation, indemnify and hold
harmless the Payee against the amount of such short-fall. For the purpose of
this Section, “rate of exchange” means the rate at which the Payee is able on
the relevant date to purchase the Required Currency with the Other Currency and
shall take into account any premium and other costs of exchange.

 



82

 

 

Section 12.12.  Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents
used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

 

Section 12.13.  Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined
below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates’
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel
and other advisors on a need-to-know basis (it being understood that the Persons
to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of
such Information and will agree to keep such Information confidential to the
same extent as if they were parties hereto and the disclosing Administrative
Agent or Lender shall be responsible for any breaches of the provisions of this
Section 12.13), (b) to the extent requested by any central bank or the Federal
Reserve or by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over it or in
connection with any pledge or assignment permitted under Section 12.04(d),
(c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena
or similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to any Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder,
(f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as
those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any
prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement (it being understood that the DQ List may be disclosed to
any assignee or Participant, or prospective assignee or Participant, in reliance
on and subject to the terms of this clause (f)(i)) or (ii) any actual or
prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction
relating to a Borrower and its obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the
prior written consent of the Company, (h) to the extent requested by ratings
agencies or (i) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available
other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than the Company. For the purposes of this Section, “Information” means
all information received from or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Affiliates relating to the Company or its business or any of its Affiliates or
their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available
to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by the Company and other than information pertaining to this
Agreement routinely provided by arrangers to data service providers, including
league table providers, that serve the lending industry, after the Company has
publicly disclosed this Agreement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (it being understood and agreed that the Company shall so disclose
this Agreement in such a filing as and when required by applicable law). Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in
this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so
if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.

 



83

 

 

Section 12.14.  USA Patriot Act and Beneficial Ownership Regulation
Notification. Each Lender that is subject to the requirements of the USA Patriot
Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the
“Patriot Act”) and the requirements of the Beneficial Ownership Regulation
hereby notifies each Credit Party that pursuant to the requirements of the
Patriot Act and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation, it is required to obtain,
verify and record information that identifies such Credit Party, which
information includes the name, address and tax identification number of such
Credit Party and other information that will allow such Lender to identify such
Credit Party in accordance with the Patriot Act and the Beneficial Ownership
Regulation. Each Credit Party agrees to cooperate with each Lender and provide
true, accurate and complete information to such Lender in response to any such
request.

 

Section 12.15.  No Fiduciary Duty. (a) Each Agent, each Lender and their
Affiliates (collectively, for purposes of this Section 12.15, the “Lender
Parties”), may have economic interests that conflict with those of the
Borrowers. Each Borrower agrees that, except as expressly provided otherwise in
Section 12.04(b)(iv), nothing in the Loan Documents will be deemed to create an
advisory, fiduciary or agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty
between the Lender Parties and the Borrowers, its stockholders or its affiliates
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrowers
acknowledge and agree that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan
Documents are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Lender Parties,
on the one hand, and the Borrowers, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith
and with the process leading to such transactions contemplated by the Loan
Documents each of the Lender Parties is acting solely as a principal and not the
fiduciary of each of the Borrower, its management, stockholders, creditors or
any other person, (iii) no Lender Party has assumed an advisory or fiduciary
responsibility in favor of any Borrower with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether any
Lender Party or any of its affiliates has advised or is currently advising any
Borrower on other matters) and (iv) each Borrower has consulted its own legal
and financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate. Each Borrower
further acknowledges and agrees that it is responsible for making its own
independent judgment with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby and
the process leading thereto. Each Borrower agrees that it will not claim that
any Lender Party has rendered advisory services of any nature or respect, or
owes a fiduciary or similar duty to such Borrower, in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto.

 

(b)         The Credit Parties further acknowledge and agree, and acknowledges
its subsidiaries’ understanding, that each Lender Party and each Agent and
Arranger is a full service securities or banking firm engaged in securities
trading and brokerage activities as well as providing investment banking and
other financial services. In the ordinary course of business, any Lender Party,
Agent or Arranger may provide investment banking and other financial services
to, and/or acquire, hold or sell, for its own accounts and the accounts of
customers, equity, debt and other securities and financial instruments
(including bank loans and other obligations) of, any Credit Party and other
companies with which any Credit Party may have commercial or other
relationships. With respect to any securities and/or financial instruments so
held by any Lender Party or any such Agent or Arranger or any of its customers,
all rights in respect of such securities and financial instruments, including
any voting rights, will be exercised by the holder of the rights, in its sole
discretion.

  

84

 



 

 

 

(c)         In addition, the Credit Parties acknowledge and agree, and
acknowledge their subsidiaries’ understanding, that each Lender Party and its
Affiliates may be providing debt financing, equity capital or other services
(including financial advisory services) to other companies in respect of which
any Credit Party may have conflicting interests regarding the transactions
described herein and otherwise. No Lender Party nor its Affiliates will use
confidential information obtained from any Credit Party, its Affiliates and/or
its representatives by virtue of the Transactions contemplated by the Loan
Documents or their other relationships with any Credit Party in connection with
the performance by such Lender Party or its Affiliates of services for other
companies, and no Lender Party nor its Affiliates will furnish any such
information to other companies. The Credit Parties also acknowledge that no
Lender Party has any obligation to use in connection with the Transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents, or to furnish to any Credit Party,
confidential information obtained from other companies.

 

Section 12.16.  Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-in of Affected Financial
Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or
in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties,
each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial
Institution arising under any Loan Document may be subject to the Write-Down and
Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents
to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

 

(a)         the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the
applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which
may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial
Institution; and

 

(b)         the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including,
if applicable:

 

(i)            a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such
liability;

 

(ii)            a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares
or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its
parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise
conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be
accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or

 

(iii)          the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with
the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable
Resolution Authority.

 

To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, rule or regulation, each Lender
shall notify the Company and the Administrative Agent if it has become the
subject of a Bail-In Action (or any case or other proceeding in which a Bail-In
Action could reasonably be expected to be asserted against such Lender).

 

Section 12.17.  Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that
the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Swap
Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support “QFC
Credit Support” and each such QFC a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge
and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the
regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in
respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below
applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in
fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the
United States or any other state of the United States):

 



84

 

 

In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered
Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime,
the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit Support
(and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC
Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such
QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent
as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if
the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation
and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a
state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate
of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special
Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise
apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised
against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent
than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution
Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of
the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the
foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and remedies of the parties
with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any
Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
