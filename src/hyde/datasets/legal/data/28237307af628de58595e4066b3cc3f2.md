Candidate Criteria have been met, or whether a Compound otherwise is appropriate
for the commencement of IND-Enabling Studies shall be subject to Biogen’s final
decision-making authority in accordance with Section 4.2.4 (Decision Making
Authority). For clarity, at any time during the Term, Biogen shall nonetheless
have the right to determine whether any Compound meets the Development Candidate
Criteria or otherwise is appropriate for the commencement of IND-Enabling
Studies. As used in this Agreement, “Development Candidate” means each Compound
(a) that meets the Development Candidate Criteria (whether determined by the JSC

agendas and presentations for the JSC meetings, (f) conducting the meetings of
the JSC, and (g) performing such other functions as requested by the JSC.

4.2Joint Steering Committee.

4.2.1Formation. As soon as practicable, but no later than [***] after the
Effective Date, the Parties will establish a joint steering committee (the
“JSC”) to oversee the Research Activities. The JSC will be comprised of [***],
each of whom will have the appropriate experience and expertise to perform its
responsibilities on the JSC, [***]. Each Party will provide notice to the other
Party of its initial representatives to the JSC. Either Party may replace its
representatives with similarly qualified individuals at any time upon prior
written notice to the other Party. If agreed by the JSC on a case-by-case basis,
the JSC may invite other non-members to participate in the discussions and
meetings of the JSC, provided that such participants will have no voting
authority at the JSC and that any such non-employee participants are bound by
written obligations of non-use and confidentiality no less stringent than those
set forth in ARTICLE 9 (Confidentiality). The Alliance Managers will be
responsible, on behalf of the JSC, for setting the agenda for meetings of the
JSC with input from the other members and for conducting the meetings of the
JSC. Neither Alliance Manager will be a member of the JSC, but the Alliance
Managers or suitable designees will attend all meetings of the JSC.

4.2.2Meetings. The JSC will meet in person (alternating between a site
designated by each of Catalyst and Biogen) or by teleconference at least once
every Calendar Quarter, or with such other frequency as the Parties may agree.
Specific meeting dates will be determined by agreement of the Parties. Either
Party may also call a special meeting of the JSC (by videoconference or
teleconference) upon at least 10 Business Days’ prior written notice to the
other Party if such requesting Party reasonably believes that a significant
matter must be addressed before the next regularly scheduled JSC meeting. Biogen
will host the first meeting of the JSC at a mutually agreeable time and place no
later than 60 days after the Effective Date. Each Party will be responsible for
its own expenses relating to attendance at or participation in JSC meetings. The
Alliance Managers will prepare and disseminate agendas and presentations no
later than five Business Days in advance of each JSC meeting unless otherwise
agreed to by the Parties in writing. The Alliance Managers will jointly prepare
and circulate minutes for each JSC meeting within 10 Business Days after each
such meeting and will ensure that such minutes are reviewed and approved by
their respective companies within 30 days thereafter.

the presence of at least one representative from each Party. The JSC will
endeavor to reach decisions by consensus, with each Party, through its
representative members of the JSC, having one vote, provided that a quorum must
be present for any decision to be made by the JSC. In the event that the JSC is
unable to reach consensus on any decision at the meeting during which the
applicable matter is presented to the JSC, then, subject to the terms of this
Agreement, including Section 4.2.5 (Limits on JSC Decision Making Authority),
Biogen will have final decision making authority with respect to such decision,
including any amendment to the Work Plan or Research Budget.

4.2.5Limits on JSC Decision Making Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, without Catalyst’s prior written consent,

ARTICLE 6
MANUFACTURING

6.1General Responsibilities. Following successful manufacturing technology
transfer as set forth in Section 6.3 (Manufacturing Technology Transfer) for
each relevant Compound or Product, Biogen will have sole responsibility for, and
sole decision-making authority with respect to, all Manufacturing activities and
associated costs and expenses for the Manufacture of such Compound or Product.

6.2Observation by Biogen; Transfer of CMO Agreements.

6.2.1General. From time to time during the Research Term and until successful
manufacturing technology transfer as set forth in Section 6.3 (Manufacturing
Technology Transfer), Catalyst will provide Biogen with the opportunity, upon
Biogen’s reasonable request and during normal business hours, to observe and
discuss with relevant personnel of Biogen or any Third Party contract
manufacturing organization (“CMO”) engaged by Catalyst the Manufacturing
processes and procedures for Compounds (including to review assays, batch
records, and release processes and procedures) for the purpose of enabling
Biogen or a CMO designated by Biogen to Manufacture such Compounds and Products
that incorporate such Compounds pursuant to Section 6.3 (Manufacturing
Technology Transfer).

20

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

If Catalyst utilizes a CMO for the Manufacture of any Compound, then Catalyst
will take all reasonable actions, including entering into a three-party
agreement with Biogen and such CMO, to enable Biogen to exercise its rights
under Section 6.3 (Manufacturing Technology Transfer) and this Section 6.2
(Observation by Biogen; Transfer of CMO Agreements).

6.2.2Transfer of CMO Agreements. Without limiting the foregoing, Catalyst agrees
that, if requested by Biogen, it will (or cause its Affiliates to, as
applicable), to the extent legally permissible: (a) assign to Biogen or its
designee any existing agreements with a CMO for the Manufacture of Compounds and
all Products that incorporate such Compounds; or (b) assist Biogen or its
Affiliate in entering into new agreements directly with such CMO for such
Manufacture. If any such existing CMO agreement is assigned to Biogen, Catalyst
will be solely responsible for, and will indemnify and hold harmless Biogen and
all other Biogen Indemnified Parties from and against any costs and other
Liabilities arising from, or relating to, any such CMO agreement as a result of,
or in connection with, events or occurrences prior to the date of such
assignment (including any payments that accrued prior to the date of such
assignment but which do not become payable until after the date of such
assignment). Biogen will be solely responsible for, and will indemnify and hold
harmless Catalyst and all other Catalyst Indemnified Parties from and against
any costs and other Liabilities arising from, or relating to, any such CMO
agreement as a result of, or in connection with, events or occurrences on or
after the date of such assignment.

6.3Manufacturing Technology Transfer. In addition to the technology transfers
provided for in Section 5.1 (Technology Transfer), following designation of a
Development Candidate and no later than [***] following Biogen’s written request
(email is acceptable) with respect to any such Development Candidate, the
Parties will develop and agree upon a plan for the transfer of the manufacturing
process and related Licensed Know-How then in existence for such Development
Candidate (each, a “Manufacturing Tech Transfer Plan”) that will include all
activities necessary to enable Biogen (or a CMO designated by Biogen) to
Manufacture the applicable Development Candidate and all Products that
incorporate such Development Candidate, utilizing such process. The Parties will
perform the activities set forth in the Manufacturing Tech Transfer Plan for
each such Development Candidate as quickly as possible following the Parties’
agreement thereon, but in any event no later than [***] following such agreement
with respect to such plan. Thereafter [***].

6.4Reimbursement for Catalyst Manufacturing Support. [***]

ARTICLE 7
PAYMENTS AND ROYALTIES

7.1Upfront Fee. In consideration of the licenses and rights granted to Biogen
and its Affiliates hereunder, Biogen will pay to Catalyst a one-time upfront
payment of fifteen million Dollars ($15,000,000) within 10 Business Days after
the Effective Date.

7.2Reimbursement of Research Costs.

7.2.1Nonbinding Estimates. Within [***] after the conclusion of each Calendar
Quarter during the Research Term, for planning purposes, Catalyst will deliver a
summary report containing nonbinding estimates of the FTE Costs and
Out-of-Pocket Costs incurred by Catalyst in the performance of Catalyst Research
Activities during such Calendar Quarter for which Catalyst expects to request
reimbursement.

21

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

7.2.2Cost Reports and Invoices. Within [***] after the conclusion of each
Calendar Quarter during the Research Term, Catalyst will deliver the quarterly
report as described in Section 3.4.1 (Reports). Such report shall include the
following information: (a) all FTE Costs and Out-of-Pocket Costs (along with
reasonable supporting documentation), in each case, incurred by or on behalf of
Catalyst during the applicable Calendar Quarter in the performance of the
Catalyst Research Activities during such Calendar Quarter (the “Quarterly
Expenses”) and (b) a reasonable non-binding rolling estimate of the projected
FTE Costs and Out-of-Pocket Costs, in each case, to be incurred on a Calendar
Quarter-by-Calendar Quarter basis by or on behalf of Catalyst in order to
complete the Catalyst Research Activities as set forth under the Work Plan. Such
report shall also include a reasonably detailed invoice for the Quarterly
Expenses (on a work stream-by-work stream basis) for which Catalyst is seeking
reimbursement. Biogen shall reimburse Catalyst for such Quarterly Expenses,
provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Biogen shall not be obligated to
reimburse Catalyst for any Quarterly Expenses which [***] unless such excess
costs are approved by the JSC. Payments under this Section 7.2.2 with respect to
any Calendar Quarter will be made within [***] following the receipt by Biogen
of the report and invoice for the applicable research costs for such Calendar
Quarter.

7.2.3[***]

7.3Milestone Payments.

7.3.1Development Milestones.

(a)General. Biogen will make one-time milestone payments (each, a “Development
Milestone Payment”) to Catalyst upon the first achievement by Biogen or its
Affiliates or Sublicensees of each of the development milestone events set forth
in TABLE 7.3.1 below for the first Product that is Covered by a Valid Claim (at
the time of such achievement) of a Licensed Patent Right, Patent Right within
the Arising IP, or Assigned Patent Right (each, a “Development Milestone
Event”), to achieve the applicable Development Milestone Event. For the
avoidance of doubt, each Development Milestone Payment hereunder will be payable
only once upon the first achievement of the applicable Development Milestone
Event by any Product. No additional Development Milestone Payments will be made
for any subsequent achievement of such Development Milestone Event by such
Product or any other Product regardless of whether such other Product contains
the same Compound.

(b)Milestone Catch-Up. If one or more Development Milestone Events involving the
Initiation of a Clinical Trial are skipped (i.e., a Development Milestone Event
is achieved prior to such a Development Milestone Event involving the Initiation
of a Clinical Trial that precedes such first Development Milestone Event in the
table below), then such skipped Development Milestone Event(s) will be payable
upon achievement of the subsequent Development Milestone Event (e.g., where no
Initiation of a Phase II Clinical Trial occurs, but the Initiation of a Phase
III Clinical Trial occurs with respect to the same Product, then at the time of
payment of the Development Milestone Payment for Initiation of the Phase III
Clinical Trial Biogen shall also pay to Catalyst the Development Milestone
Payment for Initiation of the Phase II Clinical Trial). For clarity, a
Development Milestone Event in one territory will not be deemed to be skipped
solely because a subsequent Development Milestone Event was achieved in a
different territory (e.g., the First Commercial Sale of a Product in the third
Major European Market will not be deemed to trigger a Development Milestone
Payment for the First Commercial Sale of any Product in the United States).

22

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

(c)Notification of Achievement. Biogen will notify Catalyst of the achievement
of a Development Milestone Event by Biogen or its Affiliates or Sublicensees no
later than [***] after Biogen becomes aware of the achievement thereof.
Thereafter, Catalyst will provide Biogen with an invoice for the corresponding
Development Milestone Payment. Biogen will pay to Catalyst such Development
Milestone Payment no later than [***] after its receipt of the applicable
invoice. For clarity, the total Development Milestone Payments that may become
due and payable under this Agreement shall in no event exceed [***].

7.3.2Sales Milestones.

(a)General. Biogen will make one-time sales milestone payments (each, a “Sales
Milestone Payment” and together with the Development Milestone Payments, the
“Milestone Payments”) to Catalyst upon the achievement by Biogen or its
Affiliates or Sublicensees of each of the sales-based milestones events (each, a
“Sales Milestone Event”) set forth in TABLE 7.3.2 below with respect to [***]
(“Annual Net Sales”). Each of the Sales Milestone Payments set forth below will
be payable only one time, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 7.3.2(b)
(Notification of Achievement), only for the first Calendar Year in which the
corresponding Sales Milestone Event is achieved.

(b)Notification of Achievement. Biogen will notify Catalyst in writing of the
achievement of a Sales Milestone Event by Biogen or its Affiliates or
Sublicensees no later than 45 days after the end of the Calendar Year in which
such Sales Milestone Payment is achieved. Thereafter, Catalyst will provide
Biogen with an invoice for the corresponding Sales Milestone Payment. Biogen
will pay to Catalyst such Sales Milestone Payment no later than [***] after its
receipt of the applicable invoice. If more than one Sales Milestone Event is
achieved by Biogen or its Affiliates or Sublicensees in any Calendar Year,
Biogen will only be obligated to pay the highest Sales Milestone Payment
corresponding to any Sales Milestone Event that was achieved in such Calendar
Year and (except as provided in the next sentence) no other Sales Milestone
Payments for such Calendar Year. [***]

7.4Royalties.

7.4.1Royalty Payments. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.4.4 (Payment
Adjustments), on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis, Biogen will
pay to Catalyst royalties on aggregate Net Sales in each Calendar Year resulting
from the sale of a Product in the Territory during the applicable Royalty Term
for such Product in each country (each, the “Per Product Annual Net Sales”) in
the amounts set forth in TABLE 7.4.1 below.

Each marginal royalty rate set forth in TABLE 7.4.1 above will apply only to
that portion of the Per Product Annual Net Sales of a given Product in the
Territory during a given Calendar Year that falls within the indicated range.
For example, [***]

 

7.4.2Royalty Term. On a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis,
Biogen’s obligation to pay royalties will begin upon the First Commercial Sale
of a Product in a country and will expire upon the later of (a) the expiration
of the last-to-expire Valid Claim of a (i) Licensed Patent Right, (ii) Patent
Right within the Arising IP; and (iii) Assigned Patent Right, in each case (of
(i)-(iii)) Covering the composition of matter of such Product in such country;
or (b) the tenth anniversary of the First Commercial Sale of the first Product
in such country (the “Royalty Term”).  Upon expiration of the Royalty Term for a
given Product in a given country: (i) no further royalties will be payable in
respect of sales of such Product in such country, (ii) sales of such Product in
such country will not be included in the calculation of aggregate Net Sales
under Section 7.3.2 (Sales Milestones) (i.e., for purposes of determining
whether a Sales Milestone Event has been achieved) or for purposes of
calculating the royalty tiers pursuant to Section 7.4.1 (Royalty Payments) and
(iii) the licenses granted under Section 2.1.1 (Exclusive License) with respect
to the Exploitation of such Product in such country will automatically become
fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable, and royalty-free. For clarity, only a
single royalty will be payable on the sale of a Product regardless of the number
of Valid Claims Covering such Product during the applicable Royalty Term.

7.4.3Royalty Reports; Payments.

(a)Royalty Reports. No later than [***] after the end of each Calendar Quarter
during which any royalty payments are owed, Biogen will submit to Catalyst a
written report of Net Sales of Products sold, in the currency for which such
Products were sold (and, if the currency of sale was not Dollars, also in
Dollars), by or on behalf of Biogen and its Affiliates and Sublicensees during
such Calendar Quarter, and the royalty payments payable on such Net Sales, in
sufficient detail to permit confirmation of the accuracy of royalty payments
paid hereunder.

24

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

(b)Royalty Payments. Royalties will be payable on a Calendar Quarter basis.
Biogen will make any such payments within [***] after the end of the Calendar
Quarter during which the applicable Net Sales of Products occurred.

7.4.4Payment Adjustments.

(a)Reductions for Patent Expiry, Generic Versions, and Compulsory Licenses.
Subject to Section 7.4.4(c) (Maximum Payment Reductions), the royalties payable
under Section 7.4 (Royalties) with respect to Net Sales of a Product in a
country shall be reduced as follows:

(i)upon the expiration of the last to expire Valid Claim of a Licensed Patent
Right, Patent Right within the Arising IP, and Assigned Patent Right, in each
case Covering the composition of matter of such Product in such country, the
royalties payable pursuant to Section 7.4 (Royalties) with respect to Net Sales
of such Product in such country will be reduced by [***] for the remainder of
the Royalty Term for such Product in such country (if any); and

(ii)upon the earlier of (A) the date on which a Third Party first sells a
Generic Version of such Product in such county, or (B) the date on which a Third
Party sells any product that contains the same Compound as such Product in such
country under a compulsory license granted or ordered to be granted by a
competent Governmental Authority (a “Compulsory License”), the royalties payable
pursuant to Section 7.4 (Royalties) with respect to Net Sales of such Product in
such country will be reduced by an additional [***] of the royalties otherwise
payable pursuant to Section 7.4 (Royalties) (calculated after giving effect to
any adjustment pursuant to Section 7.4.4(a)(i)) for the remainder of the Royalty
Term for such Product in such country (if any) [***].

(b)Third Party Payments. Without limiting Biogen’s rights or Catalyst’s
responsibilities under Section 7.4.5 (Third Party Agreements), if Biogen or any
Affiliate or Sublicensee thereof enters into an agreement with a Third Party to
obtain rights (whether by acquisition or license) under a Patent Right or other
Intellectual Property owned or controlled by such Third Party, and such rights
are necessary or useful to Exploit one or more Compounds or Products (but not
any Other Active of any Combination Product), then, subject to Section 7.4.4(c)
(Maximum Payment Reductions), Biogen may offset against the royalties due to
Catalyst an amount equal to [***] of the amounts paid to such Third Party under
such agreement (including any upfront payments, milestone payments, royalties
(whether based on net sales or profits)); provided that if such agreement also
includes a license under Intellectual Property that Covers products other than
any Compound or Compound Component of any Product, such reduction shall only
apply to an appropriately allocated portion of such payments (such allocation to
be done in good faith by Biogen). [***].

(c)Maximum Payment Adjustments. In no event will the royalties payable to
Catalyst in a given Calendar Quarter be reduced by more than [***] of the
aggregate amount that would otherwise be payable to Catalyst in respect of such
royalties in such Calendar Quarter (as set forth in TABLE 7.4.1) as a result of
the reductions permitted pursuant to Section 7.4.4(a) (Reductions for Patent
Expiry, Generic Versions, and Compulsory Licenses) and Section 7.4.4(b) (Third
Party Payments). Biogen may carry forward any such reductions permitted under
Section 7.4.4(a) (Reductions for Patent Expiry, Generic Versions, and Compulsory
Licenses) and Section 7.4.4(b) (Third Party Payments) that are incurred or
accrued in a Calendar Quarter but are not applied against royalties due to
Catalyst in such Calendar Quarter as a result of the foregoing floor. Biogen may
apply such amounts against royalties due to Catalyst in any subsequent Calendar
Quarter (subject to the minimum floor set forth in this Section 7.4.4(c)
(Maximum Royalty Adjustments)) until the full amount of such reduction has been
fully applied against royalties due to Catalyst.

25

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

(d)Compulsory Licenses. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in no event
will the royalties payable under this Section 7.4 (Royalties) on the sale of any
Product by a Sublicensee pursuant to a Compulsory License exceed the royalty
actually received by Biogen or its Affiliates from such Sublicensee with respect
to such sale.

7.4.5Third Party Agreements. Catalyst will be solely responsible for (i) all
obligations (including any royalty or other payment obligations, including those
which relate to the Licensed Technology or Assigned Patent Rights) under any
agreement between Catalyst or any Affiliate thereof and any Third Party that is
in effect as of the Effective Date or that Catalyst or any Affiliate thereof
enters into during the Term and (ii) all payments to inventors (other than
inventors that are representatives of Biogen) of Licensed Technology, Assigned
Patent Rights, Results, and Deliverables, including payments under inventorship
compensation laws.

7.5Payment Method. All payments to be made between the Parties under this
Agreement will be made in Dollars and may be paid by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to a bank account designated by Catalyst; provided
that in no event will Biogen be obligated to make payments under this Agreement
to any Person organized in any jurisdiction outside of the U.S. without Biogen’s
prior written consent. All undisputed invoiced amounts are due within [***]
following the date of the invoice, unless a different time period is specified
herein.

7.6Currency Exchange. Biogen’s then-current standard exchange rate methodology
will be employed for the translation of foreign currency sales into Dollars.

7.7Late Payments. If a Party does not receive payment of any undisputed sum due
to it on or before the due date set forth under this Agreement, then simple
interest will thereafter accrue on the sum due to such Party from the due date
until the date of payment at a per-annum rate of one percentage point over the
then-current prime rate reported in The Wall Street Journal or the maximum rate
allowable under Applicable Law, whichever is lower.

7.8Taxes.

7.8.1Responsibility. Except as expressly set forth in Section 7.8.2 (Withholding
Taxes), Catalyst will pay any and all taxes levied on account of all payments it
receives under this agreement.

7.8.2Withholding Taxes. Catalyst will provide such information and documentation
to Biogen as are reasonably requested by Biogen to determine if any withholding
taxes apply to any payments to be made by Biogen to Catalyst under this
Agreement. Solely to the extent that Applicable Law requires that taxes be
withheld with respect to any such payments to be made by Biogen to Catalyst
under this Agreement, Biogen will: (a) deduct those taxes from the remittable
payment, (b) pay the taxes to the proper taxing authority, and (c) send evidence
of the obligation together with proof of tax payment to Catalyst on a reasonable
and timely basis following such tax payment. Any such payments made to any
taxing authority in accordance with the foregoing shall be deemed to have been
made to Catalyst in satisfaction of the applicable payment obligation as
contemplated in this Agreement. Each Party agrees to reasonably cooperate with
the other Party in claiming refunds or exemptions from such deductions or
withholdings under any relevant agreement or treaty that is in effect.

26

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

7.9Financial Audits.

7.9.1Record Retention; Audits. Each Party will keep (and will cause its
Affiliates and Sublicensees to keep) complete and accurate records pertaining to
(a) in the case of Biogen [***] (the “Catalyst Records”), in each case ((a) and
(b)), in reasonable detail to permit the other Party to confirm the accuracy of
all payments or costs reported, for at least the preceding [***]. Upon
reasonable (but in any case no less than [***]) advance notice by one Party (the
“Auditing Party”) to the other Party (the “Audited Party”) and not more than
[***], the Audited Party and its Affiliates will permit, and will cause their
Sublicensees to permit, an independent certified public accounting firm of
internationally recognized standing, selected by the Auditing Party and
reasonably acceptable to the Audited Party, to have access during normal
business hours to such of the records of the Audited Party and its Affiliates
and, if applicable, their Sublicensees, as may be reasonably necessary to verify
the accuracy of (i) in the case of Biogen as the Audited Party [***] and (ii) in
the case of Catalyst as the Audited Party, [***]. The accounting firm will enter
a confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to the Audited Party governing
the use and disclosure of the Audited Party’s information disclosed to such
firm, and such firm will disclose to the Auditing Party only whether information
provided by the Audited Party to the Auditing Party as described in clauses (a)
and (b) above was accurate and the specific details concerning any
discrepancies, which information will be Confidential Information of the Audited
Party.

7.9.2Audit Disputes. Any disputes with respect to the findings of such
accounting firm may be referred by either Party to the dispute resolution
procedure set forth in Section 13.8 (Dispute Resolution). If either Party is
found to have been underpaid any amounts payable to such Party hereunder or to
have overpaid to the other Party any amounts payable hereunder, then such first
Party will be entitled to receive any undisputed discrepancy, plus interest as
set forth in Section 7.7 (Late Payments), no later than [***] after delivery to
the Parties of the final report of such accounting firm. For clarity, in the
case of Biogen, all or any portion of the amount of such discrepancy may be set
of against any other payments owed to Catalyst under this Agreement. The fees
charged by such accounting firm will be paid by the Auditing Party; provided
that if the audit discloses a net underpayment of amounts owed or over-reporting
of expenses by the Audited Party of more than [***] of total amounts owed or
expenses reported by the Audited Party for any Calendar Year period covered by
the audit, then, in addition to the payment of the underpaid amount (or
reimbursement of the overpaid amount, as applicable), the Audited Party will pay
the reasonable fees and expenses charged by such accounting firm. The Auditing
Party will treat all financial information disclosed by its accounting firm
pursuant to this Section 7.9 (Financial Audits) as Confidential Information of
the Audited Party for purposes of ARTICLE 9 (Confidentiality) of this Agreement,
and will cause its accounting firm to do the same.

Candidate basis and effective as of [***], Catalyst will and hereby does assign
to Biogen [***] “Assigned Patent Rights.” For clarity, at any time during the
Term prior to such assignment, such Patent Rights constitute “Licensed Patent
Rights,” and, upon such assignment, such Patent Rights will no longer constitute
“Licensed Patent Rights,” except where otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement. Collectively, the Assigned Patent Rights and any Patent Rights
constituting Arising IP are referred to herein as the “Biogen Patent Rights.”

(b)Any grants of a license by Biogen under any of the Assigned Patent Rights
shall be consistent with the license grant in Section 2.2.2 (License Under
Assigned Patent Rights), and with the other terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including termination under ARTICLE 12 (Term and Termination), and
any Third Party licensee of such rights shall be deemed a “Sublicensee” for
purposes of this Agreement (including royalty payments upon such Third Party’s
Net Sales) notwithstanding Biogen’s ownership of the Assigned Patent Rights.

10.1.4Disclosure of Inventions by Personnel. Each Party will ensure that any
personnel involved in the performance of Research Activities on behalf of such
Party, its Affiliates or Subcontractors are obligated to inform such Party about
any Invention made, conceived, discovered, or otherwise generated individually
or jointly by or on behalf of such personnel in the performance of such Research
Activities. Catalyst will promptly inform Biogen of any such Inventions by or on
behalf of Catalyst, its Affiliates or Subcontractors.

(a)Biogen’s Rights. Biogen will have (i) the sole right (but not the obligation)
to prepare, file in its name, prosecute, and maintain all Biogen Patent Rights,
and (ii) the first right (but not the obligation) to prepare, file, prosecute,
and maintain all Patent Rights listed in Schedule 1.87 but not listed under the
heading “SUBJECT TO ASSIGNMENT” (the Patent Rights described in the foregoing
clause (ii), the “Biogen First Right Patent Rights” and the Patent Rights
described in clauses (i) and, where Biogen has elected to prosecute, (ii),
collectively, the “Biogen-Prosecuted Patent Rights”). Biogen will be the
Prosecuting Party with respect to all Biogen-Prosecuted Patent Rights. Biogen
will be responsible for and pay all future costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of the
Biogen-Prosecuted Patent Rights and will keep Catalyst reasonably informed as to
material developments with respect to the preparation, filing, prosecution,
issuance, and maintenance of the Biogen First Right Patent Rights, including
providing to Catalyst notice in advance of abandoning any such Biogen First
Right Patent Rights, and considering in good faith Catalyst’s reasonable
comments thereto with respect to those claims Covering products or compounds
which are not Compounds or Products.

35

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

(b)Catalyst’s Rights. Catalyst will have the first right (but not the
obligation) to prepare, file in its name, prosecute, and maintain all other
Licensed Patent Rights (i.e., those Licensed Patent Rights not addressed in
subpart (a) above) (where Catalyst has elected to so prosecute, the
“Catalyst-Prosecuted Patent Rights”). Catalyst will be the Prosecuting Party
with respect to all Catalyst-Prosecuted Patent Rights. Catalyst will be
responsible for and pay all future costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of the
Catalyst-Prosecuted Patent Rights and will keep Biogen reasonably informed as to
material developments with respect to the preparation, filing, prosecution,
issuance, and maintenance of the Catalyst-Prosecuted Patent Rights, including
providing notice in advance of abandoning any such Catalyst-Prosecuted Patent
Rights.

10.2.2Step-In Right. If, during the Term, the Prosecuting Party decides that it
is no longer interested in the preparation, filing, prosecution, or maintenance
of a particular Biogen First Right Patent Right (with respect to Biogen as the
Prosecuting Party) or Catalyst-Prosecuted Patent Right (with respect to Catalyst
as the Prosecuting Party), then it will promptly provide written notice to the
non-Prosecuting Party of such decision. Within [***] following receipt of such
written notice, the non-Prosecuting Party may, upon written notice to the
Prosecuting Party, elect to assume the preparation, filing, prosecution, and
maintenance of such Patent Right at the non-Prosecuting Party’s sole cost and
expense. In such event, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 10.2 (Patent Prosecution and Maintenance), the Party assuming such
rights will be responsible for 100% of the costs and expenses of the
preparation, filing, prosecution, and maintenance of such Patent Right as of the
election date, and such Party assuming such rights will thereafter be deemed the
“Prosecuting Party” with respect to such Patent Right for all purposes under
this Agreement. If no such notice from the non-Prosecuting Party is received
within such [***] period, the Prosecuting Party may allow the applicable Patent
Right to lapse by non-response or non-payment.

10.2.3Cooperation. The non-Prosecuting Party will (a) obtain and deliver to the
Prosecuting Party any necessary documents for the Prosecuting Party to exercise
its rights to prepare, prosecute, defend, and maintain all Patent Rights
pursuant to Section 10.2.1 (Right to File and Prosecute) or Section 10.2.2
(Step-In Right), as applicable, (b) render all signatures that will be necessary
in connection with all such patent filings, and (c) assist the Prosecuting Party
in all other reasonable ways that are necessary for the issuance of those Patent
Rights for which such Prosecuting Party is responsible, as well as for the
preparation, prosecution, defense, and maintenance of such Patent Rights.

10.3Patent Enforcement.

10.3.1Third Party Infringement. During the Term, the Parties will promptly
inform each other in writing if either Party becomes aware of any Opposed Biogen
Patent Right or Opposed Catalyst Patent Right and will, as applicable, provide
any available evidence of such suspected, threatened or actual infringement,
objection, opposition or challenge with such notification (each, a “Third Party
Action”).

10.3.2Third Party Actions.

(a)By Biogen. During the Term, Biogen will have the sole right (except as
provided below), but not the obligation, to enforce or defend any Opposed Biogen
Patent Right against such Third Party Action, at Biogen’s sole discretion and at
Biogen’s sole cost and expense. Where Biogen desires to enforce or defend such
Opposed Biogen Patent Right but is unable to do so due to Applicable Law or
regulation (even as the assignee or exclusive licensee of such Patent Right),
then Biogen may request that Catalyst join as a named party in such action or
that Catalyst enforce or defend such Patent Right against such Third Parties, at
Biogen’s sole cost and expense. Biogen will take the lead in the control and
conduct of any such enforcement or defense under this Section 10.3.2(a) (By
Biogen) and Catalyst will reasonably assist Biogen in any such enforcement or
defense action under this Section 10.3.2(a) (By Biogen) at Biogen’s expense.
Biogen will keep Catalyst reasonably informed of any such enforcement or
defense.

36

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

(b)By Catalyst. During the Term, Catalyst will have the first right, but not the
obligation, to enforce or defend any Opposed Catalyst Patent Right against such
Third Party Action, at Catalyst’s sole discretion and at Catalyst’s sole cost
and expense. Where Catalyst desires to enforce or defend such Opposed Catalyst
Patent Right but may not do so due to Applicable Law or regulation (even as the
assignee or exclusive licensee of such Patent Right), then upon Catalyst’s
reasonable request, Biogen shall join as a named party in such action or itself
enforce or defend such Opposed Catalyst Patent Right against such Third Parties,
at Catalyst’s sole cost and expense. Catalyst will take the lead in the control
and conduct of any such enforcement or defense under this Section 10.3.2(b) (By
Catalyst) and will keep Biogen reasonably informed of any such enforcement or
defense, and Biogen will reasonably assist Catalyst in any such enforcement or
defense action under this Section 10.3.2(b) (By Catalyst) at Catalyst’s expense.
Catalyst will keep Biogen reasonably informed of any such enforcement or
defense. If Catalyst does not bring any legal action within [***] after first
becoming aware of such infringement or after notice of such infringement was
provided pursuant to Section 10.3.1, then Biogen shall have the right to bring
and control any legal action in connection with such Third Party Action, at its
sole cost and expense.

(c) Cooperation. At the request and sole cost and expense of the Party defending
or enforcing the Third Party Action under Section 10.3.2(a) or 10.3.2(b), the
other Party shall provide reasonable assistance in connection therewith,
including by executing reasonably appropriate documents, cooperating in
discovery and joining as a party to the action if required. In connection with
any such proceeding, the Party bringing the action under Section 10.3.2(a) or
10.3.2(b) shall not enter into any settlement admitting the invalidity of, or
otherwise impairing the other Party’s rights in, the Opposed Biogen Patent Right
or Opposed Catalyst Patent Right without the prior written consent of the other
Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.

10.3.3Patent Listing. Biogen will have the full and exclusive right, in its sole
discretion, to determine and control the listing of any Patent Right (including
any Assigned Patent Right or Licensed Patent Right) in connection with the
Regulatory Approval of any Product, including in the then-current edition of the
United States Food and Drug Administration publications (i) “List of Licensed
Biological Products with Reference Product Exclusivity and Biosimilarity or
Interchangeability Evaluations” (commonly referred to as the purple book); (ii)
“Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly
referred to as the orange book), or in equivalent patent listings in any other
country within the Territory.

10.3.4Recoveries. Any amount recovered in any action under Section 10.3.2 (Third
Party Actions), including any amount recovered in any settlement of such Third
Party Action, will first be used to reimburse each Party’s costs and expenses
with respect to such action, which reimbursement will be first allocated to the
Party controlling such action’s costs and expenses, and then, to the extent such
costs and expenses exceed such recovered amount, to the other Party’s costs and
expenses. Any such recoveries in excess of such costs and expenses shall be
shared by the Parties as follows [***].

10.4Defense of Claims. Catalyst will promptly inform Biogen in writing if
Catalyst receives written notice, or otherwise becomes aware, of alleged
infringement, misappropriation, or other violation of a Third Party’s
Intellectual Property based upon Catalyst’s performance of its obligations or
exercise of its rights hereunder. Except as otherwise set forth under this
Agreement (including under ARTICLE 11 (Indemnification; Insurance)), Catalyst
will have the sole right (and the obligation) to defend against any such claim
brought against it. Catalyst will keep Biogen advised of all material
developments in the conduct of any proceedings in defending any claim of alleged
infringement, misappropriation, or other violation related to any Compounds or
Products and will reasonably cooperate with Biogen in the conduct of such
defense. In no event may Catalyst settle any such infringement,
misappropriation, or other violation claim in a manner that would limit the
rights of Biogen or impose any obligation on Biogen, in each case, without
Biogen’s prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed.

37

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

10.5Patent Term Extensions. Biogen will have the full and exclusive right and
discretion to determine and control all filings of requests for patent term
extensions, supplementary protection certificates, or equivalents thereto, in
any country in the Territory, for any Patent Rights that Cover any Compound or
Product (hereinafter “Patent Term Extensions”). All costs and expenses relating
to the Patent Term Extensions will be born solely by Biogen. Upon request of
Biogen and at Biogen’s cost and expense, Catalyst will provide support,
assistance, and all necessary documents, in full executed form as needed, to
Biogen for the purpose of supporting, filing, obtaining, and maintaining Patent
Term Extensions.

10.6Summary of Activities. Upon the request of either Party, the Prosecuting
Party will provide to the other Party, no more frequently than on an annual
basis, a written report summarizing all material activities undertaken by such
Prosecuting Party in the preceding Calendar Year with respect to the
preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, enforcement, and defense of the
Biogen-Prosecuted Patent Rights or Catalyst-Prosecuted Patent Rights (as
applicable) in the exercise of the rights granted to such Prosecuting Party
under this ARTICLE 10 (Intellectual Property). Such report will be considered
the Confidential Information of the Prosecuting Party.

ARTICLE 11
INDEMNIFICATION; INSURANCE

11.1Indemnification by Catalyst. Catalyst will indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless Biogen, its Affiliates, Sublicensees, and each of its and their
respective employees, officers, directors, and agents (each, a “Biogen
Indemnified Party”) from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), and costs
(collectively, “Liabilities”) that the Biogen Indemnified Party may be required
to pay to one or more Third Parties resulting from or arising out of:

11.1.1the negligence or willful misconduct of Catalyst or any other Catalyst
Indemnified Party;

11.1.2the breach by Catalyst of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants, or agreements under this Agreement;

11.1.3any claim that Catalyst misappropriated any trade secrets or
inappropriately used or disclosed the confidential information owned or
possessed by any Third Party in the conduct of the Catalyst Research Activities;
or

11.1.4any claims of any nature arising out of any Exploitation of any Compound
or Product by or on behalf of Catalyst prior to the Effective Date or after the
effective date of termination of this Agreement (or the effective date of
termination of such Compound or Product in the event of partial termination);

11.1.5The obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless a Biogen
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 11.1.1, 11.1.2, 11.1.3, or 11.1.4 shall
not apply to any such Liabilities to the extent that (a) Biogen is obligated to
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless a Catalyst Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Agreement; or (b) such Liabilities are caused by the negligence or willful
misconduct of Biogen or any Biogen Indemnified Party.

11.2Indemnification by Biogen. Biogen will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
Catalyst, each of its Affiliates, and each of its and its Affiliates’ employees,
officers, directors, and agents (each, a “Catalyst Indemnified Party”) from and

required to pay to one or more Third Parties resulting from or arising out of:

38

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

11.2.1the negligence or willful misconduct of Biogen or any other Biogen
Indemnified Party;

11.2.2any claims of any nature arising out of (a) the Exploitation of any
Compound or Product by or on behalf of Biogen, its Affiliates or Sublicensees or
(b) any Biogen Research Activities performed by or on behalf of Biogen, in each
case ((a)-(b)), other than by any Catalyst Indemnified Party; or

11.2.3the breach by Biogen of any of its representations, warranties, covenants,
or agreements under this Agreement.

11.2.4The obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless a Catalyst
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 11.2.1, 11.2.2, or 11.2.3 shall not apply
to any such Liabilities to the extent that (a) Catalyst is obligated to
indemnify, defend, and hold harmless a Biogen Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Agreement; or (b) such Liabilities are caused by the negligence or willful
misconduct of Catalyst or any Catalyst Indemnified Party.

11.3Procedure for Third Party Claims. If a Party is seeking indemnification
under Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable (the “Indemnified Party”), it shall
inform the other Party (the “Indemnifying Party”) of the claim for Liabilities
giving rise to the obligation to indemnify pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2, as
applicable (the “Third Party Claim”), as soon as reasonably practicable after
receiving notice of the Third Party Claim (provided, however, any delay or
failure to provide such notice shall not constitute a waiver or release of, or
otherwise limit, the Indemnified Party’s rights to indemnification under Section
11.1 or 11.2, as applicable, except to the extent that such delay or failure
materially prejudices the Indemnifying Party’s ability to defend against the
relevant Third Party Claims). The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
assume the defense of any such Third Party Claim for which the Indemnified Party
is seeking indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable. The
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnifying Party’s insurer as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request,
and at the Indemnifying Party’s cost and expense. The Indemnified Party shall
have the right to participate, at its own expense and with counsel of its
choice, in the defense of any Third Party Claim that has been assumed by the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not settle any Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party shall not be required to obtain such consent if the
settlement (a) involves only the payment of money which is fully paid by the
Indemnifying Party and will not result in the Indemnified Party (or other Biogen
Indemnified Parties or Catalyst Indemnified Parties, as applicable) becoming
subject to injunctive or other similar type of relief, (b) does not require an
admission by the Indemnified Party (or other Biogen Indemnified Parties or
Catalyst Indemnified Parties, as applicable), (c) includes an unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party (or other Biogen Indemnified Parties or
Catalyst Indemnified Parties, as applicable) from all Liability on claims that
are the subject matter of such proceeding, and (d) does not materially adversely
affect any Intellectual Property owned or controlled by the Indemnified Party or
any rights or licenses granted to the Indemnified Party under this Agreement.
The Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. If the Parties cannot agree as
to the application of Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable, to any Third Party
Claim, pending resolution of the dispute pursuant to Section 13.8 (Dispute
Resolution), the Parties may conduct separate defenses of such Third Party
Claims, with each Party retaining the right to claim indemnification from the
other Party in accordance with Section 11.1 or 11.2, as applicable, upon
resolution of the underlying claim. In each case, the Indemnified Party shall
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, and shall make available to
the Indemnifying Party all pertinent information under the control of the
Indemnified Party, which information shall be subject to ARTICLE 9
(Confidentiality).

39

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

reputable insurance provider, insurance coverage in the amount of five million
Dollars ($5,000,000) for each claim and ten million Dollars ($10,000,000) in the
aggregate to cover claims against Biogen in connection with this Agreement,
including any indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 11
(Indemnification; Insurance).

ARTICLE 12
TERM AND TERMINATION

12.1Term. This Agreement will commence upon the Effective Date and, if not
otherwise terminated earlier pursuant to this ARTICLE 12 (Term and Termination),
will continue, on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis, in full
force and effect until the expiration of the Royalty Term applicable to such
Product and such country (the “Term”).

12.2Termination for Cause.

12.2.1By Biogen. In the event of a material breach of this Agreement by
Catalyst, which material breach remains uncured for [***] measured from the date
of written notice of such material breach provided by Biogen that identifies the
material breach, Biogen may terminate this Agreement in whole or with respect to
one or more Compounds or Products by written notice of termination to Catalyst
provided within [***] of the expiration of such [***] period.

12.2.2By Catalyst. In the event of a material breach of this Agreement by
Biogen, which material breach remains uncured for [***] measured from the date
of written notice of such material breach provided by Catalyst that identifies
the material breach, Catalyst may terminate this Agreement solely with respect
to those Compounds or Products to which such material breach relates by written
notice of termination to Biogen provided within [***] of the expiration of such
[***].

12.2.3Disputes Regarding Material Breach. If a Party (the “Defaulting Party”) is
alleged to have, but disputes that it, materially breached this Agreement by the
other Party (such other Party, the “Non-Defaulting Party”), then the issue of
whether the Non-Defaulting Party may properly terminate this Agreement or
applicable portion hereof on expiration of the applicable cure period will be
resolved in accordance with Section 13.8 (Dispute Resolution). If as a result of
such dispute resolution process, it is determined that the Defaulting Party
committed a material breach of this Agreement and the Defaulting Party does not
cure such material breach within [***] after the date of such determination
[***] (the “Additional Cure Period”), then the Non-Defaulting Party will have
the right to terminate this Agreement or applicable portion hereof by written
notice of termination to the Defaulting Party provided within [***] of the
expiration of the Additional Cure Period. This Agreement will remain in full
force and effect during the pendency of any such dispute resolution proceeding
and the cure periods set forth in Section 12.2.1 (By Biogen) or Section 12.2.2
(By Catalyst), as applicable, and any Additional Cure Period, in each case, will
be tolled during any such dispute resolution proceeding. If as a result of such
dispute resolution proceeding it is determined that the Defaulting Party did not
commit such material breach, then no termination will be effective, and this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

12.3Termination for Insolvency. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
either Party may terminate this Agreement upon the filing or institution of
bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, or receivership proceedings, upon the
appointment of a receiver or trustee over all or substantially all property, or
upon an assignment of a substantial portion of the assets for the benefit of
creditors by the other Party; provided, however, that in the case of any
involuntary bankruptcy proceeding such right to terminate will only become
effective if the Party consents to the involuntary bankruptcy or such proceeding
is not dismissed within [***] after the filing thereof. In the event of any
termination pursuant to this Section 12.3 (Termination for Insolvency):

40

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

12.3.1All rights and licenses now or hereafter granted by either Party (the
“Bankrupt Party”) to the other Party under or pursuant to this Agreement are,
for all purposes of Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, licenses of
rights to “intellectual property” as defined in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Upon
the filing or institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, or
receivership proceedings, upon the appointment of a receiver or trustee over all
or substantially all property, or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of
the assets for the benefit of creditors by the Bankrupt Party, the Bankrupt
Party agrees that the other Party, as licensee of such rights under this
Agreement, will retain and may fully exercise all of its rights and elections
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Bankrupt Party will, during the Term, create
and maintain current copies or, if not amenable to copying, detailed
descriptions or other appropriate embodiments, to the extent feasible, of all
intellectual property rights licensed under this Agreement. Each Party
acknowledges and agrees that “embodiments” of intellectual property rights
within the meaning of Section 365(n) include laboratory notebooks, cell lines,
product samples, and inventory, research studies and data, all Regulatory
Approvals (and all applications for Regulatory Approval) and rights of reference
therein, the Assigned Patent Rights, Licensed Technology, Results, and all
information related to the Licensed Technology. If (A) a case under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code is commenced by or against the Bankrupt Party, (B) this
Agreement is rejected as provided in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and (C) the other
Party elects to retain its rights hereunder as provided in Section 365(n) of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Bankrupt Party (in any capacity, including
debtor-in-possession) and its successors and assigns (including a trustee) will:

(a)provide the other Party with all such intellectual property rights (including
all embodiments thereof) held by the Bankrupt Party and such successors and
assigns, or otherwise available to them, immediately upon the other Party’s
written request. Whenever the Bankrupt Party or any of its successors or assigns
provides to the other Party any of the intellectual property rights licensed
hereunder (or any embodiment thereof) pursuant to this Section 12.3 (Termination
for Insolvency), the other Party will have the right to perform the Bankrupt
Party obligations hereunder with respect to such intellectual property rights,
but neither such provision nor such performance by the other Party will release
the Bankrupt Party from liability resulting from rejection of the license or the
failure to perform such obligations; and

(b)not interfere with the other Party’s rights under this Agreement, or any
agreement supplemental hereto, to such intellectual property rights (including
such embodiments), including any right to obtain such intellectual property
rights (or such embodiments) from another entity, to the extent provided in
Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

12.3.2All rights, powers, and remedies of the other Party provided in this
Section 12.3 (Termination for Insolvency) are in addition to and not in
substitution for any other rights, powers, and remedies now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity (including the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) in the event
of the commencement of a case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code with respect to the
Bankrupt Party. The Parties intend the following rights to extend to the maximum
extent permitted by Applicable Law, and to be enforceable under Section 365(n)
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code:

(a)the right of access to any intellectual property rights (and all embodiments
thereof) of the Bankrupt Party, or any Third Party with whom the Bankrupt Party
contracts to perform any obligation of the Bankrupt Party under this Agreement,
and, in the case of any such Third Party, that is necessary for the Exploitation
of Compounds or Products; and

(b)the right to contract directly with any Third Party to complete the
contracted work.

41

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

12.4Termination for Convenience. Biogen will be entitled to terminate this
Agreement, in whole or with respect to one or more Compounds or Products, at its
sole discretion at any time upon 60 days’ prior written notice to Catalyst.

12.5Effects of Termination.

12.5.1Generally. Upon early termination of the Agreement in whole or with
respect to one or more Compounds or Products:

(a)Except as provided in Section 12.5.3 (Right of Reversion), the Receiving
Party will promptly return to the other Party or destroy all Confidential
Information of the other Party (or, in the case of partial termination, all such
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party that is related solely to the
terminated Compound or Product) in accordance with Section 9.3 (Return of
Confidential Information).

(b)Effective as of the effective date of termination by Catalyst pursuant to
Section 12.2.2 (By Catalyst) or Section 12.3 (Termination for Insolvency) or a
termination by Biogen pursuant to Section 12.4 (Termination for Convenience),
[***].

(c)All licenses granted by a Party to the other Party under this Agreement with
respect to any terminated Compound or Product will immediately terminate (except
for any licenses which are perpetually granted).

(d)Notwithstanding subsection 12.5.1(c), Biogen, its Affiliates and Sublicensees
shall have the right to continue to sell their existing inventories of Products
for a period not to exceed [***] after the effective date of such termination,
provided that Catalyst is paid royalties with respect thereto, to the extent
entitled, in accordance with ARTICLE 7 (Payments and Royalties).

(e)[***]

(f)[***]

12.5.2Knowledge Transfer. If this Agreement is terminated by Biogen pursuant to
Section 12.2.1 (By Biogen) or Section 12.3 (Termination for Insolvency), then to
the extent not already provided pursuant to Section 5.1 (Technology Transfer) or
Section 6.3 (Manufacturing Technology Transfer) by the effective date of
termination of this Agreement, Catalyst will promptly transfer to Biogen, on a
Product-by-Product basis, all Results and Deliverables, the costs of which
transfer will be borne [***].

12.5.3Right of Reversion. [***]

12.6Alternative Remedy in Lieu of Termination. If Biogen has the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.2.1 (By Biogen), then in
addition to any other remedies available to Biogen at law or in equity, in lieu
of terminating this Agreement Biogen may, in its sole discretion, exercise an
alternative remedy as follows: [***]

12.7Rights Accruing Prior to Expiration or Termination. Except as set forth in
Section [***] above, expiration or termination of this Agreement will not
relieve the Parties of any obligation accruing prior to such expiration or
termination. Except as set forth in Section [***] above, any expiration or
termination of this Agreement will be without prejudice to the rights of either
Party against the other accrued or accruing under this Agreement prior to
expiration or termination, including any payment obligation that accrued prior
to the effective date of such expiration or termination.

42

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

12.8Survival. The following provisions, as well as any other provisions which
expressly or by their nature are intended to survive termination or expiration,
will survive termination or expiration of this Agreement: ARTICLE 9
(Confidentiality) (but if a time period for survival is specified therein, then
only for such time period) but excluding Section 9.8 (Publications); ARTICLE 11
(Indemnification; Insurance); ARTICLE 13 (Miscellaneous); and Sections 2.3 (No
Implied Licenses); 7.2 (Reimbursement of Research Costs) solely with respect to
costs and expenses incurred prior to the effective date of termination; 7.5

ARTICLE 13
MISCELLANEOUS

13.1Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any interest hereunder will be
assignable by Catalyst without the prior written consent of Biogen, except as
follows: (a) Catalyst may, subject to the terms of this Agreement, assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement in whole to its
successor-in-interest in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of
its assets to which this Agreement relates, whether in a merger, acquisition, or
similar transaction or series of related transactions, provided that such sale
is not primarily for the benefit of its creditors, and (b) Catalyst may assign
its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates,
provided that Catalyst will remain liable for all of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement. Biogen may freely assign this Agreement or any interest
hereunder in whole or in part, provided that Biogen will remain liable for all
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement. Each Party will promptly
notify the other Party of any assignment or transfer under the provisions of
this Section 13.1 (Assignment), other than in the case of Biogen, any such
assignment or transfer to an Affiliate thereof. This Agreement will be binding
upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Parties and the name of a Party
appearing herein will be deemed to include the names of such Party’s successors
and permitted assigns to the extent necessary to carry out the intent of this
Agreement. Any assignment not in accordance with this Section 13.1 (Assignment)
will be null, void, and of no legal effect.

13.2Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement
between the Parties and supersedes all previous and contemporaneous
negotiations, representations, or agreements, written or oral, regarding the
subject matter hereof, and any other express or implied agreements and
understandings, negotiations, writings and commitments, either oral or written,
with respect to the subject matter hereof, including the Confidentiality
Agreement, are superseded by the terms of this Agreement. This Agreement may be
amended only by an instrument in writing duly executed on behalf of the Parties.

13.3Force Majeure. Neither Party will be liable or deemed in default for failure
to perform any duty or obligation that such Party may have under this Agreement
where such failure has been occasioned by any act of God, fires, earthquakes,
strikes and labor disputes, acts of war, terrorism, civil unrest, or
intervention of any Governmental Authority, and occurring without its fault or
negligence; provided that the Party affected will promptly notify the other of
the force majeure condition and will exert all reasonable efforts to eliminate,
cure, or overcome any such causes and to resume performance of its obligations
as soon as possible.

13.4Waiver; Remedies not Exclusive. The failure of either Party to require
performance by the other Party of any of that other Party’s obligations under
this Agreement will in no manner affect the right of such Party to enforce the
same at a later time. No waiver by any Party of any condition, or of the breach
of any provision, term, representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
will be deemed to be or construed as a further or continuing waiver of any such
condition or breach, or of any other condition or

43

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

of the breach of any other provision, term, representation, or warranty hereof.
Except as set forth in Section [***] above, the remedies provided in this
Agreement are not exclusive and the Party suffering from a breach or default of
this Agreement may pursue all other remedies, both legal and equitable,
alternatively, or cumulatively.

13.5Severability. If any provision or portion thereof in this Agreement is for
any reason held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, then the same will not
affect any other portion of this Agreement and its validity, as it is the intent
of the Parties that this Agreement will be construed in such fashion as to
maintain its existence, validity, and enforceability to the greatest extent
possible. In any such event, this Agreement will be construed as if such
provision or portion thereof had never been contained in this Agreement, and
there will be deemed substituted therefore such provision as will most nearly
carry out the intent of the Parties as expressed in this Agreement to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law unless doing so would have the effect
of materially altering the rights and obligations of the Parties in which event
this Agreement may be terminated by mutual written agreement of the Parties.

13.6Notices. All notices that are required or permitted hereunder will be in

application as below, will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the
substantive laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law
principles thereof. Any legal action related to the scope and validity of any
patent or patent application relating to this Agreement brought by the Parties
hereto may be conducted in any appropriate forum under the applicable laws of
the country of such patent or patent application.

13.8Dispute Resolution.

13.8.1Escalation. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement (except for disputes arising at the JSC, which will be resolved
pursuant to Section 4.2.4 (Decision Making Authority)) will be settled, if
possible, through good faith negotiations between the Parties. If the Parties
are unable to settle such dispute within [***] after first considering such
dispute, then such dispute will be referred to the Parties’ respective Executive
Officers. The Executive Officers of both Parties will in good faith attempt to
resolve such dispute. Such resolution, if any, of a referred issue will be final
and binding on the Parties. All negotiations pursuant to this Section 13.8
(Dispute Resolution) are confidential and will be treated as compromise and
settlement negotiations for purposes of applicable rules of evidence. If the
Executive Officers cannot resolve such dispute within [***] after referral of
such dispute to the Executive Officers, then either Party will have the right to
pursue any and all remedies available at law or equity, consistent with Section
13.8.2 (Jurisdiction; Venue). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Parties will be entitled to seek equitable relief, including
injunction or specific performance, as a remedy for any breach or threatened
breach of this Agreement, in any court having jurisdiction and without first
having complied with the procedures set forth in this Section 13.8 (Dispute
Resolution). Such remedies will not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a
breach (or threatened breach) of this Agreement but will be in addition to all
other remedies available at law or equity. Neither Party will raise as a defense
or objection to the request or granting of such relief that any breach of this
Agreement is or would be compensable by an award of money damages.

13.8.2Jurisdiction; Venue. Subject to the last sentence in Section 13.7
(Governing Law), each Party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the federal courts (or if such courts do not have subject matter jurisdiction,
the state courts) sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, for the
purposes of any suit, action, or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement
or out of any transaction contemplated hereby. Each Party agrees to commence any
such action, suit, or proceeding in such federal courts (or if such courts do
not have subject matter jurisdiction, the state courts). Each Party irrevocably
and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit, or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in such courts, and hereby and thereby further irrevocably
and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court
that any such action, suit, or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Party irrevocably consents to service of
process in the manner provided under Section 13.6 (Notices) or by first class
certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid. THE PARTIES
EXPRESSLY, IRREVOCABLY, AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE AND FOREGO ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY.
