infringements or conflicts (if the subject of any unfavorable decision, ruling
or finding) or invalidities or inadequacies, singly or in the aggregate, would
result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(gg) Possession of Licenses and Permits. Each of the Partnership Parties
possesses such permits, licenses, approvals, consents and other authorizations
(collectively, “Governmental Licenses”) issued by the appropriate Governmental
Entities necessary to conduct the business now operated by them, except for any

is in compliance with the terms and conditions of all Governmental Licenses,
except for any failures to comply that would not, singly or in the aggregate,
result in a Material Adverse Effect. All of the Governmental Licenses are valid

Material Adverse Effect.

as may be necessary or appropriate to conduct its business as now conducted and
at a cost that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect. None of the

Memorandum, there has been no storage, generation, transportation, use,

omissions any of the Partnership Entities is or could reasonably be expected to
be liable) at, on, under or from any property or facility now or previously
owned, operated or leased by any of the Partnership Entities, or at, on, under
or from any other property or facility, in violation of any Environmental Laws
or in a manner or amount or to a location that could reasonably be expected to
result in any liability under any Environmental Law, except for any violations
or liabilities that would not, singly or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(uu) Review of Environmental Laws. In the ordinary course of business, the
Partnership Entities conduct a periodic review of the effect of Environmental
Laws on the business, operations and properties of the Partnership Entities, in
the course of which they identify and evaluate associated costs and liabilities
(including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required
for clean-up, closure of properties or compliance with Environmental Laws, or
any permit, license or approval, any related constraints on operating activities
and any potential liabilities to third parties). On the basis of such review,
the Partnership Entities have concluded that such associated costs and
liabilities would not, singly or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect, except as described in or contemplated in the Offering Memorandum.

(vv) Compliance with ERISA. (i) Each employee benefit plan, within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended (“ERISA”), for which Sunoco or any member of its “Controlled Group”
(defined as any organization which is a member of a controlled group of
corporations within the meaning of Section 414 of the Internal Revenue Code (the
“Code”)) would have any liability (each, a “Plan”) has been maintained in
compliance with its terms and the requirements of any applicable statutes,
orders, rules and regulations, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code,
except for any instances of noncompliance that would not, singly or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;
(ii) no prohibited transaction, within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, has occurred with respect to any Plan, excluding
transactions effected pursuant to a statutory or administrative exemption, that
would result in a Material Adverse Effect; (iii) for each Plan that is subject

minimum funding standard of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, as
applicable, has been satisfied (without taking into account any waiver thereof
or extension of any amortization period) and is reasonably expected to be
satisfied in the future (without taking into account any waiver thereof or
extension of any amortization period); (iv) the fair market value of the assets
of each Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA (other than a “multiemployer
plan”)

 

16



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

exceeds the present value of all benefits accrued under such Plan (determined
based on those assumptions used to fund such Plan); (v) no “reportable event”
(within the meaning of Section 4043(c) of ERISA) has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur that either has resulted, or would result, in a Material

reasonably likely to occur: (1) an increase in the aggregate amount of

directors or officers of any Partnership Party or their respective family
members.

of Sunoco, any director, officer, agent, employee, Affiliate or other person
acting on behalf of or providing services to any Partnership Party is aware of
or has taken any action, directly or indirectly, that would result in a
violation by such persons of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as
amended (the “FCPA”), and any other applicable anti-bribery laws and the rules
and regulations thereunder, including, without limitation, making use of the
mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in
furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay or authorization of the payment
of any money, or other property, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the
giving of anything of value to any “foreign official” (as such term is defined
in the FCPA) or any foreign political party or official thereof or any candidate
for foreign political office, in contravention of the FCPA; and the Partnership
Entities and, to the knowledge of Sunoco, their Affiliates have conducted their
businesses in compliance with the FCPA and have instituted and maintain policies

any other manner that will result in a violation by any Person (including any
Person participating in the transaction, whether as initial purchaser, advisor,
investor or otherwise) of Sanctions.

the proposed amendment or supplement at least two business days prior to the
proposed use or filing, and shall not have objected to such amendment or
supplement. Before making, preparing, using, authorizing, approving or
distributing any Additional Written Communication, the Issuers will furnish to
the Representatives a copy of such written communication for review and will not
make, prepare, use, authorize, approve or distribute any such written
communication to which the Representatives reasonably object.

(b) Amendments and Supplements to the Final Offering Memorandum and Other
Securities Act Matters. If at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) any event
shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which any of the Pricing
Disclosure Package as then amended or supplemented would include any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading or (ii) it is necessary to amend or
supplement any of the Pricing Disclosure Package to comply with law, the
Partnership Parties will immediately notify the Initial Purchasers thereof and
forthwith prepare and (subject to Section 3(a) hereof) furnish to the Initial
Purchasers such amendments or supplements to any of the Pricing Disclosure
Package as may be necessary so that the statements in any of the Pricing
Disclosure Package as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, be misleading or so that any of the
Pricing Disclosure Package will comply with all applicable law. If, prior to the
completion of the placement of the Securities by the Initial Purchasers with the
Subsequent Purchasers, any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of
which it is necessary to amend or supplement the Final Offering Memorandum, as
then amended or supplemented, in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances when the Final Offering Memorandum is delivered to a
Subsequent Purchaser, not misleading, or if in the judgment of the
Representatives or counsel for the Initial Purchasers it is otherwise necessary
to amend or supplement the Final Offering Memorandum to comply with law, the
Partnership Parties agree to promptly prepare (subject to Section 3 hereof),
file with the Commission and furnish at their own expense to the Initial
Purchasers, amendments or supplements to the Final Offering Memorandum so that
the statements in the Final Offering Memorandum as so amended or supplemented
will not, in the light of the circumstances at the Closing Date and at the time
of sale of Securities, be misleading or so that the Final Offering Memorandum,
as amended or supplemented, will comply with all applicable law.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following the consummation of the Exchange Offer or the effectiveness of an
applicable shelf registration statement and for so long as the Securities are
outstanding, if, in the judgment of the Representatives, the Initial Purchasers
or any of their Affiliates are required to deliver a prospectus in connection
with sales of, or market-making activities with respect to, the Securities, the
Partnership Parties agree to periodically amend the applicable registration
statement so that the information contained therein complies with the
requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act, to amend the applicable
registration statement or supplement the related prospectus or the documents
incorporated therein when necessary to reflect any material changes in the
information provided therein so that the registration statement and the
prospectus will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances existing as of the date the prospectus is so
delivered, not misleading and to provide the Initial Purchasers with copies of
each amendment or supplement filed and such other documents as the Initial
Purchasers may reasonably request.

The Issuers hereby expressly acknowledge that the indemnification and
contribution provisions of Sections 8 and 9 hereof are specifically applicable
and relate to each offering memorandum, registration statement, prospectus,
amendment or supplement referred to in this Section 3.

(c) Copies of the Offering Memorandum. The Issuers agree to furnish the Initial
Purchasers, without charge, as many copies of the Pricing Disclosure Package and

with the Representatives and counsel for the Initial Purchasers to qualify or

part of the Securities for offer and sale under the securities laws of the
several states of the United States or any other jurisdictions designated by the
Representatives, shall comply with such laws and shall continue such
qualifications, registrations and exemptions in effect so long as required for
the distribution of the Securities. None of the Partnership Parties shall be
required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to take any action that would
subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is
not presently qualified or where it would be subject to taxation as a foreign
corporation. The Issuers will advise the Representatives promptly of the
suspension of the qualification or registration of (or any such exemption
relating to) the Securities for offering, sale or trading in any jurisdiction or
any initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such purpose, and in the
event of the issuance of any order suspending such qualification, registration
or exemption, each of the Partnership Parties shall use its best efforts to
obtain the withdrawal thereof at the earliest possible moment.

the Securities sold by them in the manner described under the caption “Use of
Proceeds” in the Pricing Disclosure Package.

Additionally, at any time when the Issuers are not subject to Sections 13 or 15
of the Exchange Act, for the benefit of holders and beneficial owners from time
to time of the Securities, the Issuers shall furnish, at their expense, upon
request, to holders and beneficial owners of Securities and prospective
purchasers of Securities information (“Additional Issuer Information”)
satisfying the requirements of Rule 144A(d).

(h) Agreement Not To Offer or Sell Additional Securities. During the period of
45 days following the date hereof, the Issuers will not, without the prior

equivalent position” within the meaning of Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act, or
otherwise dispose of or transfer, or announce the offering of, or file any
registration statement under the Securities Act in respect of, any debt

debt securities of the Issuers (other than (i) as contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) Sunoco’s universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3, and
(iii) to register the Exchange Securities).

(i) No Integration. Each of the Issuers agrees that it will not and will cause
its Affiliates not to make any offer or sale of securities of the Issuers of any

purpose of (i) the sale of the Securities by the Issuers to the Initial
Purchasers, (ii) the resale of the Securities by the Initial Purchasers to
Subsequent Purchasers or (iii) the resale of the Securities by such Subsequent
Purchasers to others) the exemption from the registration requirements of the

agrees that it will not and will not permit any of its respective Affiliates or
any other person acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial
Purchasers, as to which no covenant is given) to (i) solicit offers for, or
offer or sell, the Securities by means of any form of general solicitation or
general advertising within the meaning of Rule 502(c) of Regulation D or in any
manner involving a public offering within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) of the
Securities Act or (ii) engage in any directed selling efforts with respect to
the Securities within the meaning of Regulation S, and the Issuers will and will
cause all such persons to comply with the offering restrictions requirement of
Regulation S with respect to the Securities.

(k) No Restricted Resales. Until the date on which all registration statements
required to be filed pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement shall become

Following the sale of the Securities by the Initial Purchasers to Subsequent
Purchasers pursuant to the terms hereof, the Initial Purchasers shall not be
liable or responsible to the Issuers for any losses, damages or liabilities
suffered or incurred by the Issuers, including any losses, damages or
liabilities under the Securities Act, arising from or relating to any resale or
transfer of any Security.

SECTION 8. Indemnification.

(a) Indemnification of the Initial Purchasers. Each of the Partnership Parties,
jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial
Purchaser, its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, selling agents and
each person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser within the meaning of
the Securities Act and the Exchange Act against any loss, claim, damage,
liability or expense, as incurred, to which the Initial Purchaser, Affiliate,
director, officer, employee, selling agent or controlling person may become
subject, under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state
statutory law or regulation, or at common law or otherwise (including in
settlement of any litigation, if such settlement is effected with the written
consent of Sunoco or as otherwise permitted by Section 8(d) hereof), insofar as
such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as
contemplated below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary
Offering Memorandum, the Pricing Supplement, any Additional Written
Communication or the Final Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement
thereto), including the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading; and to reimburse each Initial Purchaser and each such Affiliate,
director, officer, employee, selling agent or controlling person for any and all
expenses (including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the
Representatives) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by such Initial
Purchaser or such Affiliate, director, officer, employee, selling agent or
controlling person in connection with investigating, defending, settling,
compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage, liability, expense or
action; provided, however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement shall not
apply, with respect to an Initial Purchaser, to any loss, claim, damage,
liability or expense to the extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or
based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or

 

27



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Issuers by such Initial Purchaser through
the Representatives expressly for use in the Pricing Disclosure Package, any
Additional Written Communication or the Final Offering Memorandum (or any
amendment or supplement thereto), which information consists solely of the
information specified in the penultimate sentence of Section 8(b) hereof. The
indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(a) shall be in addition to any
liabilities that the Partnership Parties may otherwise have.

(b) Indemnification of the Issuers and the Guarantors. Each Initial Purchaser
agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless the
Partnership Parties, each of their respective directors, officers and each
person, if any, who controls the Partnership Parties within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any loss, claim, damage, liability
or expense, as incurred, to which the Partnership Parties or any such director,
officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, or other federal or state statutory law or regulation, or at
common law or otherwise (including in settlement of any litigation, if such
settlement is effected with the written consent of such Initial Purchaser or as
otherwise permitted by Section 8(d) hereof), insofar as such loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense (or actions in respect thereof as contemplated
below) arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum,
the Pricing Supplement, any Additional Written Communication or the Final
Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto), or the omission or
alleged omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that
such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission was made in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Pricing
Supplement, any Additional Written Communication or the Final Offering
Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement thereto), in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Issuers by such Initial
Purchaser through the Representatives expressly for use therein; and to
reimburse the Partnership Parties and each such director, officer or controlling
person for any and all expenses (including the fees and disbursements of
counsel) as such expenses are reasonably incurred by the Partnership Parties or
such director, officer or controlling person in connection with investigating,
defending, settling, compromising or paying any such loss, claim, damage,
liability, expense or action. Each of the Partnership Parties hereby
acknowledges that the only information that the Initial Purchasers through the
Representatives have furnished to the Issuers expressly for use in the
Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the Pricing Supplement, any Additional Written
Communication or the Final Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) are the statements set forth in “Plan of Distribution—Commissions and
Discounts,” the third and fourth sentences under the captions “Plan of
Distribution—New Issue of Notes” and in “Plan of Distribution—Short Positions”
in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Final Offering Memorandum. The
indemnity agreement set forth in this Section 8(b) shall be in addition to any
liabilities that each Initial Purchaser may otherwise have.

 

28



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c) Notifications and Other Indemnification Procedures. Promptly after receipt
by an indemnified party under this Section 8 of notice of the commencement of
any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be
made against an indemnifying party under this Section 8, notify the indemnifying
party in writing of the commencement thereof; provided that the failure to so
notify the indemnifying party will not relieve it from any liability which it
may have to any indemnified party under this Section 8 except to the extent that
it has been materially prejudiced by such failure (through the forfeiture of
substantive rights and defenses) and shall not relieve the indemnifying party
from any liability that the indemnifying party may have to an indemnified party
other than under this Section 8. In case any such action is brought against any
indemnified party and such indemnified party seeks or intends to seek indemnity
from an indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will be entitled to
participate in and, to the extent that it shall elect, jointly with all other
indemnifying parties similarly notified, by written notice delivered to the
indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such
indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided, however, if the defendants in
any such action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party
and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that a conflict may
arise between the positions of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party
in conducting the defense of any such action or that there may be legal defenses
available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different from or
additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party
or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assume such legal
defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on behalf of
such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the indemnifying
party to such indemnified party of such indemnifying party’s election so to
assume the defense of such action and approval by the indemnified party of
counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party
under this Section 8 for any legal counsel or other expenses subsequently
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless
(i) the indemnified party shall have employed separate counsel in accordance
with the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence (it being understood,
however, that the indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of
more than one separate counsel (together with local counsel (in each
jurisdiction)), which shall be selected by the Representatives (in the case of
counsel representing the Initial Purchasers or their related persons),
representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action) or (ii) the
indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the
indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time
after notice of commencement of the action, in each of which cases the fees and
expenses of counsel shall be at the expense of the indemnifying party.

(d) Settlements. The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable
for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which
will not be unreasonably withheld, but if settled with such consent or if there
be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to
indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or
expense by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an
indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for fees and expenses of
counsel as contemplated by this Section 8, the indemnifying party agrees that it
shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its
written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 60 days after
receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request, (ii) such
indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance
with such request prior to the date of such settlement and (iii) such

 

29



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

indemnified party shall have given the indemnifying party at least 60 days prior
notice of its intention to settle. No indemnifying party shall, without the
prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement,
compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened
action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could
have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such
indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an
unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims
that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not
include any statements as to or any findings of fault, culpability or failure to
act by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

SECTION 9. Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof
is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold
harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as
incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses
referred to therein (a) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by the Partnership Parties, on the one hand, and the
Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities
pursuant to this Agreement or (b) if the allocation provided by clause (a) above
is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (a) above but also
the relative fault of the Partnership Parties, on the one hand, and the Initial
Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions
that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well
as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received
by the Partnership Parties, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the
other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this
Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total
net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement
(before deducting expenses) received by the Issuers, and the total discount
received by the Initial Purchasers bear to the aggregate initial offering price
of the Securities. The relative fault of the Partnership Parties, on the one
hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material
fact relates to information supplied by the Partnership Parties, on the one
hand, or the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the parties’ relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission.

The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include,
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8 hereof, any legal or other
fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with
investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in
Section 8 hereof with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall
apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 9; provided,
however, that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action
for which notice has been given under Section 8 hereof for purposes of
indemnification.

The Partnership Parties and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by
pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity
for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9.

 

30



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Initial Purchaser shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the discount received by such
Initial Purchaser in connection with the Securities distributed by it. No person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Initial Purchasers’ respective
obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint,
in proportion to their respective commitments as set forth opposite their names
in Schedule A hereto. For purposes of this Section 9, each Affiliate, director,
officer, employee and selling agent of an Initial Purchaser and each person, if
any, who controls an Initial Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial
Purchaser, and each director and officer of the Partnership Parties, and each
person, if any, who controls the Partnership Parties within the meaning of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution
as the Partnership Parties.

SECTION 10. Termination of this Agreement. Prior to the Closing Date, this
Agreement may be terminated by the Representatives by notice given to Sunoco if
at any time: (a) (i) trading or quotation in any of Sunoco’s securities shall
have been suspended or limited by the Commission or by The New York Stock
Exchange (“NYSE”), or (ii) trading in securities generally on either the Nasdaq
Stock Market or the NYSE shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or
maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such quotation
system or stock exchange by the Commission or the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, Inc.; (b) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by
any of federal, New York or Delaware State authorities; (c) there shall have
occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or
any crisis or calamity, or any change in the United States or international
financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a
prospective substantial change in United States’ or international political,
financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the Representatives is
material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with
the offering sale or delivery of the Securities in the manner and on the terms
described in the Pricing Disclosure Package or to enforce contracts for the sale
of Securities. Any termination pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without
liability on the part of (i) the Partnership Parties to any Initial Purchaser,
except that the Partnership Parties shall be obligated to reimburse the expenses
of the Initial Purchasers pursuant to Sections 4 and 6 hereof, (ii) any Initial
Purchaser to the Partnership Parties, or (iii) any party hereto to any other
party except that the provisions of Sections 8 and 9 hereof shall at all times
be effective and shall survive such termination.

SECTION 11. Representations and Indemnities to Survive Delivery. The respective
indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the
Partnership Parties, their respective officers and the several Initial
Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any
Initial Purchaser, the Partnership Parties or any of their partners, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, selling agents or any controlling person
referred to in Section 8 above, as the case may be, and will survive delivery of
and payment for the Securities sold hereunder and any termination of this
Agreement.

SECTION 14. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the parties hereto, and to the benefit of the indemnified parties
referred to in Sections 8 and 9 hereof, and in each case their respective
successors, and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder. The

of the Securities as such from any of the Initial Purchasers merely by reason of
such purchase.

SECTION 15. Authority of the Representatives. Any action by the Initial
Purchasers hereunder may be taken by the Representatives on behalf of the
Initial Purchasers, and any such action taken by the Representatives shall be
binding upon the Initial Purchasers.

SECTION 16. Partial Unenforceability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
section, paragraph or provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity
or enforceability of any other section, paragraph or provision hereof. If any
section, paragraph or provision of this Agreement is for any reason determined
to be invalid or unenforceable, there shall be deemed to be made such minor
changes (and only such minor changes) as are necessary to make it valid and
enforceable.

SECTION 17. Governing Law Provisions. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK
APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE WITHOUT REGARD
TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF. Any legal suit, action or proceeding
arising out of or based upon this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (“Related Proceedings”) may be instituted in the federal courts of the
United States of America located in the City and County of New York or the
courts of the State of New York in each case located in the City and County of
New York (collectively, the “Specified Courts”), and each party irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction (except for suits, actions, or proceedings
instituted in regard to the enforcement of a judgment of any Specified Court in
a Related Proceeding a related judgment, as to which such jurisdiction is
non-exclusive) of the Specified Courts in any Related Proceeding. Service of any
process, summons, notice or document by mail to such party’s address set forth
above shall be effective service of process for any Related Proceeding brought
in any Specified Court. The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any
objection to the laying of venue of any Related Proceedings in the Specified
Courts and irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree not to plead or claim
in any Specified Court that any Related Proceedings brought in any Specified

SECTION 18. Default of One or More of the Several Initial Purchasers. If any one
or more of the several Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase
Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on the Closing
Date, and the aggregate principal amount of Securities which such defaulting
Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase
does not exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities to be
purchased on such date, the other Initial Purchasers shall be obligated,
severally, in the proportions that the principal amount of Securities set forth
opposite their respective names on Schedule A hereto bears to the aggregate
principal amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such
non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or in such other proportions as may be
specified by the Initial Purchasers with the consent of the non-defaulting
Initial Purchasers, to

 

33



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

purchase the Securities which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial
Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the Closing Date. If any
one or more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase
Securities and the aggregate principal amount of Securities with respect to
which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate principal amount of
Securities to be purchased on the Closing Date, and arrangements satisfactory to
the Initial Purchasers for the purchase of such Securities are not made within
48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of
any party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8 and
9 hereof shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. In
any such case the Initial Purchasers shall have the right to postpone the
Closing Date, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days in
order that the required changes, if any, to the Final Offering Memorandum or any
other documents or arrangements may be effected.

As used in this Agreement, the term “Initial Purchaser” shall be deemed to
include any person substituted for a defaulting Initial Purchaser under this
Section 18. Any action taken under this Section 18 shall not relieve any
defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of any default of such
Initial Purchaser under this Agreement.

SECTION 19. No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. Each of the Partnership
Parties acknowledges and agrees that: (a) the purchase and sale of the
Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the
offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is
an arm’s-length commercial transaction between the Partnership Parties, on the
one hand, and the several Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the
Partnership Parties are capable of evaluating and understanding and understand
and accept the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (b) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and
the process leading to such transaction each Initial Purchaser is and has been
acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the
Partnership Parties or their respective Affiliates, members, limited partners,
stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party; (c) no Initial
Purchaser has assumed or will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in
favor of the Partnership Parties with respect to any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such
Initial Purchaser has advised or is currently advising the Partnership Parties
on other matters) or any other obligation to the Partnership Parties except the
obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (d) the several Initial
Purchasers and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of
transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Partnership
Parties, and the several Initial Purchasers have no obligation to disclose any
of such interests by virtue of any fiduciary or advisory relationship; and
(e) the Initial Purchasers have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory
or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby, and the
Partnership Parties have consulted their own legal, accounting, regulatory and
tax advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate.

This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether
written or oral) between the Partnership Parties and the several Initial
Purchasers, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof. The
Partnership Parties hereby waive and release, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any claims that the Partnership Parties may have against the several
Initial Purchasers with respect to any breach or alleged breach of fiduciary
duty.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 20. Recognition of the U.S. Special Resolution Regimes.

(a) In the event that any Initial Purchaser that is a Covered Entity becomes
subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer
from such Initial Purchaser of this Agreement, and any interest and obligation
in or under this Agreement, will be effective to the same extent as the transfer
would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Agreement,
and any such interest and obligation, were governed by the laws of the United
States or a state of the United States.

(b) In the event that any Initial Purchaser that is a Covered Entity or a BHC
Act Affiliate of such Initial Purchaser becomes subject to a proceeding under a
U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under this Agreement that may be
exercised against such Initial Purchaser are permitted to be exercised to no
greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S.
Special Resolution Regime if this Agreement were governed by the laws of the
United States or a state of the United States.

with, 12 C.F.R. § 47.3(b); or

(iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance
with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b).

applicable.

Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder and (ii) Title II of the

of the parties to this Agreement and supersedes all prior written or oral and
all contemporaneous oral agreements, understandings and negotiations with
respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each one of which shall be an original, with the same effect
as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument. Delivery
of an executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by telecopier,
facsimile or other electronic transmission (i.e., a “pdf” or “tif”) shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart thereof. This Agreement
may not be amended or modified unless in writing by all of the parties hereto,
and no condition herein (express or implied) may be waived unless waived in
writing by each party whom the condition is meant to benefit. The section
headings herein are for the convenience of the parties only and shall not affect
the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

Term Sheet dated November 9, 2020 to the Preliminary Offering Memorandum dated
November 9, 2020. This Term Sheet is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the Preliminary Offering Memorandum. The information in this Term Sheet
supplements the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and supersedes the information
in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum to the extent it is inconsistent with the
information in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum. Capitalized terms used in
this Term Sheet but not defined have the meanings given to them in the
Preliminary Offering Memorandum.

 

Issuers    Sunoco LP and Sunoco Finance Corp. Guarantors    All current
subsidiaries (other than Sunoco Finance Corp.) that guarantee the revolving
credit facility and certain future subsidiaries Trade Date    November 9, 2020

Settlement Date

   November 24, 2020 (T+10). We expect that delivery of the notes will be made
against payment therefor on or about November 24, 2020, which is ten business
days following the date of pricing of the notes. This settlement cycle is
referred to as “T+10.” Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, trades in the secondary market generally are required to
settle in two business days, unless the parties to any such trade expressly
agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade notes on the date of
this offering memorandum or the next seven succeeding business days will be
required, by virtue of the fact that the notes initially will settle T+10, to
specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a
failed settlement. Purchasers of notes who wish to trade notes on the date of
this offering memorandum or the next seven succeeding business days should
consult their own advisor.

Changes to the Preliminary Offering Memorandum

The following changes will be made to the disclosure in the Preliminary Offering
Memorandum:

Offering Size

The Issuers have increased the aggregate principal amount of the notes offering
from $500.0 million to $800.0 million. References in the Preliminary Offering
Memorandum to the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of notes are hereby
amended to reference the issuance of $800.0 million aggregate principal amount
of notes. In connection with the increase in the size of the offering, the
Issuers intend to remove the Tender Cap and seek any and all tender of the
4.875% Senior Notes due 2023. Similar and corresponding changes will be made
wherever applicable to the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, including as
discussed below.

Offering Summary

The last paragraph under the row marked “Ranking” starting on page 5 of the
Preliminary Offering Memorandum and each other location where similar language
and such amounts may appear in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum is replaced
in its entirety with the following:

“As of September 30, 2020, after giving effect to the offering of the notes and
the use of proceeds therefrom as described under “Use of Proceeds,” and assuming
that the Tender Offer is fully subscribed as of the Early Tender Time, we would
have had approximately $3.0 billion of debt outstanding, including approximately
$287.0 million of secured indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility
(excluding approximately $7.9 million of outstanding letters of credit
thereunder), and we would have had approximately $1.2 billion of remaining
borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement.”

 

Exhibit A-3



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXHIBIT A

 

Capitalization

The aggregate principal amount of notes to be issued in the offering increased
from $500.0 million to $800.0 million. The net proceeds received from the
increased amount of the offering of $790.0 million, along with borrowings under
the revolving credit facility, will be used to fund the Tender Offer and, if
applicable, the Partial Redemption, as set forth under “Use of Proceeds” in the
Preliminary Offering Memorandum. Following the increase in the aggregate
principal amount of the notes, the As Adjusted column of the capitalization
table on page 15 of the Preliminary Offering Memorandum is adjusted as follows:
Cash and cash equivalents is $36 million, Revolving credit facility is
$287 million, 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023 is $0, notes offered hereby is
$800.0 million, Total long-term debt (including current maturities and debt
issuance costs) is $2,992 million and Total capitalization is $3,627 million.

All information (including financial information) presented in the Preliminary
Offering Memorandum is deemed to have changed to the extent affected by the
changes described herein.
