equal to the aggregate Liquidation Value of all shares of Series 1 Preferred

of their ownership thereof. If upon any Liquidation the remaining assets of the
Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient
to pay the holders of shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock and the holders of any
Liquidation Parity Stock the full preferential amount to which they are
entitled, (i) the holders of shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock and the holders
of any Liquidation Parity Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the
Liquidation Proceeds in proportion to the respective full preferential amounts
which would otherwise be payable to a holder of shares of Series 1 Preferred
Stock or Liquidation Parity Stock in respect of such shares if all preferential
amounts payable on or with respect to such shares in a Liquidation were paid in
full, and (ii) the Corporation shall not make or agree to make any payments to
the holders of Liquidation Junior Stock. In the event of a Liquidation prior to
the Mandatory Conversion Date, in addition to and after payment in full of all
preferential amounts required to be paid to the holders of Series 1 Preferred
Stock upon a Liquidation prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date under the
foregoing provisions of this Section 5(a), the holders of shares of Series 1
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to participate with the
holders of shares of Liquidation Junior Stock then outstanding, pro rata as a
single class based on the number of outstanding shares of Liquidation Junior
Stock on an as-converted into Common Stock basis held by each holder as of
immediately prior to the Liquidation, in the distribution of all the remaining
Liquidation Proceeds available for distribution to its stockholders.

(b) After the Mandatory Conversion Date. In the event of a Liquidation, after
the Mandatory Conversion Date, for so long as any shares of Series 1 Preferred
Stock shall be outstanding, the holders of shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock
then outstanding shall be entitled to participate with the holders of shares of
Liquidation Junior Stock then outstanding, pro rata as a single class based on
the number of outstanding shares of Liquidation Junior Stock on an as-converted
into Common Stock basis held by each holder as of immediately prior to the
Liquidation, in the distribution of all the remaining Liquidation Proceeds
available for distribution to its stockholders.

 

(c) Notice of Liquidation. In the event of any Liquidation, the Corporation
shall, within ten (10) days of the date the Board of Directors approves such
action, or no later than twenty (20) days of any stockholders’ meeting called to

1 Preferred Stock written notice of the proposed action. Such written notice
shall describe the material terms and conditions of such proposed action,
including a description of the stock, cash, and property to be received by the
holders of shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock upon consummation of the proposed
action and the date of delivery thereof. If any material change in the facts set
forth in the initial notice shall occur, the Corporation shall promptly give
written notice to each holder of shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock of such
material change. A merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into any
other corporation or other entity, or a sale, lease, exchange, exclusive license
or other disposition of all or any part of the assets of the Corporation and/or
any of its subsidiaries (which shall not in fact result in the Liquidation of
the Corporation and the distribution of assets to its stockholders) shall not be
deemed to be a Liquidation for purposes of this Section 5.

 

Section 6. Redemption. Each outstanding share of Series 1 Preferred Stock shall
be redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Corporation,
exercisable as hereinafter provided in this Section 6, at any time and from time
to time after the first (1st) anniversary of the Original Issue Date and prior
to the Mandatory Conversion Date, provided that any redemption hereunder by the
Corporation as to each holder of Series 1 Preferred Stock shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, be for a number of shares equal to no less
than twenty-five percent (25%) of the number of shares of Series 1 Preferred
Stock originally issued to such holder. Each share of Series 1 Preferred Stock
subject to redemption pursuant to this Section 6 shall be redeemed by the
Corporation in cash at a price per share equal to the Conversion Rate then in
effect multiplied by $13.50, (as adjusted for any for any (A) dividend in
respect of any class or series of stock of the Corporation in shares of Series 1
Preferred Stock, (B) subdivision, whether by reclassification or
recapitalization, of the outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock into a
greater number of shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock, or (C) combination,
whether by reclassification or recapitalization, of the outstanding shares of
Series 1 Preferred Stock into a lesser number of shares of Series 1 Preferred
Stock) (the “Redemption Price”). The Corporation may exercise its option to
redeem all or any portion of the outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Section 6 by delivering a written notice thereof to all, but
not less than all, of the holders of outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred
Stock (such notice, the “Redemption Notice”, and the date on which all such
holders receive such notice, the “Redemption Notice Date”). Each Redemption
Notice shall be irrevocable and shall (a) state the date on which the redemption
shall occur (the “Redemption Date”), which date shall not be less than thirty
(30) days following the Redemption Notice Date, (b) state the aggregate number
of outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock to be redeemed on the
Redemption Date and (c) state the aggregate number of outstanding shares of
Series 1 Preferred Stock to be redeemed from each holder of Series 1 Preferred
Stock (which shall be effected pro rata based on the number of outstanding
shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock held by such holder bears to the number of
outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock held by all holders of Series 1
Preferred Stock). Notwithstanding the receipt of any Redemption Notice, for the
avoidance of doubt, a holder of Series 1 Preferred Stock may convert such
holder’s shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock pursuant
to the terms of Section 7(a) at any time prior to the Redemption Date.

Section 7. Conversion.

 

(a) Optional Conversion. Each outstanding share of Series 1 Preferred Stock
shall be convertible, at any time and from time to time from and after the
Original Issue Date and prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, at the option of
the holder thereof, into that number of shares of Common Stock (subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 7(c)) as is determined by multiplying one (1)
by the Conversion Rate then in effect. Any holder of Series 1 Preferred Stock
desiring to effect such conversion shall deliver to the Corporation a notice of
conversion in the form attached hereto as Annex A (a “Notice of Conversion”),
which Notice of Conversion shall specify the number of shares of Series 1
Preferred Stock to be converted, the number of outstanding shares of Series 1
Preferred Stock held by such holder immediately prior to such conversion, the
number of outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock held by such holder
immediately following such conversion, and, the date on which such conversion is
to be effected, which conversion date shall not be prior to the date on which
the applicable Notice of Conversion is given to the Corporation (the “Optional
Conversion Date”). No ink-original Notice of Conversion shall be required, nor
shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of
any Notice of Conversion be required. The calculations and entries set forth in
a Notice of Conversion shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
control and be conclusive and binding in the absence of manifest or mathematical
error.

 

(b) Mandatory Conversion. On the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Original Issue
Date (the “Mandatory Conversion Date”), each outstanding share of Series 1
Preferred Stock shall automatically convert (subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 7(c)) into that number of shares of Common Stock as is
determined by multiplying one (1) by the Conversion Rate in effect on the
Mandatory Conversion Date (the “Mandatory Conversion”); provided, however, that
to the extent any shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock remain outstanding after
the Mandatory Conversion Date (as a result of the limitations set forth in
Section 7(c)), each outstanding share of Series 1 Preferred Stock shall continue
to be convertible, at any time and from time to time, at the option of the
holder thereof, pursuant to the provisions of this Certificate of Designation
otherwise applicable to the Series 1 Preferred Stock and set forth in Section
7(a).

 

(c) Limitations on the Right to Convert. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, no outstanding share of Series 1 Preferred Stock shall
be converted pursuant to this Section 7 to the extent that, after giving effect
to a conversion pursuant to this Section 7, the holder of such shares of Series
1 Preferred Stock, together with such holder’s Attribution Parties, would, as
determined by such holder, in its sole discretion, and reflected in a written
notice given to the Corporation no later than five (5) days prior to the
Conversion Date (the “Conversion Limitation Determination”), Beneficially Own in
excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. A holder’s submission of a
Conversion Limitation Determination shall be deemed to be such holder’s
determination and representation to the Corporation that the proposed conversion
of the number of outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock set forth in the
Conversion Limitation Determination is consistent with the foregoing sentence,
and such determination shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
be final, binding and conclusive and the Corporation shall have no obligation to
verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination or representation. For
purposes of this Section 7(c), in determining the number of outstanding shares
of Common Stock, a holder of outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock may
rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most
recent of the following: (i) the Corporation’s most recent periodic or annual
report filed with the Commission, as the case may be; (ii) a more recent public
announcement by the Corporation; or (iii) a more recent written notice by the
Corporation or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding.  Upon the written or oral request (which may be via

shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section
7. The Person(s) entitled to receive shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 7
shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder(s) of such shares of

conversion of outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Certificate of Designation shall be made without charge to any holder thereof
for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the

of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any shares of Common
Stock upon the conversion of outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock
pursuant to this Certificate of Designation in a name other than that of the
holder of the outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock converted pursuant
to this Certificate of Designation, and the Corporation shall not be required to
issue or deliver such shares of Common Stock unless or until the Person(s)
requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of
such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation that
such tax has been paid. The Corporation shall pay all Transfer Agent fees
required for same-day processing of any Notice of Conversion or in connection
with the Mandatory Conversion and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or
another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required
for, if applicable, same-day electronic delivery of shares of Common Stock upon
the conversion of outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock pursuant to
this Certificate of Designation.

 

(f) Fractional Shares of Common Stock. The Corporation shall not be obligated to
deliver to the holders of Series 1 Preferred Stock any fraction(s) of a share of

pursuant to this Section 7, the Corporation being entitled to round down to the
nearest whole share of Common Stock if the fraction is less than one-half (0.5)

Stock if the fraction is equal to or greater than one-half (0.5) of one share of
Common Stock.

dividend in respect of any class or series of stock of the Corporation in shares
of Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents (other than a dividend in accordance
with Section 3(b)), (b) subdivide, whether by reclassification or
recapitalization, the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number
of shares of Common Stock, or (c) combine, whether by reclassification or
recapitalization, the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number
of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate and the Voting Rate, in each
case, as in effect immediately prior to the effectiveness of such action shall
be adjusted by multiplying such Conversion Rate or the Voting Rate (as
applicable) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding (including, for this purpose, all shares of Common
Stock then issuable upon the conversion or exercise of all outstanding Common
Stock Equivalents) immediately prior to the effectiveness of such action, and
the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding (including, for this purpose, all shares of Common Stock then
issuable upon the conversion or exercise of all outstanding Common Stock
Equivalents) immediately after the effectiveness of such action. Any adjustment
pursuant to this Section 8 shall be given effect (i) in the case of a dividend
(other than a dividend in accordance with Section 3(b)), upon the payment of
such dividend as of the record date for determining the holders of outstanding
stock entitled to receive such dividend or (ii) in the case of a subdivision or
combination, whether by reclassification or recapitalization, upon the effective
date of such subdivision or combination.

Section 11. Reservation of Shares.

 

(a) The Corporation shall at all times keep reserved, free from preemptive or
subscription rights, out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock,

conversion of Series 1 Preferred Stock as required by this Certificate of
Designation from time to time as shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock are
presented for conversion.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporation shall be entitled to deliver
upon conversion of outstanding shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock pursuant to

Preferred Stock shall be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and

Series 1 Preferred Stock is converted, redeemed, repurchased or otherwise
acquired by the Corporation, in any manner whatsoever, the share of Series 1
Preferred Stock so acquired shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, be retired and cancelled upon such acquisition, and shall not be reissued
as a share of Series 1 Preferred Stock. Any share of Series 1 Preferred Stock so
acquired shall, upon its retirement and cancellation, and upon the taking of any
action required by law, become an authorized but unissued share of Preferred
Stock undesignated as to series and may be reissued a part of a new series of
Preferred Stock, subject to the conditions and restrictions set forth in the
Certificate of Incorporation or imposed by the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware.



 

Section 13. Waiver. The powers (including voting powers), if any, of the Series

special or other rights, if any, and the qualifications, limitations or
restrictions, if any, of the Series 1 Preferred Stock may be waived as to all
shares of Series 1 Preferred Stock in any instance (without the necessity of
calling, noticing or holding a meeting of stockholders) by the written consent
or agreement of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of Series 1
Preferred Stock then outstanding, consenting or agreeing separately as a single
class.”

such Holder in writing, prior to its receipt of such request from such Holder,
of its intention to register securities with the SEC, in which case the request
from such Holder shall be governed by Section 3 hereof, not this Section 2. All
Demands to be made by a Holder pursuant to this Section 2(b) and any
notifications by the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence must be based
upon a good faith intent of such Holder or the Company, as the case may be, to
effect the sale of securities pursuant to such registrations as promptly as
practicable after the date of the Demand or notification, as the case may be, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

(c) After receipt of a Demand from a Holder, the Company shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, but in no event later than ninety (90) days following
such Demand, file and cause to be effective a Registration Statement for the
Registrable Securities so requested to be registered.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company
shall not be required to file a Registration Statement for Registrable
Securities pursuant to a Demand:

 

(i) if the Company shall have previously effected a Demand Registration at any
time during the immediately preceding ninety (90) day period;

 

(ii) if the Company shall have previously effected a registration of Registrable
Securities to be issued and sold by the Company at any time during the
immediately preceding ninety (90) day period (other than a registration on Form
S-4, Form S-8 or Form S-3 (with respect to dividend reinvestment plans and
similar plans) or any successor forms thereto);

 

(iii) during any Blackout Period;

 

(iv) during any Ineligibility Accommodation Period;

 

(v) if the aggregate value of the Registrable Securities to be registered
pursuant to a Demand Registration does not equal at least $2,500,000; or

 

(vi) if the Registrable Securities that are the subject of the Demand are the
subject of an effective Shelf Registration.

 

(e) The Company shall be permitted to satisfy its obligations under this Section
2 by amending (to the extent permitted by applicable law) any Shelf Registration
previously filed by the Company under the Securities Act so that such Shelf
Registration (as amended) shall permit the disposition (in accordance with the
intended methods of disposition specified as aforesaid) of all of the
Registrable Securities for which a Demand shall have been made. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation under this Agreement to file
any Shelf Registration.

 



4

 

 

(f) A requested Demand Registration shall not be deemed to count as a Demand
Registration described in Section 2(d)(ii) hereof if: (i) such registration has
not been declared effective by the SEC or does not become effective in
accordance with the Securities Act, (ii) after becoming effective, such
registration is materially interfered with by any stop order, injunction or
similar order or requirement of the SEC or other governmental agency or court
for any reason not attributable to a Holder and does not thereafter become
effective, (iii) the conditions to closing specified in any underwriting
agreement entered into in connection with such Demand Registration are not
satisfied or waived other than by reason of an act or omission on the part of a
Holder, or (iv) the Holder making a Demand shall have withdrawn its Demand or
otherwise determined not to pursue such registration, provided that, in the case
of this clause (iv), such Holder shall have reimbursed the Company for all of
its out- of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with such Demand.

 

(g) At any time and from time to time that a Registration Statement is
effective, if a Holder of Registrable Securities requests (i) the registration
under the Securities Act of additional Registrable Securities pursuant to such
Registration Statement or (ii) that such Holder be added as a selling
stockholder in such Registration Statement, the Company shall as promptly as
practicable amend or supplement the Registration Statement to cover such
additional Registrable Securities and/or Holder.

 

(h) If the lead managing underwriters of an Underwritten Offering made pursuant
to a Demand shall advise the Holder making a Demand in writing (with a copy to
the Company) that marketing or other factors require a limitation on the number
of shares of Registrable Securities which can be sold in such offering within a
price range acceptable to the Holder, then (i) if the Company shall have elected
to include any securities to be issued and sold by the Company or sold on behalf
of any of the Company’s security holders excluding such Holder (“Other Rights
Holders”) in such Registration Statement, then the Company shall reduce the
number of securities the Company shall intend to issue and sell (and, if
applicable, the number of securities being sold on behalf of the Other Rights
Holders) pursuant to such Registration Statement such that the total number of
securities being sold by each such party shall be equal to the number which can
be sold in such offering within a price range acceptable to such Holder, and
(ii) if the Company shall not have elected to include any securities to be
issued and sold by the Company or sold on behalf of Other Rights Holders in such
Registration Statement or if the reduction referred to in the previous clause
(i) shall not be sufficient, then, the Holder shall reduce the number of
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such offering to the number
that the lead managing underwriter advises can be sold in such offering within a
price range acceptable to the Holder. The Holder shall not be required to reduce
the number of Registrable Securities requested to be included in any such
offering until the number of securities referred to in the previous clause (i)
shall have been reduced to zero (0).

 

Section 3. Piggy-Back Registration Rights.

 

(a) At any time on or after the date hereof, whenever the Company shall propose
to file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act relating to the public
offering of securities for sale for cash, the Company shall give written notice
to the Holders as promptly as practicable, but in no event less than fifteen
(15) days prior to the anticipated filing thereof, specifying the approximate
date on which the Company proposes to file such Registration Statement and the
intended method of distribution in connection therewith, and advising Holders of
their right to have any or all of the Registrable Securities then Beneficially
Owned by them included among the securities to be covered by such Registration
Statement (the “Piggy-Back Rights”).

 

(b) Subject to Section 3(c) and Section 3(d) hereof, in the event that Holders
have and shall elect to utilize their Piggy-Back Rights, the Company shall
include in the Registration Statement the Registrable Securities identified by
the Holders in a written request (a “Piggy-Back Request”) given to the Company
not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the proposed filing date of the
Registration Statement. The Registrable Securities identified in a Piggy-Back
Request shall be included in the Registration Statement on the same terms and
conditions as the other securities included in the Registration Statement,
provided, that, any Holder of Registrable Securities shall have the right to
withdraw a Piggy-Back Request for any reason or no reason whatsoever prior to
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement covering such Piggy-Back Rights.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Holders shall
not have Piggy-Back Rights with respect to (i) a Registration Statement on Form
S-4 or Form S-8 or Form S-3 (with respect to dividend reinvestment plans and
similar plans) or any successor forms thereto or (ii) a Registration Statement
filed in connection with an exchange offer or an offering of securities solely
to employees of the Company.

 



5

 

 

(d) If the lead managing underwriters selected by the Company for an
Underwritten Offering for which Piggy-Back Rights are requested shall advise the
Company in writing that marketing or other factors require a limitation on the
number of shares of securities which can be sold in such offering within a price
range acceptable to the Company, then, (i) such underwriters shall provide
written notice thereof to the Holders and (ii) there shall be included in the
offering, (A) first, all securities proposed by the Company to be sold for its
account (or such lesser amount as shall equal the maximum number determined by
the lead managing underwriters as aforesaid); (B) second, all Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such Registration Statement by Holders,
or such lesser number as shall equal, together with the amount referred to in
(A), the maximum number determined by the lead managing underwriters as
aforesaid; and (C) third, only that number of securities requested to be
included by any Other Rights Holders that such lead managing underwriters
reasonably and in good faith believe will not substantially interfere with
(including, without limitation, adversely affecting the pricing of) the offering
of all the securities that the Company desires to sell for its own account and
all the Registrable Securities that the Holders desire to sell for their own
accounts.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 3 shall create any liability on the part
of the Company to the Holders if the Company for any reason should decide not to
file a Registration Statement for which Piggy-Back Rights are available or to
withdraw such Registration Statement subsequent to its filing, regardless of any
action whatsoever Holders may have taken, whether as a result of the issuance by
the Company of any notice hereunder or otherwise.

 

(f) A request made by Holders pursuant to their Piggy- Back Rights to include
Registrable Securities in a Registration Statement shall not be deemed to be a
Demand Registration described in Section 2(d)(ii) hereof.

 

Section 4. Selection of Underwriters. In connection with any Underwritten
Offering made pursuant to a Demand or a Piggy-Back Right, the Company may, at
its sole discretion, select a book running managing underwriter to manage the
Underwritten Offering with the prior written consent of the Holders (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that the Company
shall have no obligation to use an underwriter in connection with any
registration made pursuant to a Demand or Piggy-Back Request.

 

Section 5. Blackout Periods. If (i) within five (5) Business Days following the
exercise by a Holder of a Demand, the Company determines in good faith and
notifies such Holder in writing that the registration and distribution of
Registrable Securities (or the use of the Registration Statement or related
Prospectus) resulting from a Demand received from such Holder would materially
and adversely interfere with any planned or proposed business combination
transaction involving the Company, or any pending financing, acquisition,
corporate reorganization or any other corporate development involving the
Company or any of its subsidiaries or (ii) following the exercise by such Holder
of a Demand but before the effectiveness of the Registration Statement, (A) a
business combination, tender offer, acquisition or other corporate event
involving the Company is proposed, initiated or announced by another Person
beyond the control of the Company (an “Uncontrolled Event”), (B) in the
reasonable judgment of at least a majority of the members of the Board of
Directors of the Company (the “Board”), the filing or seeking the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement would materially and adversely interfere with such
Uncontrolled Event or would otherwise materially and adversely affect the
Company and (C) the Company promptly so notifies such Holder, then the Company
shall be entitled to (x) postpone the filing of the Registration Statement
otherwise required to be filed by the Company pursuant to Section 2 hereof, or
(y) elect that the effective Registration Statement not be used, in either case
for a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed ninety (90) days after the
date that (1) the Demand was made (in the case of an clause (i) above) or (2)
the Company so notifies such Holder of such determination (in the case of clause
(ii) above) (each, a “Blackout Period”). Any such written notice shall contain a
general statement of the reasons for such postponement or restriction on use and
an estimate of the anticipated delay. The Company shall (a) promptly notify the
Holder making a Demand of the expiration or earlier termination of such Blackout
Period and (b) use its reasonable best efforts to effect the Demand Registration
as promptly as practicable after the end of the Blackout Period.

 

Section 6. Holdback.

 

(a) If (i) at any time after the date hereof, the Company shall file a
Registration Statement (other than a registration on Form S-4, Form S-8 or Form
S-3 (with respect to dividend reinvestment plans and similar plans) or any
successor forms thereto) with respect to any shares of its capital stock, and
(ii) upon reasonable prior notice the managing underwriter or underwriters (in
the case of an Underwritten Offering) advise the Company and the Holders in
writing that a sale or distribution of Registrable Securities would adversely
impact such offering, then the Holders shall, to the extent not inconsistent
with applicable law, refrain from effecting any sale or distribution of
Registrable Securities during the period commencing on the effective date of
such Registration Statement and continuing until the ninetieth (90th) day after
the effective date of such Registration Statement; provided that such
restriction shall apply to the Holders only if in connection with such offering,
the underwriters require the directors and executive officers of the Company to
refrain from selling the Company’s securities for a like period and on like
terms (such period, a “Holdback Period”).

 



6

 

 

(b) During the ninety (90) day period commencing on the effective date of a
Registration Statement filed by the Company on behalf of Holders in connection
with an Underwritten Offering pursuant to a Demand, the Company shall not effect
(except pursuant to registrations on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or Form S-3 (with
respect to dividend reinvestment plans and similar plans) or any successor forms
thereto and except pursuant to Section 2(h) hereof) any public sale or
distribution of its securities.

 

Section 7. Ineligibility to Effect a Demand Registration. If, following receipt
of a Demand (other than the Initial Demand) from a Holder, after giving effect
to any Holdback Period and any Blackout Period, the Company has not filed a
Registration Statement for the Registrable Securities so requested to be
registered or has not used its reasonable best efforts to cause such
Registration Statement to become effective because it is not eligible to effect
a registration pursuant to the Securities Act, the Company shall have 60
additional days to file such Registration Statement for the Registrable
Securities so requested to be registered or to use its reasonable best efforts
to cause such Registration Statement to become effective (such additional days,
the “Ineligibility Accommodation Period”).

 

Section 8. Intentionally Omitted.

 

Section 9. Registration Procedures. If and whenever the Company shall be
required to use its reasonable best efforts to effect or cause the registration
of any Registrable Securities under the Securities Act as provided in this
Agreement, the Company shall and, with respect to Section 9(m) and Section 9(n),
the Holders shall:

 

(a) prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement with respect to such
Registrable Securities on any form for which the Company then qualifies or that
counsel for the Company shall deem appropriate, and which form shall be
available for the sale of the Registrable Securities in accordance with the
intended methods of distribution thereof, and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such Registration Statement to become and remain effective;

 

(b) prepare and file with the SEC amendments and post- effective amendments to
such Registration Statement and such amendments and supplements to the
Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration or as may be required by the rules,
regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form utilized by the
Company or by the Securities Act for a Shelf Registration or otherwise necessary
to keep such Registration Statement effective for at least ninety (90) days (or
one hundred eighty (180) days in the case of a Shelf Registration) and cause the
Prospectus as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 under the
Securities Act, and to otherwise comply with the provisions of the Securities
Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by such
Registration Statement until the earlier of (x) such 90th or 180th day, as the
case may be, or (y) such time as all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement shall have ceased to be Registrable Securities (it being
understood that the Company at its option may determine to maintain such
effectiveness for a longer period, whether pursuant to a Shelf Registration or
otherwise); provided, however, that a reasonable time before filing a
Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendments or supplements thereto
(other than reports required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act), the
Company shall furnish to the Holders, the managing underwriter and their
respective counsel for review and comment, copies of all documents proposed to
be filed;

 

(c) furnish, without charge, to the Holders and to any underwriter in connection
with an Underwritten Offering such number of conformed copies of such
Registration Statement and of each amendment and post-effective amendment
thereto (in each case including all exhibits) and such number of copies of any
Prospectus or Prospectus supplement and such other documents as Holders or such
underwriter may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Securities by the Holders or the underwriter (the Company hereby
consenting to the use (subject to the limitations set forth in Section 9(n)
hereof) of the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto in connection
with such disposition);

 



7

 

 

(d) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement under such other securities or
“blue sky” laws of such jurisdictions as Holders shall reasonably request,
except that the Company shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify
generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where, but
for the requirements of this Section 9(d), it would not be obligated to be so
qualified, to subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or to consent
to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

 

(e) as promptly as practicable, notify the managing underwriters (if any) and
Holders, at any time when a Prospectus relating thereto is required to be
delivered under the Securities Act within the appropriate period mentioned in
Section 9(b) hereof, of the Company’s becoming aware that the Prospectus
included in such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in
light of the circumstances then existing, and, as promptly as practicable,
prepare and furnish to the Holders a reasonable number of copies of an amendment
or supplement to such Registration Statement or related Prospectus as may be
necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable
Securities, such Prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances then
existing;

 

(f) notify the Holders, as promptly as practicable, at any time:

 

(i) when the Prospectus or any Prospectus supplement or post- effective
amendment has been filed, and, with respect to the Registration Statement or any
post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective;

 

(ii) of any request by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus or for additional information;

 

(iii) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement or any order preventing the use of a related
Prospectus, or the initiation (or any overt threats) of any proceedings for such
purposes;

 

(iv) of the receipt by the Company of any written notification of the suspension
of the qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction or the initiation (or overt threats) of any proceeding for that
purpose; and

 

(v) if at any time the representations and warranties of the Company
contemplated by Section 9(i)(i) below cease to be true and correct in all
material respects;

 

(g) otherwise comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and
make available to Holders an earnings statement that shall satisfy the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, provided that the Company
shall be deemed to have complied with this Section 9(g) if it shall have
complied with Rule 158 under the Securities Act;

 

(h) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities to
be listed on the NYSE, NASDAQ or any other national securities exchange or
automated quotation system on which the class of Registrable Securities being
registered is then listed, if such Registrable Securities are not already so
listed and if such listing is then permitted under the rules of such exchange,
and to provide a transfer agent and registrar for such Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement no later than the effective date of such
Registration Statement;

 



8

 

 

(i) enter into agreements (including, if applicable, an underwriting agreement
and other customary agreements in the form customarily entered into by other
companies in comparable underwritten offerings) and take all other appropriate
and all commercially reasonable actions in order to expedite or facilitate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities and in such connection, whether or
not an underwriting agreement shall be entered into and whether or not the
registration shall be an underwritten registration:

 

(i) make such representations and warranties to the Holders and the
underwriters, if any, in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by
companies to underwriters in comparable underwritten offerings;

 

(ii) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and updates thereof (which
counsel and opinions shall be reasonably satisfactory (in form, scope and
substance) to the managing underwriters) addressed to the underwriters covering
the matters customarily covered in opinions requested in comparable underwritten
offerings by the Company;

 

(iii) obtain “comfort letters” and updates thereof from the Company’s
independent certified public accountants addressed to the Board and the
underwriters, if any, such letters to be in customary form and covering matters
of the type customarily covered in “comfort letters” by independent accountants
in connection with comparable underwritten offerings on such date or dates as
may be reasonably requested by the managing underwriters, or if such offering is
not an Underwritten Offering, the Board; provided, however, that in connection
with any non-Underwritten Offering, such comfort letter shall not be required
except to the extent requested by the Board;

 

(iv) provide the indemnification in accordance with the provisions and
procedures of Section 13 hereof to all parties to be indemnified pursuant to
such Section 13 and any other indemnification customarily required in
underwritten public offerings; and

 

(v) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested by
the Holders and the managing underwriters, if any, to evidence compliance with
Section 9(f) above and with any customary conditions contained in the
underwriting agreement or other agreement entered into by the Company.

 

(j) cooperate with the Holders and the managing underwriter or underwriters, if
any, to facilitate, to the extent reasonable under the circumstances, the timely
preparation and delivery of certificates representing the securities to be sold
under such Registration Statement, and enable such securities to be in such
denominations and registered in such names as the managing underwriter or
underwriters, if any, or the Holders may request and/or in a form eligible for
deposit with the Depository Trust Company;

 

(k) make available to the Holders, any underwriter participating in any
disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement, and any attorney,
accountant or other agent retained by the Holders or such underwriter
(collectively, the “Inspectors”), reasonable access to appropriate officers and
employees of the Company and the Company’s subsidiaries to ask questions and to
obtain information reasonably requested by such Inspector and all financial and
other records and other information, pertinent corporate documents and
properties of any of the Company and its subsidiaries and Affiliates
(collectively, the “Records”), as shall be reasonably necessary to enable them
to exercise their due diligence responsibility; provided, however, that the
Records that the Company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and which
it notifies the Inspectors in writing are confidential shall not be disclosed to
any Inspector unless such Inspector signs a confidentiality agreement in
customary form reasonably satisfactory to the Company or either (i) the
disclosure of such Records is necessary to avoid or correct a misstatement or
omission of a material fact in such Registration Statement, or (ii) the release
of such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a court of
competent jurisdiction; provided, further, that any decision regarding the
disclosure of information pursuant to subclause (i) shall be made only after
consultation with counsel for the applicable Inspectors; and provided, further,
that the Holders agree that they shall, promptly after learning that disclosure
of such Records is sought in a court having jurisdiction, give notice to the
Company and allow the Company, at the Company’s expense, to undertake
appropriate action to prevent disclosure of such Records;

 



9

 

 

(l) in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement or of any order suspending or preventing the use
of any related Prospectus or suspending the qualification of any Registrable
Securities included in the Registration Statement for sale in any jurisdiction,
the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts promptly to obtain its
withdrawal;

 

(m) the Holders shall furnish the Company with such information regarding them
and pertinent to the disclosure requirements relating to the registration and
the distribution of such securities as the Company may from time to time
reasonably request in writing or as shall be required in connection with the
action to be taken by the Company hereunder; and

 

(n) the Holders shall, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of the
happening of any event of the kind described in Section 9(e) hereof, forthwith
discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Prospectus or
Registration Statement covering such Registrable Securities until the Holders
shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus
contemplated by Section 9(e) hereof, and, if so directed by the Company, the
Holders shall deliver to the Company (at the Company’s expense) all copies,
other than permanent file copies then in their possession, of the Prospectus
covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such
notice.

 

Section 10. Registration Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, in
connection with all registrations of Registrable Securities made pursuant to the
Shelf Registration to be filed pursuant to Section 2(a) or any Demand
Registration or Piggy-Back Rights, the Company shall pay all Registration
Expenses; provided, however, that the Holders shall pay, and shall hold the
Company harmless from, (i) any underwriting discounts and commissions and
transfer taxes relating to the sale or disposition of Registrable Securities and
(ii) any fees, expenses or disbursements of Holders’ counsel and other advisors.

 

Section 11. Rule 144. From and after the date which is more than one hundred
eighty (180) days after the date hereof, the Company shall, at all times when
the Holders Beneficially Own any Registrable Securities, take such measures and
file and/or make available such information, documents and reports as shall be
required by the SEC as a condition to the availability of Rule 144; provided,
however, that the Company need not take any of the foregoing actions during any
Ineligibility Accommodation Period.

 

Section 12. Covenants of Holders. Each Holder hereby covenants and agrees that
it shall not sell any Registrable Securities in violation of the Securities Act
or this Agreement.

 

Section 13. Indemnification; Contribution.

 

(a) The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, its respective
officers and directors, and each Person, if any, who controls such Holder within
the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act and any agents, representatives or advisers thereof against all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ fees and expenses and reasonable costs of investigation) incurred by
such party pursuant to any actual or threatened action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arising out of or based upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of material fact contained in any Registration Statement, any
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement to any of
the foregoing, (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
(in the case of a Prospectus or a preliminary Prospectus, in light of the
circumstances then existing) not misleading, or (iii) any violation or alleged
violation by the Company of any United States federal, state or common law rule
or regulation applicable to the Company and relating to action required of or
inaction by the Company in connection with any such registration except in each
case insofar as the same arise out of or are based upon, any such untrue
statement or omission made in reliance on and in conformity with written
information with respect to the Holders furnished in writing to the Company by
the Holders or their counsel expressly for use therein. In connection with an
Underwritten Offering, the Company shall indemnify the underwriters thereof,
their officers, directors and agents and each Person who controls such
underwriters (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the
indemnification of the Holders.

 



10

 

 

(b) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder agrees to give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party after the receipt by such indemnified
party of any written notice of the commencement of any action, suit, proceeding
or investigation or threat thereof made in writing for which such indemnified
party may claim indemnification or contribution pursuant to this Section 13
(provided that failure to give such notification shall not affect the
obligations of the indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 13 except to the
extent the indemnifying party shall have been materially prejudiced as a result
of such failure). In case any such action shall be brought against any
indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement
thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to
the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent
of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after
notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so
to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to
such indemnified party under this Section 13 for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the indemnifying
party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
indemnified party to take charge of the defense of such action within a
reasonable time after notice of commencement of such action (so long as such
failure to employ counsel is not the result of an unreasonable determination by
such indemnified party that counsel selected pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence is unsatisfactory) or if the indemnifying party shall not
have demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction of the indemnified party its
ability to finance such defense, or (ii) the indemnified party shall have
reasonably concluded or been advised by counsel that there may be legal defenses
available to other indemnified parties to such action which could result in a
conflict of interest for such counsel or prejudice the prosecution of the
defenses available to such indemnified party, then such indemnified party shall
have the right to employ separate counsel of its choosing, at the expense of the
indemnifying party. No indemnifying party shall consent to entry of any judgment
or enter into any settlement without the consent (which consent, in the case of
an action, suit, claim or proceeding exclusively seeking monetary relief, shall
not be unreasonably withheld) of the applicable indemnified party.

 

(c) If the indemnification from the indemnifying party provided for in this
Section 13 is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in respect of any
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then the
indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and
indemnified party in connection with the actions or omissions which resulted in
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party
and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has
been made by, or relates to information supplied (in writing, in the case of the
Holders) by, such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties’
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such action or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a
result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to
above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 13(b) hereof, any legal and other fees and expenses reasonably incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with any investigation or proceeding.
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this Section 13(c) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any
other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable
considerations referred to above in this Section 13(c). Any underwriter’s
obligations in this Section 13(c) to contribute shall be several in proportion
to the number of Registrable Securities underwritten by them and not joint.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 13(c), no underwriter shall be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
price at which the Registrable Securities underwritten by it and distributed to
the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which
such underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No Person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. If indemnification is available
under this Section 13, the indemnifying parties shall indemnify each indemnified
party to the fullest extent provided in Section 13(a) hereof without regard to
the relative fault of such indemnifying parties or indemnified party or any
other equitable consideration provided for in this Section 13(c).

 



11

 

 

(d) The provisions of this Section 13 shall be in addition to any liability
which any party may have to any other party and shall survive any termination of
this Agreement. The indemnification provided by this Section 13 shall survive
the Transfer of such Registrable Securities by the Holders and shall remain in
full force and effect irrespective of any investigation made by or on behalf of
an indemnified party.

 

Section 14. Injunctions. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
IRREPARABLE DAMAGE WOULD OCCUR IN THE EVENT THAT ANY OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
AGREEMENT WERE NOT PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS SPECIFIC TERMS OR WERE
OTHERWISE BREACHED. THEREFORE, EACH PARTY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO AN INJUNCTION OR
INJUNCTIONS TO PREVENT BREACHES OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND TO
ENFORCE SPECIFICALLY THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS HEREOF IN ANY COURT HAVING
JURISDICTION, SUCH REMEDY BEING IN ADDITION TO ANY OTHER REMEDY TO WHICH SUCH
PARTY MAY BE ENTITLED AT LAW OR IN EQUITY.

 

Section 15. Amendments and Waivers. No amendment, modification, supplement,
termination, consent or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, nor consent
to any departure herefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same is in
writing and is signed by the party against whom enforcement of the same is
sought. Any waiver of any provision of this Agreement and any consent to any
departure from the terms of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

 

Section 16. Notices. All notices, consents, requests, demands and other
communications hereunder must be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been
