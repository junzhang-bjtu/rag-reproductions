Lender to apply the Net Proceeds as a prepayment of the Outstanding Principal

prepayment set forth in Section 2.4.1 hereof, and Borrower shall pay, as part of
the Debt, all of the interest calculated at the Interest Rate on the amount of
principal being prepaid through and including the end of the Interest Period in
which such prepayment occurs.

certification by Borrower and/or any Guarantor that its respective
representations and warranties set forth in the Loan Documents to which it is a
party remain true and correct in all material respects as of the first day of

the Title Insurance Policy for the remaining Property (to the extent reasonably
available in the State in which the remaining Property is located) insuring the
Security Instrument, which endorsement (A) extends the effective date of such
Title Insurance Policy for the remaining Property to the effective date of the
release, (B) confirms no change in the priority of the Security Instrument on
the balance of the Property (exclusive of the Release Parcel); and (C) lists any
Permitted Encumbrances; and (ii) at Lender’s request, a survey in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Lender of the remaining portion of the
Property; and

 

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.7, if the Loan is
included in a REMIC Trust, as a condition to such release, Borrower shall have
established to Lender’s reasonable satisfaction that the loan-to-value ratio of
the Loan (expressed as a percentage) based upon valuations obtained by Borrower
at its sole cost and expense using (i) an existing appraisal (if such release
occurs within twenty-four (24) months of the Closing Date), (ii) a new appraisal
or (iii) a broker’s price opinion or other written determination of value using
a commercially reasonable valuation method (provided, in each case, that such
appraisal, opinion or other determination constitutes a commercially reasonable
method permitted to a REMIC Trust, and provided, further, that such valuation
shall be based solely on the value of real property and shall exclude personal
property and going-concern value) does not exceed 125% immediately after the
release of the Release Property, no such release will be permitted unless the
Borrower pays down the principal balance of the Loan by an amount not less than
the greater of (A) the Release Amount or (B) the least of one of the following
amounts: (i) if the Individual Property is sold, the net proceeds of an
arm’s-length sale of the Release Property to an unrelated Person, (ii) the fair
market value of the Release Property at the time of the release, or (iii) an
amount such that the loan-to-value ratio of the Loan as so determined by Lender
after the release is not greater than the loan-to-value ratio of the Loan
immediately prior to the release, unless the Lender receives an opinion of
counsel that, if (B) is not followed, the Securitization will not fail to
maintain its status as a REMIC Trust as a result of the release.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

 

Section 4.1 Borrower Representations. Borrower represents and warrants as of the
date hereof that:

 

4.1.1 Organization. Borrower has been duly organized and is validly existing and
in good standing with requisite power and authority to own its properties and to
transact the business in which it is now engaged and as contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the power and authority to do business
in the State. Borrower is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where it is required to be so qualified in connection with
its properties, businesses and operations. Borrower possesses all rights,
licenses, permits and authorizations, governmental or otherwise, necessary to
entitle it to own its properties and to transact the businesses in which it is
now engaged. The sole business of Borrower is the ownership, management and
operation of the Property. The ownership interests of Borrower are as set forth
on the organizational chart attached hereto as Schedule 4.1.1. Borrower (a) has
complied in all respects with its articles of organization or limited liability
company agreement; (b) has maintained complete books and records and bank
accounts separate from those of its Affiliates; and (c) has obeyed all
formalities required to maintain its status as, and at all times has held itself
out to the public as, a legal entity separate and distinct from any other entity
(including, but not limited to, any Affiliate thereof). The signatory hereto has
all necessary power, authority and legal right to execute this Agreement, the
Note and the other Loan Documents on Borrower’s behalf to which Borrower is a
party. Guarantor has the necessary power, authority and legal right to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under the Guaranty.

 

4.1.2 Proceedings. Borrower has taken all necessary action to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a party
have been duly executed and delivered by or on behalf of Borrower and constitute
the legal, valid and binding obligations of Borrower enforceable against
Borrower in accordance with their respective terms, subject only to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting rights of creditors generally,
and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless
of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 

 15 

 

 

4.1.3 No Conflicts. The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents by Borrower and/or Guarantor, as applicable, will
not conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or
constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien,
charge or encumbrance (other than pursuant to the Loan Documents) upon any of
the property or assets of Borrower pursuant to the terms of any indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement, partnership agreement, management
agreement or other agreement or instrument to which Borrower is a party or by
which any of Borrower’s property or assets is subject, nor will such action
result in any violation of the provisions of any Legal Requirements of any
Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Borrower or any of Borrower’s
properties or assets, and any consent, approval, authorization, order,
registration or qualification of or with any court or any such Governmental
Authority required for the execution, delivery and performance by Borrower
and/or any Guarantor, as applicable, of this Agreement or any other Loan
Documents has been obtained and is in full force and effect.

 

4.1.4 Litigation. There are no actions, suits or proceedings at law or in equity
by or before any Governmental Authority or other agency now pending or
threatened against or affecting Borrower, any Guarantor, or the Property, which
actions, suits or proceedings, if determined against Borrower, any Guarantor, or
the Property.

 

4.1.5 Agreements. Borrower is not a party to any agreement or instrument or
subject to any restriction which might materially and adversely affect Borrower
or the Property, or Borrower’s business, properties or assets, operations or
condition, financial or otherwise. Borrower is not in default in any material
respect in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations,
covenants or conditions contained in any agreement or instrument to which it is
a party or by which Borrower or the Property are bound. Borrower has no material
financial obligation under any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan
agreement or other agreement or instrument to which Borrower is a party or by
which Borrower or the Property is otherwise bound, other than as permitted by
this Agreement.

 

4.1.6 Title. Borrower has good, marketable and insurable fee simple title to the
real property comprising part of the Property and good title to the balance of
the Property, free and clear of all Liens whatsoever except the Permitted
Encumbrances, such other Liens as are permitted pursuant to the Loan Documents
and the Liens created by the Loan Documents. The Security Instrument, when
properly recorded in the appropriate records, together with any UCC-1 financing
statements required to be filed in connection therewith, will create (a) a
valid, perfected first priority lien on the Property, subject only to Permitted
Encumbrances and the Liens created by the Loan Documents, and (b) perfected
security interests in and to, and perfected collateral assignments of, all
personalty, solely to the extent such security interests can be perfected by the
filing of a UCC-1 financing statement, all in accordance with the terms thereof,
in each case subject only to any applicable Permitted Encumbrances, such other
Liens as are permitted pursuant to the Loan Documents and the Liens created by
the Loan Documents. There are no claims for payment for work, labor or materials
affecting the Property which are or may become a Lien prior to, or of equal
priority with, the Liens created by the Loan Documents.

 

4.1.7 Solvency. Borrower has (a) not entered into the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement or executed the Note, this Agreement or any other Loan
Documents with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor and
(b) received reasonably equivalent value in exchange for its obligations under
such Loan Documents. After giving effect to the Loan, the fair saleable value of
Borrower’s assets exceeds and will, immediately following the making of the
Loan, exceed Borrower’s total liabilities, including, without limitation,
subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and contingent liabilities. The fair
saleable value of Borrower’s assets is and will, immediately following the
making of the Loan, be greater than Borrower’s liabilities (including contingent
liabilities, if any), including the maximum amount of its contingent liabilities
on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured. Borrower’s assets do not
and, immediately following the making of the Loan will not, constitute
unreasonably small capital to carry out its business as conducted or as proposed
to be conducted. Borrower does not intend to incur debts and liabilities
(including contingent liabilities and other commitments) beyond its ability to
pay such debts and liabilities as they mature (taking into account the timing
and amounts of cash to be received by Borrower and the amounts to be payable on
or in respect of the obligations of Borrower). No Bankruptcy Action exists
against Borrower and Borrower has never been a debtor party in a Bankruptcy
Action. No Bankruptcy Action exists against any Guarantor, and neither Borrower
nor has any Guarantor has ever been a debtor party in a Bankruptcy Action.
Neither Borrower nor any Guarantor is contemplating either a Bankruptcy Action
or the liquidation of all or a major portion of Borrower’s or Guarantor’s
respective assets or properties, and Borrower has no knowledge of any Person
contemplating the filing of any petition against Borrower or any Guarantor.

 

 16 

 

 

4.1.8 Full and Accurate Disclosure. No statement of fact made by or on behalf of
Borrower in this Agreement or in any of the other Loan Documents contains any
untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
necessary to make statements contained herein or therein not misleading. There
is no material information that has not been disclosed to Lender which adversely
affects, nor as far as Borrower can reasonably foresee, might materially
adversely affect, the Property or the business, operations or condition
(financial or otherwise) of Borrower or any Guarantor.

 

4.1.9 No Plan Assets. Borrower is not an “employee benefit plan,” as defined in
Section 3(3) of ERISA, subject to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code,
and none of the assets of Borrower constitutes or will constitute “plan assets”
of one or more such plans within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101.
Compliance by Borrower and each Guarantor with the provisions hereof will not
involve any Prohibited Transaction. Neither Guarantor nor Borrower has any
pension, profit sharing, stock option, insurance or other arrangement or plan
for employees covered by Title IV of ERISA, and no “Reportable Event” as defined
in ERISA has occurred and is now continuing with respect to any such plan. The
performance by Borrower of its obligations under the Loan Documents and
Borrower’s conducting of its operations do not violate any provisions of ERISA.
In addition, (a) Borrower is not a “governmental plan” within the meaning of
Section 3(32) of ERISA, (b) transactions by or with Borrower are not subject to
any state statute or regulation regulating investments of, or fiduciary
obligations with respect to, governmental plans within the meaning of Section
2(32) of ERISA which is similar to the provisions of Section 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code currently in effect, which prohibit or otherwise
restrict the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (c) none of
Borrower, Guarantor or ERISA Affiliate is at the date hereof, or has been at any
time within the two years preceding the date hereof, an employer required to
contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan, or a
“contributing sponsor” (as such term is defined in Section 4001 of ERISA) in any
Multiemployer Plan or Multiple Employer Plan; and none of Borrower, Guarantor or
any ERISA Affiliate has any contingent liability with respect to any
post-retirement “welfare benefit plan” (as such term is defined in ERISA) except
as disclosed to Lender in writing.

 

4.1.10 Compliance. Borrower and the Property (including the use thereof) comply
in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements, including,
without limitation, building and zoning ordinances and codes. Borrower is not in
default or violation of any order, writ, injunction, decree or demand of any
Governmental Authority, including, without limitation, any order of a bankruptcy
court or plan approved thereby. There has not been committed by Borrower (or any
other Person), any act or omission affording any Governmental Authority the
right of forfeiture as against the Property or any part thereof or any monies
paid in performance of Borrower’s obligations under any of the Loan Documents.
Neither the Improvements, if any, as constructed, nor the use of the Property or
any contemplated accessory uses, will violate (a) any Legal Requirements
(including subdivision, zoning, building, environmental protection and wetland
protection Legal Requirements), or (b) any building permits, restrictions or
records, or agreements affecting the Property or any part thereof. Neither the
zoning authorizations, approvals or variances nor any other right to construct
or to use the Property is to any extent dependent upon or related to any real
estate other than the Property.

 

4.1.11 Financial Information. All financial data with respect to the Property
and Guarantor, including, without limitation, the statements of cash flow and
income and operating expense, that have been delivered to Lender in connection
with the Loan (a) are true, complete and correct in all material respects, (b)
fairly and accurately represent the financial condition of the Property and each
Guarantor as of the date of such reports, and (c) to the extent prepared or
audited by an independent certified public accounting firm, have been prepared
in accordance with GAAP (or such other accounting basis acceptable to Lender)
throughout the periods covered, except as disclosed therein. Except for
Permitted Encumbrances, Borrower does not have any contingent liabilities,
liabilities for taxes, unusual forward or long-term commitments or unrealized or
anticipated losses from any unfavorable commitments that are known to Borrower
and reasonably likely to have a Materially Adverse Effect on the Property or the
Project. Since the date of such financial statements, there has been no Material
Adverse Change (or any other material change) in the financial condition,
operation or business of Borrower or any Guarantor from that set forth in said
financial statements.

 

 17

commenced or, to Borrower’s best knowledge, is threatened with respect to all or
any portion of the Property or for the relocation of any roadway providing
access to the Property.

 

4.1.13 Federal Reserve Regulations. No part of the proceeds of the Loan will be
used for the purpose of purchasing or acquiring any “margin stock” within the
meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
or for any other purpose which would be inconsistent with such Regulation U or
any other Regulations of such Board of Governors, or for any purposes prohibited
by any Legal Requirements or by the terms and conditions of this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents.

 

4.1.14 Public Access. The Property has rights of access to public ways and, upon

drain facilities adequate to service the Property for its intended uses. All
public utilities necessary or convenient to the full use and enjoyment of the
Property are located either in the public right-of-way abutting the Property
(which will be connected so as to serve the Property without passing over other
property) or in recorded easements serving the Property and such easements are
set forth in and insured by the Title Insurance Policy. All roads necessary for
the use of the Property for its current purpose have been completed and
dedicated to public use and accepted by all Governmental Authorities. There is

subsequent holder thereof) in accordance with their respective terms, subject to

applicable to creditors’ rights and the enforcement of debtors’ obligations. The
Loan Documents are not subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim
or defense by Borrower or Guarantor, including the defense of usury, nor would
the operation of any of the terms of the Loan Documents, or the exercise of any
right thereunder, render the Loan Documents unenforceable (subject to principles
of equity and bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws generally affecting
creditors’ rights and the enforcement of debtors’ obligations), and neither
Borrower nor any Guarantor have asserted any right of rescission, set-off,
counterclaim or defense with respect thereto.

or in any other Loan Document, are accurate, complete and correct in all
material respects. There has been no Material Adverse Change in any condition,
fact, circumstance or event that would make any such information inaccurate,
incomplete or otherwise misleading in any material respect or that otherwise
materially and adversely affects or might materially and adversely affect the
use, operation or value of the Property or the business operations and/or the
financial condition of Borrower or any Guarantor. Borrower and each Guarantor

liability and such other insurance, as is more fully provided in this Agreement.
After prior notice to Lender, Borrower, at its own expense, may contest by

any Legal Requirement to Borrower or the Property or any alleged violation of
any Legal Requirement, provided, that: (a) no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing; (b) such proceeding shall be permitted under, and be
conducted in accordance with, the provisions of any instrument to which Borrower

applicability or violation of such Legal Requirement is finally established or
the Property (or any part thereof or interest therein) shall be in danger of
being sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost.

not suffer and shall promptly pay or cause to be paid and discharged any Lien or
charge whatsoever which may be or become a Lien or charge against the Property,
and shall promptly pay or cause to be paid all utility services provided to the

payable in connection therewith; (e) such proceeding shall suspend the
collection of such contested Taxes or Other Charges from the Property (except
that if such Taxes or Other Charges must be paid sooner in order to avoid being
delinquent, then Borrower shall pay or cause the same to be paid prior to
delinquency, and upon making such payment or causing such payment to be made
prior to delinquency Borrower may continue such contest); and (f) Borrower shall
furnish such security as may be required in the proceeding, or as may be
requested by Lender, to insure the payment of any such Taxes or Other Charges,
together with all interest and penalties thereon. Lender may pay over any such
cash deposit or part thereof held by Lender to the claimant entitled thereto at
any time when, in the judgment of Lender, the entitlement of such claimant is
established or the Property (or part thereof or interest therein) shall be in
danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, cancelled or lost or there shall be
any danger of the Lien of the Security Instrument being primed by any related
Lien.

with respect to any employees of Borrower, as required by any Governmental

ordinance or law coverage to compensate for the value of the undamaged portion
of the Property, the cost of demolition and increased cost of construction in
amounts as requested by Lender;

 

(x) if applicable, the commercial property, business income, general liability
and umbrella or excess liability insurance required under Sections 6.1(a)(i),
(ii), (iii) and (viii) above shall cover perils of terrorism and acts of
terrorism and Borrower shall maintain commercial property and business income
insurance for loss resulting from perils and acts of terrorism on terms
(including amounts) consistent with those required under Sections 6.1(a)(i),
(ii), (iii) and (viii) above at all times during the term of the Loan so long as
Lender determines that either (I) prudent owners of real estate comparable to
the Property are maintaining same or (II) prudent institutional lenders
(including, without limitation, investment banks) to such owners are requiring
that such owners maintain such insurance; and

 

(xi) upon sixty (60) days’ notice, such other insurance and in such amounts as
Lender from time to time may request against such other insurable hazards which
at the time are commonly insured against for properties similar to the Property
located in or around the region in which the Property is located.

 

(b) All insurance provided for in Section 6.1(a) shall be obtained under valid
and enforceable policies (collectively, the “Policies” or in the singular, the
“Policy”), and shall be subject to the approval of Lender as to insurance
companies, amounts, deductibles, loss payees and insureds. The Policies shall be
issued by financially sound and responsible insurance companies authorized to do
business in the State and having a claims paying ability rating of “A-” or
better by S&P or “A-X” or better by AM Best or “A3” or better by Moody’s
Investor Service, Inc.. Prior to the expiration dates of the Policies
theretofore furnished to Lender, certificates of insurance evidencing the
renewal or successor Policies accompanied by evidence satisfactory to Lender of
payment of the premiums due thereunder (the “Insurance Premiums”), shall be
delivered by Borrower to Lender. Borrower shall supply an original or certified
copy of the original policy within ten (10) days of request by Lender, provided
that the policy is available.

 

(c) Any blanket insurance Policy shall specifically allocate to the Property the
amount of coverage from time to time required hereunder and shall otherwise
provide the same protection as would a separate Policy insuring only the
Property in compliance with the provisions of Section 6.1(a).

 

 29 

 

 

(d) All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section 6.1(a), except for the
Policy referenced in Section 6.1(a)(v), shall name Borrower as the insured and
Lender (and its successors and assigns) as Mortgagee, Loss Payee and Additional
Insured, as its interests may appear, and in the case of property damage, boiler
and machinery, flood and earthquake insurance, shall contain a standard
non-contributing mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing that the loss
thereunder shall be payable to Lender.

 

(e) All Policies provided for in this Section 6.1 shall contain clauses or
endorsements to the effect that: (i) no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone
acting for Borrower, or of any tenant or other occupant, or failure to comply
with the provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise result in a forfeiture
of the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way affect the validity or
enforceability of the insurance insofar as Lender is concerned; (ii) the
Policies on which Lender is listed as a Mortgagee shall not be canceled without
at least thirty (30) days’ notice to Lender; (iii) Lender shall not be liable
for any Insurance Premiums thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder; and
(iv) shall contain a waiver of subrogation in favor of Lender.

 

(f) If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence that all
Policies are in full force and effect, Lender shall have the right, without
notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems necessary to protect its
interest in the Property, including, without limitation, the obtaining of such
insurance coverage as Lender in its sole discretion deems appropriate. All
premiums incurred by Lender in connection with such action or in obtaining such
insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by Borrower to Lender upon
demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the Security Instrument and shall
bear interest at the Default Rate. Provided no Event of Default exists, Lender
shall promptly provide Borrower with notice of any such premiums incurred.

 

(g) Without limitation, Borrower shall continue to maintain all insurance that
is in effect as of the date hereof.

 

Section 6.2 Casualty. If the Property shall be damaged or destroyed, in whole or
in part, by fire or other casualty (a “Casualty”), Borrower shall (a) give
prompt notice of such damage to Lender, and (b) promptly commence and diligently
prosecute the completion of Restoration so that the Property resembles, as
nearly as possible, the condition the Property was in immediately prior to such
Casualty, with such alterations as may be reasonably approved by Lender and
otherwise in accordance with Section 6.4. Borrower shall pay all costs of such
Restoration whether or not such costs are covered by insurance. Lender may, but
shall not be obligated to make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower.
In addition, Lender may participate in (and have approval rights over) any
settlement discussions with any insurance companies with respect to any Casualty
in which the Net Proceeds or the costs of completing Restoration are equal to or
greater than five percent (5%) of the applicable Allocated Loan Amount for the
affected Individual Property and Borrower shall deliver to Lender all
instruments required by Lender to permit such participation.

 

Section 6.3 Condemnation. Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of the
actual or threatened commencement of any proceeding in respect of Condemnation,
and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and all papers served in connection
with such proceedings. Lender may participate in any such proceedings, and
Borrower shall from time to time deliver to Lender all instruments requested by
Lender to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at its expense, diligently
prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with Lender, its attorneys and
experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or defense of any such
proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or quasi-public authority
through Condemnation or otherwise (including, but not limited to, any transfer
made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of such taking), Borrower
shall continue to perform the Obligations at the time and in the manner provided
in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the Outstanding Principal
Balance shall not be reduced until any Award shall have been actually received
and applied by Lender, after the deduction of expenses of collection, to the
reduction or discharge of the Obligations. Lender shall not be limited to the
interest paid on the Award by the applicable Governmental Authority but shall be
entitled to receive out of the Award interest at the rate or rates provided
herein or in the Note. If the Property or any portion thereof is taken by a
Governmental Authority, Borrower shall promptly commence and diligently
prosecute Restoration and otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 6.4.
If the Property is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the receipt
by Lender of the Award, Lender shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency
judgment on the Note shall have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the
Award, or a portion thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.

Section 6.4 Restoration. If there are any Improvements on the Property, the
following provisions shall apply:

 

(a) If the Net Proceeds and the costs of completing Restoration shall each be
less than five percent (5%) of the applicable Allocated Loan Amount for the
affected Individual Property, then the Net Proceeds will be disbursed by Lender
to Borrower upon receipt, provided that all of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.4(b)(i) are met and Borrower delivers to Lender a written undertaking
to expeditiously commence and to satisfactorily complete with due diligence
Restoration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

 

(b) If the Net Proceeds are equal to or greater than five percent (5%) of the
applicable Allocated Loan Amount for the affected Individual Property, but less
than twenty percent (20%) of the applicable Allocated Loan Amount for the
affected Individual Property, or the costs of completing Restoration are equal
to or greater than five percent (5%) of the applicable Allocated Loan Amount for
the affected Individual Property, but less than twenty percent (20%) of the
applicable Allocated Loan Amount for the affected Individual Property, then, in
either case, the Net Proceeds will be held by Lender and Lender shall make the
Net Proceeds available for Restoration in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 6.4. The term “Net Proceeds” for purposes of this Section 6.4 shall
mean: (i) the net amount of all insurance proceeds received by Lender pursuant
to Section 6.1 (a)(i), (iv), (vi), (ix) and (x) as a result of such damage or
destruction, after deduction of Lender’s reasonable costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel costs and fees), if any, in
collecting same (“Insurance Proceeds”), or (ii) the net amount of the Award,
after deduction of Lender’s reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not
limited to, reasonable counsel costs and fees), if any, in collecting same
(“Condemnation Proceeds”), whichever the case may be.

 

(i) The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower for Restoration upon
the determination of Lender in its sole discretion that the following conditions
are met:

 

(A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

 

(B) in the event the Net Proceeds are Condemnation Proceeds, less than ten
percent (10%) of the land constituting the affected Individual Property is
taken, and such land is located along the perimeter or periphery of such
Property, and no portion of the Improvements is located on such land;

 

(C) if applicable, Leases demising in the aggregate a percentage amount equal to
or greater than ninety percent (90%) of the total rentable space in the affected
Individual Property which has been demised under executed and delivered Leases
in effect as of the date of the occurrence of such Casualty or Condemnation,
whichever the case may be, shall remain in full force and effect during and
after the completion of Restoration, notwithstanding the occurrence of any such
Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may be, and will make all necessary
repairs and restorations thereto at their sole cost and expense;

 

(D) Borrower shall commence Restoration as soon as reasonably practicable (but
in no event later than sixty (60) days after such Casualty or Condemnation,
whichever the case may be, occurs) and shall diligently pursue the same to
satisfactory completion;

 

(E) Lender shall be satisfied that any operating deficits, including all
scheduled payments of principal and interest under the Note, which will be
incurred with respect to the affected Individual Property as a result of the
occurrence of any such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may be, will
be covered out of (1) the Net Proceeds, (2) the insurance coverage referred to
in Section 6.1(a)(iii), if applicable, or (3) by other funds of Borrower;

 

(F) Lender shall be satisfied that Restoration will be completed on or before
the earliest to occur of (1) four (4) months prior to the Maturity Date, (2) the
earliest date required for such completion under the terms of any Leases, (3)
such time as may be required under all applicable Legal Requirements in order to
repair and restore the affected Individual Property to the condition it was in
immediately prior to such Casualty or to as nearly as possible the condition it
was in immediately prior to such Condemnation, as applicable, or (4) the
expiration of the insurance coverage referred to in Section 6.1(a)(iii);

 

 31 

 

 

(G) the affected Individual Property and the use thereof after Restoration will
be in compliance with and permitted under all applicable Legal Requirements;

 

(H) Restoration shall be done and completed by Borrower in an expeditious and
diligent fashion and in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements;

 

(I) such Casualty or Condemnation, as applicable, does not result in the loss of
access to the affected Individual Property or the related Improvements;

 

(J) Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Lender a signed
detailed budget approved in writing by Borrower’s architect or engineer stating
the entire cost of completing Restoration, which budget shall be acceptable to
Lender; and

 

(K) the Net Proceeds together with any cash or cash equivalent deposited by
Borrower with Lender are sufficient in Lender’s discretion to cover the cost of
Restoration.

 

(ii) The Net Proceeds shall be paid directly to Lender for deposit in an
interest-bearing account (the “Net Proceeds Account”) and, until disbursed in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b), shall constitute
additional security for the Debt and the Other Obligations. The Net Proceeds
shall be disbursed by Lender to, or as directed by, Borrower from time to time
during the course of Restoration, upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to
Lender that (A) all materials installed and work and labor performed (except to
the extent that they are to be paid for out of the requested disbursement) in
connection with Restoration have been paid for in full, and (B) there exist no
notices of pendency, stop orders, mechanic’s or materialman’s liens or notices
of intention to file same, or any other liens or encumbrances of any nature
whatsoever on the Property which have not either been fully bonded to the
satisfaction of Lender and discharged of record or in the alternative fully
insured to the satisfaction of Lender by the Title Company.

 

(iii) All plans and specifications required in connection with Restoration shall
be subject to prior review and acceptance in all respects by Lender in its
discretion and by an independent consulting engineer selected by Lender (the
“Casualty Consultant”). Lender shall have the use of the plans and
specifications and all permits, licenses and approvals required or obtained in
connection with Restoration. The identity of the contractor engaged in
Restoration, as well as the contracts under which it has been engaged, shall be
subject to prior review and acceptance by Lender in its discretion and the
Casualty Consultant. All costs and expenses incurred by Lender in connection
with making the Net Proceeds available for Restoration including, without
limitation, reasonable counsel fees and disbursements and the Casualty
Consultant’s fees, shall be paid by Borrower.

 

(iv) In no event shall Lender be obligated to make disbursements of the Net
Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the costs actually incurred from time
to time for work in place as part of Restoration, as certified by the Casualty
Consultant, minus the Retention Amount. The term “Retention Amount” shall mean,
as to each contractor, subcontractor or materialman engaged in Restoration, an
amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the costs actually incurred for work in
place as part of Restoration, as certified by the Casualty Consultant, until
Restoration has been completed. The Retention Amount shall in no event, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth above in this Section 6.4(b),
be less than the amount actually held back by Borrower from contractors,
subcontractors and materialmen engaged in Restoration. The Retention Amount
shall not be released until the Casualty Consultant certifies to Lender that
Restoration has been completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section
6.4(b) and that all approvals necessary for the re-occupancy and use of the
Property have been obtained from all appropriate Governmental Authorities, and
Lender receives evidence satisfactory to Lender that the costs of Restoration
have been paid in full or will be paid in full out of the Retention Amount;
provided, however, that Lender will release the portion of the Retention Amount
being held with respect to any contractor, subcontractor or materialman engaged
in Restoration as of the date upon which the Casualty Consultant certifies to
Lender that the contractor, subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily
completed all work and has supplied all materials in accordance with the
provisions of the contractor’s, subcontractor’s or materialman’s contract, the
contractor, subcontractor or materialman delivers the lien waivers and evidence
of payment in full of all sums due to the contractor, subcontractor or
materialman as may be reasonably requested by Lender or by the Title Company
issuing the Title Insurance Policy, and Lender receives an endorsement to the
Title Insurance Policy insuring the continued priority of the lien of the
related Security Instrument and evidence of payment of any premium payable for
such endorsement. If required by Lender, the release of any such portion of the
Retention Amount shall be approved by the surety company, if any, which has
issued a payment or performance bond with respect to the contractor,
subcontractor or materialman.

 

 32 

 

 

(v) Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements of the Net Proceeds more
frequently than once every calendar month.

 

(vi) If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed balance thereof shall
not, in the opinion of Lender in consultation with the Casualty Consultant, be
sufficient to pay in full the balance of the costs which are estimated by the
Casualty Consultant to be incurred in connection with the completion of
Restoration, Borrower shall deposit the deficiency (the “Net Proceeds
Deficiency”) with Lender before any further disbursement of the Net Proceeds
shall be made. The Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be held
by Lender and shall be disbursed for costs actually incurred in connection with
Restoration on the same conditions applicable to the disbursement of the Net
Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant to this Section 6.4(b) shall
constitute additional security for the Debt and the Other Obligations.

 

(vii) The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the remaining balance, if any,
of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender after the Casualty
Consultant certifies to Lender that Restoration has been completed in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 6.4(b), and the receipt by Lender of
evidence satisfactory to Lender that all costs incurred in connection with
Restoration have been paid in full, shall be remitted by Lender to Borrower,
provided no Event of Default shall have occurred and shall be continuing.

 

(c) If Net Proceeds are (i) equal to or greater than twenty percent (20%) of the
applicable Allocated Loan Amount for the affected Individual Property, (ii) not
required to be made available for Restoration (due to Borrower’s inability to
satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 6.4(b)(i) or otherwise), or (iii)
not to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant to Section
6.4(b)(vii), then in any such event all Net Proceeds may be retained and applied
by Lender in accordance with Section 2.4.2 hereof toward reduction of the
Outstanding Principal Balance whether or not then due and payable in such order,
priority and proportions as Lender in its sole discretion shall deem proper, or,
in the sole discretion of Lender, the same may be paid, either in whole or in
part, to Borrower for such purposes as Lender shall approve, in its sole
discretion. No prepayment charge shall be payable by Borrower by reason of a
Casualty or Condemnation.

 

(d) In the event of foreclosure of the Security Instrument, or other transfer of
title to the Property in extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt all
right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the Policies that are not
blanket Policies then in force concerning the Property and all proceeds payable
thereunder shall thereupon vest in the purchaser at such foreclosure or Lender
or other transferee in the event of such other transfer of title.

Lender a perfected first priority security interest in the Reserve Funds,

Property not theretofore approved by Lender, and Lender may, in its discretion,
require an endorsement to the Title Insurance Policy, in form and content

thirty (30) days after notice from Lender in the case of any other Default;
provided, however, that if such non-monetary Default is susceptible of cure but
cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period and provided
further that Borrower shall have commenced to cure such Default within such
thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently and expeditiously proceeds to
cure the same, such thirty (30) day period shall be extended for such time as is
reasonably necessary for Borrower in the exercise of due diligence to cure such
Default, such additional period not to exceed ninety (90) days; or

 

(xiv) if there shall be a Default under any of the other Loan Documents beyond
any applicable cure periods contained in such documents, whether as to Borrower,
Guarantor or the Property.

 

(b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default
described in clauses (vi), (vii) or (viii) above) and at any time thereafter, in
addition to any other rights or remedies available to it pursuant to this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents or at law or in equity, Lender may take
such action, without notice or demand, that Lender deems advisable to protect
and enforce its rights against Borrower and in and to the Property, including,
without limitation, declaring the Obligations to be immediately due and payable,
and Lender may enforce or avail itself of any or all rights or remedies provided
in the Loan Documents against Borrower and the Property, including, without
limitation, all rights or remedies available at law or in equity; and upon any
Event of Default described in clauses (vi), (vii) or (viii) above, the Debt and
all Other Obligations of Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
shall immediately and automatically become due and payable, without notice or
demand, and Borrower hereby expressly waives any such notice or demand, anything
contained herein or in any other Loan Document to the contrary notwithstanding.

 

8.1.2 Remedies.

 

(a) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, all or any one or more of the
rights, powers, privileges and other remedies available to Lender against
Borrower under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents executed and
delivered by, or applicable to, Borrower or at law or in equity may be exercised
by Lender at any time and from time to time (including, without limitation,
Lender may accelerate the Loan and declare the Outstanding Principal Balance and
all other amounts under the Loan Documents due and payable and institute
foreclosure proceedings), whether or not all or any of the Debt shall be
declared due and payable, and whether or not Lender shall have commenced any
foreclosure proceeding or other action for the enforcement of its rights and
remedies under any of the Loan Documents. Any such actions taken by Lender shall
be cumulative and concurrent and may be pursued independently, singularly,
successively, together or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender
may determine in its sole discretion, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
without impairing or otherwise affecting the other rights and remedies of Lender
permitted by law, equity or contract or as set forth herein or in the other Loan
Documents. To the fullest extent permitted by law or equity, without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Borrower agrees that if an Event of Default is
continuing (i) Lender shall not be subject to any “one action” or “election of
remedies” law or rule, and (ii) all liens and other rights, remedies or
privileges provided to Lender shall remain in full force and effect until Lender
has exhausted all of its remedies against the Property and the Security
Instrument has been foreclosed, sold and/or otherwise realized upon in
satisfaction of the Debt or the Obligations have been paid in full.

 

 37 

 

 

(b) With respect to Borrower and the Property, nothing contained herein or in
any other Loan Document shall be construed as requiring Lender to resort to the
Property for the satisfaction of any of the Debt in any preference or priority,
and Lender may seek satisfaction out of the Property, or any part thereof, in
its absolute discretion in respect of the Debt. In addition, Lender shall have
the right from time to time to partially foreclose the Security Instrument in
any manner and for any amounts secured by the Security Instrument then due and
payable as determined by Lender in its sole discretion, including, without
limitation, the following circumstances: (i) in the event Borrower defaults
beyond any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more scheduled
payments of principal and interest, Lender may foreclose the Security Instrument
to recover such delinquent payments or (ii) in the event Lender elects to
accelerate less than the entire Outstanding Principal Balance, Lender may
foreclose the Security Instrument to recover so much of the principal balance of
the Loan as Lender may accelerate and such other sums secured by the Security
Instrument as Lender may elect. Notwithstanding one or more partial
foreclosures, the Property shall remain subject to the Security Instrument to
secure payment of sums secured by the Security Instrument and not previously
recovered.

 

(c) Lender shall have the right from time to time to partially foreclose the
Security Instrument in any manner and for any amounts secured by the Security
Instrument then due and payable as determined by Lender in its sole discretion,
including the following circumstances: (i) in the event Borrower defaults beyond
any applicable grace period in the payment of one or more scheduled payments of
principal and/or interest, Lender may foreclose the Security Instrument to
recover such delinquent payments, or (ii) in the event Lender elects to
accelerate less than the entire Outstanding Principal Balance, Lender may
foreclose the Security Instrument to recover so much of the Debt as Lender may
accelerate and such other sums secured by the Security Instrument as Lender may
elect. Notwithstanding one or more partial foreclosures, the Property shall
remain subject to the Security Instrument to secure payment of sums secured by
the Security Instrument and not previously recovered.

 

(d) To the fullest possible extent permitted by applicable law or equity, any
amounts recovered from the Property or any other collateral for the Loan after
an Event of Default may be applied by Lender toward the payment of any interest
and/or principal of the Loan and/or any other amounts due under the Loan
Documents in such order, priority and proportions as Lender in its sole
discretion shall determine.

 

(e) If an Event of Default exists, Lender may (directly or by its agents,
employees, contractors, engineers, architects, nominees, attorneys or other
representatives), but without any obligation to do so and without notice to
Borrower and without releasing Borrower from any obligation hereunder, cure the
Event of Default in such manner and to such extent as Lender may deem necessary
to protect the security hereof. Subject to Tenants’ rights under the Leases,
Lender (and its agents, employees, contractors, engineers, architects, nominees,
attorneys or other representatives) are authorized to enter upon the Property to
cure such Event of Default, and Lender is authorized to appear in, defend, or
bring any action or proceeding reasonably necessary to maintain, secure or
otherwise protect the Property or the priority of the Lien granted by the
Security Instrument.

 

(f) Lender may appear in and defend any action or proceeding brought with
respect to the Property and may bring any action or proceeding, in the name and
on behalf of Borrower, which Lender, in its sole discretion, decides should be
brought to protect its interest in the Property. Lender shall, at its option, be
subrogated to the Lien of any mortgage or other security instrument discharged
in whole or in part by the Obligations, and any such subrogation rights shall
constitute additional security for the payment of the Obligations.

 

(g) As used in this Section 8.1.2, a “foreclosure” shall include, without
limitation, a power of sale.

 

8.1.3 Remedies Cumulative; Waivers. The rights, powers and remedies of Lender
under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right,
power or remedy which Lender may have against Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or
otherwise. Lender’s rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singularly,
concurrently or otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may
determine in Lender’s sole discretion. No delay or omission to exercise any
remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such
remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such
remedy, right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be
deemed expedient. A waiver of one Default or Event of Default with respect to
Borrower shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or
Event of Default by Borrower or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent
thereon.

8.1.4 CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT. THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH SETS FORTH A WARRANT OF
AUTHORITY FOR ANY ATTORNEY TO CONFESS JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BORROWER. IN GRANTING
THIS WARRANT OF ATTORNEY TO CONFESS JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BORROWER, BORROWER,
FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH (OR DECISION NOT TO CONSULT) COUNSEL FOR BORROWER
AND WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THE LEGAL EFFECT HEREOF, HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY,
VOLUNTARILY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS BORROWER HAS OR MAY
HAVE TO PRIOR NOTICE AND AN OPPORTUNITY OF REHEARING UNDER THE RESPECTIVE
CONSTITUTIONS AND LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, THE COMMONWEALTH OF
PENNSYLVANIA, OR ELSEWHERE. IT IS SPECIFICALLY ACKNOWLEDGED BY BORROWER THAT
LENDER HAS RELIED ON THIS WARRANT OF ATTORNEY AS AN INDUCEMENT TWO GRANT
FINANCIAL ACCOMMODATIONS TO BORROWER. UPON AND FOLLOWING THE OCCURRENCE OF AN
UNCURED EVENT OF DEFAULT, BORROWER HEREBY AUTHORIZES AND EMPOWERS ANY ATTORNEY
OF ANY COURT OF RECORD OR THE PROTHONOTARY OR CLERK OF ANY COUNTY IN THE
COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA, OR IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE PERMITTED BY LAW OR
THE CLERK OF ANY UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT, TO APPEAR FOR BORROWER IN ANY AND
ALL ACTIONS WHICH MAY BE BROUGHT HEREUNDER AND ENTER AND CONFESS JUDGMENT
AGAINST BORROWER OR ANY OF THEM IN FAVOR OF LENDER FOR SUCH SUMS AS ARE DUE OR
MAY BECOME DUE HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, TOGETHER WITH COSTS
OF SUIT AND ACTUAL COLLECTION COSTS INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, REASONABLE
ATTORNEYS’ FEES EQUAL TO FIVE PERCENT (5%) OF THE LIABILITIES THEN DUE AND OWING
BUT IN NO EVENT LESS THAN $5,000, WITH OR WITHOUT DECLARATION, WITHOUT PRIOR
NOTICE, WITHOUT STAY OF EXECUTION AND WITH RELEASE OF ALL PROCEDURAL ERRORS AND
THE RIGHT TO ISSUE EXECUTIONS FORTHWITH. IF A COPY OF THIS NOTE VERIFIED BY
AFFIDAVIT OF ANY OFFICER OF LENDER SHALL HAVE BEEN FILED IN SUCH ACTION, IT
SHALL NOT BE NECESSARY TO FILE THE ORIGINAL THEREOF AS A WARRANT OF ATTORNEY,
ANY PRACTICE OR USAGE TO THE CONTRARY NOTWITHSTANDING. THE AUTHORITY HEREIN
GRANTED TO CONFESS JUDGMENT SHALL NOT BE EXHAUSTED BY ANY SINGLE EXERCISE
THEREOF, BUT SHALL CONTINUE AND MAY BE EXERCISED FROM TIME TO TIME AS OFTEN AS
LENDER SHALL FIND IT NECESSARY AND DESIRABLE AND AT ALL TIMES UNTIL FULL PAYMENT
OF ALL AMOUNTS DUE HEREUNDER AND UNDER THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. LENDER MAY
CONFESS ONE OR MORE JUDGMENTS IN THE SAME OR DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS FOR ALL OR
ANY PART OF BORROWER’S OBLIGATIONS ARISING HEREUNDER OR UNDER ANY OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENT TO WHICH BORROWER IS A PARTY, WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER JUDGMENT HAS
THERETOFORE BEEN CONFESSED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION FOR THE SAME OBLIGATIONS.
IN THE EVENT THAT ANY JUDGMENT CONFESSED AGAINST BORROWER IS STRICKEN OR OPENED
UPON APPLICATION BY OR ON BEHALF OF BORROWER FOR ANY REASONS, LENDER IS HEREBY
AUTHORIZED AND EMPOWERED TO AGAIN APPEAR FOR AND CONFESS JUDGMENT AGAINST
BORROWER FOR ANY PART OR ALL OF THE LIABILITIES DUE AND OWING UNDER THIS NOTE
AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, AS HEREIN PROVIDED.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS

 

Section 9.1 Transfer of Loan. Lender may, at any time, sell, transfer or assign
this Agreement, the Note, the Security Instrument and the other Loan Documents,
and any or all servicing rights with respect thereto, or grant participations
therein or issue mortgage pass-through certificates or other securities (the
“Securities”) evidencing a beneficial interest in a rated or unrated public
offering or private placement (such sales, participation, offering and/or
placement, collectively, a “Lender Assignment”). Lender may forward to each
purchaser, transferee, assignee, servicer, participant or investor in such
participations or Securities (collectively, the “Investor”), each prospective
Investor, and any organization maintaining databases on the underwriting and
performance of commercial mortgage loans, all documents and information which
Lender now has or may hereafter acquire relating to the Loan or to Borrower, any
Guarantor or the Property, whether furnished by Borrower, any Guarantor or
otherwise, as Lender determines necessary or desirable, including, without
limitation, financial statements relating to Borrower, Guarantor, the Property
and any Tenant at the Property. Borrower irrevocably waives any and all rights
it may have under law or in equity to prohibit such disclosure, including but
not limited to any right of privacy.

Section 9.2 Severed Loan Documents. Lender shall have the right from time to
time to sever the Note and the other Loan Documents into one or more separate
notes, mortgages and other security documents (the “Severed Loan Documents”) in

of evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies provided hereunder. Borrower
shall execute and deliver (and cause other parties who executed any of the Loan
Documents to execute and deliver) to Lender from time to time, promptly after
the request of Lender, a severance agreement and such other documents as Lender
may reasonably request in order to effect the severance described in the
preceding sentence, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender
and Borrower. The Severed Loan Documents shall not contain any representations,

selected by Lender and Lender may delegate all or any portion of its
responsibilities under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to Servicer
pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement, servicing agreement, special
servicing agreement or other agreement providing for the servicing of one or
more mortgage loans (collectively, the “Servicing Agreement”) between Lender and
Servicer. Without limitation, Borrower shall promptly reimburse Lender on demand
for (a) interest payable on advances made by Servicer with respect to delinquent
debt service payments (to the extent interest at the Default Rate actually paid
by Borrower in respect of such payments are insufficient to pay the same) or
expenses paid by Servicer or trustee in respect of the protection and
preservation of the Property (including, without limitation, on account of Basic
Carrying Costs), (b) all costs and expenses, liquidation fees, workout fees,
special servicing fees, operating advisor fees or any other similar fees payable
by Lender to Servicer which may be due and payable under the Servicing Agreement

under the Loan, the Loan becoming specially serviced, the commencement or
continuance of any enforcement action of any kind with respect to the Loan or
any of the Loan Documents, a refinancing or a restructuring of the credit
arrangements provided under this Agreement in the nature of a “work-out” of the
Loan Documents, or any Bankruptcy Action involving Borrower, Principal,
Guarantor or any of their respective principals or Affiliates, (c) all costs and
expenses of any Property inspections and/or appraisals (or any updates to any
existing inspection or appraisal) that Servicer or the trustee may be required
to obtain (but not more than one appraisal in any twelve months unless an Event
of Default exists), and (d) all costs and expenses relating to or arising from
any special requests made by Borrower or Guarantor during the term of the Loan

Section 10.8 Headings. The Article and/or Section headings and the Table of
Contents in this Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only
and shall not constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.

 

Section 10.9 Severability. Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent
of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such
provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.10 Preferences. Lender shall have the continuing and exclusive right
to apply or reverse and reapply any and all payments by Borrower to any portion
of the Debt. To the extent Borrower makes a payment or payments to Lender, which
payment or proceeds or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared
to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a
trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state or Federal
law, common law or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or
proceeds received, the Obligations hereunder or part thereof intended to be
satisfied shall be revived and continue in full force and effect, as if such
payment or proceeds had not been received by Lender.

 

Section 10.11 Waiver of Notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives, and shall not
be entitled to any notices of any nature whatsoever from Lender except with
respect to matters for which this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by Lender to
Borrower and except with respect to matters for which Borrower is not, pursuant
to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of notice.

 

Section 10.12 Remedies of Borrower. In the event that a claim or adjudication is
made that Lender or its agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed
acting in any case where by law or under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents, Lender or such agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act
reasonably or promptly, Borrower agrees that neither Lender nor its agents shall
be liable for any monetary damages, and Borrower’s sole remedies shall be
limited to commencing an action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory
judgment. The parties hereto agree that any action or proceeding to determine
whether Lender has acted reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking
declaratory judgment. Further, it is agreed Lender shall not be in default under
this Agreement, or under any other Loan Document, unless a written notice
specifically setting forth the claim of Borrower shall have been given to Lender
within thirty (30) days after Borrower first had knowledge of the occurrence of
the event which Borrower alleges gave rise to such claim and Lender does not
remedy or cure the default, if any there be, promptly thereafter. Failure to
give such notice shall constitute a waiver of such claim.

 

Section 10.13 Expenses; Indemnity.

 

(a) Borrower covenants and agrees to pay or, if Borrower fails to pay, to
reimburse, Lender upon receipt of notice from Lender for all costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements) incurred by Lender in

Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and all the costs of furnishing all opinions by
counsel for Borrower (including without limitation any opinions requested by
Lender as to any legal matters arising under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents with respect to the Property); (ii) Borrower’s ongoing performance of
and compliance with Borrower’s respective agreements and covenants contained in
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or

performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or complied
with after the Closing Date; (iv) the negotiation, preparation, execution,

expenses of counsel for providing to Lender all required legal opinions, and
other similar expenses incurred in creating and perfecting the Liens in favor of
Lender pursuant to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (vii) enforcing
or preserving any rights, either in response to third party claims or in
prosecuting or defending any action or proceeding or other litigation, in each
case against, under or affecting Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, the Property, or any other security given for the Loan; and (viii)
enforcing any obligations of or collecting any payments due from Borrower under
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or with respect to the Property, or in
connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements
provided under this Agreement in the nature of a “work-out” or of any insolvency
or bankruptcy proceedings or any other amounts required under Section 9.3;
provided, however, that Borrower shall not be liable for the payment of any such
costs and expenses to the extent the same arise by reason of the gross
negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful misconduct of Lender. Any cost and
expenses due and payable to Lender may be paid by Lender from any Reserve
Account.

(b) Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties
from and against any and all other liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements
of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel for Lender in connection with any
investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened,
whether or not Lender shall be designated a party thereto), that may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against any Indemnified Party in any manner
relating to or arising out of (i) any breach by Borrower of its Obligations
under, or any misrepresentation by Borrower contained in, this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents, or (ii) the use or intended use of the proceeds of the
Loan (the liabilities, losses, costs, expenses and other matters described in
this subparagraph (b), collectively, the “Indemnified Liabilities”); provided,
however, that Borrower shall not have any obligation to an Indemnified Party
hereunder to the extent that such Indemnified Liabilities arise from the gross
negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party.
To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold harmless set
forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it violates any law
or public policy, Borrower shall pay the maximum portion that it is permitted to
pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and satisfaction of all
Indemnified Liabilities incurred by the Indemnified Parties.

 

Section 10.14 Exhibits and Schedules Incorporated. Any Exhibits and Schedules
annexed hereto are hereby incorporated herein as a part of this Agreement with
the same effect as if set forth in the body hereof.

 

Section 10.15 Offsets, Counterclaims and Defenses. Any assignee of Lender’s
interest in and to this Agreement, the Note and the other Loan Documents shall
take the same free and clear of all offsets, counterclaims or defenses solely to
the extent such offsets, counterclaims or defenses are unrelated to such
documents which Borrower may otherwise have against any assignor of such
documents, and no such unrelated counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or
asserted by Borrower in any action or proceeding brought by any such assignee
upon such documents and any such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated
offset, counterclaim or defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby
expressly waived by Borrower.

 

Section 10.16 No Joint Venture or Partnership; No Third Party Beneficiaries.

 

(a) Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships created hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and lender. Nothing
herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture, partnership,
tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower and Lender nor
to grant Lender any interest in the Property other than that of mortgagee,
beneficiary or lender.

 

(b) This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the benefit of
Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender and Borrower
any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of any of
the Obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions to the obligations
of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and exclusively for the
benefit of Lender and no other Person shall have standing to require
satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be entitled to
assume that Lender will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of strict
compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall under any
circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of
which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender’s sole
discretion, Lender deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

 

Section 10.17 Publicity. All news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower
or its Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which
refers to the Loan Documents or the financing evidenced by the Loan Documents,
to Lender or any of its Affiliates shall be subject to the prior approval of
Lender.

 

Section 10.18 Waiver of Marshalling of Assets; Homestead Waiver. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and its successors and assigns,
waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of Borrower, Borrower’s
partners and others with interests in Borrower, and of the Property, or to a
sale in inverse order of alienation in the event of foreclosure of the Security
Instrument, and agrees not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the
marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead
exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters
whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan
Documents to a sale of the Property for the collection of the Debt without any
prior or different resort for collection or of the right of Lender to the
payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the Property in preference to
every other claimant whatsoever. To the extent permitted by applicable law,
Borrower hereby waives any Homestead protections that may be available to
Borrower under the law of the state in which the Property is located.

 

 45 

 

 

Section 10.19 Waiver of Counterclaim. Borrower hereby waives the right to assert
a counterclaim, other than a compulsory counterclaim, in any action or
proceeding brought against it by Lender or its agents.

 

Section 10.20 Conflict; Construction of Documents; Reliance. In the event of any
conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any of the other Loan
Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall control. The parties hereto
acknowledge that they were represented by competent counsel in connection with
the negotiation, drafting and execution of the Loan Documents and that such Loan
Documents shall not be subject to the principle of construing their meaning
against the party which drafted same. Borrower acknowledges that, with respect
to the Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its own judgment and advisors in
entering into the Loan without relying in any manner on any statements,
representations or recommendations of Lender or any Affiliate of Lender. Lender
shall not be subject to any limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any rights
or remedies available to it under any of the Loan Documents or any other
agreements or instruments which govern the Loan by virtue of the ownership by it
or any parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender of any equity interest any of
them may acquire in Borrower, and Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right
to raise any defense or take any action on the basis of the foregoing with
respect to Lender’s exercise of any such rights or remedies. Borrower
acknowledges that Lender engages in the business of real estate financings and
other real estate transactions and investments which may be viewed as adverse to
or competitive with the business of Borrower or its Affiliates.

 

Section 10.21 Brokers and Financial Advisors. Borrower hereby represents that it
has dealt with no financial advisors, brokers, underwriters, placement agents,
agents or finders in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement other than Direct Lending Partners LLC, which arranged the Loan.
Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Lender harmless from and
against any and all claims, liabilities, costs and expenses of any kind
(including Lender’s attorneys’ fees and expenses) in any way relating to or
arising from a claim by any Person that such Person acted on behalf of Borrower
or Lender in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. The
provisions of this Section 10.21 shall survive the expiration and termination of
this Agreement and the payment of the Debt.

 

Section 10.22 Prior Agreements. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents
contain the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and all prior agreements among or
between such parties, whether oral or written, including, without limitation,
the Term Sheet dated April 13, 2020 between Borrower (or an agent or
representative of Borrower) and Lender, are superseded by the terms of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

 

Section 10.23 Cumulative Rights. All of the rights of Lender under this
Agreement hereunder and under each of the other Loan Documents and any other
agreement now or hereafter executed in connection herewith or therewith, shall
be cumulative and may be exercised singly, together, or in such combination as
Lender may determine in its sole judgment.

 

Section 10.24 Counterparts; Electronic Delivery. This Agreement and all of the
other Loan Documents may be executed in several counterparts, each of which when
executed and delivered is an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one instrument. In making proof of this Agreement, it shall not be
necessary to produce or account for more than one such counterpart which is
executed by the party against whom enforcement of this Agreement is sought. The
delivery of an executed counterpart of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
(other than Note) by facsimile or as a PDF or similar attachment to an email
shall constitute effective delivery of such counterpart for all purposes with
the same force and effect as the delivery of an original, executed counterpart.

 

Section 10.25 Time is of the Essence. Time is of the essence of each provision
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

 

 46 

 

 

Section 10.26 Consent of Holder. Wherever this Agreement refers to Lender’s
consent or discretion or other rights, such references to Lender shall be deemed
to refer to any holder of the Loan. The holder of the Loan may from time to time
appoint a trustee or servicer, and Borrower shall be entitled to rely upon
written instructions executed by a purported officer of the holder of the Loan
as to the extent of authority delegated to any such trustee or from time to time
and determinations made by such trustee or servicer to the extent identified as
within the delegated authority of such trustee or servicer, unless and until
such instructions are superseded by further written instructions from the holder
of the Loan.

 

Section 10.27 Successor Laws. Any reference in this Agreement to any statute or
regulation shall be deemed to include any successor statute or regulation.

 

Section 10.28 Reliance on Third Parties. Lender may perform any of its
responsibilities hereunder through one or more agents, attorneys or independent
contractors. In addition, Lender may conclusively rely upon the advice or
determinations of any such agents, attorneys or independent contractors in
performing any discretionary function under the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.29 Joint Borrower. The representations, covenants, warranties and
obligations of Borrower shall be joint and several. Each entity that constitutes
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it shall be jointly and severally liable
for the Loan and all other Obligations arising under this Agreement and/or any
of the other Loan Documents. In furtherance thereof, each Borrower acknowledges
and agrees as follows:

 

(a) For the purpose of implementing the joint borrower provisions of the Loan
Documents, each Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints each other Borrower as its
agent and attorney-in-fact for all purposes of the Loan Documents, including the
giving and receiving of notices and other communications.

 

(b) To induce Lender to make the Loan, and in consideration thereof, each
Borrower hereby agrees to indemnify Lender against, and hold Lender harmless
from, any and all liabilities, expenses, losses, damages and/or claims of damage
or injury asserted against Lender by any Borrower or by any other Person arising
from or incurred by reason of (i) reliance by Lender on any requests or
instructions from any Borrower, or (ii) any other action taken by Lender in good
faith with respect to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

 

(c) Each Borrower acknowledges that the liens and security interests created or
granted herein and by the other Loan Documents will secure the Obligations of
all Borrowers under the Loan Documents and, in full recognition of that fact,
each Borrower consents and agrees that Lender may, at any time and from time to
time, without notice or demand, and without affecting the enforceability or
security hereof or of any other Loan Document:

 

(i) agree with any Borrower to supplement, modify, amend, extend, renew,
accelerate, or otherwise change the time for payment or the terms of the
Obligations or any part thereof, including any increase or decrease of the
rate(s) of interest thereon;

 

(ii) agree with any Borrower to supplement, modify, amend or waive, or enter
into or give any agreement, approval or consent with respect to, the Obligations
or any part thereof or any of the Loan Documents or any additional security or
guaranties, or any condition, covenant, default, remedy, right, representation
or term thereof or thereunder;

 

(iii) accept new or additional instruments, documents or agreements in exchange
for or relative to any of the Loan Documents or the Obligations or any part
thereof;

 

(iv) accept partial payments on the Obligations;

 

(v) receive and hold additional security or guaranties for the Obligations or
any part thereof;

 

 47 

 

 

(vi) release, reconvey, terminate, waive, abandon, subordinate, exchange,
substitute, transfer and enforce any security for or guaranties of the
Obligations, and apply any security and direct the order or manner of sale
thereof as Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion may determine;

 

(vii) release any Person or any guarantor from any personal liability with
respect to the Obligations or any part thereof; or

 

(viii) settle, release on terms satisfactory to Lender or by operation of
applicable laws or otherwise liquidate or enforce any Obligations and any
security therefor or guaranty thereof in any manner, consent to the transfer of
any such security and bid and purchase at any sale; and consent to the merger,
change or any other restructuring or termination of the corporate existence of
any Borrower or any other Person, and correspondingly restructure the
obligations of such Borrower or other Person, and any such merger, change,
restructuring or termination shall not affect the liability of any Borrower or
the continuing existence of any lien or security interest hereunder, under any
other Loan Document to which any Borrower is a party or the enforceability
hereof or thereof with respect to all or any part of the Obligations.

 

(d) Upon the occurrence of and during the continuance of any Event of Default,
Lender may enforce this Agreement and the other Loan Documents independently as
to each Borrower and independently of any other remedy or security Lender at any
time may have or hold in connection with the Obligations, and in collecting on
the Loan it shall not be necessary for Lender to marshal assets in favor of any
Borrower or any other Person or to proceed upon or against and/or exhaust any
other security or remedy before proceeding to enforce this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents. Each Borrower expressly waives any right to require
Lender, in connection with Lender’s efforts to obtain repayment of the Loan and
Other Obligations, to marshal assets in favor of any Borrower or any other
Person or to proceed against any other Person or any collateral provided by any
other Person, and agrees that Lender may proceed against any Persons and/or
collateral in such order as it shall determine in its sole and absolute
discretion in connection with Lender’s efforts to obtain repayment of the Loan
and other Obligations. Lender may file a separate action or actions against each
Borrower to enforce the Obligations, whether action is brought or prosecuted
with respect to any other security or against any other Person, or whether any
other Person is joined in any such action or actions. Each Borrower agrees that
Lender, each Borrower and/or any other Person may deal with each other in
connection with the Obligations or otherwise, or alter any contracts or
agreements now or hereafter existing between any of them, in any manner
whatsoever, all without in any way altering or affecting the security of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents. The rights of Lender hereunder and under
the other Loan Documents shall be reinstated and revived, and the enforceability
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall continue, with respect to
any amount at any time paid on account of the Obligations which thereafter shall
be required to be restored or returned by Lender as a result of the bankruptcy,
insolvency or reorganization of any Borrower or any other Person, or otherwise,
all as though such amount had not been paid. The enforceability of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents at all times shall remain effective even
though any or all Obligations, or any other security or guaranty therefor, may
be or hereafter may become invalid or otherwise unenforceable as against any
Borrower or any other Person and whether or not any Borrower or any other Person
shall have any personal liability with respect thereto. Each Borrower expressly
waives any and all defenses to the enforcement of its Obligations under the Loan
Documents now or hereafter arising or asserted by reason of (i) any disability
or other defense of any Borrower or any other Person with respect to the
Obligations, (ii) the unenforceability or invalidity of any security or guaranty
for the Obligations or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection or
failure of priority of any security for the Obligations, (iii) the cessation for
any cause whatsoever of the liability of any Borrower or any other Person (other
than by reason of the full and final payment and performance of all
Obligations), (iv) any failure of Lender to marshal assets in favor of any of
the Borrowers or any other Person, (v) any failure of Lender to give notice of
sale or other disposition of any Collateral for the Obligations to any Borrower
or to any other Person or any defect in any notice that may be given in
connection with any such sale or disposition, (vi) any failure of Lender to
comply in any non-material respect with applicable laws in connection with the
sale or other disposition of any collateral or other security for any
Obligation, (vii) any act or omission of Lender or others that directly or
indirectly results in or aids the discharge or release of any Borrower or of any
other Person or of any of the Obligations or any other security or guaranty
therefor by operation of law or otherwise, (viii) any law which provides that
the obligation of a surety or guarantor must neither be larger in amount nor in
other respects more burdensome than that of the principal or which reduces a
surety’s or guarantor’s obligation in proportion to the principal obligation,
(ix) any failure of Lender to file or enforce a claim in any bankruptcy or
similar proceeding with respect to any Person, (x) the election by Lender, in
any bankruptcy or similar proceeding of any Person, of the application or
non-application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, (xi) any extension
of credit or the grant of any lien under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code
except to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement, (xii) any use of cash
collateral under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, (xiii) any agreement or
stipulation with respect to the provision of adequate protection in any
bankruptcy or similar proceeding of any Person, (xiv) the avoidance of any lien
or security interest in favor of Lender securing the Obligations for any reason,
or (xv) any bankruptcy or similar proceeding commenced by or against any Person,
including any discharge of, or bar or stay against collecting, all or any of the
Obligations (or any interest thereon) in or as a result of any such proceeding.
Without in any way limiting the foregoing, with respect to the Loan Documents
and the Obligations, Borrower: (A) waives all rights and defenses arising out of
an election of remedies by Lender even though that election of remedies, such as
non-judicial foreclosure with respect to security for Borrowers’ obligations,
has destroyed each of their rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the
other; and (B) waives any right to a fair value hearing or similar proceeding
following a non-judicial foreclosure of the Obligations.

 

 48 

 

 

(e) Borrowers represent and warrant to Lender that they have established
adequate means of obtaining from each other, on a continuing basis, financial
and other information pertaining to their respective businesses, operations and
condition (financial and otherwise) and their respective properties, and each
now is and hereafter will be completely familiar with the businesses, operations
and condition (financial and otherwise) of the other and their respective
properties. Each Borrower hereby expressly waives and relinquishes any duty on
the part of Lender to disclose to such Borrower any matter, fact or thing
related to the businesses, operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of
the other Borrowers or the other Borrowers’ properties, whether now known or
hereafter known by Lender during the life of this Agreement. With respect to any
of the Obligations, Lender need not inquire into the powers of any Borrower or
the officers, employees or other Persons acting or purporting to act on such
Borrower’s behalf.

 

(f) Without limiting the foregoing, or anything else contained in this
Agreement, each Borrower waives all rights and defenses that it may have because
the Obligations are secured by real property. This means, among other things:

 

(i) Lender may collect on the Obligations from any Borrower without first
foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by the other
Borrowers; and

 

(ii) If Lender foreclose on any real property collateral pledged by any Borrower
for the Obligations: (A) the amount of the indebtedness owed by the other
Borrowers may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at
the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price;
and (B) Lender may collect from any Borrower even if Lender, by foreclosing on
the real property collateral, has destroyed any right any Borrower may have to
collect from the other Borrowers.

 

(iii) This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses
each Borrower may have because the Obligations are secured by real property.
Each Borrower expressly waives any right to receive notice of any judicial or
nonjudicial foreclosure or sale of any real property collateral provided by the
other Borrowers to secure the Obligations and failure to receive any such notice
shall not impair or affect such Borrower’s obligations hereunder or the
enforceability of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any liens
created or granted hereby or thereby.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere contained herein or in
any other Loan Document to which any Borrower is a party, with respect to the
Loan and all other Obligations, each Borrower hereby waives with respect to the
other Borrowers and their successors and assigns (including any surety) and any
other Person any and all rights at law or in equity, to subrogation, to
reimbursement, to exoneration, to contribution, to set-off, to any other rights
and defenses available to it or to any other rights that could accrue to a
surety against a principal, to a guarantor against a maker or obligor, to an
accommodation party against the party accommodated, or to a holder or transferee
against a maker and which each of them may have or hereafter acquire against the
other or any other Person in connection with or as a result of such Borrower’s
execution, delivery and/or performance of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document to which it is a party until the Obligations are paid and performed in
full. Each Borrower agrees that it shall not have or assert any such rights
against any other Borrower or any other Borrower’s successors and assigns or any
other Person (including any surety), either directly or as an attempted set-off
to any action commenced against such Borrower by any other Borrower (as borrower
or in any other capacity) or any other Person until all the Obligations are paid
and performed in full. Each Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that this
waiver is intended to benefit Lender and shall not limit or otherwise affect any
Borrower’s liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to which it
is a party, or the enforceability hereof or thereof.

 

EACH BORROWER WARRANTS AND AGREES THAT EACH OF THE WAIVERS AND CONSENTS SET
FORTH HEREIN IS MADE WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ITS SIGNIFICANCE AND CONSEQUENCES,
WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT EVENTS GIVING RISE TO ANY DEFENSE WAIVED MAY
DIMINISH, DESTROY OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT RIGHTS WHICH EACH OTHERWISE MAY
HAVE AGAINST THE OTHER, AGAINST LENDER OR OTHERS, OR AGAINST ANY COLLATERAL. IF
ANY OF THE WAIVERS OR CONSENTS HEREIN IS DETERMINED TO BE CONTRARY TO ANY
APPLICABLE LAW OR PUBLIC POLICY, SUCH WAIVERS AND CONSENTS SHALL BE EFFECTIVE TO
THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.
