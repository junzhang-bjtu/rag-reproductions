CREDIT AGREEMENT

This CREDIT AGREEMENT (including all exhibits and schedules hereto, as the same
may be amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified from time to time, this “Agreement”) is entered into as of May 22,
2020, by and among AMERCO, a Nevada corporation (the “Borrower”), the several
financial institutions from time to time party to this Agreement as lenders
(collectively, the “Lenders” and each individually, a “Lender”) and PNC BANK,
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as the administrative agent for the Lenders.

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Borrower has requested, and the Lenders have agreed to make
available to the Borrower, a $200,000,000 term loan facility upon and subject to
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement to be used by the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries for working capital, general corporate purposes and capital
expenditures;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements, provisions and
covenants contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE CREDITS

Section 1.1Amounts and Terms of Commitments.

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, and in reliance upon
the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained herein, each Lender
severally and not jointly agrees to make term loans (each such loan, a “Loan”
and, collectively, the “Loans”) to the Borrower on the Closing Date in such
principal amount as the Borrower shall request up to, but not exceeding, such
Lender’s Commitment, following proper delivery of a Loan Notice pursuant to
Section 1.5 hereof.

(b)The obligations of each Lender to make Loans to the Borrower shall equal its
Commitment; provided that no Lender’s Loan to the Borrower shall exceed its
Commitment.  The Lenders shall have no obligation to make Loans hereunder after
the Closing Date, and any portion of the Commitments not drawn on the Closing
Date shall automatically expire.  The Commitments are not revolving credit
commitments, and the Borrower shall not have the right to borrow, repay
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with a mandatory
prepayment) and reborrow under this Agreement.

(c)The Loans may be Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar Rate Loans, as further
provided herein.

Section 1.2Notes.  The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by this
Agreement and, if requested by such Lender, a Note payable to such Lender or its
registered assigns.

Section 1.3Interest.

(a)Subject to subsections 1.3(c) and 1.3(d), (i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan shall
bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest
Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period
plus the Applicable Margin; and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on
the outstanding principal amount thereof from the borrowing date at a rate per
annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.  Each determination of
an interest rate by the Agent shall be










conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of
manifest error.  All computations of fees and interest payable under this
Agreement for Base Rate Loans shall be made on the basis of a year of 365/366
days.  All other computations of fees and interest payable under this Agreement
shall be made on the basis of a 360 day year and actual days elapsed.  Interest
and fees shall accrue during each period during which interest or such fees are
computed from the first day thereof to the last day thereof.

(b)Interest on each Loan shall be paid in arrears on each Interest Payment
Date.  Interest on mandatory prepayments of principal under Section 1.8 shall be
due on the date such mandatory prepayment is due.

(c)Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and until such time such Event of
Default is cured or waived, each Obligation and other amounts due hereunder (in
each case whether or not overdue) shall bear interest (after as well as before
entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) at a rate per annum
equal to the sum of the rate of interest applicable to Base Rate Loans (i.e. the
sum of the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin) plus an additional two percent
(2.00%) from the date of such Event of Default until the earlier of (i) the date
when such amount owed is paid in full in cash and (ii) the date the Event of
Default is cured or waived.  The Borrower acknowledges that the increase in
rates referred to in this clause (c) reflects, among other things, the fact that
such Loans or other amounts have become a substantially greater risk given their
default status and that the Lenders are entitled to additional compensation for
such risk; and all such interest shall be payable by Borrower upon demand by the
Agent.

(d)Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations of the
Borrower hereunder shall be subject to the limitation that payments of interest
shall not be required, for any period for which interest is computed hereunder,
to the extent (but only to the extent) that contracting for or receiving such
payment by the respective Lender would be contrary to the provisions of any law
applicable to such Lender limiting the highest rate of interest which may be
lawfully contracted for, charged or received by such Lender, and in such event
the Borrower shall pay such Lender interest at the highest rate permitted by
applicable law (“Maximum Lawful Rate”); provided, however, that if at any time
thereafter the rate of interest payable hereunder is less than the Maximum
Lawful Rate, the Borrower shall continue to pay interest hereunder at the
Maximum Lawful Rate until such time as the total interest received by the Agent,
on behalf of Lenders, is equal to the total interest that would have been
received had the interest payable hereunder been (but for the operation of this
paragraph) the interest rate payable since the Closing Date as otherwise
provided in this Agreement.

Section 1.4Loan Accounts.  The Loans made by each Lender shall be evidenced by
one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Agent in
the ordinary course of business.  The accounts or records maintained by the
Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of
the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments
thereon.  Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however,
limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any
amount owing with respect to the Obligations.  In the event of any conflict
between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and
records of the Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the
Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.  Upon the request of any
Lender made through the Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such
Lender (through the Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s Loans in
addition to such accounts or records.  Each Lender may attach schedules to its
Note and endorse thereon the date, Type, amount and maturity of its Loans and
payments with respect thereto.

Section 1.5Procedure for Borrowing; Conversions, Continuations.

(a)The Borrowing to be made on the Closing Date, each conversion of Loans from
one Type to the other, and each continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be
made upon the Borrower’s




-2-





irrevocable notice to the Agent, which may be given by: (A) telephone (except in
the case of the Borrowing on the Closing Date) or (B) a Loan Notice; provided
that any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the
Agent of a Loan Notice; provided further Agent may rely on the authority of any
individual making such a telephonic request without the necessity of receipt of
such written confirmation.  Each such notice must be received by the Agent not
later than 10:00 a.m. eastern time (i) three (3) Business Days prior to the
requested date of any Borrowing of (in the case of the Closing Date only),
conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) on the requested
date of any Borrowing of (in the case of the Closing Date only) Base Rate Loans
and (iii) the last day of the preceding Interest Period with respect to any
conversion of Eurodollar Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans.  Each Loan Notice given
pursuant to this Section 1.5 must be appropriately completed and signed by a
Responsible Officer of the Borrower.  Each conversion to or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of at least $5,000,000. 
Each conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of at least
$1,000,000.  Each Loan Notice shall be irrevocable.  Each Loan Notice and each
telephonic notice shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting a
Borrowing (in the case of the Closing Date only), a conversion of Loans from one
Type to the other or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, (ii) the requested
date of the conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a
Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed (in the case
of the Closing Date only), converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be
borrowed (in the case of the Closing Date only) or to which existing Loans are
to be converted and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with
respect thereto.  If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Loan
Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion
or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to,
Base Rate Loans.  Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be
effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect
to the applicable Eurodollar Rate Loans.  If the Borrower requests a Borrowing
of (in the case of the Closing Date only), conversion to, or continuation of
Eurodollar Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest
Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.
Except to the extent the Agent and Lenders shall have received an
indemnification substantially consistent with the terms of Section 10.4 in form
and substance acceptable to the Agent, any Loans made on the Closing Date shall
initially be Base Rate Loans.

(b)Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Agent shall promptly notify each
relevant Lender of the requested conversion or continuation, and if no timely
notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Agent
shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Base Rate
Loans described in Section 1.5(a).  In the case of the Borrowing on the Closing
Date, subject to the terms of Section 1.1 and Section 2.2 hereof, each Lender
shall make an amount equal to its Commitment available to the Agent in
immediately available funds at the Agent’s Office on the Business Day specified
in the applicable Loan Notice such that the Agent is able to, and the Agent
shall, to the extent the Lenders have made funds available to it for such
purpose, fund such Loans to the Borrower in Dollars and immediately available
funds at the Agent’s Office prior to 2:00 p.m. eastern time on the Closing Date;
provided that if any Lender fails to remit such funds to the Agent in a timely
manner, the Agent may elect in its sole discretion to fund with its own funds
the Loans of such Lender on the Closing Date, and such Lender shall be subject
to the repayment obligation in Section 1.11(a) below.

(c)Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurodollar Rate Loan may be continued
or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Rate
Loan.  During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be requested as,
converted to or continued as Eurodollar Rate Loans without the consent of the
Required Lenders and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the
outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans be converted immediately to Base Rate Loans,
subject to the obligation of the Borrower to pay any indemnity required under
Section 10.4.

(d)The Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest
rate applicable to any Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans upon
determination of such interest rate.  At any




-3-





time that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Agent shall notify the Borrower
and the Lenders of any change in the Agent’s prime rate used in determining the
Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such change.

(e)After giving effect to the Borrowing, all conversions of Loans from one Type
to the other and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be
more than six (6) Interest Periods in effect.

(f)Upon satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 2.1, the
proceeds of the Borrowing will be made available to the Borrower by the Agent by
wire transfer of such amount to a deposit account of the Borrower specified by
the Borrower.

(g)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may
exchange, continue or rollover all or the portion of its Loans in connection
with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction
permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement
mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Agent and such Lender.

Section 1.6[Reserved].

Section 1.7Optional Prepayments.

(a)The Borrower may, upon notice to the Agent pursuant to delivery to the Agent
of a Notice of Loan Prepayment, at any time or from time to time voluntarily
prepay the Loan(s) in whole or in part without premium or penalty subject to
Sections 10.3 and 10.4; provided that, unless otherwise agreed by the Agent, (i)
such notice must be received by the Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. eastern time
(A) three (3) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Eurodollar Rate
Loans and (B) one (1) Business Day prior to the date of prepayment of Base Rate
Loans and (ii) optional partial prepayments of the Loans shall be in amounts not
less than $1,000,000 and shall be applied in the manner set forth in Section
1.10(c).  Each such notice shall specify the date (which shall be a Business
Day) and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and,
if Eurodollar Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such
Loans.  The Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such
notice, and of the amount of such Lender’s ratable portion of such prepayment
(based on such Lender’s Applicable Percentage).  All Notices of Loan Prepayment
shall be irrevocable.  The principal amount of the Loans for which a Notice of
Loan Prepayment is given, together with interest on such principal amount and
any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 10.4, shall be due and
payable on the date specified in such Notice of Loan Prepayment as the date on
which the proposed prepayment is to be made.

(b)Subject to Section 1.13, such prepayments shall be paid to the Lenders in
accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages.

Section 1.8Mandatory Prepayments.

(a)Payment on Maturity Date.  The Borrower shall pay to the Agent, for the
account of the Lenders, the principal amount of all of the Loans on the Maturity
Date in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of all Loans
outstanding on such date, together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon
and all other amounts payable hereunder.

(b)Federal Income Tax Refund Claims.  Within three (3) Business Days after
receipt of any and all refunds, credits, money or other proceeds (the “Tax
Refunds”) arising from, related to or connected with the Federal Income Tax
Refund Claims, the Borrower shall prepay an aggregate principal amount of the
Loans equal to one hundred percent (100%) of such Tax Refunds, together with
accrued




-4-





interest on such principal amount, and until the date of such payment, such Tax
Refunds shall be held in trust for the Agent.  For the avoidance of doubt, the
payment of breakage costs under Section 10.4 in the case of prepayments of
Eurodollar Rate Loans other than on the last day of the relevant Interest Period
shall not be required in connection with mandatory prepayments made pursuant to
this subsection (b).

(c)Application of Prepayments.  Subject to subsection 1.10(c), any prepayments
of the Loans pursuant to Section 1.7  or this Section 1.8 shall be applied first
to any Base Rate Loans then outstanding and then to outstanding Eurodollar Rate
Loans with the shortest Interest Periods remaining.

Section 1.9Fees.  The Borrower shall pay to (i) the Agent, for the Agent’s own
account and/or for the account of the Lenders (including the Agent), as
applicable, and (ii) the Lead Arranger, for the Lead Arranger’s own account,
fees in the amounts and at the times set forth in a letter agreement between the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lead Arranger dated as of April 24, 2020 (as
amended, restated, amended and restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from
time to time, the “Fee Letter”).

Section 1.10Payments by the Borrower.

(a)All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower on account of
principal, interest, fees and other amounts required hereunder shall be payable
prior to 2:00 p.m. eastern time on the date when due without presentment,
demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived
by the Borrower, and without set-off, recoupment, counterclaim or other
deduction of any kind, and an action therefor shall immediately accrue.  Such
payments shall, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, be made to the
Agent (for the ratable account of the Persons entitled thereto) at the Agent’s
Office, including payments utilizing the ACH system, and shall be made in
Dollars and by wire transfer or ACH transfer in immediately available funds
(which shall be the exclusive means of payment hereunder).  Subject to Section
1.13, the Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable
Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in
like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office.  Any
payment which is received by the Agent later than 2:00 p.m. eastern time may in
the Agent’s discretion be deemed to have been received on the immediately
succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to
accrue.  The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right to direct the
application during the continuance of an Event of Default of any and all
payments in respect of any Obligation.

(b)Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of “Interest Period”
herein, if any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day,
and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of
interest or fees, as the case may be; provided, however, that the Loans shall be
due on the Business Day preceding the Maturity Date if the Maturity Date is not
a Business Day.

(c)During the continuance of an Event of Default, the Agent may, and shall upon
the direction of Required Lenders, apply any and all payments received by the
Agent in respect of any Obligation in accordance with clauses first through
sixth below.  Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, all amounts
collected or received by the Agent after any or all of the Obligations have been
accelerated (so long as such acceleration has not been rescinded), shall be
applied as follows:

first, to payment of costs and expenses, including Attorney Costs, of the Agent
payable or reimbursable by the Borrower under the Loan Documents;

second, to payment of costs and expenses, including Attorney Costs, of Lenders
payable or reimbursable by the Borrower under the Loan Documents;




-5-





third, to payment of all accrued unpaid interest on the Obligations and fees
owed to the Agent and the Lenders;

fourth, to payment of principal of the Obligations;

fifth, to payment of any other amounts owing constituting Obligations; and

sixth, any remainder shall be for the account of and paid to whoever may be
lawfully entitled thereto.

In carrying out the foregoing, (i) amounts received shall be applied in the
numerical order provided until exhausted prior to the application to the next
succeeding category and (ii) each of the Lenders or other Persons entitled to
payment shall receive an amount equal to its pro rata share of amounts available
to be applied pursuant to clauses third, fourth and fifth above.

Section 1.11Payments by the Lenders to Agent; Settlement.

(a)Funding by Lenders; Presumptions by Agent.  Unless the Agent shall have
received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of
Eurodollar Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans,
prior to 12:00 noon eastern time on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender
will not make available to the Agent such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such
Borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available
on such date in accordance with Section 1.5(b) and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such
event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing
available to the Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally
agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in
immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but
excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to
be made by such Lender, the greater of the Overnight Bank Funding Rate and a
rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees
customarily charged by the Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in
the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable
to Base Rate Loans.  If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to
the Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Agent shall promptly remit
to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such
period.  If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Agent,
then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such
Borrowing.  Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim
the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such
payment to the Agent.

(b)Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Agent.  Unless the Agent shall have
received notice from the Borrower prior to the time at which any payment is due
to the Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not
make such payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment
on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
distribute to the Lenders the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has
not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to
repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender,
in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of
payment to the Agent, at the greater of the Overnight Bank Funding Rate and a
rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on
interbank compensation. A notice of the Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with
respect to any amount owing under subsection (a) or this subsection (b) shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error.




-6-





(c)Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent.  If any Lender makes available to
the Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the
foregoing provisions of this Article I, and such funds are not made available to
the Borrower by the Agent because the conditions to the applicable Loan set
forth in Article II are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms
hereof, the Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such
Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

(d)Obligations of Lenders Several.  The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to
make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 8.8 are several and not
joint.  The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, or to make any payment under
Section 8.8 on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of
its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loans, or to make
its payment under Section 8.8.

(e)Funding Source.  Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to
obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute
a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner.

(f)Insufficient Funds.  If at any time insufficient funds are received by and

then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied, subject to Section 1.10(c), (i)
first, toward payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the

then due to such parties, and (ii) second, toward payment of principal then due
hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the

Section 1.12[Reserved].

Section 1.13Defaulting Lenders.

(a)Adjustments.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as
that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law:

(i)Waivers and Amendments.  Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or
disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall
be restricted as set forth in the definition of “Required Lenders” and Section
9.1.

(ii)Defaulting Lender Waterfall.  Any payment of principal, interest, fees or
other amounts received by the Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender
(whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article VII or
otherwise) or received by the Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section
9.10 shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent as
follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to
the Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default
or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such
Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this
Agreement, as determined by the Agent; third, if so determined by the




-7-





Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in
order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations
with respect to Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any
amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result
of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
fifth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any
amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender
as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this
Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a
court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment
of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender
has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made at a
time when the conditions set forth in Article 2 were satisfied or waived, such
payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders
on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such
Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata
in accordance with the Commitments hereunder.  Any payments, prepayments or
other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held)
to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and
redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents
hereto.

(iii)Certain Fees.  No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any fee
payable under Section 1.9 for any period during which that Lender is a
Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee
that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting
Lender).

(b)Defaulting Lender Cure.  If the Borrower and the Agent agree in writing that
a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Agent will so notify the parties
hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject
to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable,
purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take
such other actions as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans
to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their
Applicable Percentages, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting
Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to
fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender
was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent
otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from
Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of
any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

The Borrower represents and warrants to Agent and each Lender that the following
are, and will be, true, correct and complete:

Section 3.1Financial Condition. 




-10-





(a)The audited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its consolidated
Subsidiaries for the Fiscal Year ended March 31, 2019 and the related audited
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for
the Fiscal Year ended on such date, reported on without a “going concern” or
like qualification or exception, or qualification arising out of the scope of
the audit, by BDO USA LLP, copies of which have heretofore been furnished to the
Agent, are complete and correct and present fairly the consolidated financial
condition of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and
the consolidated results of their operations and their consolidated cash flows
for the Fiscal Year then ended.

(b)All such financial statements referenced in clause (a) of this Section 3.1,
including the related schedules and notes thereto, have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods involved
(except as approved by such Responsible Officer, and as disclosed therein). 
Neither the Borrower nor any of its consolidated Subsidiaries had, at the date
of the most recent balance sheet referred to in clause (a) of this Section 3.1,
any material guarantee obligation, contingent liability or liability for taxes,
or any long term lease or unusual forward or long term commitment, including,
without limitation, any interest rate or foreign currency swap or exchange
transaction or other financial derivative, which is not reflected in the
foregoing statements or in the notes thereto.  During the period from March 31,
2019 to and including the date hereof there has been no sale, transfer or other
disposition by the Borrower or any of its consolidated Subsidiaries of any
material part of its business or property and no purchase or other acquisition
of any business or property (including any Stock of any other Person) material
in relation to the consolidated financial condition of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries at March 31, 2019.

(c)The Borrower has delivered to the Agent a summary of quarterly pro forma
projected financial statements (including, without limitation, a pro forma
statement of operations together with a detailed explanation of the assumptions
used in preparing such projected financial statements) of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries for the Fiscal Year ended March 31, 2021 derived from various
assumptions of the Borrower’s management (the “Projections”).  The Projections
reflect reasonable estimates and assumptions of possible results in light of the
history of the business, present and foreseeable conditions and the intentions
of the Borrower’s management, it being understood that such Projections are (i)
as to future events and not to be viewed as facts, (ii) are subject to
significant uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the
Borrower’s control and (iii) no assurance can be given that the Projections will
be realized.

it is a party;

(c)is duly qualified as a foreign corporation, and licensed and in good
standing, under the laws of each jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or
operation of Property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification
or license except where the failure to so qualify could not, in the aggregate,

(d)is in compliance with all Requirements of Law, except to the extent that the
failure to comply therewith could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect.




-11-

Loan Documents and to authorize the Borrowing under the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and any Notes.  The execution, delivery and performance by the

party, do not and will not:

(a)contravene the terms of any of the Organization Documents of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries;

(b)conflict with or result in any breach or contravention of, or result in the
creation of or enforcement of any Lien (other than Liens granted under the Loan

writ or decree of any Governmental Authority to which the Borrower, its
Subsidiaries or their Property is subject; or

(c)violate any Requirement of Law.

Section 3.4Governmental Authorization.  No approval, consent, exemption,
authorization, or other action by, or notice to, or filing with, any

this Agreement or any other Loan Document except for those obtained or made on
or prior to the Closing Date.

Section 3.5Validity and Binding Effect.  This Agreement and each other Loan
Document (a) have been duly authorized, validly executed and delivered by the
Borrower and (b) constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the
Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their respective
terms, except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, or similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights
generally or by equitable principles relating to enforceability.

Section 3.6Litigation.  Except as disclosed in the public filings of the
Borrower, dated March 31, 2019, and any subsequent Current Report on Form 8-K
filed prior to the date hereof, as of the date hereof, no litigation,
investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, is threatened by or
against the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or against any of its or their
respective Properties or revenues (a) with respect to any of the Loan Documents
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (b) which could

of any Requirement of Law.

Section 3.7No Default.    Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in

respect which could be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Loans will be used for “purchasing” or “carrying” any “margin stock” within the
respective meanings of




-12-





each of the quoted terms under Regulation U of the Federal Reserve Board as now
and from time to time hereafter in effect, or for any purpose which violates, or
which would be inconsistent with, the provisions of the regulations of such
Board of Governors.  The Borrower does not engage or intend to engage
principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of extending
credit for the purpose, immediately, incidentally or ultimately, of “purchasing”
or “carrying” “margin stock”. The Borrower does not hold or intend to hold
“margin stock” in such amounts that more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the
reasonable value of the assets of the Borrower are or will be represented by
“margin stock.”

Section 3.9Title to Property.  Each of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries has
good and marketable title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all of its real
and personal property material to its business, except for minor defects in
title that do not interfere with its ability to conduct its business as
currently conducted or to utilize such properties for their intended purposes.

Section 3.10Taxes.  All federal, state, local and foreign income and franchise
and other material tax returns, reports and statements (collectively, the “Tax
Returns”) required to be filed by the Borrower have been filed with the
appropriate Governmental Authorities, all such Tax Returns are true and correct
in all material respects, and all Taxes, assessments and other governmental
charges and impositions reflected therein or otherwise due and payable have been
paid prior to the date on which any Liability may be added thereto for non
payment thereof.  The Tax Returns filed in connection with the Federal Income
Tax Refund Claims are true, correct and complete in all material respects.

Section 3.11No Material Adverse Effect.  Since March 31, 2019, there has been no
development or event which has had or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.12Environmental Matters.

(a)The business, properties, assets and operations of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries are and have been in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Environmental Laws;

(b)The Borrower and its Subsidiaries hold and have held all permits, licenses,

business operations and for their ownership, use or operation of their
properties and assets (“Environmental Permits”) and are and have been in
compliance in all material respects with the Environmental Permits;

(c)No Hazardous Materials have been disposed of on or released (as used herein,
“release” shall have the meaning provided in 42 U.S.C. § 9601(22)) or are
otherwise present at, onto or under Properties of the Borrower or its
Subsidiaries or, to the Borrower’s and its Subsidiaries’ best knowledge, any
properties formerly owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries in a condition which could result in material liability, materially
interfere with continued operations, or materially impair the fair saleable
value thereof;

(d)No Hazardous Materials are located in, on or under, or have been handled,
generated, stored, treated, disposed, transported, processed, released or
discharged by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or, to the Borrower’s and its
Subsidiaries’ best knowledge, after due inquiry and investigation, by any other
Person, at, to or from any properties currently or formerly owned, leased or
operated by the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, except for those substances used
by Borrower or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of their business in
compliance with all Environmental Laws and as could not reasonably expected to
give rise to material liability under Environmental Laws; and




-13-





(e)The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have received no notice of, and to the best
of their knowledge and belief there exists no investigation, action, proceeding,
claim, notice of violation, request for information, consent decree, consent
order, administrative order or other order by any agency, authority or unit of
government or by any third party which could result in any material liability,
penalty, sanction or judgment under any Environmental Laws with respect to the
Borrower or its Subsidiaries, nor do the Borrower and its Subsidiaries know of
any basis for any of the foregoing.

Section 3.13Regulated Entities.  Neither the Borrower nor any Person controlling
the Borrower is (a) an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 or (b) subject to regulation under the Federal Power Act,
the Interstate Commerce Act, any state public utilities code, or any other
Federal or state statute, rule or regulation limiting its ability to incur
Indebtedness, pledge its assets or perform its Obligations under the Loan
Documents.

Section 3.14Solvency.  Both before and after giving effect to (a) the Loans made
on the Closing Date, (b) the disbursement of the proceeds of such Loans by the

connection with the foregoing, the Borrower and all of its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, are Solvent.

Section 3.15ERISA.  No ERISA Event has occurred, and the Borrower is not aware
of any fact, event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to
constitute or result in an ERISA Event with respect to any Pension Plan or
Multiemployer Plan. The present value of all accrued benefits under each Pension
Plan (based on those assumptions used to fund such Pension Plans) did not, as of
the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is
made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such Pension Plan
allocable to such accrued benefits.  The Borrower has not incurred any liability
to the PBGC other than for the payment of premiums, and there are no premium
payments which have become due that are unpaid, except as would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Neither the Borrower nor any
ERISA Affiliate has engaged in a transaction that could be subject to Section
4069 or Section 4212(c) of ERISA.  Borrower has no knowledge of any event or
circumstance that could reasonably be expected to cause the PBGC to institute
proceedings under Title IV of ERISA to terminate any Pension Plan.    Except to
the extent that any such excess could not have a Material Adverse Effect, the
present value (determined using actuarial and other assumptions which are
reasonable in respect of the benefits provided and the employees participating)
of the liability of the Borrower and each of its ERISA Affiliates for
post-retirement benefits to be provided to their current and former employees
under employee welfare benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) other
than such liability disclosed in the financial statements of the Borrower does
not, in the aggregate, exceed the assets under all such plans allocable to such
benefits.  The Borrower has not engaged in a prohibited transaction under
Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code in connection with any
employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA) that would subject
the Borrower to liability under ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code that would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 3.16Brokers’ Fees; Transaction Fees.  Except for fees payable to the
Agent, the Lead Arranger and the Lenders, neither the Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to any Person in respect of any finder’s,
broker’s or investment banker’s fee in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 3.17Insurance.  As of the date hereof, the Borrower has, with respect to

the Borrower in the Loan Documents as of the date such representations and
warranties are made or deemed made, and none of the statements contained in each

Borrower in connection with the Loan Documents (including the offering and

directly or indirectly for any payments to any government official or employee,

or anyone else acting in an official capacity, in order to obtain, retain or
direct business or obtain any improper advantage, in violation of  FCPA.  The

independent investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the Borrower

any related document or any other act, event or transaction related,
contemplated in or attendant to any such document, or, in each case, any action
taken or omitted to be taken by the Agent or any of its Related Persons under or
with respect to any of the foregoing; provided, however, that no Lender shall be
liable to the Agent or any of its Related Persons to the extent such liability

Related Person, as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final
nonappealable judgment or order.

its rights under Section 8.4, the retiring Agent shall take such action as may
be reasonably necessary to assign to the successor Agent its rights as the Agent

with, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent under
the Loan Documents.

its discretion, to release any Lien on any property granted to or held by the

in such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and
performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in

Required Lenders), and the Borrower, and then such waiver shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given;
provided, however, that no such waiver, amendment, or consent shall, unless in
writing and signed by all the Lenders directly affected thereby (or by the Agent
with the consent of all the Lenders directly affected thereby), in addition to
the Agent and the Required Lenders (or by the Agent with the consent of the
Required Lenders) and the Borrower, do any of the following:

(i)increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate any Commitment

applicability of any post-default increase in interest rates (which waiver shall
be effective with the consent of the Required Lenders) and (B) that any

this Agreement shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees
for purposes of this clause (ii) or clause (iii) below);

(iii)reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein or the
amount of interest payable in cash specified herein on any Loan, or of any fees

(b)No amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the
Agent, in addition to the Required Lenders or all Lenders directly affected

affect the rights or duties of the Agent under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document.

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 9.1, (A)
the Agent may amend Schedule 1.1 to reflect assignments entered into pursuant to

provided in subsection (b) below shall be effective as provided in such
subsection (b).

 

(b)Electronic Communications.  Notices and other communications to the Agent and
the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication
(including e-mail, FPML messaging and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to
procedures approved by the Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not apply to

opening of business on the next Business Day for the recipient.

 

(c)The Platform.  THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”  THE
AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF
THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS.  NO WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD
PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT
PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM.  In no event
shall the Agent or any of its Related Persons (collectively, the “Agent
Parties”) have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort,
contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrower’s or the Agent’s transmission
of Borrower Materials or notices through the Platform, any other electronic
platform or electronic messaging service, or through the Internet.

(d)Change of Address, Etc.  Each of the Borrower and the Agent may change its
address, fax number or telephone number or e-mail address for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto.  Each other
Lender may change its address, fax number or telephone number or e-mail address
for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the Borrower and the
Agent.  In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the Agent from time to time to
ensure that the Agent has on record (i) an effective address, contact name,
telephone number, fax number and e-mail address to which notices and other
communications may be sent and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such Lender.

(e)Reliance by Agent and Lenders.  The Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled
to rely and act upon any notices (including, without limitation, telephonic or
electronic notices, Loan Notices and Notices of Loan Prepayment) purportedly
given by or on behalf of the Borrower even if (i) such notices were not made in
a manner specified herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by
any other form of notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as
understood by the recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof.  The Borrower
shall indemnify the Agent, each Lender and the Related Persons of each of them
from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by
such Person on each notice purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower. 
All telephonic notices to and other telephonic communications with the Agent may
be recorded by the Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such
recording.

Section 9.3Electronic Execution.  The words “delivery,” “execute,” “execution,”
“signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in any Loan Document or any
other document executed in connection herewith shall be deemed to include
electronic signatures, the electronic matching of assignment terms and contract
formations on electronic platforms approved by the Agent, or the keeping of
records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect,
validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery
thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to
the extent and as provided for in any applicable Law, including the Federal
Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State
Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on
the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided that notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary the Agent is under no obligation to agree to




-36-





accept electronic signatures in any form or in any format unless expressly
agreed to by the Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it; provided further,
without limiting the foregoing, upon the request of the Agent, any electronic
signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart.

Section 9.4No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.  No failure to exercise and no delay
in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Lender, any right, remedy, power
or privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single
or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
remedy, power or privilege.  No course of dealing between the Borrower, any
Affiliate of thereof, the Agent or any Lender shall be effective to amend,
modify or discharge any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents.

Section 9.5Costs and Expenses.  Any action taken by the Borrower under or with
respect to any Loan Document, even if required under any Loan Document or at the
request of the Agent or the Required Lenders, shall be at the expense of the
Borrower, and neither the Agent nor any Lender shall be required under any Loan
Document to reimburse the Borrower or any Subsidiary of thereof therefor except
as expressly provided therein.  In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay or
reimburse upon demand (a) the Agent and the Lead Arranger for all reasonable out
of pocket costs and expenses incurred by it or any of its Related Persons, in
connection with the investigation, development, preparation, negotiation,
syndication, execution, interpretation or administration of, any modification of
any term of or termination of, any Loan Document, any commitment or engagement
letter therefor, any other document prepared in connection therewith or the

case, whether or not the transactions contemplated thereby are consummated); (b)
the Agent for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by it or any of its
Related Persons in connection with internal audit reviews; (c) each of the Agent

hereunder in the nature of a “work out”, (ii) the enforcement or preservation of
any right or remedy under any Loan Document, any Obligation or any other related
right or remedy, (iii) the commencement, defense, conduct of, intervention in,
or the taking of any other action with respect to, any proceeding (including any
bankruptcy or Insolvency Proceeding) related to the Borrower, any Subsidiary of
the Borrower, any Loan Document or Obligation (or the response to and
preparation for any subpoena or request for document production relating
thereto), including Attorney Costs, and (iv) and any amendments, modifications
or waivers of the provisions of any Loan Document (in each case under this
clause (c), whether or not the transactions contemplated thereby are
consummated); and (d) fees and disbursements of Attorney Costs of one law firm
on behalf of all Lenders (other than the Agent) incurred in connection with any
of the matters referred to in clause (c) above.

Section 9.6Indemnity.

(a)The Borrower agrees to indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Agent, the
Lead Arranger and each Lender and each of their respective Related Persons (each
such Person being an “Indemnitee”) from and against all Liabilities (including
brokerage commissions, fees and other compensation) that may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against any such Indemnitee in any matter relating to or
arising out of, in connection with or as a result of (i) any Loan Document, any
Obligation (or the repayment thereof), the use or intended use of the proceeds
of any Loan or the use of any securities filing of, or with respect to, the
Borrower, (ii) any commitment letter, engagement letter or term sheet with any
Person or any Contractual Obligation, arrangement or understanding with any
broker, finder or consultant, in each case entered into by or on behalf of the
Borrower or any Affiliate of thereof in connection with any of the foregoing and
any Contractual Obligation entered into in connection with any Platform or other
electronic transmissions, (iii) any actual or prospective investigation,
litigation or other proceeding, whether or not brought by any such Indemnitee or
any of its Related Persons, any holders of




-37-





securities or creditors (and including attorneys’ fees in any case), whether or
not any such Indemnitee, Related Person, holder or creditor is a party thereto,
and whether or not based on any securities or commercial law or regulation or
any other Requirement of Law or theory thereof, including common law, equity,
contract, tort or otherwise or (iv) any other act, event or transaction related,
contemplated in or attendant to any of the foregoing (collectively, the
“Indemnified Matters”); provided, however, that the Borrower shall not have any
liability under this Section 9.6 to any Indemnitee with respect to any
Indemnified Matter, and no Indemnitee shall have any liability with respect to
any Indemnified Matter other than (to the extent otherwise liable), to the
extent such liability has resulted primarily from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final non appealable judgment or order.  Furthermore, the
Borrower waives and agrees not to assert against any Indemnitee any right of
contribution with respect to any Liabilities that may be imposed on, incurred by
or asserted against any Related Person.

(b)Without limiting the foregoing, “Indemnified Matters” includes all
Environmental Liabilities, including those arising from, or otherwise involving,
any property of the Borrower or any Related Person of the Borrower or any
actual, alleged or prospective damage to property or natural resources or harm
or injury alleged to have resulted from any Release of Hazardous Materials on,
upon or into such property or natural resource or any property on or contiguous
to any Real Estate of the Borrower or any Related Person of the Borrower,
whether or not, with respect to any such Environmental Liabilities, any
Indemnitee is a mortgagee pursuant to any leasehold mortgage, a mortgagee in
possession, the successor in interest to the Borrower or any Related Person of
the Borrower or the owner, lessee or operator of any property of any Related
Person through any foreclosure action, in each case except to the extent such
Environmental Liabilities (i) are incurred solely following foreclosure by the
Agent or following the Agent or any Lender having become the successor in
interest to the Borrower or any Related Person of the Borrower and (ii) are
attributable solely to acts of such Indemnitee.

Section 9.7[Reserved].

Section 9.8Successors and Assigns.

(a)Successors and Assigns Generally.  The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Agent and each Lender and no Lender may assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder except (i) to an
assignee in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.8(b), (ii) by way of
participation in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.8(d) or (iii) by
way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions
of Section 9.8(f) (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party
hereto shall be null and void).  Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties
hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants
to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to the extent
expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Persons of each of the Agent and the
Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.

(b)Assignments by Lenders.  Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more
assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to
it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following
conditions:

(i)Minimum Amounts.




-38-





(1)in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an
assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum
amount need be assigned; and

(2)in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(1) of this Section, the
aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans
outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the
principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to
each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption
with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Agent or, if “Trade Date” is
specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the “Trade Date”, shall not be
less than $5,000,000, unless each of the Agent and, so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed);

(ii)Proportionate Amounts.  Each partial assignment shall be made as an
assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and
obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment
assigned;

(iii)Required Consents.  No consent shall be required for any assignment except
to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(2) of this Section and, in addition:

(1)the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) shall be required unless (1) an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing at the time of such assignment or (2) such assignment is to a Lender,
an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund; provided that the Borrower shall
be deemed to have consented to any such assignment unless it shall object
thereto by written notice to the Agent within five (5) Business Days after
having received notice thereof; and

(2)the consent of the Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) shall be required for assignments in respect of (1) any Commitment if
such assignment is to a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender
or an Approved Fund with respect to such Lender or (2) any Loan to a Person that
is not a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund.

(iv)Assignment and Assumption.  The parties to each assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing
and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however, that the Agent
may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee
in the case of any assignment.  The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall
deliver to the Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

(v)No Assignment to Borrower.  No such assignment shall be made to (A) the
Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (B) to any
Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a
Lender hereunder, would constitute a Defaulting Lender or a Subsidiary thereof.




-39-





(vi)No Assignment to Natural Persons.  No such assignment shall be made to a
natural person (or holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned
and operated for, the primary benefit of a natural person).

(vii)Certain Additional Payments.  In connection with any assignment of rights
and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be
effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto
specified herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional
payments to the Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution
thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee
of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including
funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the Agent, the applicable pro rata
share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to
each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent),
to (A) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such
Defaulting Lender to the Agent and each Lender hereunder (and interest accrued
thereon), and (B) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of
all Loans in accordance with its pro rata share.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting
Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance
with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall
be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until
such compliance occurs.

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Agent pursuant to subsection
(c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each
Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this
Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering
all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to
the benefits of Sections 8.8, 9.5, 9.6, 10.1, 10.3 and 10.4 with respect to
facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such
assignment.  Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and
deliver a Note to the assignee Lender.  Any assignment or transfer by a Lender
of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
Section 9.8(d).

(c)Register.  The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the
Borrower, shall maintain at the Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment and
Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and
addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts of and
stated interest on the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof
from time to time (the “Register”).  The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders
shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the
terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(d)Participations.  Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or
notice to, the Borrower or the Agent, sell participations to any Person (other
than a natural person (or holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or
owned and operated for, the primary benefit of a natural person) or the Borrower
or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in
all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its




-40-





Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Agent, and the Lenders shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such
Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  Any agreement or
instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide
that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this
Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such
Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to Section 9.1 that
affects such Participant.  Subject to subsection (e) of this Section, the
Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 10.1, 10.3 and 10.4, to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 9.8(b).  To the extent
permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of
Section 9.10(a) as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to
be subject to Section 9.10(b) as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that
sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary
agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and
address of each Participant and the principal amounts of and stated interest on
each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan
Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any
obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including
the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s
interest in any commitments, loans, or its other obligations under any Loan
Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary
to establish that such commitment, loan or other obligation is in registered
form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The
entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error,
and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this
Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of
doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for
maintaining a Participant Register.

(e)Limitations upon Participant Rights.  A Participant shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under Section 10.1 or 10.3 than the applicable
Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation
sold to such Participant, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a
greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant
acquired the applicable participation.  A Participant that would be a Foreign
Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.1
unless such Participant provides the documentation required by Section 10.1(e)
to the participating Lender.

(f)Certain Pledges.  Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including
under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided
that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.

Section 9.9Non Public Information; Confidentiality.

(a)Non Public Information.  The Agent and each Lender acknowledges and agrees
that it may receive material non public information (“MNPI”) hereunder
concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates and agrees to use such information in
compliance with all relevant policies, procedures and applicable Requirements of
Laws (including United States federal and state security laws and regulations).

(b)Confidential Information.  So long as the Loans are outstanding and for a
period of two (2) years thereafter, the Lenders and the Agent agree to use all
reasonable efforts to maintain, in accordance with its customary practices, the
confidentiality of information obtained by it pursuant to any




-41-





Loan Document and designated in writing by the Borrower as confidential, except
that such information may be disclosed (i) with the Borrower’s consent, (ii) to
Related Persons of such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, that are
advised of the confidential nature of such information and are instructed to
keep such information confidential in accordance with the terms hereof, (iii) to
the extent such information presently is or hereafter becomes (A) publicly
available other than as a result of a breach of this Section 9.9 or (B)
available to such Lender or the Agent or any of their Related Persons, as the
case may be, from a source (other than the Borrower) not known by them to be
subject to disclosure restrictions, (iv) to the extent disclosure is required by
applicable Requirements of Law or other legal process or requested or demanded
by any Governmental Authority, (v) to the extent necessary or customary for
inclusion in league table measurements, (vi) (A) to the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners or any similar organization, any examiner or any
nationally recognized rating agency or (B) otherwise to the extent consisting of
general portfolio information that does not identify the Borrower, (vii) to
current or prospective assignees or participants and to their respective Related
Persons, in each case to the extent such assignees, investors, participants,
counterparties or Related Persons agree to be bound by provisions substantially
similar to the provisions of this Section 9.9 (and such Person may disclose
information to their respective Related Persons in accordance with clause (ii)
above), (viii) to any other party hereto, and (ix) in connection with the
exercise or enforcement of any right or remedy under any Loan Document, in
connection with any litigation or other proceeding to which such Lender or the
Agent or any of their Related Persons is a party or bound, or to the extent
necessary to respond to public statements or disclosures by the Borrower or its
Related Persons referring to a Lender or the Agent or any of their Related
Persons.  In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Section 9.9 and
those of any other Contractual Obligation entered into with the Borrower
(whether or not a Loan Document), the terms of this Section 9.9 shall govern.

(c)Tombstones.  The Borrower consents to the publication by the Agent, the Lead
Arranger or any Lender of advertising material relating to the financing
transactions contemplated by this Agreement using the Borrower’s name, product
photographs, logo or trademark.  The Lead Arranger, the Agent or such Lender
shall provide a draft of any advertising material to the Borrower for review and
comment prior to the publication thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
tombstones referencing the syndication and arrangement of the credit facility,
or inclusion of the credit facility on lists or in other formats, in each case
providing the same information as is typically included on tombstones shall not
require prior notice thereof to, or acceptance by, the Borrower if such
information is utilized by the Agent or the Lead Arranger for internal or
external purposes.

(d)Press Release and Related Matters.  The Borrower shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Affiliates to, issue any press release or other public
disclosure (other than any document filed with any Governmental Authority
relating to a public offering of securities of the Borrower) using the name,
logo or otherwise referring to the Agent, the Lead Arranger or any of their
respective Affiliates, the Loan Documents or any transaction contemplated
therein to which the Agent or the Lead Arranger is a party without the prior
consent of the Agent or the Lead Arranger, as applicable, except to the extent
required to do so under applicable Requirements of Law and then, only after
consulting with the Agent or the Lead Arranger, as applicable.

(e)Distribution of Materials to Lenders.  The Borrower acknowledges and agrees,
that the Loan Documents and all reports, notices, communications and other
information or materials provided or delivered by, or on behalf of, the Borrower
(collectively, the “Borrower Materials”) may be disseminated by, or on behalf
of, the Agent, and made available, to the Lenders by posting such Borrower
Materials on IntraLinks, Syndtrak, ClearPar or a substantially similar
electronic transmission system (the “Platform”).  The Borrower authorizes the
Agent to download copies of their logos from its website and post copies thereof
on the Platform.




-42-





(f)Material Non Public Information.  The Borrower hereby agrees that if either
it, any parent company or any Subsidiary of the Borrower has publicly traded
equity or debt securities in the U.S., it shall (and shall cause such parent
company or Subsidiary, as the case may be, to) (i) identify in writing, and (ii)
to the extent reasonably practicable, clearly and conspicuously mark such
Borrower Materials that contain only information that is publicly available or
that is not material for purposes of U.S. federal and state securities laws as
“PUBLIC”.  The Borrower agrees that by identifying such Borrower Materials as
“PUBLIC” or publicly filing such Borrower Materials with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, then the Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to treat
such Borrower Materials as not containing any MNPI for purposes of U.S. federal
and state securities laws.  The Borrower further represents, warrants,
acknowledges and agrees that the following documents and materials shall be
deemed to be PUBLIC, whether or not so marked, and do not contain any MNPI:  (A)
the Loan Documents, including the schedules and exhibits attached thereto, and
(B) administrative materials of a customary nature prepared by the Borrower or
the Agent (including, Loan Notices and any similar requests or notices posted on
or through the Platform).  Before distribution of any Borrower Materials, the
Borrower agrees to execute and deliver to the Agent a letter authorizing
distribution of the evaluation materials to prospective Lenders and their
employees willing to receive MNPI, and a separate letter authorizing
distribution of evaluation materials that do not contain MNPI and represent that
no MNPI is contained therein.

Section 9.10Set off; Sharing of Payments.

(a)Right of Setoff.  Each of the Agent, each Lender and each Affiliate
(including each branch office thereof) and any participant of such Lender or
Affiliate which has agreed in writing to be bound by the provisions of Section
9.10(b) is hereby authorized, without notice or demand (each of which is hereby
waived by the Borrower), at any time and from time to time during the
continuance of any Event of Default and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Requirements of Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(whether general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other Indebtedness, claims or other obligations at any time owing by
the Agent, such Lender or any of their respective Affiliates or participants to
or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any Obligation of the
Borrower now or hereafter existing, whether or not any demand was made under any
Loan Document with respect to such Obligation and even though such Obligation
may be unmatured.  No Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff without the
prior consent of the Agent or the Required Lenders. Each Lender agrees to
promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent after any such setoff and application
made by such Lender or its Affiliates or participants; provided, however, that
the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and
application.  The rights under this Section 9.10 are in addition to any other
rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that the Agent, the
Lenders and their Affiliates and participants, may have.

(b)Sharing of Payments, Etc.  If any Lender, directly or through an Affiliate or
branch office thereof, obtains any payment of any Obligation of the Borrower
(whether voluntary or involuntary) other than pursuant to Section 9.10 or
Article X, and such payment exceeds the amount such Lender would have been
entitled to receive if all payments had gone to, and been distributed by, Agent
in accordance with the provisions of the Loan Documents, such Lender shall
purchase for cash from other Lenders such participations in their Obligations as
necessary for such Lender to share such excess payment with such Lenders to
ensure such payment is applied as though it had been received by Agent and
applied in accordance with this Agreement (or, if such application would then be
at the discretion of the Borrower, applied to repay the Obligations in
accordance herewith); provided, however, that (a) if such payment is rescinded
or otherwise recovered from such Lender in whole or in part, such purchase shall
be rescinded and the purchase price therefor shall be returned to such Lender
without interest and (b) such Lender shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Requirements of Law, be able to exercise all its rights of payment
(including the right of setoff) with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Lender were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.  If a Defaulting Lender receives any




-43-





such payment as described in the previous sentence, such Lender shall turn over
such payments to Agent for application in accordance with the terms of Section
1.13(a)(ii) hereof.

Section 9.11Counterparts; Facsimile Signature.  This Agreement may be executed
in any number of counterparts and by different parties in separate counterparts,
each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of
which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.  Signature
pages may be detached from multiple separate counterparts and attached to a
single counterpart.  Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by
facsimile transmission or electronic transmission shall be as effective as
delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof.

Section 9.12Severability.  The illegality or unenforceability of any provision
of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder shall not in
any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder.

Section 9.13Captions.  The captions and headings of this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of this
Agreement.

Section 9.14Independence of Provisions.  The parties hereto acknowledge that
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents may use several different
limitations, tests or measurements to regulate the same or similar matters, and
that such limitations, tests and measurements are cumulative and must each be
performed, except as expressly stated to the contrary in this Agreement.

Section 9.15Interpretation.  This Agreement is the result of negotiations among
and has been reviewed by counsel to the Borrower, the Agent, each Lender and
other parties hereto, and is the product of all parties hereto.  Accordingly,
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be construed against the
Lenders or the Agent merely because of the Agent’s or the Lenders’ involvement
in the preparation of such documents and agreements.  Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the parties hereto has had the advice of
counsel with respect to Sections 9.18 and 9.19.

Section 9.16No Third Parties Benefited.  This Agreement is made and entered into
for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders, the
Agent and their permitted successors and assigns, and no other Person shall be a
direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any direct or indirect cause of
action or claim in connection with, this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents.  Neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to any
Person not a party to this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

Section 9.17Governing Law and Jurisdiction.

(a)Governing Law.  The laws of the State of New York shall govern all matters

provided by law. 




-44-





Nothing in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall limit the right of
the Agent or any Lender to commence any proceeding in the federal or state
courts of any other jurisdiction to the extent the Agent or the Lender, as
applicable, determines that such action is necessary or appropriate to exercise
its rights or remedies under the Loan Documents.  The parties hereto (and, to
the extent set forth in any other Loan Document) hereby irrevocably waive any
objection, including any objection to the laying of venue or based on the
grounds of forum non conveniens, that any of them may now or hereafter have to
the bringing of any such action or proceeding in such jurisdictions.

(c)Service of Process.  The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives personal service
of any and all legal process, summons, notices and other documents and other
service of process of any kind and consents to such service in any suit, action
or proceeding brought in the United States of America with respect to or

Borrower specified herein (and shall be effective when such mailing shall be
effective, as provided therein).

(d)Non Exclusive Jurisdiction.  Nothing contained in this Section 9.17 shall
affect the right of Agent or any Lender to serve process in any other manner

WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT, CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE.  EACH PARTY HERETO (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS

AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION.

Section 9.19Entire Agreement; Release; Survival.

(a)THE LOAN DOCUMENTS EMBODY THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES AND SUPERSEDE
ALL PRIOR AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER THEREOF
AND ANY PRIOR LETTER OF INTEREST, COMMITMENT LETTER, ENGAGEMENT LETTER,
CONFIDENTIALITY AND SIMILAR AGREEMENTS INVOLVING THE BORROWER AND ANY LENDER OR
ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES RELATING TO A FINANCING OF SUBSTANTIALLY
SIMILAR FORM, PURPOSE OR EFFECT OTHER THAN THE FEE LETTER.  IN THE EVENT OF ANY
CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, THE
TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN (UNLESS SUCH TERMS OF SUCH OTHER LOAN
DOCUMENTS ARE NECESSARY TO COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE REQUIREMENTS OF LAW, IN WHICH
CASE SUCH TERMS SHALL GOVERN TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO COMPLY THEREWITH).

(b)Execution of this Agreement by the Borrower constitutes a full, complete and
irrevocable release of any and all claims which the Borrower may have at law or
in equity in respect of all




-45-





prior discussions and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.  In no event shall any
Indemnitee be liable on any theory of liability for any special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages (including any loss of profits, business or
anticipated savings).  The Borrower hereby waives, releases and agrees not to
sue upon any such claim for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive
damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist
in its favor.

(c)(i) Any indemnification or other protection provided to any Indemnitee
pursuant to this Section 9.19, Sections 9.5 and 9.6 and Articles VIII and X and
(ii) solely for the two (2) year time period specified therein, the provisions
of Section 9.9, inure to the benefit of any Person that at any time held a right
thereunder (as an Indemnitee or otherwise) and, thereafter, its successors and
permitted assigns.

Section 9.20Patriot Act.  The Agent and each Lender that is subject to the
Patriot Act hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of
the Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that
identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the
Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the
Borrower in accordance with the Patriot Act.

Section 9.21Replacement of Lender.  Within forty five (45) days after: (i)
receipt by the Borrower of written notice and demand from any Lender that is not
Agent or an Affiliate of Agent (an “Affected Lender”) for payment of additional
costs as provided in Sections 10.1, 10.3 and/or 10.4; or (ii) any failure by any
Lender (other than Agent) to consent to a requested amendment, waiver or
modification to any Loan Document in which Required Lenders have already
consented to such amendment, waiver or modification but the consent of each
Lender (or each Lender directly affected thereby, as applicable) is required
with respect thereto, the Borrower may, at its option, notify Agent and such
Affected Lender (or such defaulting or non consenting Lender, as the case may
be) of the Borrower’s intention to obtain, at the Borrower’s expense, a
replacement Lender (“Replacement Lender”) for such Affected Lender (or such
defaulting or non consenting Lender, as the case may be), which Replacement
Lender shall be reasonably satisfactory to Agent.  In the event the Borrower
obtains a Replacement Lender within forty five (45) days following notice of its
intention to do so, the Affected Lender (or defaulting or non consenting Lender,
as the case may be) shall sell and assign its Loans and Commitments to such
Replacement Lender, at par, provided that the Borrower has reimbursed such
Affected Lender for its increased costs for which it is entitled to
reimbursement under this Agreement through the date of such sale and
assignment.  In the event that a replaced Lender does not execute an Assignment
and Assumption pursuant to Section 9.8 within five (5) Business Days after
receipt by such replaced Lender of notice of replacement pursuant to this
Section 9.21 and presentation to such replaced Lender of an Assignment and
Assumption evidencing an assignment pursuant to this Section 9.21, the Borrower
shall be entitled (but not obligated) to execute such an Assignment and
Assumption on behalf of such replaced Lender, and any such Assignment and
Assumption so executed by the Borrower, the Replacement Lender and Agent, shall
be effective for purposes of this Section 9.21 and Section 9.8.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, with respect to a Lender that is a Defaulting Lender, the
Borrower or Agent may obtain a Replacement Lender and execute an Assignment and
Assumption on behalf of such Defaulting Lender at any time and without prior
notice to such Defaulting Lender and cause its Loans and Commitments to be sold
and assigned at par.  Upon any such assignment and payment and compliance with
the other provisions of Section 9.8, such replaced Lender shall no longer
constitute a “Lender” for purposes hereof; provided, any rights of such replaced
Lender to indemnification hereunder shall survive.

Section 9.22Duration; Survival.  All representations and warranties of the
Borrower contained herein or made in connection herewith shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the completion of the transactions
hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect until the Maturity Date. 
All covenants and agreements of the Borrower contained herein relating to the
payment of




-46-





principal, interest, premiums, additional compensation or expenses and
indemnification, including those specified in the Notes and Sections 8.8, 9.5,
9.6, 10.1, 10.3 and 10.4 shall survive the Maturity Date.  All other covenants
and agreements of the Borrower shall continue in full force and effect from and
after the Closing Date and until the Maturity Date.

Section 9.23  [Reserved].

Section 9.24Actions in Concert.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, each Lender hereby agrees with each other Lender that no Lender
shall take any action to protect or enforce its rights against the Borrower
arising out of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including exercising
any rights of setoff) without first obtaining the prior written consent of the
Agent or Required Lenders, it being the intent of the Lenders that any such
action to protect or enforce rights under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents shall be taken in concert and at the direction or with the consent of
Agent or Required Lenders.

Section 9.25Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial
Institutions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or
in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties,
each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Lender that is an
Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent
such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion
Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and
acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

(a)the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable
Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be
payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and

(b)the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability, including, if
applicable:

(i)a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;

(ii)a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other
instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent
undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise
conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be
accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or

(iii)the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the
exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution
Authority.

ARTICLE X

TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

Section 10.1Taxes.

(a)Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes.

(i)Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding
for any Taxes.  If,




-47-





however, applicable Laws require the Borrower or Agent to withhold or deduct any
Tax, such Tax shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such Laws as
determined by the Agent, upon the basis of the information and documentation to
be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) below.

(ii)If the Borrower or the Agent shall be required by applicable Laws to
withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup
withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Agent shall
withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Agent to be required
based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to
subsection (e) below, (B) the Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or
deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and
(C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of
Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be
increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of
all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section) the Agent or Lender, as the case may be, receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or
deduction been made.

(b)Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower.  Without limiting the provisions of
subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

(c)Tax Indemnifications.

(i)Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, the Borrower
shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Agent and each Lender, and shall make
payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the
full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under
this Section) withheld or deducted by the Borrower or the Agent or paid or
payable by the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, and any penalties,
interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to
the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a
Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on
behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

(ii)Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Lender
shall severally indemnify the Agent within ten (10) days after demand therefor,
for (i) any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes attributable to such Lender (but
only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Agent for
such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the
Borrower to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to
comply with the provisions of Section 9.8(d) relating to the maintenance of a
Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender,
in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan
Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto,
whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the
relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment
or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply
any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or
otherwise payable




-48-





by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the
Agent under this subsection (c)(ii).

(d)Evidence of Payments.  Upon request by the Borrower or the Agent, as the case
may be, after any payment of Taxes by the Borrower or the Agent to a
Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 10.1, the Borrower shall 
deliver to the Agent or the Agent shall deliver to the Borrower, as the case may
be, the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental
Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to
report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to
the Borrower or the Agent, as the case may be.

(e)Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation.

(i)Each Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and to the Agent, at the time or
times prescribed by applicable Laws or when reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by
applicable Laws or by the taxing authorities of any jurisdiction and such other
reasonably requested information as will permit the Borrower or the Agent, as
the case may be, to determine (A) whether or not payments made hereunder or
under any other Loan Document are subject to Taxes, (B) if applicable, the
required rate of withholding or deduction, and (C) such Lender’s entitlement to
any available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of
all payments to be made to such Lender by the Borrower pursuant to this
Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender’s status for withholding tax
purposes in the applicable jurisdiction.

(ii)Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the Borrower is
resident for tax purposes in the United States,

(A)any Lender that is a “United States person” within the meaning of Section
7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent executed
originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or
information prescribed by applicable Laws or reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Agent, as the case may
be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or
information reporting requirements; and

(B)each Foreign Lender that is entitled under the Code or any applicable treaty
to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or
prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this
Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or
the Agent, but only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so),
whichever of the following is applicable:

(1)executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E (as applicable) claiming eligibility for benefits
of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,

(2)executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,




-49-





(3)executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY and all required
supporting documentation,

(4)in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for
portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the
effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of
section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower
within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled
foreign corporation” described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y)
executed originals of  Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8BEN-E (as applicable), or

(5)executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable Laws as a basis
for claiming exemption from or a reduction in United States Federal withholding
tax together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by
applicable Laws to permit the Borrower or the Agent to determine the withholding
or deduction required to be made.

(iii)If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to
U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to
comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those
contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender
shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by
law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent
such documentation prescribed by Applicable Law (including as prescribed by
Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the
Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to
determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under
FATCA or to determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such
payment. Solely for purposes of this subparagraph (iii), “FATCA” shall include
any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.

(iv)Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify the Borrower and the Agent of any
change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any claimed
exemption or reduction, and (B) take such steps as shall not be materially
disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, and as may be
reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending Office) to
avoid any requirement of applicable Laws of any jurisdiction that the Borrower
or the Agent make any withholding or deduction for taxes from amounts payable to
such Lender.

(f)Treatment of Certain Refunds.  Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time
shall the Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of
a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes
withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender.  If the
Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a
refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an
amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made,
or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to
the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be,
and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the
request of the Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the




-50-





amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges
imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Agent or such Lender in
the event the Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority.  This subsection shall not be construed to require the
Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax Returns (or any other information
relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other
Person.

Section 10.2Illegality.  If any Lender determines that any Law has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund any
Eurodollar Rate Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
Eurodollar Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions
on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of,
Dollars in the London interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender
to the Borrower through the Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or
continue Eurodollar Rate Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Agent and the Borrower
that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist.  Upon
receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a
copy to the Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans
of such Lender to Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period
therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate
Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to
maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loans.  Upon any such prepayment or conversion,
the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or
converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to Section
10.4.

Section 10.3Increased Costs and Reduction of Return.

(a)Increased Costs Generally.  If any Change in Law shall:

(i)impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory
loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with
or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender
(except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurodollar Rate);

(ii)subject any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to this
Agreement or any Eurodollar Rate Loan made by it, or change the basis of
taxation of payments to such Lender in respect thereof (except for Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 10.1 and the imposition of, or any
change in the rate of, any Excluded Tax payable by such Lender); or

(iii)impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition,
cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such
Lender;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loan (or of maintaining its
obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received
or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any
other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, as the
case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.




-51-





(b)Capital Requirements.  If any Lender determines that any Change in Law
affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s
holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or
on the capital or liquidity of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made
by such Lender to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding
company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into
consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding
company with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time
the Borrower will pay to such Lender, as the case may be, such additional amount
or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for
any such reduction suffered.

(c)Delay in Requests.  Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand
compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation, provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or
reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender
notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor
(except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

Section 10.4Funding Losses.  In addition to the compensation or payments
required by Section 10.1 or 10.3, upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate such Lender for
and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a
result of:

(a)any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a
Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such
Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or
otherwise);

(b)any attempt by the Borrower to revoke (expressly, by later inconsistent
notices or otherwise) in whole or part any Loan Notice under Section 1.5 or
notice relating to prepayments under Section 1.7;

(c)any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such
Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other
than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or

(d)any assignment of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of
the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant
to Section 9.21;

including any loss of anticipated profits and any loss or expense arising from
the liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or
from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were
obtained.  The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged
by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.

If any Lender sustains or incurs any such loss or expense, it shall from time to
time notify the Borrower of the amount determined in good faith by such Lender
(which determination may include such assumptions,




-52-





allocations of costs and expenses and averaging or attribution methods as such
Lender shall deem reasonable) to be necessary to indemnify such Lender for such
loss or expense.

Section 10.5Inability to Determine Rates.  If in connection with any request for
a Eurodollar Rate Loan or a conversion to or continuation thereof (a) the Agent
determines that (i) Dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in the London
interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of
such Eurodollar Rate Loan or (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
determining the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect
to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan, or (b) the Required Lenders determine that
for any reason the Eurodollar Rate for any requested Interest Period with
respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Agent will promptly
so notify the Borrower and each Lender.  Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the
Lenders to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the
extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in
the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to
the Eurodollar Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the
Eurodollar Rate component in determine the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each
case until the Agent (upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such
notice.  Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending
request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurodollar Rate
Loans (to the extent of the affected Eurodollar Rate Loans or Interest Periods)
or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request
for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

Section 10.6Certificates of Lenders.  Any Lender claiming reimbursement or
compensation pursuant to this Article X shall deliver to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Agent) a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the amount
payable to such Lender hereunder and such certificate shall be conclusive and
binding on the Borrower in the absence of manifest error. Such amount shall be
due and payable by the Borrower to such Lender ten (10) days after such notice
is given.

Section 10.7Effect of Benchmark Transition Event.

(a)Benchmark Replacement.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in
any other Loan Document, if the Agent determines that a Benchmark Transition
Event or an Early Opt-in Event has occurred, the Agent and the Borrower may
amend this Agreement to replace the Eurodollar Rate with a Benchmark
Replacement; and any such amendment will become effective at 5:00 p.m. New York
City time on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Agent has provided such
proposed amendment to all Lenders, so long as the Agent has not received, by
such time, written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising
the Required Lenders. Until the Benchmark Replacement is effective, each
advance, conversion to and renewal of a Eurodollar Rate Loan will continue to
bear interest with reference to the Eurodollar Rate; provided, however, during a
Benchmark Unavailability Period (i) any pending selection of, conversion to or
renewal of a Eurodollar Rate Loan that has not yet gone into effect shall be
deemed to be a selection of, conversion to or renewal of Base Rate Loans, (ii)
all outstanding Eurodollar Rate Loans shall automatically be converted to Base
Rate Loans at the expiration of the existing Interest Period (or sooner, if the
Agent cannot continue to lawfully maintain such affected Eurodollar Rate Loan)
and (iii) the component of the Base Rate based upon the Eurodollar Rate will not
be used in any determination of the Base Rate.

(b)Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes.  In connection with the
implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Agent will have the right to make
Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments

notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (i) the implementation of any Benchmark

determination, decision or election that may be made by the Agent or the Lenders
pursuant to this Section 10.7 including any determination with respect to a
tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event,
circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action,
will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or

instruments, documents, agreements, certificates, indentures, notices and other

Article V and Article VI shall be made, without giving effect to any election
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 159 (or any other Financial
Accounting Standard having a similar result or effect) to value any Indebtedness

value.”  A breach of a financial covenant contained in Article VI shall be

Section 11.4Payments.

The Agent may set up standards and procedures to determine or redetermine the
equivalent in Dollars of any amount expressed in any currency other than Dollars
and otherwise may, but shall not be obligated to, rely on any determination made
by the Borrower.  Any such determination or redetermination by the Agent shall
be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.  No
determination or redetermination by any Lender or the Borrower and no other
currency conversion shall change or release any obligation of the Borrower or of
any Lender (other than the Agent and its Related Persons) under any Loan
Document, each of which agrees to pay separately for any shortfall remaining
after any conversion and payment of the amount as converted.  The Agent may
round up or down, and may set up appropriate mechanisms to round up or down, any
amount hereunder to nearest higher or lower amounts and may determine reasonable
de minimis payment thresholds.

London interbank offered rate is no longer available or in certain other
circumstances. The Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for and
shall not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or

the definition of “Eurodollar Rate” or with respect to any alternative or
successor rate thereto, or replacement rate therefor.

connection with any division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any
comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset,
right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right,
obligation or liability of a different Person, then it shall be deemed to have
been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person and (b) if
any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have
been organized on the first date of its existence by the holders of its equity
interests at such time.
