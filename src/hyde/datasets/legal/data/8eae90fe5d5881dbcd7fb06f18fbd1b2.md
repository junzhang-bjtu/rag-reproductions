(a)    Loans. Each Lender severally agrees, on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, to make loans to the Borrower pursuant to this Section
from time to time during the Revolving Credit Period; provided that, immediately
after each such loan is made, (i) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
such Lender’s Loans to the Borrower shall not exceed its Commitment and (ii) the
Total Outstanding Amount shall not exceed the aggregate amount of the
Commitments. Within the foregoing limits, the Borrower may borrow under this
subsection, prepay Loans to the extent permitted by Section 2.10 and reborrow at
any time during the Revolving Credit Period under this subsection; provided, for
the avoidance of doubt, that the Borrower shall not be entitled to reborrow
pursuant to this sentence Loans which are prepaid at any time following the Term
Loan Conversion Date.


(b)    Minimum Amounts. Each Borrowing under this Section shall be in an
aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of $1,000,000
(except that any such Borrowing may be in the aggregate amount available within
the limitations set forth above) and shall be made from the several Lenders
ratably in proportion to their respective Commitments.


Section 2.02.     Notice of Borrowing. The Borrower shall give the
Administrative Agent irrevocable notice of any Borrowing by (A) telephone or (B)
a Notice of Borrowing; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed
promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Notice of Borrowing not

Business Day before each Base Rate Borrowing and (y) 1:00 P.M. (New York City
time) on the third Euro-Dollar Business Day before each Euro-Dollar Borrowing,

(b)    the aggregate amount of such Borrowing;


(c)    whether the Loans comprising such Borrowing are to bear interest
initially at the Base Rate or a Euro-Dollar Rate; and

Interest Period applicable thereto, subject to the provisions of the definition
of Interest Period;


19

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










provided that, in the case of any Euro-Dollar Borrowing to be made on the
Effective Date, the Borrower shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent,
concurrently with or prior to the delivery of the Notice of Borrowing in respect
of such Borrowing, a duly executed funding indemnity letter in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
Section 2.03.     [Reserved.]


Section 2.04.     Notice to Lenders; Funding of Loans. (a) Promptly after
receiving a Notice of Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall notify each
Lender of the contents thereof and of such Lender’s share (if any) of such
Borrowing and such Notice of Borrowing shall not thereafter be revocable by the
Borrower.


(b)    Not later than 12:00 Noon (New York City time) on the date of each
Borrowing, each Lender shall make available its share of such Borrowing, in
Federal or other funds immediately available in New York City, to the
Administrative Agent at its address specified in or pursuant to Section 9.01.
Unless the Administrative Agent determines that any applicable condition
specified in Article 3 has not been satisfied, the Administrative Agent will
make the funds so received from the Lenders available to the Borrower at the
Administrative Agent’s aforesaid address.


(c)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
before the time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available to the
Administrative Agent on the date of such Borrowing in accordance with Section
2.04(b) and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the
extent that such Lender shall not have so made such share available to the
Administrative Agent, such Lender and the Borrower severally agree to repay to
the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together
with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available
to the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative
Agent, at (i) if such amount is repaid by the Borrower, a rate per annum equal
to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate and the interest rate applicable to such
Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.06 and (ii) if such amount is repaid by such
Lender, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall repay to the Administrative
Agent such corresponding amount, the Borrower shall not be required to repay
such amount and the amount so repaid by such Lender shall constitute such
Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

Loans outstanding on the Revolver Termination Date into a term loan which the
Borrower shall repay in full ratably to the Lenders on the Term Loan Maturity
Date; provided that the Term Loan Election may not be exercised unless the
conditions set forth in Section 3.03 are satisfied on the Term Loan Conversion
Date. All Loans converted into a term loan pursuant to this Section 2.05 shall
continue to constitute Loans and Borrowings hereunder except that the Borrower
may not reborrow pursuant to Section 2.01 after all or any portion of such Loans
have been prepaid pursuant to Section 2.10. The Company shall be entitled to
make interest elections under Section 2.07 and to prepay under Section 2.10 any
Loans outstanding following the Term Loan Conversion Date as if such Loans were
Loans or Borrowings made prior to the Revolver Termination Date (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, such prepaid loans may not be reborrowed).


Section 2.06.     Interest Rates. (a) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on
the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from the date such Loan
is made until it becomes due, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Base
Rate Margin plus the Base Rate for such day. Such interest shall be payable
quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date. Any overdue principal of or
interest on any Base Rate Loan shall bear interest (after as well as before
judgment), payable on demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal
to the sum of 2 % plus the Base Rate Margin plus the Base Rate for such day.


(b)    Each Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof, for each day during each Interest Period applicable thereto, at
a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Euro-Dollar Margin for such day plus
the London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such Interest Period. Such
interest shall be payable for each Interest Period on the last day thereof and,
if such Interest Period is longer than three months, at intervals of three
months after the first day thereof.


The “London Interbank Offered Rate” applicable to any Interest Period means: (a)
for any Interest Period with respect to a Euro-dollar Loan, the rate per annum
equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate or a comparable or successor rate,
which rate is approved by the Administrative Agent, as published on the
applicable Bloomberg screen page (or such other commercially available source
providing such quotations as may be designated by the Administrative Agent from
time to time) at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, two Business Days prior
to the commencement of such Interest Period, for Dollar deposits (for delivery
on the first day of such Interest Period) with a term equivalent to such
Interest Period (the “LIBOR Screen Rate”); and






21

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------








(b)    for any interest calculation with respect to a Base Rate Loan on any
date, the rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Screen Rate, at or about 11:00 a.m.,
London time determined two Business Days prior to such date for U.S. Dollar
deposits with a term of one month commencing that day; and
(c)     if the London Interbank Offered Rate shall be less than zero, such rate
shall be deemed zero for purposes of this Agreement;
provided, that to the extent a comparable or successor rate is approved by the
Administrative Agent in connection herewith, the approved rate shall be applied
in a manner consistent with market practice; provided, further that to the
extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the
Administrative Agent, such approved rate shall be applied in a manner as
otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent.
(d)    Any overdue principal of or interest on any Euro-Dollar Loan shall bear
interest (after as well as before judgment), payable on demand, for each day
until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the Euro-Dollar
Margin for such day plus the London Interbank Offered Rate applicable to such
Loan on the day before such payment was due (or, if the circumstances described
in Section 8.01 shall exist, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the
Base Rate Margin plus the Base Rate for such day).


(e)    [Reserved.]


(f)    The Administrative Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to
the Loans hereunder. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower
and the participating Lenders of each rate of interest so determined, and its
determination thereof shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.


(g)    [Reserved.]

Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination
shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders
notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a
copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have
determined, that:


(i)    adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the London
Interbank Offered Rate for any requested Interest Period, including, without
limitation, because the LIBOR Screen Rate is not available or published on a
current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or




22

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------








(ii)     the administrator of the LIBOR Screen Rate or a governmental authority
having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public statement
identifying a specific date after which the London Interbank Offered Rate or the
LIBOR Screen Rate shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the
interest rate of loans (such specific date, the “Scheduled Unavailability
Date”), or
(iii)     syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language
similar to that contained in this Section, are being executed or amended (as
applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace the
London Interbank Offered Rate,
then, reasonably promptly after such determination by the Administrative Agent
or receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice , as applicable, the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the
London Interbank Offered Rate with an alternate benchmark rate (including any
mathematical or other adjustments to the benchmark (if any) incorporated
therein), giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention
for similar U.S. dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such
alternative benchmarks (any such proposed rate, a “LIBOR Successor Rate”),
together with any proposed LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes and any such
amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the fifth
Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed
amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders
comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent
written notice that such Required Lenders do not accept such amendment.
If no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under
clause (i) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as
applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and
each Lender.  Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain
Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended, (to the extent of the affected Euro-Dollar
Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) the Euro-Dollar Rate component shall no
longer be utilized in determining the Base Rate.  Upon receipt of such notice,
the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or
continuation of Euro-Dollar Loans (to the extent of the affected Euro-Dollar
Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted
such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans (subject to the
foregoing clause (y)) in the amount specified therein.
Notwithstanding anything else herein, any definition of LIBOR Successor Rate
shall provide that in no event shall such LIBOR Successor Rate be less than zero
for purposes of this Agreement.
Section 2.07.     Method of Electing Interest Rates. (a) The Loans included in
each Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate specified by
the Borrower in the






23

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------








applicable Notice of Borrowing. Thereafter, the Borrower may from time to time
elect to change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Base Rate
Loan and each Euro-Dollar Loan with respect to which the last day of the
Interest Period is the same day (subject to Section 2.07(d) and the provisions
of Article 8), as follows:
    
(i)    if such Loan is a Base Rate Loan, the Borrower may elect to convert such
Loan to a Euro-Dollar Loan as of any Euro-Dollar Business Day; and
(ii)    if such Loan is a Euro-Dollar Loan, the Borrower may elect to convert
such Loan to a Base Rate Loan as of any Domestic Business Day or elect to
continue such Loan as a Euro-Dollar Loan for an additional Interest Period,
subject to Section 2.12 if any such conversion is effective on any day other
than the last day of an Interest Period applicable to such Loan.
Each such election shall be made by (A) telephone or (B) a Notice of Interest
Rate Election; provided that any telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by
delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Notice of Interest Rate Election not
later than 1:00 P.M. (New York City time) on the third Euro-Dollar Business Day
before the conversion or continuation selected in such notice is to be
effective. A Notice of Interest Rate Election may, if it so specifies, apply to
only a portion of the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Base Rate Loans
or Euro-Dollar Loans with respect to which the last day of the Interest Period
is the same day; provided that the portion to which such Notice applies, and the
remaining portion to which it does not apply, are each at least $5,000,000
(unless such portion is comprised of Base Rate Loans).
(b)    Each Notice of Interest Rate Election shall specify:


(i)    the Loans (or portion thereof) to which such notice applies (which Loans
shall be Base Rate Loans or Euro-Dollar Loans with respect to which the last day
of the Interest Period is the same day);
(ii)    the date on which the conversion or continuation selected in such notice
is to be effective, which shall comply with the applicable clause of Section
2.07(a) above;
(iii)    if the applicable Loans are to be converted, the new type of Loans and,
if the Loans resulting from such conversion are to be Euro-Dollar Loans, the
duration of the next succeeding Interest Period applicable thereto; and




    




24

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------






(iv)    if such Loans are to be continued as Euro-Dollar Loans for an additional
Interest Period, the duration of such additional Interest Period.
Each Interest Period specified in a Notice of Interest Rate Election shall
comply with the provisions of the definition of Interest Period.
(c)    Promptly after receiving a Notice of Interest Rate Election from the
Borrower pursuant to Section 2.07(a) above, the Administrative Agent shall
notify each Lender of the contents thereof and such notice shall not thereafter
be revocable by the Borrower.


(d)    The Borrower shall not be entitled to elect to convert any Loans to, or
continue any Loans for an additional Interest Period as, Euro-Dollar Loans if
(i) the aggregate principal amount of any Euro-Dollar Loans created or continued
as a result of such election would be less than $5,000,000 or (ii) a Default
shall have occurred and be continuing when the Borrower delivers notice of such
election to the Administrative Agent.


(e)    If any Loan is converted to a different type of Loan, the Borrower shall
pay, on the date of such conversion, the interest accrued to such date on the
principal amount being converted.


(f)    If the Borrower fails to specify a type of Loan in a Notice of Borrowing
or Notice of Interest Rate Election or if the Borrower fails to give a timely
notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall
be made as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans. Any such automatic conversion to
Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period
then in effect with respect to the applicable Euro-Dollar Loans. If the Borrower
requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Euro-Dollar Loans in
any such Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Interest Rate Election, but fails to
specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest
Period of one month.


Section 2.08.     Fees. (a) The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent,
for the account of the Lenders ratably in proportion to their Credit Exposures,
a facility fee calculated for each day at the Facility Fee Rate for such day
(determined in accordance with the Pricing Schedule) on the aggregate amount of
the Credit Exposures on such day. Such facility fee shall accrue for each day
from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the day on which the
Credit Exposures are reduced to zero. If a Term Loan Election has been made,
such facility fee shall cease to accrue from and including the Term Loan
Conversion Date.


(b)    [Reserved].












25

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------






(c)    Fees accrued for the account of the Lenders under this Section shall be
payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and on the day on
which the Commitments terminate in their entirety (and, if later, on the day on
which the Credit Exposures are reduced to zero). Any overdue fees accrued for
the account of the Lenders under this Section shall bear interest, payable on
demand, for each day until paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus
the Base Rate Margin plus the Base Rate for such day.


Section 2.09.     Termination or Reduction of Commitments. (a) The Borrower may,
upon at least three Domestic Business Days’ irrevocable notice to the
Administrative Agent, (i) terminate the Commitments at any time, if no Loans are
outstanding at such time, or (ii) ratably reduce from time to time by an
aggregate amount of $5,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, the aggregate
amount of the Commitments in excess of the Total Outstanding Amount. Promptly
after receiving a notice pursuant to this subsection, the Administrative Agent
shall notify each Lender of the contents thereof.


(b)    Unless previously terminated, each Lender’s Commitment shall terminate on
the Revolver Termination Date applicable to such Lender.


Section 2.10.     Optional Prepayments. (a) The Borrower may (i) upon same day
notice to the Administrative Agent given not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York
City time), prepay any Base Rate Loans or (ii) upon at least three Euro-Dollar
Business Days’ notice to the Administrative Agent, prepay any Euro-Dollar Loans,
in each case without premium or penalty, in whole at any time, or from time to
time in part in amounts aggregating $5,000,000 or any larger multiple of
$1,000,000, by paying the principal amount to be prepaid together with interest
accrued thereon to the date of prepayment. Each such optional prepayment shall
be applied to prepay the Loans of the several Lenders ratably in proportion to
the Lenders’ Credit Exposures.


(b)    [Reserved.]


(c)    Promptly after receiving a notice of prepayment pursuant to this Section
2.10, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the contents thereof
and of such Lender’s ratable share (if any) of such prepayment, and such notice
shall not thereafter be revocable by the Borrower.


Section 2.11.     General Provisions as to Payments. (a) The Borrower shall make
each payment of principal of, and interest on, the Loans and of fees hereunder,
without defense, setoff or counterclaim, not later than 12:00 Noon (New York
City time) on the date when due, in Federal or other funds immediately available
in New York City, to the Administrative Agent at its address specified in or
pursuant to Section 9.01. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to
each Lender its ratable share of each such payment received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders. Whenever any payment of
principal of, or interest on, the Base Rate Loans or any payment of fees shall
be due on a day which is not a Domestic Business






26

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------






Day, the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Domestic Business Day. Whenever any payment of principal of, or interest on, the
Euro-Dollar Loans shall be due on a day which is not a Euro-Dollar Business Day,
the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Euro-Dollar Business Day unless such Euro-Dollar Business Day falls in another
calendar month, in which case the date for payment thereof shall be the next
preceding Euro-Dollar Business Day. If the date for any payment of principal is
extended by operation of law or otherwise, interest thereon shall be payable for
such extended time.


(b)    Unless the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent before the date on
which any payment is due to the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not
make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower
has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance on such assumption, cause to be
distributed to each Lender on such due date an amount equal to the amount then
due such Lender. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made
such payment, each Lender shall repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand such amount distributed to such Lender together with interest thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is distributed to such Lender until the
date such Lender repays such amount to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal
Funds Rate.


Section 2.12.     Funding Losses. If (i) the Borrower makes any payment of
principal with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan or any Euro-Dollar Loan is
converted to a Base Rate Loan (whether such payment or conversion is pursuant to
Article 2, 6 or 8 or otherwise) on any day other than the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto, or the last day of an applicable period
fixed pursuant to Section 2.06(c), (ii) the Borrower fails to borrow, prepay,
convert or continue any Euro-Dollar Loan after notice has been given to any
Lender in accordance with Section 2.04(a), 2.07(c) or 2.10(c) or (iii) a Lender
assigns its interest in any Euro-Dollar Loan other than on the last date of the
Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 8.06, the Borrower shall reimburse each Lender within 15
days after demand for any resulting loss or expense incurred by it (or by an
existing or prospective Participant in the related Loan), including (without
limitation) any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits
from third parties, but excluding loss of margin for the period after such
payment or conversion or failure to borrow, prepay, convert or continue;
provided that such Lender shall have delivered to the Borrower a certificate as
to the amount of such loss or expense, which certificate shall be conclusive in
the absence of manifest error.


Section 2.13.     Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest based on the Base
Rate hereunder (including computations of the Base Rate determined by reference
to the Euro-Dollar Rate) shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days
(or 366 days in a leap year) and paid for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day).  All












27

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------






other interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and
paid for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day).  


Section 2.14.     Notes; Evidence of Debt. (a) The Borrower hereby agrees that,
upon the request of any Lender at any time, such Lender’s Loans shall be
evidenced by a promissory note or notes of the Borrower (each a “Note”),
substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, payable to such Lender (or its
registered assigns) and representing the obligation of the Borrower to pay the
unpaid principal amount of the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender, with
interest as provided herein on the unpaid principal amount from time to time
outstanding.


(b)    Each Lender shall record the date, amount and type of each Loan made by
it and the date and amount of each payment of principal made by the Borrower
with respect thereto, and may, if such Lender so elects in connection with any
transfer or enforcement of its Note, endorse on the schedule forming a part
thereof appropriate notations to evidence the foregoing information with respect
to each such Loan then outstanding; provided that a Lender’s failure to make (or
any error in making) any such recordation or endorsement shall not affect the
Borrower’s obligations hereunder or under the Notes. Each Lender is hereby
irrevocably authorized by the Borrower so to endorse its Note and to attach to
and make a part of its Note a continuation of any such schedule as and when
required.


(c)    The Loan made by each Lender, whether or not evidenced by a Note, shall
be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by the Administrative
Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by
the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount
of the Loans made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments
thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however,
limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any
amount owing hereunder. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and
records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the
Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the
Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.


Section 2.15.     Regulation D Compensation. If and so long as a reserve
requirement of the type described in the definition of “Euro-Dollar Reserve
Percentage” is prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (or any successor), each Lender subject to such requirement may require
the Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on each of
such Lender’s Euro-Dollar Loans, additional interest on such Euro-Dollar Loan at
a rate per annum determined by such Lender up to but not exceeding the excess of
(i) (A) the applicable London Interbank Offered Rate divided by (B) one minus
the Euro-Dollar Reserve Percentage over (ii) the applicable London Interbank
Offered Rate. Any Lender wishing












28

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------






to require payment of such additional interest (x) shall so notify the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent, in which case such additional interest on the
Euro-Dollar Loans of such Lender to the Borrower shall be payable to such Lender
at the place indicated in such notice with respect to each Interest Period
commencing at least three Euro-Dollar Business Days after such Lender gives such
notice and (y) shall notify the Borrower at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days
before each date on which interest is payable on the Euro-Dollar Loans of the
amount then due it under this Section.


Section 2.16.     Change of Control. If a Change of Control shall occur with
respect to the Borrower, (i) the Borrower will, promptly after the occurrence
thereof, (x) give each Lender notice thereof and shall describe in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances giving rise thereto and (y) if requested,
furnish to the Administrative Agent updated documentation and other information
that is required by regulatory authorities under applicable “know your customer”
and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation
the USA PATRIOT Act and (ii) each Lender may, by three Domestic Business Days’
notice to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent given not later than 60 days
after such notice of Change of Control is received, terminate its Commitment,
which shall thereupon be terminated, and declare the Loans held by it (together
with accrued interest thereon) and any other amounts payable hereunder for its
account to be, and such Loans and such other amounts shall thereupon become,
immediately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice
of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower.


Section 2.17.     Increased Commitments; Additional Lenders.


(a)    From time to time (but no more than three times) prior to the Revolver
Termination Date the Borrower may, upon at least five Domestic Business Days’
notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly provide a copy of such
notice to the Lenders), increase the aggregate amount of the Commitments by an
amount not less than $25,000,000 (the amount of any such increase, the
“Increased Commitments”).


(b)    To effect such an increase, the Borrower may designate one or more
Eligible Assignees which at the time agree to (i) in the case of any such Person
that is an existing Lender, increase its Commitment and (ii) in the case of any
other such Person, become a party to this Agreement with a Commitment of not
less than $5,000,000; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, no Lender shall
be required to increase its Commitment pursuant to this Section 2.17.


(c)    Any increase in the Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.17 shall be
subject to satisfaction of the following conditions:














29

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------






(i)    before and after giving effect to such increase, all representations and
warranties contained in Article 4 shall be true;


(ii)    at the time of such increase, no Default shall have occurred and be
continuing or would result from such increase; and


(iii)    after giving effect to such increase, the aggregate amount of all
increases in Commitments made pursuant to this Section 2.17 shall not exceed
$250,000,000.


(d)    An increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant to this
Section 2.17 shall become effective upon the receipt by the Administrative Agent
of (i) an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent signed by the Borrower, by each Additional Lender and by
each other Lender whose Commitment is to be increased, setting forth the new
Commitments of such Lenders and setting forth the agreement of each Additional
Lender to become a party to this Agreement and to be bound by all the terms and
provisions hereof, (ii) such evidence of appropriate corporate authorization on
the part of the Borrower with respect to the Increased Commitments and such
opinions of counsel for the Borrower with respect to the Increased Commitments
as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request and (iii) a certificate of
the Borrower stating that the conditions set forth in subsection (c) above have
been satisfied.


(e)    Upon any increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant to
this Section 2.17, within five Domestic Business Days, in the case of Base Rate
Loans then outstanding, and at the end of the then current Interest Period with
respect thereto, in the case of Euro-Dollar Loans then outstanding, the Borrower
shall prepay or repay such Loans in their entirety and, to the extent the
Borrower elects to do so and subject to the conditions specified in Article 3,
the Borrower shall reborrow Loans from the Lenders in proportion to their
respective Commitments after giving effect to such increase, until such time as
all outstanding Loans are held by the Lenders in such proportion.


(f)    [reserved].    


Section 2.18.     Mandatory Prepayments and Commitment Reductions. (a) In the
event that the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries receives any Net Cash
Proceeds (including into escrow) of any incurrence, issuance, offering or
placement of Debt for borrowed money (including hybrid securities and debt
securities convertible into equity) (other than (i) Excluded Debt, (ii)
commercial paper issued by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in the
ordinary course of business, (iii) borrowings under the Existing Revolving
Credit Agreement up to an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the aggregate
commitments thereunder as in effect on the date hereof, (iv) intercompany
indebtedness between the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and


30

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










(v) the Loans) or any issuance of equity securities or equity-linked securities
(other than Excluded Equity), in each case on or after the Effective Date, then
the Commitments shall be
permanently and automatically reduced (or, if on or after the Term Loan
Conversion Date, the Loans shall be repaid) by an amount equal to 100% of such
Net Cash Proceeds, in each case not later than three Business Days following the
receipt by the Borrower or any such Subsidiary of such Net Cash Proceeds and in
accordance with Section 2.18(b). If, after giving effect to any reduction of the
Commitments the total Credit Exposures would exceed the total Commitments, then
the Borrower shall also, on the date of such reduction or at such other time,
repay or prepay Loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate such excess.


(b)    The Borrower shall promptly (and not later than the second Business Day
following receipt thereof) notify the Administrative Agent of the receipt by the
Borrower or, as applicable, any of its Subsidiaries, of such Net Cash Proceeds
referred to in clause (a) above. Each such notice shall not be revocable by the
Borrower, shall specify the prepayment or reduction date and the principal
amount of the Loans and/or Commitments to be prepaid or reduced, as the case may
be, and shall be accompanied by a reasonably detailed calculation of the Net
Cash Proceeds. Promptly after receiving a notice of prepayment or reduction
pursuant to this Section 2.18, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender
of the contents thereof and of such Lender’s ratable share (if any) of such
prepayment or reduction. Each prepayment or reduction under this Section 2.18
shall be applied ratably to the Loans and Commitments, as applicable.
Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest.
Section 2.19.     [Reserved].


Section 2.20.     Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the
following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting
Lender:


(a)    fees shall cease to accrue on the unused portion of the Commitment of
such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.08(a);


(b)    the Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in
determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action
hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification
pursuant to Section 9.05); provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to the
vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other
modification requiring the consent of each Lender or each Lender affected
thereby;


(c)    [reserved];








31

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










(d)    in the event that the Administrative Agent and the Borrower agree that a
Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to
be a Defaulting Lender, then on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such
of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine
may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such Loans in accordance with
its Percentage;


(e)    any payment of principal, interest, or other amounts received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of a Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary
or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Article 6 or otherwise) or received by
the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.04 shall
be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative
Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting
Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may
request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of
any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its
portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the
Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to
satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future funding obligations with
respect to Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the payment of any amounts
owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result
of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
fifth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any
amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender
as a result of such Defaulting Lender's breach of its obligations under this
Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a
court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a payment
of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender
has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made at a
time when the conditions set forth in Section 3.02 were satisfied or waived,
such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting
Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans
of such Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or
payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by
a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting
Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

ARTICLE 4


REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES


The Borrower represents and warrants on the Effective Date that:


34

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




    




Section 4.01.     Corporate Existence and Power. The Borrower is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation, and has all corporate powers and all material
governmental licenses, consents, authorizations and approvals required to carry
on its business as now conducted.


Section 4.02.     Corporate and Governmental Authorization; No Contravention.
The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower of this Agreement and
its Notes are within the Borrower’s corporate powers, have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action, require no action by or in respect of, or
filing with, any governmental body, agency or official and do not contravene, or
constitute a default under, any provision of applicable law or regulation or of
the Borrower’s certificate of incorporation or by-laws or of any agreement,
judgment, injunction, order, decree or other instrument binding upon the
Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the
Borrower.


Section 4.03.     Binding Effect. This Agreement constitutes a valid and binding
agreement of the Borrower and each Note of the Borrower, if and when executed
and delivered in accordance with this Agreement, will constitute a valid and
binding obligation of the Borrower, in each case enforceable in accordance with
its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws
affecting creditors’ rights generally and general principles of equity.


Section 4.04.     Financial Information. (a) The consolidated balance sheet of
the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2019 and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, capitalization and
retained earnings for the Fiscal Year then ended, reported on by
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and set forth in the Borrower’s 2019 Annual Report,
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such date and their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for such Fiscal Year in
conformity with GAAP.


(b)    Except for Disclosed Matters, as of the Effective Date, there has, since
December 31, 2019, been no material adverse change in the business, financial
position or results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated
Subsidiaries, considered as a whole.


Section 4.05.     Litigation. Except (solely with respect to clause (a) below)
as disclosed in the Borrower’s periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to
the Exchange Act prior to the date hereof, there is no action, suit or
proceeding pending against, or to the Borrower’s knowledge threatened against or
affecting, the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower before any court or
arbitrator or any governmental body, agency or official (a) in which, as of the
Effective Date,










35

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision which could materially
adversely affect the business, consolidated financial position or consolidated
results of operations of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries,
considered as a whole, or (b) which in any manner draws into question the
validity or enforceability of this Agreement or the Notes.


Section 4.06.     Compliance with ERISA. Each member of the ERISA Group has
fulfilled its obligations under the minimum funding standards of ERISA and the
Internal Revenue Code with respect to each Plan and is in compliance in all
material respects with the presently applicable provisions of ERISA and the
Internal Revenue Code with respect to each Plan. No member of the ERISA Group
has (i) sought a waiver of the minimum funding standard under Section 412 of the
Internal Revenue Code in respect of any Plan, (ii) failed to make any
contribution or payment to any Plan or Multiemployer Plan, or made any amendment
to any Plan, which has resulted or could result in the imposition of a Lien or
the posting of a bond or other security under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code
or (iii) incurred any liability under Title IV of ERISA other than a liability
to the PBGC for non-delinquent premiums under Section 4007 of ERISA.


Section 4.07.     Environmental Matters. In the ordinary course of its business,
the Borrower conducts an ongoing review of the effect of Environmental Laws on
the business, operations and properties of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in
the course of which it identifies and evaluates associated liabilities and costs
(including, without limitation, any capital or operating expenditures required
for clean-up or closure of properties presently or previously owned, any capital
or operating expenditures required to achieve or maintain compliance with
Environmental Laws or as a condition of any license, permit or contract, any
related constraints on operating activities, including any periodic or permanent
shutdown of any facility or reduction in the level of or change in the nature of
operations conducted thereat, any costs or liabilities in connection with
off-site disposal of wastes or Hazardous Substances and any actual or potential
liabilities to third parties, including employees, and any related costs and
expenses). On the basis of this review, the Borrower has reasonably concluded
that, except as disclosed in the Borrower’s periodic reports filed with the SEC
pursuant to the Exchange Act from time to time, such associated liabilities and
costs, including the costs of complying with Environmental Laws, are unlikely to
have a Material Adverse Effect.


Section 4.08.     Taxes. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed all United
States Federal income tax returns and all other material tax returns which are
required to be filed by them and have paid all taxes due pursuant to such
returns or pursuant to any assessment received by the Borrower or any Subsidiary
of the Borrower, except to the extent that any such assessment is being
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings. The charges, accruals and
reserves on the books of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in respect of
material taxes or other governmental charges are, in the Borrower’s opinion,
adequate.






36

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










Section 4.09.     Subsidiaries. Each of the Borrower’s Material Subsidiaries (if
any) is an entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, and has all powers and all
material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required
to carry on its business as now conducted.


Section 4.10.     Investment Company Status. The Borrower is not an “investment
company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.


Section 4.11.     Full Disclosure. As of the Effective Date, neither the
Borrower’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, as of the date of
filing of such Form 10-K, nor any registration statement (other than a
registration statement on Form S-8 (or its equivalent)) or report on Form 10-K,
10-Q and 8-K (or their equivalents) which the Borrower shall have subsequently
filed with the SEC, as at the time of filing of such registration statement or
report, as applicable, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to make any statements
contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading.


Section 4.12.     Sanctions and Anti-Corruption Laws. The Borrower and its
Subsidiaries have implemented and maintain in effect policies that, in order to
provide assurance that the Borrower and its Subsidiaries comply with applicable
Anti-Corruption Laws and Sanctions, instruct their respective directors and
officers with respect to compliance with applicable Anti-Corruption Laws and
Sanctions. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, any of its or their respective directors or officers
(x) is the subject or, to the Borrower’s knowledge, target of any Sanctions, (y)
is in violation of any Anti-Corruption Laws in any material respect or (z) is
located, organized or resident in a country or territory that is, or whose
government is, the subject or target of any Sanctions.

any Lender and shall thereupon notify all the Lenders thereof.


ARTICLE 7


THE AGENTS


Section 7.01.     Appointment and Authorization. Each Lender irrevocably
appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as agent on
its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement as are delegated to
the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with all such
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.


Section 7.02.     Administrative Agent and Affiliates. Bank of America, N.A.
shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any other Lender
and may exercise or refrain from exercising the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent, and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the
Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Bank of America, N.A.










46

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of,
act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally
engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or affiliate
of the Borrower as if it were not the Administrative Agent and without any duty
to account therefor to the Lenders.


Section 7.03.     Action by Administrative Agent. The obligations of the
Administrative Agent hereunder are only those expressly set forth herein, and
its duties shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:


(a)    shall not be required to take any action with respect to any Default,
except as expressly provided in Article 6;


(b)    shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless
of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, except as expressly
provided in Article 6;


(c)    shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any
discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly
contemplated hereby or under any Loan hereunder that the Administrative Agent is
required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for
herein or any borrowing hereunder), provided that the Administrative Agent shall
not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its
counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is contrary to
any borrowing hereunder or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt
any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor
Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of
property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and


(d)    shall not, except as expressly set forth herein or under any Loan
hereunder, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that
is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent
or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.


Section 7.04.     Consultation with Experts. The Administrative Agent may
consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent
public accountants and other experts selected by it and shall not be liable for
any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with
the advice of such counsel, accountants or experts.
















47

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










Section 7.05.     Liability of Administrative Agent. None of the Administrative
Agent, its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and
employees shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in connection
herewith (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such
different number of Lenders as any provision hereof expressly requires for such
consent or request) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final
and non-appealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to
have knowledge of any Default unless and until notice describing such Default is
given in writing to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender. None
of the Administrative Agent, its affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, agents and employees shall be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain, inquire into or verify (i) any statement, warranty or representation
made in connection with this Agreement or any borrowing hereunder; (ii) the
contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants or agreements of the Borrower; (iv) the
satisfaction of any condition specified in Article 3, except receipt of items
required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent; or (v) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, the Notes or any
other instrument or writing furnished in connection herewith. The Administrative
Agent shall not incur any liability by acting in reliance upon any notice,
consent, certificate, statement or other writing (which may be a facsimile or
similar writing) believed by it to be genuine or to be signed by the proper
party or parties. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made
to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper
party or parties, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In
determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan,
that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the
Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such
Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the
contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the use of the term “agent” in this Agreement with
reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
applicable law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom
and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
independent contracting parties.


Section 7.06.     Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any
and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder by or through
any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Administrative Agent; provided that,
unless the sub-agent is an Affiliate of the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower in advance of appointing the
sub-agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and
all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through their
respective Related










48

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such
sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities
as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for
the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court
of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that
the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in
the selection of such sub-agents.


Section 7.07.     Indemnification. The Lenders shall, ratably in proportion to
their Credit Exposures, indemnify the Administrative Agent, its affiliates and
their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrower) against any cost, expense (including counsel fees
and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as
result from such indemnitees’ gross negligence or willful misconduct) that such
indemnitees may suffer or incur in connection with this Agreement or any action
taken or omitted by such indemnitees hereunder.


Section 7.08.     Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance on any Agent or any other Lender, and based
on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance on any Agent or
any other Lender, and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking any action under this Agreement.


Section 7.09.     Successor Administrative Agent.


(a)    The Administrative Agent may resign at any time by giving notice thereof
to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders
shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative Agent; provided that
any such appointment shall be subject to consent of the Borrower (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing with respect to the Borrower. If no successor
Administrative Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and
shall have accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of resignation (or such earlier day as shall
be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the
retiring Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of
the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a
commercial bank organized or licensed under the laws of the United States or of
any State thereof and having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$100,000,000; provided that any such appointment










49

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










shall be subject to consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing with respect to the Borrower and provided further that in no event
shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Lender. Whether or
not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in
accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date.


(b)    If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting Lender
pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, either the Required Lenders or
the Borrower may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in
writing to the Borrower, if applicable, and such Person, remove such Person as
Administrative Agent and, the Required Lenders may appoint a successor; provided
that any such appointment shall be subject to consent of the Borrower (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Borrower. If no such
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed
by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal Effective Date”), then such removal shall
nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal
Effective Date.


(c)    Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder
by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights and duties of the
Administrative Agent that resigned or was removed pursuant to subsections (a) or
(b) of this Section 7.09 (the “Retiring Administrative Agent”), and the Retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. On and after the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective
Date, as applicable:


(i)    except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the
Retiring Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations
provided to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be
made by or to each Lender directly, until such time, if any, as the Required
Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided for above; and


(ii)    the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect
for the benefit of such Retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them (i) while the Retiring Administrative Agent was acting as
Administrative Agent and (ii) after such resignation or removal for as long as
any of them continues to act in any capacity hereunder, including in respect of
any actions taken in connection with transferring the agency to any successor
Administrative Agent.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










Section 7.10.     Administrative Agent’s Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent for its own account fees in the amounts and at the times
previously agreed upon by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent.


Section 7.11.     Other Agents. None of the Documentation Agents and Syndication
Agent, in its capacity as such, shall have any duty or obligation of any kind
under this Agreement.


Section 7.12.     Certain ERISA Matters.


(a)    Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date such Person
became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person
became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party
hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance
of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower, that at least one of the
following is and will be true:


(i)    such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section
3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans with respect to such
Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of
the Loans, the Commitments or this Agreement,


(ii)    the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as PTE
84-14 (a class exemption for certain transactions determined by independent
qualified professional asset managers), PTE 95-60 (a class exemption for certain
transactions involving insurance company general accounts), PTE 90-1 (a class
exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate
accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank
collective investment funds) or PTE 96-23 (a class exemption for certain
transactions determined by in-house asset managers), is applicable with respect
to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and
performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement,


(iii)    (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified
Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B)
such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment decision on behalf
of such Lender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans,
the Commitments and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in,
administration of and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this
Agreement satisfies the requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I
of PTE 84- 14 and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of
subsection (a) of Part I of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such
Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of
the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement, or (iv) such other
representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the
Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, and such Lender.


    


51

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------








(b)     In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause (i) in the immediately
preceding clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has
provided another representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with
sub-clause (iv) in the immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x)
represents and warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party
hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party
hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the
benefit of, the Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or
for the benefit of the Borrower, that the Administrative Agent is not a
fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s
entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans,
the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation
or exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or
any documents related hereto).
ARTICLE 8
CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES
Section 8.01.     Basis for Determining Interest Rate Inadequate or Unfair. If
on or before the first day of any Interest Period for any Euro-Dollar Loans
Lenders having at least 50% in aggregate amount of the Commitments advise the
Administrative Agent that the London Interbank Offered Rate, as determined by
the Administrative Agent, will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
such Lenders of funding their Euro-Dollar Loans for such Interest Period, the
Administrative Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to the Borrower and the
Lenders, whereupon until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, (i) the
obligations of the Lenders to make Euro-Dollar Loans or to continue or convert
outstanding Loans as or into Euro-Dollar Loans shall be suspended and (ii) each
outstanding Euro-Dollar Loan shall be converted into a Base Rate Loan on the
last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto. Unless the
Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent at least two Domestic Business Days
before the date of any affected Borrowing for which a Notice of Borrowing has
previously been given that it elects not to borrow on such date, if such
affected Borrowing is a Euro-Dollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall instead be
made as a Base Rate Borrowing.


Section 8.02.     Illegality. If, on or after the date hereof, any Change in Law
shall make it unlawful or impossible for any Lender (or its Euro-Dollar Lending
Office) to make, maintain or fund its Euro-Dollar Loans and such Lender shall so
notify the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith give
notice thereof to the other Lenders and the Borrower, whereupon until such
Lender notifies the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that the circumstances
giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligation of such Lender to










52

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










make Euro-Dollar Loans, or to convert outstanding Loans into Euro-Dollar Loans
or continue outstanding Loans as Euro-Dollar Loans, in each case to the Borrower
shall be suspended. Before giving any notice to the Administrative Agent
pursuant to this Section, such Lender shall designate a different Euro-Dollar
Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for giving such notice
and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to
such Lender. If such notice is given, each Euro-Dollar Loan of such Lender then
outstanding to the Borrower shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan either (a) on
the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Euro-Dollar
Loan if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan as a
Euro-Dollar Loan to such day or (b) immediately if such Lender shall determine
that it may not lawfully continue to maintain and fund such Loan as a
Euro-Dollar Loan to such day. Interest and principal on any such Base Rate Loan
shall be payable on the same dates as, and on a pro rata basis with, the
interest and principal payable on the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other
Lenders.


Section 8.03.     Increased Cost and Reduced Return.


(a)    If on or after the date hereof any Change in Law


(i)    shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including, without
limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, but excluding with respect to any Euro-Dollar Loan any
such requirement with respect to which such Lender is entitled to compensation
during the relevant Interest Period under ection 2.15), special deposit,
insurance assessment or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or
for the account of, or credit (including letters of credit and participations
therein) extended by, any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office);


(ii)    shall impose on any Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) or on the
London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than taxes)
affecting its Euro-Dollar Loans, its Notes or its obligation to make Euro-Dollar
Loans; or


(ii)    shall subject any Lender or Agent to any taxes (other than (A) Taxes,
(B) taxes described in (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the exclusions from Taxes and
(C) Other Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments,
or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital
attributable thereto;


and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender
(or its Applicable Lending Office) of making or maintaining any Euro-Dollar Loan
(or, in the case of a Change in Law with respect to taxes, any Loan) or to
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such




53

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------








Lender (or its Applicable Lending Office) under this Agreement or under its
Notes with respect thereto, by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material,
then, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such increased cost or
reduction.
(b)    If any Lender shall have determined that, after the date hereof, any
Change in Law has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on
capital or liquidity of such Lender (or its Parent) as a consequence of such
Lender’s obligations hereunder to a level below that which such Lender (or its
Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, request or directive
(taking into consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy or
liquidity) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material, then from time to
time, within 15 days after demand by such Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender (or its Parent) for such
reduction.


(c)    Each Lender will promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent of any event of which it has knowledge, occurring after the date hereof,
which will entitle such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section and will
designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such designation will avoid
the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the
judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to it. A certificate of
any Lender claiming compensation under this Section and setting forth the
additional amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender, as the case
may be, shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.


(d)    Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation
pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's right to
demand such compensation; provided that no Borrower shall be required to
compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or
reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender, as
the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim
compensation therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise
to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period
referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof.


Section 8.04.     Taxes. (a) For the purposes of this Agreement, the following
terms have the following meanings: “FATCA” means (a) Sections 1471 through 1474
of the Internal Revenue Code, as of the date of this Agreement (or any amended
or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more
onerous to comply with), any current or future regulations or official
interpretations thereof, (b) any agreement entered into pursuant to Section






54

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










1471(b)(1) of the Code and (c) any intergovernmental agreement between the
United States and any other jurisdiction which facilitates the implementation of
any law or regulation referred to in clause (a) above and any fiscal or
regulatory legislation, rules or official administrative practices adopted
pursuant to any such intergovernmental agreement. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term “applicable law” includes FATCA.


“Taxes” means any and all present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts,
deductions, charges or withholdings with respect to any payment by or on account
of the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note, and all
liabilities with respect thereto, excluding (i) in the case of each Lender and
the Administrative Agent, taxes imposed on its net income, and franchise or
similar taxes imposed on it, by a jurisdiction under the laws of which it is
organized or in which its principal executive office is located or, in the case
of a Lender, in which its Applicable Lending Office is located, (ii) in the case
of each Lender, any United States withholding taxes imposed on such payment, but
not excluding any portion of such tax that exceeds the United States withholding
tax which would have been imposed on such a payment to such Lender under the
laws and treaties in effect (x) when such Lender first becomes a party to this
Agreement or (y) when such Lender changes its Applicable Lending Office, (iii)
taxes attributable to such Lender’s or Administrative Agent’s failure to comply
with Section 8.04(e), (f), (g) or (h) and (iv) any U.S. federal withholding
Taxes imposed under FATCA.
“Other Taxes” means any present or future stamp or documentary taxes and any
other excise or property taxes, or similar charges or levies, which arise from
any payment made pursuant to this Agreement or under any Note or from the
execution, delivery, registration or enforcement of, or otherwise with respect
to, this Agreement or any Note.
(b)    All payments by or on account of the Borrower to or for the account of
any Lender or the Administrative Agent hereunder or under any Note shall be made
without deduction for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law. If any
withholding agent shall be required by law to deduct any Taxes from any such
payment, (i) the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so
that after all required deductions for Taxes are made (including deductions
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such withholding
agent shall make such deductions, (iii) such withholding agent shall pay the
full amount deducted to the relevant taxation authority or other authority in
accordance with applicable law and (iv) if the withholding agent is the
Borrower, the Borrower shall promptly furnish to the Administrative Agent, at
its address specified in or pursuant to Section 9.01, the original or a
certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof.


(c)    In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any Other Taxes.


    


55

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------












(d)    The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and the Administrative Agent
for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes (including, without limitation, any
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted (whether or not correctly) by any
jurisdiction on amounts payable under this Section) paid by such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) and any liability (including
penalties, interest and expenses) arising therefrom or with respect thereto.
This indemnification shall be paid within 15 days after such Lender or the
Administrative Agent (as the case may be) makes demand therefor.


(e)    Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding Tax with respect to payments made under this Agreement or any Note
shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly
completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding
or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to
backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion,
execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation
set forth in Section 8.04(f), (g) and (h)) below) shall not be required if in
the Lender's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would
subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would
materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Each
Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires
or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or
certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in
writing of its legal inability to do so.


(f)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender that is not
a U.S. person, before it signs and delivers this Agreement in the case of each
Lender listed on the signature pages hereof and before it becomes a Lender in
the case of each other Lender, and from time to time thereafter if requested in
writing by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (but only so long as such
Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the
recipient) with whichever of the following is applicable:


(i)    in the case of a Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to
which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest
hereunder or under any Note, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form
W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S.
Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty
and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments hereunder or under any
Note, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form


56

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------












W-8BEN-E, as applicable, establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S.
Federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income”
article of such tax treaty;


(ii)    executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;


(iii)    in the case of a Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for
portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, (x) a
certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-1 to the effect that such
Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Internal Revenue Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the
meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a “controlled
foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Internal Revenue
Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed copies of IRS Form
W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable; or


(iv)    to the extent a Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies of
IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form
W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the
form of Exhibit H-2 or Exhibit H-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification
documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Lender
is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Lender are
claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Lender may provide a U.S. Tax
Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit H-4 on behalf of
each such direct and indirect partner.


(g)    Any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a
Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies
of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. Federal backup
withholding tax.


(h)    If a payment made to a Lender hereunder or under any Note would be
subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to
fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including
those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, as
applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such
documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section
1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code) and such additional documentation
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the








57

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such
Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine
the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
clause (h), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of
this Agreement.


(i)    If a Lender, that is otherwise exempt from or subject to a reduced rate
of withholding tax, becomes subject to Taxes because of its failure to deliver a
form required hereunder, the Borrower shall take such steps as such Lender shall
reasonably (at the expense of such Lender) request to assist such Lender to
recover such Taxes.


(j)    If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to or for the
account of any Lender pursuant to this Section as a result of a change in law or
treaty occurring after such Lender first became a party to this Agreement, then
such Lender will, at the Borrower’s request, change the jurisdiction of its
Applicable Lending Office if, in the judgment of such Lender, such change will
eliminate or reduce any such additional payment which may thereafter accrue and
is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Lender.


(k)    Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10
days after demand therefor, for (i) any Taxes attributable to such Lender (but
only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the
Administrative Agent for such Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the
Borrower to do so), (ii) any taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to
comply with the provisions of Section 9.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a
Participant Register and (iii) any taxes excluded from the definition of Taxes
and attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the
Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement or any Note, and any
reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto. A certificate as
to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender
hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all
amounts at any time owing to such Lender hereunder or under any Note or
otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other
source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this paragraph
(k).


(l)    Unless required by applicable laws, at no time shall the Administrative
Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender,
or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of taxes withheld or
deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender, as the case may be.

Section 8.05.     Base Rate Loans Substituted for Affected Euro-Dollar Loans. If
(i) the obligation of any Lender to make, or to continue or convert outstanding
Loans as or to, Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or
(ii) any Lender has demanded compensation from a Borrower under Section 8.03 or
8.04 with respect to its Euro-Dollar Loans, and in any such case the Borrower
shall, by at least five Euro-Dollar Business Days’ prior notice to such Lender
through the Administrative Agent, have elected that the provisions of this
Section shall apply to such Lender, then, unless and until such Lender notifies
the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension or demand for
compensation no longer exist, all Loans which would otherwise be made by such
Lender as (or continued as or converted to) Euro-Dollar Loans shall instead be
Base Rate Loans on which interest and principal shall be payable
contemporaneously with the related Euro-Dollar Loans of the other Lenders. If
such Lender notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
suspension or demand for compensation no longer exist, the principal amount of
each such Base Rate Loan shall be converted into a Euro-Dollar Loan on the first
day of the next succeeding Interest Period applicable to the related Euro-Dollar
Loans of the other Lenders.


Section 8.06.     Substitution of Lender. If (i) the obligation of any Lender to
make Euro-Dollar Loans has been suspended pursuant to Section 8.02 or (ii) any
Lender has demanded compensation under Section 8.03 or 8.04, the Borrower shall
have the right, with the assistance of the Administrative Agent, to seek a
mutually satisfactory substitute bank or banks (which may be one or more of the
Lenders) to purchase the Loans and assume the Commitment of such Lender.

the Administrative Agent, at its address or facsimile number set forth on the
signature pages hereof, (b) in the case of any Lender, at its address or

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be delivered or
furnished by electronic communication (including e‑mail and Internet or intranet
websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the Administrative Agent; provided
that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to Article
2 if such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that it is incapable of
receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication. The
Administrative Agent or the Borrower may, in its discretion, agree to accept
notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications
pursuant to procedures approved by it, provided that approval of such procedures
may be limited to particular notices or communications.
Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other
communications sent to a facsimile number or e-mail address shall be deemed
received upon the sender’s receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended
recipient (such as by the “return receipt requested” function, as available,
return e-mail or other written acknowledgement), provided that if such notice or
other communication is not sent during the normal business hours of the

opening of business on the next business day for the recipient, and (ii) notices
or communications posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed
received upon the deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address

THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” THE AGENT PARTIES (AS
DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE BORROWER
MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR
ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS OR
FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT PARTY IN
CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the
Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the “Agent
Parties”) have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort,
contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrower’s or the Administrative
Agent’s transmission of Borrower Materials or notices through the Platform, any
other electronic platform or electronic messaging service, or through the
Internet.
Section 9.02.     No Waivers. No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or
any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any
Note shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further






60

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies provided by law.


Section 9.03.     Expenses; Indemnification. (a) The Borrower shall pay (i) all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent,
including reasonable and documented fees and disbursements of one special
counsel for the Administrative Agent, in connection with the preparation and
administration of this Agreement, any waiver or consent hereunder or any
amendment hereof or any Default or alleged Default hereunder and (ii) if an
Event of Default occurs, all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, including (without duplication) the fees
and disbursements of outside counsel and the allocated cost of inside counsel,
in connection with such Event of Default and collection, bankruptcy, insolvency
and other enforcement proceedings resulting therefrom.


(b)    The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Joint Lead
Arrangers and each Lender, their respective affiliates and the respective
directors, officers, agents, employees and other representatives of each of the
foregoing (each an “Indemnitee”) and hold each Indemnitee harmless from and
against any and all liabilities, losses, claims, damages, costs and expenses of
any kind, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel, which may be incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with any
investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding (whether or not such
Indemnitee shall be designated a party thereto) brought or threatened relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, any actual or proposed use of proceeds of
Loans hereunder or the transactions contemplated hereunder, regardless of
whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, and to reimburse each Indemnitee upon
demand for any legal or other expenses incurred in connection with investigating
or defending any of the foregoing; provided that no Indemnitee shall have the
right to be indemnified hereunder for such Indemnitee’s own gross negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct, in each case as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable judgment and provided
further that each Indemnitee shall be obligated to refund or return any and all
amounts paid by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 9.03 to such Indemnitee
for any liabilities, losses, claims, damages, costs and expenses to the extent
such Indemnitee is not entitled to payment thereof in accordance with the terms
hereof.


(c)    This Section 9.03 shall survive any termination of this Agreement, the
termination or assignment of the Commitments and the repayment of all
outstanding Loans.


(d)    To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, each party hereto and
each Indemnitee hereby waives, any claim, on any theory of liability, for
special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or
actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated








61

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of
the proceeds thereof; provided that nothing in this clause (d) shall limit the
Borrower’s indemnification and reimbursement obligations in this Section 9.03 to
the extent such indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages are
included in any claim by a person unaffiliated with the applicable Indemnitee
with respect to which the applicable Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification
as set forth in this Section 9.03.


Section 9.04.     Set-offs; Sharing.


(a)    If (i) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the
Required Lenders have requested the Administrative Agent to declare the Loans to
be immediately due and payable pursuant to Article 6, or the Loans have become
immediately due and payable without notice as provided in Article 6, then the
Administrative Agent, each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates are
hereby authorized by the Borrower at any time and from time to time, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, without notice to the Borrower (any such
notice being expressly waived by the Borrower), to set off and apply all
deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time
held and other indebtedness at any time owing by the Administrative Agent, such
Lender or any such Affiliate, as the case may be, to or for the account of the
Borrower against any obligations of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent or
such Lender, as the case may be, now or hereafter existing under this Agreement,
regardless of whether any such deposit or other obligation is then due and
payable or is in the same currency or is booked or otherwise payable at the same
office as the obligation against which it is set off and regardless of whether
the Administrative Agent, such Lender or any such Affiliate, as the case may be,
shall have made any demand for payment under this Agreement. The Administrative
Agent, each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates agree promptly to
notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application is made by such
party; provided that any failure to give such notice shall not affect the
validity of such setoff and application. The rights of the Administrative Agent,
the Lenders and their respective Affiliates under this subsection are in
addition to any other rights and remedies which they may have.


(b)    Each Lender agrees that if it shall, by exercising any right of set-off
or counterclaim or otherwise, receive payment of a proportion of the aggregate
amount of principal and interest then due with respect to the Loans held by it
which is greater than the proportion received by any other Lender in respect of
the aggregate amount of principal and interest then due with respect to the
Loans held by such other Lender, the Lender receiving such proportionately
greater payment shall purchase such participations in the Loans held by the
other Lenders, and such other adjustments shall be made, as may be required so
that all such payments of principal and interest with respect to the Loans held
by the Lenders shall be shared by the Lenders pro rata; provided that nothing in
this Section shall impair the right of any Lender to exercise any right of
set-off or counterclaim it may have and to apply the amount subject to such
exercise to the payment of indebtedness of the Borrower other than indebtedness
in respect of the Loans. The Borrower agrees, to the fullest extent it may
effectively do so under applicable law,


62

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










that any holder of a participation in a Loan, whether or not acquired pursuant
to the foregoing arrangements, may exercise rights of set-off or counterclaim
and other rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such holder
of a participation were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation.


Section 9.05.     Amendments and Waivers. Any provision of this Agreement or the
Notes may be amended or waived if, but only if, (x) such amendment or waiver is
in writing, (y) such amendment or waiver is signed by the Borrower and the
Required Lenders (and, if the rights or duties of any the Administrative Agent
are affected thereby, by it) and (z) the Borrower has notified the
Administrative Agent of such amendment or waiver in writing; provided that no
such amendment or waiver shall:


(a)    unless signed by each affected Lender, (i) increase the Commitment of any
Lender, (ii) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan or any
interest thereon or any fees hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any
payment of principal of or interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder or for the
termination of any Commitment or (iv) alter the pro rata treatment of the
Lenders as provided herein in a manner adverse to any Lender;


(b)    unless signed by all Lenders, change the percentage of the Commitments or
of the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Loans, or the number of Lenders,
which shall be required for the Lenders or any of them to take any action under
this Section or any other provision of this Agreement; or


(c)    unless signed by the Administrative Agent, amend, modify or otherwise
affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder.


It is understood that the operation of Section 2.17 in accordance with their
terms is not an amendment subject to this Section 9.05.


Section 9.06.     Successors and Assigns. (a) The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may
not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of each Lender and the Administrative Agent
(and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent
shall be null and void).
















63

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










(b)    Any Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that (i)
except in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the
assigning Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the
case of an assignment to a Lender or an affiliate of a Lender or an Approved
Fund with respect to a Lender, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for
this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder) subject to each such
assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption Agreement,
as hereinafter defined, with respect to such assignment is delivered to the
Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000, unless each of the
Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event of Default with respect to the
Borrower has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); (ii) each partial
assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the
assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement with respect to
the Loan or the Commitment assigned and (iii) the parties to each assignment
shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an agreement,
substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto (an “Assignment and Assumption
Agreement”), together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and the
Eligible Assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. Subject to acceptance and
recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
Assumption Agreement, the Eligible Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto
and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption
Agreement, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and
the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by
such Assignment and Assumption Agreement, be released from its obligations under
this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement
covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this
Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 8.03, 8.04 and 9.03). Any assignment or
transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a
sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
accordance with paragraph (d) of this Section.


(c)    The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of
the Borrower, shall maintain a copy of each Assignment and Assumption Agreement
delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of (and stated
interest on) the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from
time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive
absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent










64

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.


(d)    Any Lender may, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(other than the Borrower or its Affiliates, a Defaulting Lender or its
Affiliates, or a natural person, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such
Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such
Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this
Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, modification or waiver described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii)
of Section 9.05(a) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (e) of
this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.12 and 2.15 and Article 8 to the same extent as if it
were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph
(b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall
be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.04 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 9.04 as though it were a
Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this
purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which
it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts of
(and stated interest on) each Participant's interest in the Loans or other
obligations hereunder or under any Note (the “Participant Register”); provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the
Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any
information relating to a Participant's interest in any Commitments, Loans or
its other obligations hereunder or under any Note) to any Person except to the
extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan
or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the
United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register
shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such
participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to
the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its
capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a
Participant Register.








65

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------








(e)    A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 8.03 or 8.04 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to
receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the
sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior
written consent or except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater
payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired
the applicable participation. A Participant organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction outside the United States shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 8.04 unless such Participant complies with the requirements of Section
8.04 as though it were a Lender (it being understood that the documentation
required under Section 8.04(f) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)).


(f)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such
Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or
assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.


Section 9.07.     [Reserved.]


Section 9.08.     No Reliance on Margin Stock. Each of the Lenders represents to
each Agent and each of the other Lenders that it in good faith is not relying
upon any “margin stock” (as defined in Regulation U) as collateral in the
extension or maintenance of the credit provided for in this Agreement.


Section 9.09.     Confidentiality. (a) The Administrative Agent and each Lender
agrees to keep any information delivered or made available by the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement confidential from anyone other than persons employed
or retained by such Lender who are engaged in evaluating, approving, structuring
or administering the credit facility contemplated hereby; provided that nothing
herein shall prevent any Lender from disclosing such information (a) to its and
its affiliates’ directors, officers, employees, controlling persons and agents,
including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors who need to know such
information (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is
made will be informed of the confidential nature of such information and
instructed to keep such information confidential), (b) to any other Lender or to
the Administrative Agent, (c) to any other Person if reasonably incidental to
the administration of the credit facility contemplated hereby, (d) upon the
order of any court or administrative agency (in which case such Person agrees to
inform the Borrower promptly thereof to the extent practicable and not
prohibited by law or such order), (e) upon the request or demand of any
regulatory agency or authority or self regulatory authority, (f) which (i) had
been publicly disclosed other than as a result of a disclosure by the
Administrative Agent or










66

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










any Lender prohibited by this Agreement (ii) becomes available to any of them on
a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Borrower or one of their
agents (which source, to the knowledge of the Lenders, is not bound by any
obligation of confidentiality to the Borrower) or (iii) was known to any of them
on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to them (as the case may be)
by the Borrower or one of its agents, (g) in connection with any litigation to
which the Administrative Agent, any Lender or its subsidiaries or Parent may be
a party (in which case such Person agrees to inform the Borrower promptly
thereof to the extent practicable and not prohibited by law or such legal
process), (h) to the extent necessary in connection with the exercise of any
remedy hereunder, (i) subject to provisions substantially similar to those
contained in this Section, to any actual or proposed Participant or Eligible
Assignee or to any direct or indirect contractual counterparties (or the
professional advisors thereto) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to
the Borrower and its obligations, (j) to any rating agency or CUSIP Bureau when
required by it or (k) with the Borrower’s consent.


(b)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any party hereto (and
any employee, representative or other agent of thereof) may disclose to any and
all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the U.S. federal income tax
treatment and the U.S. federal income tax structure of the transactions
contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other
tax analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure. However, no disclosure of any information relating to such tax
treatment or tax structure may be made to the extent nondisclosure is reasonably
necessary in order to comply with applicable securities laws.


Section 9.10.     Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction. This Agreement and
each Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York. The Borrower hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York or, if
that court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, of any State court located
in the City and County of New York and any appellate court thereof for purposes
of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Borrower irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter
have to the laying of the venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court
and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been brought
in an inconvenient forum.


Section 9.11.     Counterparts; Integration. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each
of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together
shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the Notes, and any separate
letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the










67

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










Administrative Agent, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating
to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.


Section 9.12.     WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF
OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.


Section 9.13.     USA PATRIOT Act Notice. Each Lender that is subject to the USA
PATRIOT Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any
Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that, pursuant to the requirements of the
USA PATRIOT Act, it may be required to obtain, verify and record information
that identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of
the Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the
Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with
the USA PATRIOT Act.


Section 9.14.     No Advisory or Fiduciary Duty. The Borrower agrees that in
connection with all aspects of the Loans contemplated by this Agreement and any
transactions in connection therewith, (i) (A) the arranging and other services
regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Joint Lead
Arrangers and the Lenders are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the
Borrower and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the
Joint Lead Arrangers and the Lenders, on the other hand, (B) the Borrower has
consulted its own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent
it has deemed appropriate, and (C) the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and
understands and accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions
contemplated hereby and by the Notes; (ii) (A) the Administrative Agent, each
Joint Lead Arranger and each Lender is and has been acting solely as a principal
and, except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not
been, is not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the
Borrower or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) neither the
Administrative Agent, any Joint Lead Arranger nor any Lender has any obligation
to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in
the Notes; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, the Joint Lead Arrangers and the
Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of
transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and
its Affiliates, and neither the Administrative Agent, any Joint Lead Arranger
nor any Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the
Borrower or any of its Affiliates. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the
Borrower hereby waives and releases any claims that it may have against the
Administrative Agent, any Joint Lead Arranger or any Lender with respect to any
breach or alleged breach of agency or fiduciary duty in connection with any
aspect of any transaction contemplated hereby.






68

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------












Section 9.15.     Survival. Each party's rights and obligations under Articles
7, 8 and 9 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative
Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the
termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of
all obligations hereunder or under any Note.


Section 9.16.     Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other
Documents. The words “execute,” “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of
like import in or related to any document to be signed in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including without limitation
Assignment and Assumption Agreements, amendments or other modifications, any
Notice of Borrowing, any Notice of Interest Election, waivers and consents)
shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, the electronic matching of
assignment terms and contract formations on electronic platforms approved by the
Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of
which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a
manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as
the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law,
including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act,
the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar
state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided that
notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary the Administrative
Agent is under no obligation to agree to accept electronic signatures in any
form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent
pursuant to procedures approved by it.


Section 9.17.     Acknowledgment And Consent To Bail-in Of Affected Financial
Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any

OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR
CONSOLIDATED EDISON, INC.
April 6, 2020


To the Lenders and the Administrative Agent
Referred to Below
c/o Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent
One Bryant Park
New York, New York 10036


I am Senior Vice President and General Counsel of Consolidated Edison, Inc., a
New York corporation (the “Company”), and as such am familiar with the legal
affairs of the Company. I and other members of the Law Department of
Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., the principal subsidiary of the
Company, have represented the Company in connection with the Credit Agreement
dated as of April 6, 2020 (the “Credit Agreement”) among the Company,the Lenders
party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent. Capitalized
terms used herein without definition are used as defined in the Credit
Agreement. This opinion is being rendered to you at the request of our clients
pursuant to Section 3.01(b) of the Credit Agreement.
In connection with this opinion letter, I have examined an execution copy of the
Credit Agreement and originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to
my satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records and certificates of public
officials and have discussed the foregoing documents and such other matters with
such personnel of the Law Department and such officials of the Company, as I
considered necessary or appropriate to enable me to express the opinions stated
in this letter. In such examination, I have assumed the genuineness of all
documents submitted to me as originals, and the conformity to the originals of
all documents submitted to me as copies.
Based on the foregoing and subject to the other qualifications, assumptions and
limitations stated herein, it is my opinion that:
1.    The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of New York and has all corporate powers and all
material governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required
to carry on its business as now conducted.
2.    The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Credit
Agreement and the Notes are within the Company’s corporate powers, have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action and require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency or official, and
do not contravene, or constitute a default under, any provision of applicable
law or regulation or of the Company’s certificate of incorporation or by-laws
or, to my knowledge, of any agreement, judgment, injunction, order, decree or
other instrument binding upon the Company or any Material Subsidiary or result
in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any
Material Subsidiary.


F-1

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------








3.    The Credit Agreement constitutes a valid and binding agreement of the
Company and each Note issued thereunder today constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of the Company, in each case enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws affecting
creditors’ rights generally and general principles of equity.
4.    Except as otherwise disclosed in the Company’s periodic reports under the
Exchange Act, to the best of my knowledge, there is no action, suit or
proceeding pending or threatened against or affecting the Company or any
Material Subsidiary before any court or arbitrator or any governmental body,
agency or official, in which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse
decision which could materially adversely affect the business, consolidated
financial position or consolidated results of operations of the Company and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries, considered as a whole, or which in any manner draws
into question the validity of the Credit Agreement or the Notes.
5.    Each of the Company’s Material Subsidiaries is a corporation validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation, and has all corporate powers and all material governmental
licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its
business as now conducted.
This letter is provided as a legal opinion only, and not as a guaranty or
warranty of the matters discussed herein. The opinion expressed in this letter
is limited to the matters stated herein, and no opinion is implied or may be
inferred beyond the matters expressly stated.
The opinions expressed in this letter are based on laws and regulations as in
effect on the date hereof and facts as I understand them as of the date hereof.
I am not assuming any obligation, and do not undertake to revise, update or
supplement this opinion letter after the date hereof notwithstanding any change
in applicable law or regulation or interpretation thereof, any amendment,
supplement modification or rescission of any document examined or relied on in
connection herewith, or any change in the facts, after the date hereof.
I am admitted to the bars of the State of Connecticut, the State of Delaware and
the District of Columbia, and I express no opinion as to any laws of any
jurisdiction other than those of the State of New York and the federal laws of
the United States of America to the extent specifically referred to herein (the
“Applicable Laws”). With respect to the laws of the State of New York, I have
received advice,




























F-2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------










satisfactory to me, from New York counsel in the Law Department admitted in such
jurisdiction. Insofar as the opinions expressed herein relate to matters
governed by laws other than the Applicable Laws, I have assumed, without having
made any independent investigation, that such laws do not affect any of the
opinions set forth herein.


The opinions expressed in this letter are rendered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Credit Agreement solely for your benefit and
are not to be relied upon, quoted, circulated, used or otherwise referred to for
any other purpose, nor may it be relied upon by any other person, without my
prior written consent.
Very truly yours,
