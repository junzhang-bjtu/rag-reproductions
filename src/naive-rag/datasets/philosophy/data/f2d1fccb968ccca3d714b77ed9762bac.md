## Nietzsche's Use of Intellectual History

Nietzsche's views of history and historiography are just those that a "philosopher of life" and practitioner of the art of cultural analysis would have. As a cultural analyst, Nietzsche was philosophic in the sense that he criticized values, institutions and ideas (both artistic and religious) at the most reflective possible levels. Among the connotations of "reflective" we must include both "self-reflective" and "practical," if we are to understand Nietzsche. Under "practical" we must include "diagnostic," in the sense of examining patterns of conduct that correspond to intellectual pathologies, on Nietzsche's analysis. Because Nietzsche makes such abundant use of ancient Greek thought in advancing his critique of the ideas of his own time, we can contrast his practice of intellectual history with his overt statements about the use of history in "The Advantage and Disadvantage of History for Life."

Now, Nietzsche felt that it was "only insofar as he was the nursling of older ages like the Greek rather than a child of the present age" that he had come to his "untimely" insights.1 But he also believed that "only he who is building the future has a right to judge the past" (UAH 41). So, since "you can explain the past only by what is most powerful in the present," it would follow for Nietzsche that: while the past is partly constitutive of the present, only those who are seeking to overcome a present which they understand and wish to change, are good explainers of the human past. These are just those who both have a historical consciousness and wish to use it creatively.

But the historical sense prevalent in Nietzsche's Germany looked like "a malignant fever" (UAH sec. 4) to him and a "sign of decay."2 So Nietzsche's book is a criticism of the forms which historical consciousness had taken in his day. But Nietzsche's work as a whole is itself an expression of the reason why his age was obsessed with history, namely, the hope that the past might provide models of conduct for the present. This search for models, Nietzsche believed, has both healthy and unhealthy forms. But the hope itself, it should be noted, is a corollary of the spreading disbelief to which Nietzsche is a decided contributor. Many historians also hoped to uncover, in the historical process itself, some pattern within which man's salvation, or perfectibility, could be heralded as immanent or possible. But Nietzsche's excursus on forgetfulness which opens UAH is clearly a response to the overselling of the historical sense by scholars and popularizers.

The concern of UAH is to identify both the deadly and the liberating, or life-giving, aspects of history. It is an aspect of Nietzsche's larger project of identifying the ways in which mankind, in the interest of its own health, could consciously recover its ability to grasp the world mythically. As he was to say in The Genealogy of Morals, "we have art in order not to die of the truth."3 But because "the critical-historical spirit of our culture has... made the previous existence of myth credible... only by means of scholarship," Nietzsche has to state in The Birth of Tragedy that:

> without myth every culture loses the healthy natural power of its creativity: only a horizon defined by myths completes and unifies a whole cultural movement. Myth alone saves all powers of the imagination and of the Apollonian dream from aimless wanderings. The images of myth have to be the unnoticed omnipresent demonic guardians, under whose care the young soul grows to maturity and whose signs help the adult interpret his life and struggles. Even the state knows no more powerful unwritten laws than [those of] the mythical foundation.4

"Any people," Nietzsche claims, "any individual is worthy only insofar as it is able to press the stamp of the eternal upon its experience; for only then is it... demundanized (entweltlicht) and able to show its unconscious inner convictions about the relativity of time and truth, i.e., about the metaphysical significance of life. The opposite of this happens when a people begins to comprehend itself historically and to demolish the mythical bulwarks that gird it around" (BT 23).

So, the historical self-understanding that a people can achieve for itself should not be any weaker in social effectiveness than that once provided by the myths. It is this desideratum that energizes Nietzsche's criticism of the histories of his time. As he implies in UAH, a practice of history which addresses the human condition at the level of art can serve life as effectively as valid myth.5

The truth that Nietzsche is articulating is that the ability to feel unhistorically, or mythically, and the ability to feel historically are equally necessary to the health and self-definition of an individual or culture. [Note the implication of this, that to think unhistorically is to think mythically.]6

There is such a thing as a "super-historical" standpoint. This is the "insider" view which dispenses with history because it sees all action as inherently blind and unjust. But Nietzsche rejects this standpoint: "we wish rather to be joyful in our unwisdom" of trying as active men, to balance the sense of history with the knowledge that, in serving life, history serves an unhistorical power. So, having acknowledged that an excess of history is damaging, Nietzsche turns in chapter II of UAH to showing the ways in which history can serve the living.

Monumental history is described as the kind of history which serves human action by providing models, inspiration and encouragement. It shows how in great fights or causes the individual goals of the man of action are fused with those of his nation or of humanity, and how, in giving himself to fame, the great man gives up selfishness and becomes an exemplar to the culture. This kind of history counteracts the anti-creative effect of the religion that condemns earthly life and that "has... condemned all creatures to live in the fifth act of a tragedy" (UAH p.8). Religion can produce only a paralyzing sort of eschatological history. Against it "the virtuous man will always rise," he will rise "against the blind force of facts, against the tyranny of the actual and submit himself to laws that are not the laws of historical changefulness (jener Geschichtsfluctuationen). He always swims against the waves of history, either by fighting his passions as the nearest brute facts of his existence or by dedicating himself to honesty amid the... nets which falsehood spins around him" (UAH p.8).

This is the kind of history that is practiced by Nietzsche when he deals with historical agents who were culture-heroes or would-be culture heroes. These are set up and analyzed as exempla, whether positive (like Socrates in some respects) or negative (like Luther in all respects).7 The great individuals who serve the human process in this way are also the disproof, for Nietzsche, that there is any such thing as an eschatological, Hegelian "world-process" to which man must submit.

Great individuals in fact "form a kind of bridge across the turbulent stream of becoming. These individuals don't carry forward any kind of process but live out of time, contemporaneously with one another;... they live as that republic of geniuses of which Schopenhauer speaks. One giant calls to the other across the waste space of time in noble dialogue.... The task of history is to be mediator between these, ever to beget the occasion for them and lend power to them. No, the goal of humanity cannot lie in its end, but only in its noblest specimens" (UAH p.9).

Thus, monumentalist history understands the past in terms of individuals superior to the passage of time, individuals who overcome the chaos of the historical process. But monumentalist history can be destructive, if it overstresses the gap between past greatness and the possibilities of greatness in the present.8 In any case, monumentalist history is necessarily omissive and inaccurate in its treatment of the inbetween periods which Hegel called "the empty pages of history" (PH).

What Nietzsche calls antiquarian history, he himself practices in his reconstructions and interpretations of ancient Greek and Renaissance thought and values. Remember that, for Nietzsche, Western cultural history is all decadence after the archaic and classical periods of Athens, and that he is searching for remedies to reverse the effects of this decadence. As part of this search antiquarian historiography thinks of the human past in terms of its continuities with the present. Were an antiquarian history to account for the present as only the result of the past, it would be destructive. Antiquarian history is creative because its respectful appreciativeness tends to make everything equal in historical value and import.

In its effort to be accurate it generates a respect for origins, as in Santayana's definition of piety as respect for the sources of our existence. Antiquarian history also becomes genealogical in Foucault's sense of not flinching at the petty details or the monstrous messes that bestrew our past. It fosters the healthy localism which neutralizes the dangerous impulse to adventurism or migration, the hankering for mere novelty or cosmopolitanism. "The feeling of the tree that clings to its roots, the happiness of knowing one's growth to be not merely arbitrary and fortuitous but the inheritance, the fruit of the blossom, of a past that does not merely justify but crowns the present––this is what we nowadays prefer to call the real historical sense" (UAH III).

But because "the things of the past are never viewed in their true perspective or receive their just value, but value and perspective change with the individual or nation that is looking back on its past," inevitable errors of historical judgment can harden into destructive misperceptions. When "the spring of piety" or creative respect dries up, antiquarian history turns deadly dry and undiscriminating in practice. And since "it only understands how to preserve," it tends (unlike monumental history), to "undervalue present growth," hindering "the mighty impulse to a new deed."

As soon as Nietzsche distinguishes the third kind of history as critical history, the reader sees that his own ongoing interpretations of Christianity and morality are apt examples of this sort of history. The critical historian both interrogates the past and tries to "apply it." For him, it is a rule that "every past is worth condemning" because of the ever-present abuse of power and the human weakness in those pasts. The judgment which life passes on them is necessarily unmerciful and unjust. On the principle that the same life that needs to forget oppression needs to destroy it, this judgment does not have to be based on specific knowledge. For as soon as the "injustice of something... becomes obvious, a monopoly, a caste, a dynasty... the thing deserves to fall." When the past is thus critically examined "all the 'pieties' are grimly trodden under foot."

The men and the times who annihilate the past in this way are dangerous. For, to condemn past errors in this way is, still, not to escape them, since "we are also the resultant of [these] errors, passions and crimes" (UAH III). The best we can make of this conflict between heritage, capacity, and new knowledge is to try to create new "second natures" or cultural forms for ourselves, in a disciplined way. But when we do this we inevitably also invent a less shameful past, "as it is difficult to find a limit to the denial of the past." Our good intentions, however, too often fail "because we also know the better but cannot do it." It is a paradoxical consolation, for those who practice critical history on behalf of life, that new "second natures" or cultural forms come to be taken eventually for nature itself.

The ability to forget and the willingness to confront life directly, without the mediation of second-hand knowledge, are two remedies which Nietzsche prescribes for the excesses of the historicist education rampant in his time. Now, by the "unhistorical" Nietzsche meant, precisely, "the power, the art, of forgetfulness and of drawing a limited horizon round oneself" (UAH X). We see that the ability to draw a horizon round oneself is not incompatible with any of the kinds of history in their healthy forms as previously described. Further thought in fact shows that the ability to forget is one of the genetic components of myth, if myths are what define the horizon which circumvallates a culture, as stated in The Birth of Tragedy.

Another remedy is the super-historical, "the power... which turns the eyes from the process of [sheer] becoming to that which gives existence a... stable character, to art and religion." Science is not super-historical in the required antidotal sense, because it hates forgetfulness and because it is too much immersed in process to set any limit to becoming. We have to think that it is because art and religion are both ingredients of myth, both forgetful and stabilizing, that they can be antidotes to the excesses of historicism.

"History itself," in the sense of healthy history, "also keeps alive for us the memory of the great 'fighters against history,' that is, against the blind power of the actual" (UAH VIII). When history becomes art "it preserves the instincts and arouses them" (UAH VII). But a history that was too unrestrainedly just in its adjudications would not do this, because it would destroy the aura which accrues to the things a people respects.

Thus, to do historical justice to a religion which has become prevalent, is to destroy the pious illusions that make it work. Since man is creative only through love, strict historical justice must be tempered by reconstructions that love life, that address the circumstantial, the everyday, the extraordinary at the perceptive level of art:

> Do not believe any history that does not spring from the mind of a rare spirit.... the fine historian must have the power of coining the known into a thing never heard before and proclaiming the universal so simply and profoundly that the simple is lost in the profound, and the profound in the simple. No one can be a great historian and artist, and a shallowpate at the same time (UAH VI).

Finally, we should not fail to honor the patient underworkers in history. It is because "the language of the past is always oracular," that history must be written by men of character who have lived through experiences that ennoble or enlighten (UAH VI). Time is also needed, both to digest the past and to incubate the written history. Hurried or journalistic history does not wear or serve, because "art flies away when you [rush to] roof your deeds with a historical awning" (UAH V). Nietzsche's related thought that "historians cease to be instructive as soon as they begin to generalize; their weakness is shown by their obscurity" (UAH VI), strikes a timely blow against the nomothetic-deductive view of history.

## History and the Self-Definition of Humanity

The heroic history of the exemplars, the loving history of what we have made our own, and the judgmental history of the usable past are all, for Nietzsche, to be told in terms of epochs and types as well as of great individuals; for, Nietzsche is an intellectual historian. He does not discuss only the great individuals who, together, span the dehumanizing flux of becoming.

We notice also that the mass of men are here said to be deserving of more respect than the preachers of the world-process give them (UAH VII).9 "Rise to the conception of the people, you learned men; you can never have one noble or high enough." Here at least Nietzsche seems to be thinking of the people as the "demos" rather than the "plebs." "If you thought much of the people you would have compassion... and shrink from offering your historical mixture of acids as a refreshing drink. You really think very little of them, for you dare not take reasonable pains for their future; you act like practical pessimists..." This should all the more be so because "the modern savants... leaving their little corner of [specialized] knowledge out of account, are part of the 'general public' themselves, and its needs are theirs." When they think they're condescending to the public, they are only descending to a more vulgar level of themselves. Not only are they pessimists, but as "men who feel the coming catastrophe and become... careless of their own and others' existence," they become ironists in the unhappy sense of too-knowing and too-detached.10

Given that the distinctive value of a historian's work is not the generalizations which it allows, and given that for Nietzsche value is what generates healthy feeling or perceptivity, it follows that the "real value" of history consists in its

> inventing ingenious variations on a probably commonplace theme, in raising the popular melody to a universal symbol showing what a world of depth, power and beauty exists in it (UAH VI).

The good historian, in other words, is something of an allegorist ("raising the popular... to a universal symbol"). He is also, as we would expect, implicitly Dionysan-Apollonian, or tragic ("a world of depth, power and beauty"). The insights which a historian offers must speak to what is urgent or problematical in the present; otherwise, they will not feel like insights about human action or culture.

When Nietzsche quotes Grillparzer with approval, "we Germans feel by theory, we are all spoiled by history," we see that his account of history is not only non-nomotheticist, it is properly anti-theoreticist. This is relevant because culture for Nietzsche, is not to be understood in terms of theory; and theories of culture do not create culture. ["The culture of a people," he says, "can be described with justice as 'the unity of artistic style in every outward expression of the people's life'... To be called a culture, a people must in a real sense be a living unity, not cleft asunder into form and substance." He is not opposing barbarism to stylishness here, but discussing "how the health of a people that has been destroyed by history may be restored, and how it may recover its instincts with its honor."] Nietzsche felt, with Grillparzer, that his German contemporaries were not giving authentic expression to their feelings but clothing them in abstractions, in conventions borrowed from France or gestures adapted from Shakespeare. He blamed the German educational system for this.11 And it left him feeling like an isolated man of knowledge whose tolerance has been exhausted, and who tragically sees that the sharpness of his insights is the direct result of his exclusion from cultural creativity and helpfulness.

Accordingly, chapter 5 of UAH is a rehearsal of what he must do to wean his culture from its harem of foreign attachments and uncover the real "inner need and misery of modern man." Lady Philosophy, the holy naked goddess, must be rescued from her thralldom to the superannuated and immature ("the old men and children at the university"). Creative coherence must rule, again in cultural matters. Encyclopedic bookishness and insecure role-playing only mask the goddess's poverty, nakedness and irrelevance.12 Nietzsche identifies the weakness responsible for this with "what the Romans called impotentia." He translates this term as "want of self-mastery." The identification helps us to understand his equation (insofar as it is one) between the "will-to-power" and "creativity."

Nietzsche's demand that thinking-feeling be mature in the sense of able to overcome the inherited climate of opinion is closely connected to the above equation. He thinks that this ability is a condition of real objectivity.13 At the same time UAH VI recognizes that the sense of justice––another generator of real objectivity and a stimulus to the search for truth––easily becomes too destructive. "The impulse to justice without the power of judgment," he says, "has been the cause of the greatest suffering to men." Too many, who are only fanatics, have claimed that they are "men of truth and justice."

He concludes that it is justice as already humanized by the dramatic impulse, that makes objectivity possible in historical work, as opposed to sheer justice. This is the illusion that remains in the best interpretation of "objectivity," because we require "artistic vision and absorption in his object from the historian" (UAH VI).

> To think of history objectively, in this sense, is the work of the dramatist: to think one thing with another and weave elements into a single whole, with the presumption that the unity of plan must be put into the objects if it is not already there. So man veils and subdues the past, and expresses his impulse to art––but not his impulse to truth or justice.

Significantly, the last clause shows Nietzsche requiring the historian to be aware of his artistry without losing his impulse to truth and justice. I conclude, then, that Nietzsche is desiderating the kind of objectivity that comes from the historian's material being informed with what I call a perspective of humanity, namely, the kind of perspective achieved by Greek tragedy.

Nietzsche rejects the forms imposed upon the human past by conceptions of "the world process." His reason is that there is no "opposition... between human action and the process of the world." He points out that the kinds of history that see the world as grown old and ripe for judgment, that think it is too late, or impossible, to do anything better are disguised theologies. They show that the excess of history derives from the medieval injunction "memento mori." On the contrary, says Nietzsche, we must think upon life, "memento vivere." And if Germans are not to be forever followers or "Alexandrians," culturally speaking, they must become more self-reflective. For, the opposition between historical culture and modern consciousness can, itself, be known only by a historical process. "History must solve the problem of history, science must turn its sting against itself." We note that the last clause assumes what we doubt today: that the self-reflection of science can go beyond scientism. Nietzsche must have thought that the self-reflection of science would be non-positivistic.

A few pages back Nietzsche had condemned the contemporary "historical virtuosi" for softening too much the horrors of the human past. "The original note sang of action, need, and terror; the overtone lulls us into a... dilettante sleep... as though the heroic symphony had been arranged for two flutes for the use of dreaming opium smokers." He then groups the narrow, self-convinced historians, who judge out of egocentricity, with the disguised partisan historians and the historians who think that to write in the spirit of the times is to be just, or that the universal opinions of the present constitute criteria of objectivity. In chapter VII of UAH, Nietzsche condemns the eschatological historians, both Hegelian and Christian, who have their own ways of glossing over the horrors of history, ways that turn us into captives of their own predictive schemes of salvation or rationalizations. Equally to be repudiated is the mechanistic materialism that is the matrix for the all-tolerating history fashionable among the successful mediocrities. But most repudiable, because ridiculous and nihilistic, is Hartmann's "wanton love of the world-process at the expense of life and existence, the confusion of all perspective." And, insofar as it suggests that there are laws in history, Hartmann's philosophy––like other philosophies that confuse mass effects with laws––is of no value to history. Next, Nietzsche punctures the pretension that gives to the masses or social chaos the credit for producing great men, by turning to the relation of great men to the society which by definition they fight against:

> least valuable of all is that kind of history which takes the great popular movements as the most important events of the past, and regards great men only as their clearest expression––the visible bubbles on the stream.

Just as he had warned inexperienced readers of history that the historical approach does not necessarily lead to relativism, Nietzsche now tells historians: do not take the part for the whole, do not believe that either providence or the flux are all-determinative. Relativism, eschatology, determinism are all bad forms of the historical consciousness. Like the total lack of historical memory characteristic of man's earliest time, they are anti-life and stumbling-blocks to civilization. The selectivity of creative forgetting must be matched by the self-determinism of creative remembering. Without creative remembering-and-forgetting the error-filled, horror-steeped past remains unredeemable and constructive history impossible.

It would be bad conscience to blame everything in the human past on external agencies or conditions, a protraction of history as the nightmare from which we cannot awake. Good conscience is just the power to take responsibility for what has happened as a prefiguration of my responsibility for the future and my ability to affect it. Thus, both teleology and doctrines of historical causality, namely, all determinisms untempered by self-determinationism, are forms of bad conscience. It is with this in mind that Nietzsche will tell historians and readers of history,

> the cause of the origin of a thing and its eventual utility, its actual employment and place in a system of purposes, lie worlds apart; whatever exists, having somehow come into being, is again and again reinterpreted to new ends, taken over, transformed, and redirected by some power superior to it. All events in the organic world are a subduing, a becoming master, and all subduing and becoming master involves a fresh interpretation, an adaptation through which any previous 'meaning' and 'purpose' are necessarily obscured or even obliterated (GM 11.12).

In this conception of history things, institutions and events are seen as being related to each other in the interest of the agents using or living them. The history of anything is the series of its successive appropriations or transformations by the human will-to-form. This will is the plastic power of the culture, and it serves or follows the will-to-power, the active interest in domination. Thus, what look like adaptive reactions are really the result of conflicts among "the spontaneous, aggressive, expansive, form-giving forces that set new interpretations and directions" (GM 11.12). The tragedies of history, of course, occur in the arena of these conflicts. "The scope of any 'progress' is measured by all that must be sacrificed for its sake."

Here, the difficulties in getting at the deepest meaning of Nietzsche's philosophy of history are helped by pursuing the implications of his Burckhardtian belief that the state was or can be a work of art. Politics in its history in the West has ever been an art-and-science in Aristotle's sense of a technê, an art of practice, a kind of knowledge.14 The same holds for histories of the state, with the difference that these are instances of productive knowledge (poiêtikê), more than they, are directly addressed to conduct. While Burckhardt's analogy between the form of the Renaissance state and works of art is illuminating, it cannot be taken literally. There is certainly art and science to nation-making or to the construction of a state. But, like myths, nations and states are also collective or social products, and the result of much non-deliberative activity. Some well-constituted and flourishing states can be looked upon as works of art, but only if the details are blanked out. These "details" include the tragic consequences (of which Nietzsche speaks repeatedly but in general) of the historical process in its conflictive wastefulness and chaos.

It is, therefore, simplistic to associate the will-to-power with the hoped-for triumph of the strong and noble over the weak and resentful. In criticizing Christianity and advocating its overthrow, Nietzsche has implicitly acknowledged that the weak and resentful, under the leadership of a priestly aristocracy, were triumphant for centuries. The noble, in history, are not always the strong, or the resentful the slaves or the weak. And Nietzsche could not be more aware of how mediocrity has prospered in the fields of scholarship and history. The prevalence of resentful moralities and mediocrity, with the human waste they entail, must be illustrations of what Nietzsche means by the destructiveness and aimless circumstantiality of the historical process.

So, we can advance as a hope that the will-to-form of those with nobler moralities or more creative abilities will triumph over the will-to-form of the resentful and mediocre. In those who do triumph socially or historically, the will-to-form should, retrospectively, be called the will-to-power; except that, when it is the product of weakness or resentment that prevails, Nietzsche never uses it as an example of the will-to-power.

He always associates the will-to-power, in his writing, with successful or epic aristocracy and with great works of art. But mediocre ruling-classes and defective art are still, respectively, aristocracies and instances of art. The will-to-power in Nietzsche may not be "blind," like the will in Schopenhauer; but it is "spontaneous and aggressive." It is "expansionist and form-giving;" and history, as commented on by Nietzsche himself, is the proof that the will-to-live does not most often result in the best forms. Mankind, however, will never cease to desiderate the best. And the history of human productivity as a search for and occasional achieving of the best can, therefore, always be read as a history of mankind's creative attempts at self-definition. Confronted with a chaos of "very diverse value judgments" none of which provides a tenable necessary basis for, or condition of, existence, modern man must call upon a voluntarism rarely found in convention-ridden majorities. If however "we... want to become those who we are––human beings who are new, unique, incomparable, who give themselves laws, who create themselves," then it is our duty to develop a reliable subjectivity or individuality (GS 335)––fragile as such individuality must be in the absence of general social support. For, "the 'subject'," as Aristotle knew and Dewey was to reassert (HNC), "is not something given, it is something added and invented" (GM I. 12, 13).

Unlike the beasts of the field, a human "goes into his present" with leftovers from the past which influence his behavior and affect his spirit. The pastless existence of the beasts looks like paradise to man because it is forgetfully free of this burden of determinants or consciousness-penetrating residues. Forgetfulness, says Nietzsche, is equated with blessedness because realizing the fullness of the present moment is, for humans, a condition of happiness. And too much memory dissolves the forward texture of coming-to-be into a continual perishing that paralyzes. "One who wished to feel everything historically would be like a man forcing himself to refrain from sleep." And, "there is a degree of sleeplessness, of rumination, of 'historical sense,' that injures and finally destroys the living thing, be it a man or a people or a system of culture" (UAH p.7).

6

Nietzsche has to trust the "plastic power" of the culture or the individual "to grow out of itself," to grow healthily. Strong individuals will not be hurt by too much history, just as, when they act, they act as if there were no past, only the future they are concerned to shape.

We could say that this kind of history, like great literature, is an implicit contribution to mankind's ongoing definition and redefinition of itself.

And it left him 11 The system was a failure, for Nietzsche, because it had resulted in a spiritually divided nation. His end-in-view was not political but that authentic unity of feeling the result of which is, precisely, cultural productivity (UAH IV). "How should a great productive spirit exist among a nation... divided into educated men whose inner life has been turned from the true path of education, and uneducated men whose inner life cannot be approached at all?" Nietzsche has addressed himself to healing this divide. He is also autobiographical: "it tortures a man to have to speak only to one section and no longer be in sympathy with his people." Since he cannot accept the vulgar patronage of a misguided class that thinks itself superior, and "the instinct of the people can no longer meet him halfway," he can only turn his inspired disgust (begeisterten Haβ) "against the educational barriers raised by the so-called culture, and condemn [them]."

The eunuch-abstraction "woman in herself, the ever-unapproachable" has robbed the feminine, and the particular, of their inspiring effectiveness. It is the same, says Nietzsche in an after-thought, with "the eternal masculine," which is now hardly distinguishable from the feminine given that both are masked or neutered by the cult of "objectivity." Because it drains subjectivity of its significance and impetus, this kind of objectivity in history is possible only to those who are not men of action. The cultural form called "criticism" is the expression of the demand for this kind of objectivity. So it is grimly ironic that "the measureless overflow of criticism" is unable either to have "an influence on life and action," or to recognize non-reductively "something good and true... in action, poetry or music" when it does occur.

Nietzsche on the Greek Decline

## Socrates as a Symptom of the Greek Decline

In "The Struggle between Science and Wisdom" Nietzsche voiced the following impression about ancient Greek culture: "The Greeks progressed quickly, but they likewise declined with frightening quickness. When the Hellenic genius had exhausted its highest types, Greece declined with the utmost rapidity. An interruption had only to occur once, and the great style of life ceased to be supplied: it was finished in an instant, just like tragedy. One single powerful crank like Socrates, and the break was irreparable. The self-destruction of the Greeks is accomplished in Socrates."1 While it is true that classical Greece declined with the greatest rapidity, we now know that its rise out of the dark age was not as sudden as Nietzsche implies. The advance of scholarship since Nietzsche's time has also caused us to conceptualize quite differently the nature of the decline in question.

Since the evidence about the oral-aural, or pre-literate, nature of the Greek "literary" achievement had not yet been marshalled in a correctly interpretable way, the young Nietzsche would have had to anticipate the scholarship that goes from Milman Parry to Eric Havelock in order to understand more fully the nature and causes of the break he has invoked.2

The intellectual break in question corresponded, among other things, to a changeover of the culture from oral-aural modes of communication and composition to visual-graphic modes. Taking as it did from the early seventh to the late fifth century, this changeover was far from being as sudden as the term "break" or "interruption" implies. But we can use the official adoption by Athens of the Ionian alphabet as a rough marker of the near completion of the changeover. This occurred in 401 B.C., two years after the end of the great war which had spelled the death of a sense of panhellenic unity vital enough to preserve the autonomy of the Greeks in the face of external enemies. The sense of panhellenic unity had saved the Greeks from the Persians at the beginning of the fifth century. In its absence, the Greeks became victims of Macedonian expansionism in the middle of the fourth century. The Archaic age came to an end with the triumph over Persia; the Classical age came to an end with the Macedonian conquest.

The last phase of the decline Nietzsche is deploring was indeed made terminal by the Macedonian conquest of Greece at the battle of Chaeronea in 338 B.C., nine years after the traditional date of Plato's death. After this date, which can be taken to inaugurate the Hellenistic (as opposed to the Hellenic) age, only Aristotle's work and the oratory of Demosthenes maintain the standard of the previous classical achievement. The decline is manifest in the "posthumous" Academic production called the Laws, which is mistakenly ascribed to Plato but which could not have been by him, given the bad Greek of the text, the regressive failures in its composition, and the distinct and poorer quality of its reflectiveness.3 As I say in Plato's Dialogues One by One (p. 152):

> The gap between Plato's brilliant dialogical achievement... and the regressive failures of the monologous Laws is an expression of the historical discontinuity between the oral-aural culture of the Classical polis and the visual-graphic... alienated culture of a subjugated Hellenistic society. What makes Plato so vulnerable to misunderstanding, is that his working lifetime fell exactly between this and another great cultural divide. Not only does Plato live on the far side of the divide between oral-aural and visual-graphic modes of thinking prevalent before the official adoption of the Ionian alphabet at the unhappy end of the fifth century, but he is also separated from us by the abrupt changes caused in the middle of the fourth by... expansionist Macedonian militarism. There is something of these four worlds––the polis, the oral-aural, the visual-graphic, dorianism––in Plato's dialogues. What has been... confusing to philosophers is the presence, within the... dialogical format of the works, of the bits of doctrinal 'raw' material out of which the Hellenistic age was to construct its differently motivated world-view in combination with non-Greek influences. The difficulty is compounded by the fact that the foundations of the Western tradition lie just as much in the Hellenistic society, and in the Greek classics as mediated by Alexandria and Rome, as in the perceptive non-alienated humanism of the Tragic age of Greece of which Plato was the inheritor. Thus, when we see that Laws is not by Plato, we can also see what its real importance is: it must be taken, and should be studied, as a major founding document of the 'ecumenical,' Syrianized, Romanized and anguished Hellenistic age.

The confusion between Plato and Platonism arises––as I have shown in Plato's Dialogues One by One––from the non-dialogical reading of the dialogues, and the ascription to Plato as the source of the system of doctrine developed by his successors in the Academy in the pythagorized intellectual environment of the second half of the fourth century and the Hellenistic age. As far as Nietzsche is concerned, we shall find (i) that he did not sufficiently distinguish between the Hellenistic and classical ages of Athens and Greece, and (ii) that he did not question the traditional attribution to Plato of the dogmatic system of platonism. That Nietzsche found in "Socrates" so much that was inspiring, in spite of the many deplorable attributes which "the tradition" assigns him, is a tribute to his perceptivity. Genius, however, does not necessarily transcend the climate of opinion of its time in all respects. Though Nietzsche was critical of the philologists whose profession he was to abandon, it is only in the intensity and eloquence of his interpretations that he goes beyond the state of the question in regard to the Presocratics, Socrates and Plato.

In distinction from the historical problem, the substantive point here is that only by a dialogical reading of the dialogues can Plato be clearly and validly distinguished from platonism, and only on a dialogical reading can Plato's dramatic character Socrates be distinguished from the composite figure of the inconsistent tradition. Wherever "Socrates" occurs in Nietzsche's work it falls to us, then, to ask to which Socrates does Nietzsche have reference: to the historical Socrates, to Xenophon's or Laertius's Socrates, to Plato's Socrates, to some idiosyncratic or generalized composite of these, or to the equally fictional Socrates of the Socratic eulogizers and detractors of the fourth century?

Implicit in the quotation from Nietzsche's notebooks with which we began this chapter, we notice the nineteenth century aesthetic doctrine that ascribed culturally causal powers to "genius" in just the way Nietzsche does to "the Hellenic genius." Socrates is featured as a crank and genius who contributed to making the cultural break irreparable. He is also featured as a symptom of the decline. Acquaintance with the sociohistory of archaic and classical Greek civilization, together with a different view of causation in cultural matters, allows us to see that no single individual––and therefore no possible "Socrates"––could have been a cause or precipitator of the kind of decline involved in the transition from preliteracy (or recitation literacy) to full literacy, and from the free Athenian polity to the Macedonian regency. So, we are forced to ask, in what sense then was "Socrates" a symptom of the decline, and had that break, in fact, already started to occur during his lifetime?

Let us grant Walbank's stark thesis that the most fundamental cause of the decline was "the [demographic] failure of the middle class inside the Greek cities to maintain and extend democracy."4 In this case, the "Socrates" who has the characteristics which Xenophon attributes to him is readily visible as a symptom of the decline. For, this Socrates is exclusionary, a Spartanizer, regressive and chauvinistic. But to the extent that any individual in a declining culture will, by definition, show some symptoms of his culture's decline because he is a product of it, to that extent the historical Socrates may be presumed (truistically) to have been representative of his culture in the respects that he did not transcend it.

Consideration, however, of the Socrates who is Plato's dialogical creation, and reflection upon the semi-literate (i.e. recitation-literate) nature of Athenian culture in Plato's time, will lead us to conclude that this Socrates is an expression or product of (i) Plato's literary-philosophic method, intellectual posture and brilliance. He is also, in historical context, a symptom of (ii) not a decline, but of the start of a new mode of thinking and talking among Athenians. For, as an ironic seeker after definitions, Plato's Socrates is the first outstanding "conceptualist" or anti-imagist in Greek culture.

Though he himself communicated orally––never in writing––this Socrates' frequently propositional, ostensibly non-rhetorical, mode of advancing query made explicit the presuppositions of the prose modality most suited to graphic ways of communicating. These are the literality, univocity and definability of the terms of the prose discourse. Notice that even when Plato's Socrates is storifying, quoting poets or trying out similes, he does this (we feel) within an assertional matrix of exploration, of drawing out consequences or of refutation. Somehow the frequent failure to achieve definitions, as in the Euthyphro or Hippias Major, does not nullify for the conventional reader the will-to-definition made manifest in Plato's Socrates––even though, as integral productions of Plato himself, they satirize or test the demand for definitions implicit in the theory of ideas. This means, among other things, that we the readers are in the grip of the tendency to essentialism in Western languages. By assertional is meant "assertive," in contrast to "exhibitive" or poetic, as in Buchler's terminology.5 In his pursuit of definitional consistency, Plato's Socrates associates action, or active judgment, more intimately with assertion, or assertive judgment, than with the exhibitive judgments constituted by the tribal exemplars who had their being in the poetic heritage of the Athenians.

If the historical Socrates received the normal oral or musical education (mousikê) of his time, learning his poets but not how to write with any ease, he would have grown up with correspondingly narrative and concrete ways of talking. Contact, as he matured, with foreign Sophists from areas more advanced in literacy could have made him aware of the new kind of discourse that was emerging as the accompaniment of full literacy. If he was the instinctive questioner that Plato projects in the dialogues, he would soon have come to query the possibilities and limitations of the emerging way of speaking abstractly. Note, among other things, that this way of speaking allows both discourse and the speaking self to become themselves objects of discourse and reflection. As Havelock says, "did not the recognition of language as a separate object call for the recognition of the human consciousness as a separate subject?"6

Within the new mind-set and kind of speech that this led to, the existential copula "is" gets featured as never before, and it becomes essential in the theoretical and self-reflective discussions that are now possible. Not only are questions about language (grammar) and questions about knowing (philosophy) possible, but an interrogative and inductive Socrates can ask "what are you saying," "is that an example of piety," "what is piety?" He can, as we now say, ask "what is x?"7 So, if the historical Socrates overlaps this much with Plato's Socrates, we can say that he was a symptom, but no more a cause than anybody else, of the new rationalism to which Nietzsche is referring in The Birth of Tragedy.8 We can also say that, as an insistent and exemplary questioner, he may well have been a cause of the rapidity with which the new rationality became theoreticist. In any case, the Socrates of Plato's dialogues is certainly a questioner and an exemplar, among the other things he is: so, if not the historical Socrates then Plato's Socrates, was a precipitator of the new "intellectualism." But I will be reminding the reader, in serious qualification of this, that Plato's Socrates is also a poet-quoter, punster, story-teller, myth-maker, ironist and allegorist.

Readers of The Birth of Tragedy are struck by the consonance and depth of Nietzsche's feeling for Greek culture. But we see already that, though this feeling was supported by his philological research, Nietzsche does not bridge for his reader the gap between his rich impression of that culture and his detailed philological or historical grounds for it. I take this gap as an invitation to make some of those grounds explicit, while seeking to articulate and clarify Nietzsche's assimilation and use of the classical Greek achievement. To do this properly we shall also have to identify as many as we can of the guiding, or framework, assumptions within which Nietzsche worked.

"Socrates is so close to me that I am almost continually fighting with him," says Nietzsche in the notes on "The Struggle between Science and Wisdom" which we quoted earlier. In Nietzsche's published work it is Socrates the culture-hero, the questioner who stands for enlightenment and creative honesty, that Nietzsche identifies with. But it is the Socrates whom he takes to be the first logicalist, and a kind of Christian, that he is fighting with.9 When Nietzsche complains, in The Twilight of the Idols (sec.2), that "Plato is boring" the reference has to be (as we shall see) to Plato without his wit and ironies, namely, to the doctrinal "Plato" of the conventional platonists. Nietzsche continues, "he represents such an aberration from all the basic instincts of the Hellene, is so moralistic, so pre-existently Christian––he already takes the concept 'good' for the highest concept––that for the whole phenomenon Plato I would sooner use the harsh phrase 'higher swindle,' or if it sounds better, 'idealism,' than any other." By "the whole phenomenon Plato" I will show that Nietzsche means Academic, pythagorizing platonism or neoplatonism.

With regard to the "Plato" of the platonists, the problem is that this Plato is not an artist but an other–worldly dogmatist with a will-to-system in the assertive, theoreticist sense. As handed down by the doxographical, pervasively pythagorized, tradition, this Plato is rightly the object of Nietzsche's scorn. We shall uncover, below, what some of the factors were in Nietzsche's education and context that inhibited him from the perception that this Plato is an unmonitored construct of the later tradition, and could not have been the author of the brilliant intellectual dramatizations that are the dialogues––when these are taken as dialogues. The irony that we have to face, here, is that Nietzsche, who himself combines philosophy with poetry throughout his finished work, never won through to this perception of the dialogical Plato who, like himself, was both a literary master and a cultural critic of his times. Nietzsche's life-long practice of rejecting "the conventional distinction between creative and critical natures," and the assumption it makes that artists and thinkers are opposites, gets an explicit formulation in the following note of 1869: "Die angebliche Scheidung in schopferische und kritische Naturen ist eine Tauschung, aber eine sehr palpable und unter Geistern der mittleren Zone recht beliebte."10

For the moment, let us note that Nietzsche's difficulties with Plato are both cultural and textual. They were cultural insofar as he failed, in the respect mentioned, to transcend the traditionally received opinions about Plato of his time and colleagues. A result of these difficulties is that the ironic Socrates who was the literary and dramatic creation of a kindred spirit––could he but have recognized him––remains, tragically, inaccessible to Nietzsche the poet-philosopher. In spite of the failure to distinguish between the several different Socrates that people have unmonitoredly synthesized from the surviving evidence, Nietzsche nonetheless admires a great deal about Socrates. So it will be of the greatest interest to discover in which Socrates exactly will the admirable traits be found? Those who have read D. Laertius, or who learned Greek by reading Xenophon, will anticipate that it is not in their respectively garbled or tendentious texts that they will be found.

But since Nietzsche's conception of Socrates is a function both of where he locates him in the history of Greek culture and of his conception of Greek thought, we will begin for historiographic reasons by articulating Nietzsche's view of the Presocratics as it is to be found in his Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks.11 As I will be critiquing Nietzsche's view of the earlier Presocratics, as well as of "Socrates," it is exhilarating to find that he himself gives utterance to one of the premises upon which my critique is based: "So much depends upon the development of Greek culture, since our entire occidental world received its original impulse therefrom. Destiny has ordained that the more recent and decadent Hellenism [i.e. of the Hellenistic age] has had the greatest historical power. For this reason the older Hellenism [of the archaic and classical ages] was always falsely judged."12

# Chapter III  
Nietzsche on the Early Presocratics

## Philosophy in the "Tragic Age"

"Early Greek philosophy is the philosophy of statesmen," says Nietzsche in 1875; "this is what best distinguishes the Presocratics from the Postsocratics."1 By "statesmen" we can take Nietzsche to mean "statesmen of ideas." But we remember that Thales is reputed, by the secondary sources, to have authored a political constitution as well as a star-guide, and are confirmed in our recommendation that Solon, Thales' older contemporary, is the thinker who should be placed at the head of the series called the Presocratics.2 The term also has reference to the fact that a man-of-knowledge (sophos) in the sixth century B. C. was a man of practical involvements, as likely to have been an inventor, or master navigator, as a legislator or founder of a colony.

There are, however, two statesmen of ideas, who, if called Postsocratics, must be exempted from Nietzsche's statement. The first is Plato, the brilliant composer of the dramatized intellectual encounters that constitute the dialogues which, themselves, constitute an exhibitive critique of the thought and culture of early fourth century Athens. The other is Aristotle, insofar as he reflects the last phase of classical Greek thought and can be separated from both the Hellenistically interpolated Aristotle and the Aristotle of the medieval and Renaissance interpreters. Needless to say, we will find that the latter is the Aristotle of whom Nietzsche is so severely critical.

Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks deals at any length only with Thales, Anaximander, Herakleitos, Parmenides and Anaxagoras. That the last three were philosophers, in something like our sense, we have enough of their work not to doubt. But we do not have any of the work of Thales or enough of Anaximander's to be sure that they were philosophers rather than men-of-knowledge of the oral-aural epoch, echoes of whose work have been preserved because these few words were relevant to the later interest in cosmology. This is especially true if philosophic thinking is taken to include a certain amount of self-reflection. We mention this because, as Burkert has made clear, the terms "philosophy" and "philosopher" first occur in the dialogues of Plato, not in the thinkers whom we call Presocratics.3 The one sentence of Anaximander's that we do have is likely to have been only a cosmological aside in, or a preface to, his navigator's geography or periplous. And this, in the mid-sixth century, would have consisted of orally transmitted hexameters which Anaximander (or an other) at some point committed to writing. Since whatever it was that Anaximander composed has not survived, the time of its transcription (if it was transcribed) can be inferred to have been too early for the written version to have made a difference to its preservation.4

Nietzsche nonetheless says some interesting things about the fragment of Anaximander. He can do this because his interpretive genius has already made much of Thales on the basis (i) of the "indirect tradition," or third-party reports of later antiquity, and on the basis (ii) of the conventional assumption that Thales and Anaximander were cosmologists trying to identify the originating or common principle of all existence. More will be said about these starting-points as we proceed. Another starting-point, for us, is that Nietzsche expects to be able to treat the early thinkers as a "homogenous company"5 of inspiring "self-liberators."6

This premise has to be taken together with the claims that earlier Greek philosophy is "inspired by art,"... "is not the negation of the other life;" and "lacks the detestable pretension to happiness." These early philosophers, Nietzsche says, "picture life in a richer and more complex way."7 We note the exclusion of Solon, who was concerned with happiness as it relates to justness––even though he does in his poems picture life in a rich and complex way. The exclusion is also counter to the recurrent ingredient in widely different definitions of philosophy which require it to be concerned with the human good. Since Nietzsche was not other-worldly we will have to monitor the sense in which his notion of the human good did not include happiness.

"Science," Nietzsche reminds us, "rushes headlong, without selectivity... at whatever is knowable, in the blind desire to know all at any cost. Philosophic thinking, on the other hand, is ever on the scent of those things most worth knowing, the great and important insights.... And so philosophy starts by legislating greatness. Part of this is a sort of name-giving.... By its concept of greatness philosophy tames this drive [the blind search for knowledge] and most of all it considers the greatest knowledge of all, the knowledge of the essence and core of all things, as ascertainable (erreichbar) and, in fact, ascertained."8

We note the danger of anachronism in Nietzsche's unmonitored use of the latinate term "science" in connection with the Presocratics. But it is a useful reminder of the absence of self-reflection in the special knowledges ("sciences"), a reminder which we will find resonating both with Parmenides' bringing out of the limitations of nature-philosophy or cosmology, and with Socrates' exposure of the ignorance of experts in Plato's dialogues. Because Nietzsche is the father of literary existentialism we must not fail to note the tendency to essentialism lurking in the claim of the last sentence quoted, that the search, in philosophy, is for aknowledge of the principle of things (Wesen und Kern der Dinge).

It is just this identification of philosophy with nature-philosophy, combined with the anachronistic assumption that all the Presocratics are nature-philosophers, which has confused our appreciation of Presocratic thought. While Nietzsche did not make the first identification, he certainly falls into the latter assumption in Philosophy in the Tragic Age. Because the early thinkers seemed, to cosmogonically interested parties, to have a physics, they were called physikoi, nature- philosophers or cosmologists. Because their thoughts about nature were speculative, they were taken as "philosophy." Even Solon who was identified as a sophos, not as a physikos, is said by Plutarch to have had "an antiquated physics." This makes it apposite to ask, why then did the nineteenth-century editors not take Solon's reflective political and personal poetry as a beginning for Greek "philosophy?" Besides the bias toward identifying philosophy with nature-philosophy, one can also adduce the old theoreticist prejudices against poetry's being philosophy and against non-theoretical politics as sufficiently reflective to be a learned discipline.

Xenophanes and Herakleitos, who are philosophic in their scope and in the generality of some of their formulations, were not cosmologists; yet their fragments are interpreted as if they were. Parmenides, in his poetic way, is self-reflective about nature-philosophy in the half of his poem which is based upon a metaphysical analysis of the concept of "the All." And the Goddess in the second part of the poem rapidly deploys, for her young auditor and in a monitory spirit, a specimen cosmography to illustrate the weaknesses in all cosmographies. This does not make Parmenides a cosmologist; rather, it makes him an anti-cosmologist. Yet both the Goddess's sample cosmography and her metaphysical analysis of "the All" are interpreted as making up Parmenides' cosmology. It's as if we called Wordsworth a nature-philosopher because of his meditative appropriation of nature in "The Prelude." This work is not nature-philosophy in the sense of cosmology. It is self-reflective in specifiable respects; so it can be said to be philosophical. But it is not philosophic in the sense that philosophy of science is self-reflective about its many subject-matters.

## Nietzsche on Anaximander

Towards the end of chapter 3 of Philosophy in the Tragic Age, in deploring the gap between the life that drama wants to express and its verbal expression, Nietzsche exclaims that what the dramatist has seen and lived "could [be] utter[ed] directly only through music or gesture." He then adds that the case is the same "for every profound philosophic intuition" because it has to be "expressed through dialectic and through scientific reflection." Sadly, he adds, the latter are "the only means for the philosopher to communicate what he has seen." Nietzsche himself, however, found other and apter means to communicate to us what he has seen. But we have to note that Nietzsche's complaint suppresses the poetic way in which Solon, Xenophanes, Herakleitos and Parmenides express their reflections. It also overlooks the non-scientific, dialogical or dramatic, way in which Plato shares with us his penetrating perception of the communicative interactions of his day.

Nietzsche does accept Anaximander's fragment as a deep insight. He sees in it the original of Schopenhauer's anthropomorphic metaphor about the transience and poor quality of human existence in Parerga (11, 12). Here is his translation of the fragment:

> Where the source of things is, to that place they must also pass away, according to necessity, for they must pay penance and be judged for their injustices, in accordance with the ordinance of time (Cowan's English).9

Though Nietzsche doesn't translate the sentence which heads the original fragment as quoted by Simplicius (following Theophrastos), he does accept "the indefinite" (to apeiron) as the origin and first principle of things. The collection extant in Nietzsche's day was Ritter and Preller's Historia Philosophiae Graecae, first published in 1838. It quotes the fragment, as do Diels and Kranz in our time, 10 with the introductory claim about the apeiron as the material principle (archên te kai stoicheion) of what there is (tôn ontôn). DK omit the appositional words "te kai stoicheion;" but they translate archên as "Anfang und Ursprung," "beginning and origin," which equates with "cause."

Whether Anaximander's work was or not only a navigator's geography or star-guide, the fragment itself certainly sounds cosmogonical. And so Nietzsche takes it, without questioning the traditional categorization of this Ionian as a cosmogonist. But his own Schopenhauerian interpretation of the fragment is brilliant and interesting in its own right.

Nietzsche finds Anaximander's claim (if it was one) to be eloquently metaphysical, as well as physical:

> when he saw in the multiplicity of things that have come-to-be a sum of injustices that must be expiated, he grasped with bold fingers the tangle of the profoundest problem in ethics. He was the first Greek to do so. How can anything pass away which has a right to be?

The last interrogative is underscored because in its anguish over mortality, it confesses, as nothing else does in the passionate four pages on Anaximander, to the humanistic strain in Nietzsche's existentialism. Inspired as these pages are by an assumed stance of Schopenhauerian pessimism, Nietzsche's existentialist answer to the question would, otherwise, be absurdist and close to nihilism. "It may not be logical, but it certainly is human, to view... with Anaximander, all coming-to-be as though it were an illegitimate emancipation from eternal being, a wrong for which destruction is the only penance."

As an antiplatonist and antichristian, what Nietzsche wants us to achieve is a legitimate emancipation from the otherworldliness of the eternal; for, to Nietzsche, otherworldliness is a nihilistic deception. But he sees that, if the eternal is assumed to be what is real, then it inexorably follows that temporal existence or coming-to-be is unjustifiable. And Nietzsche can, for the nonce, grant this assumption because his job here is to make sense of Anaximander's "the indefinite" and how he came to it.

"Everything that has ever come-to-be again passes away, whether we think of human life or of water or of hot and cold. Wherever definite qualities are perceivable, we can prophesy, on the basis of enormously extensive experience, the passing of these qualities. Never, in other words, can a being which possesses definite qualities... be the origin or first principle of things. That which truly is, concludes Anaximander, cannot possess definite characteristics.... In order that coming-to-be shall not cease, primal being must be indefinite. The... everlastingness of primal being does not lie in its infinitude or inexhaustibility,... but in the fact that it is devoid of definite qualities that would lead to its passing. Hence its name, "the indefinite." We have to grant that, so far, Nietzsche's dialectical explanation of the apeiron is ingenious and successful.

But, as Nietzsche effervescently articulates more implications of Anaximander's principle, the reader is carried so far from Nietzsche's own (non-dialectical) starting-points that he must strain to keep track of what his author wants him to assent to. He must remember, for instance, that a question such as "Who is there that could redeem you from the curse of coming-to-be" is pointed forward against the idea of Christian salvation, not towards its approval. So too, when Nietzsche puts it that Anaximander has explained "how is the many possible if there is such a thing as the eternal [undifferentiated oneness of the indefinite]," by turning the "self-contradictory, selfconsuming" many into a moral phenomenon, the reader must not take it that Nietzsche has granted that existence is a process of expiation for a "fall" from the indefinite.

Similarly, the last lines of chapter 4 rehearse Anaximander's answer to the question "Why hasn't all that came-to-be passed away long since, since a whole eternity of time has passed?" They do not represent a falling, by Nietzsche, into the Pythagorean paradox of deriving the temporal from the non-temporal. To answer this question, Nietzsche is saying, Anaximander had to invoke "a mystic possibility," namely, that "eternal coming-to-be can have its origin only in eternal being; the conditions for the fall from being to coming-to-be in injustice are forever the same;... such that no end can be envisaged for the emergence of individual creatures from the womb of the 'indefinite' (unbestimmten)."

Accordingly, Nietzsche leaves Anaximander behind "in the deep shadows which lie like gigantic ghosts upon the mountains of this world-view." "The closer men wanted to get to the problem of how the definite could ever fall from the indefinite, the temporal from the eternal, the unjust from the just, the deeper grew the night." This is the night, the intellectual historian must say, invented by Pythagoreans, perpetuated by platonists, which Christianity laid claim to dissipate in practice while clinging to it, like modern idealism, in discourse. Nietzsche's interpretation implies that the obscurity, the obscurantism, began to set in with Anaximander. It is just as likely that the obscurity had something to do with his contemporary, the charismatic Pythagoras.

Finally and in accordance with Nietzsche's characterization of the Presocratics as self-liberators, if the reader asks "from what has Anaximander liberated himself," the only answer which Nietzsche's interpretation allows is, "from the error of an attachment to a principle with definite qualities." Since this leads to an "explanation" of more or less determinate existences by referring them to a totally indeterminate existence, it is not much of a liberation––if Anaximander actually was a cosmological inquirer into nature. This means that his famous lemma just might have been the device needed by a practical man-of-knowledge (sophos) to free himself from having to address questions that could only be given speculative answers. A positive outcome of this is that the hypothesis advanced by Heidel early in this century, 11 that Anaximander was a sixth-century master-navigator or map-maker, is strengthened. This, in turn, gives independent support to the view now gaining ground that the so-called Ionian scientific school might be only a notional product of Theophrastos' discursive ingenuity.12 And it reminds us, in any case, that the researches which the tradition has ascribed to Anaximander would have been technological, not nomological as in the formalist-positivist understanding of "science" and Presocratic "nature-philosophy."

## Nietzsche on Herakleitos

Nietzsche's next chapter hurls Herakleitos like a thunderbolt at Anaximander's mystification of the problem of becoming (Werden). Attentive to "the everlasting wavebeat and rhythm of things," Herakleitos is said to see "Not the punishment of what has come-to-be, but the justification of that which comes-to-be." Perceiving the prevalence of Dikê (Zeus's daughter Justice) in the world, he asks, how could this world be "the execution-arena of all the condemned?" He represents a twofold negation of the cosmogonic interpretation of Anaximander: Herakleitos denies the duality of the two worlds Anaximander is said to have instated. And, he completely rejects changeless being, proclaiming "all is becoming." It is your short sight that is damnable, not the nature of things, snorts Nietzsche's Herakleitos, in what we moderns would call a philosophical move.

Nietzsche's understanding of Herakleitos, however, is based on a distinction between "intuition"(Intuition, intuitive Vorstellung) and "reason" (Vernunft) that this champion of the logos would not have held. For, reason in the Archaic age had not yet come to mean only abstract or calculative reasoning (logismos as opposed to analogismos or dianoia). Not seeing that Herakleitos' perceptivity still held together what we have separated, Nietzsche has to circumvent the distinction by grounding Herakleitos' insightfulness in an analysis of his rich sense of time as epochal and active (wirkend, wirklich).

Nietzsche says that Herakleitos is like Schopenhauer in this. Actually, he is more like the classical Aristotle for whom time was also epochal (duplex), dynamic and real.13 For Aristotle time is a function of change not consciousness, and change is its substrate. This is the Aristotle in whom aesthêsis and noêsis, as intellectual activities (dianoia) are still interchangeable. We note that, in Nietzsche's quick summary of Schopenhauer's view, time, though epochal, falls short of the pre-Hellenistic view of time as constitutive of what happens. This is because it confuses the dimensionless (ausdehnungslos) and durationless (bestandlos) instant, the mathematical fiction, with the present, and because it seems to spatialize time (wie die Zeit, so der Raum). But in the classical Aristotle, the now (to nun) is irreducibly both an ending and a beginning.

In any case, and on the positive side, Nietzsche ascribes to this view of time the Herakleitean perception that "the whole nature (Wesen) of reality lies simply in its acts (Wirken)." In Schopenhauer's words, "Cause and effect... are the whole essence of matter: its being is its activity" (Ursache und Wirkung ist... das ganze Wesen der Materie: ihr Sein ist ihr Wirken). The words in the second coordinate clause not only represent an Archaic and classical view, they are Aristotle's when he is correctly translated: "energeia ousia estin" means "being is activity," not "substance is actuality" as the Latin has it, in the Metaphysics (VII-IX).14 We have to remember that physis (nature) for the early Greek thinkers was a dense teeming of patterned processes, not empty space in which there happen to be things-with-attributes, the natura of Roman and latinate cultures. I say this because, in the first sentence of the passage Nietzsche quotes from Schopenhauer, the latter says that "only as it acts" does reality "fill space and time." We recognize the receptacle metaphor. But space and time, if we are discussing Herakleitos, are not yet the fixed coordinates of being that they became after Newton. Does not Herakleitos begin by denying changeless being?

Nietzsche, the critic who first and most clearly saw that the whole of life, for the Greeks, was like a contest–– was agonistic––has come as close as he could to seeing that being, for them, was activity. It seems entirely fitting that the classical Greeks should have so linked their most cherished value, activity, with their widest category, being.

Now though Nietzsche somewhere knows that Herakleitos is a poet, what he gives us is an interpretive reconstruction of the cosmogony this poet might have produced, had he wanted to, on the basis of the perceptions expressed in his rhythmic aphorisms. So it is no wonder that "Herakleitos's cosmology" turns out to be a sort of imagistic physics. In consonance with this, Nietzsche finds that the contest-idea (Wettkampfgedanke) is the foundation of the cosmogony. That struggle is the father of all things was also a Schopenhauerian thought. But Nietzsche is aware that the latter's idealist version of the anthropomorphic image sought to be "a proof of the internal self-dissociation of the Will-to-Live" pessimistically understood. This is very different from Herakleitos' assertion of it as the dramatic generalization of a will-to-live whose highest expression is the achievement of human self-knowledge. For, though the cosmos of Nietzsche's Herakleitos is a game played by Zeus, there is law in the "game of becoming" just as there is play in the prevalence of necessity. And if, because of this, knowledge is achievable by those who struggle to discern the pattern, then pessimism is not warranted. What we know of Herakleitos' own life suggests that, starting from a position of social advantage, he himself found the pursuit of understanding worth the struggle and worth the renouncing of his position as an Ephesian notable.

In the end, we have to acknowledge that Nietzsche's interpretation in chapters 6 though 8 of Philosophy in the Tragic Age does less than full justice to Herakleitos, in spite of Nietzsche's will to appreciate him. It sees him almost entirely as a cosmologist responding to another cosmologist, and so assimilates him too much to Anaximander. Chapter 7 does recover some of Herakleitos' poetic quality, when rehearsing his perception of the "hidden harmony" of things. But is the hidden harmony of the aphoristic fragments only cosmic and material?

That it is not is shown by the counter-historical consequence of taking it to be so. Taking the hidden harmony as only cosmological imputes a distinction between appearance and reality to Herakleitos which he could not have held. That his "fire-gaze" (Feuerblick, as Nietzsche aptly calls it) is penetrating does not entail, ontologically, that it rejects any part of what it discriminates. That would be an ontic or existential injustice contrary to the spirit of the body of Herakleitos's fragments. What Herakleitos perceived, as I read him, was the simultaneous prevalence of chanciness and order in all of life. But he downgraded neither member of this pair, just as he does not downgrade either the visible or the hidden.

It is this joint prevalence of chance and order that, in fact, warrants Nietzsche's twofold view that the process of events was a game for Herakleitos, and that he was a literary artist. For, it is precisely the distinction of poetry that it memorializes our sense of the reality of whatever is there to be discriminated, in whatever way. And both Herakleitos and Nietzsche know that it is poetry, in its playfulness, not polymathy, in its ponderousness, that does this. True poetry is thus not arrogant or "assertive," as polymathy is when it asserts what it thinks are priorities in the realm of being. As Nietzsche so beautifully says, "Not hybris but the ever self-renewing impulse to play calls new worlds into being."

## Nietzsche and Parmenides

Given Nietzsche's literary sensibility and his historiographic equipment, the student of the Presocratics of the lyric century, is disappointed in the hope that Nietzsche's genius would clear away for him the Sophistic and cosmogonic interpretations of Parmenides, the "father of philosophy" (as Plato's Socrates calls him). Nietzsche missed noting that Parmenides is also the first "metaphysical poet," as I would like to call him. But he does say: "The prelude in Parmenides' philosophy is played with ontology as its theme;" and he does say that Parmenides expresses "being as he imagined it" in his poem.

But it is not the case that Parmenides is as anti-experiential as Nietzsche makes out, in taking him for a cosmologist. Nor, I will show, is it clear that Parmenides is asserting doctrine, as Nietzsche thinks he is in the following:

> so far as Parmenides' main doctrine (Hauptsatze) goes, he kept... in submission to it... all subsequent philosophers and nature investigators. They all deny the possibility of coming-to-be and passing-away (Cowan's tr., ch. 14 PTAG).

> In brief, plurality, motion, infinity––all of them [were] chased off by Parmenides with his astonishing proposition (Satz) about being..." (Cowan's tr., ch.15 PTAG).

The intellectual historian can see that Nietzsche, like many others, 15 has failed to see through the Parmenides of the later tradition to the metaphysics, poetry and irony of the original. What is at stake here is the understanding–– abandoned by the cosmologizing, pythagorizing tradition–– that Parmenides' poetic medium holds all assertion in suspension, and that he is putting on exhibit for his auditors the product of his conceptual analysis of "the All," not a cosmographic description of the astronomical universe.

To rescue Parmenides' poem from misapplication, Nietzsche would have had to notice that Parmenides' subject was not existence in the common sense of observable nature, but the All which, while not observable at any one time is yet thinkable––under certain conditions. The All is not observable because "it," the subject of "is" in the locution "what is," is inclusively all that ever was, is and will-be. The conditions which must be observed, if the All is to be thought or spoken of without contradiction, are given by the Goddess in the poem to the young man who is the fictive auditor of her inspired but logically-grounded utterance.

Among the basic ideas of Parmenides' Goddess, from which Nietzsche was unable to wrest clarity, is "the notion of the identity of thinking and being," as he calls it. This is not the "incredibly bold notion" Nietzsche thinks it is. Nor is it a device to salvage the nominal oneness of Parmenides' "Being," which would otherwise, Nietzsche thinks, be afflicted by a cleavage between reality and appearance, between thought and imagination. We recognize here the Parmenides of the neoplatonist Simplicius (VI c. A.D.) who, in his commentaries on Aristotle's physics, assimilates the seemings to aisthêsis and "what is" to noêsis when he quotes for his reader verses 50–53 of fragment 8 of the poem. But Theophrastos, who was removed by less than a century from the Classical age, had already testified in De Sensibus (1.4) that this was not how Parmenides made the distinction: "to perceive by the senses (aisthanesthai), and to have intelligence (phronein) are treated by him as identical."

What the Goddess actually says is that if it can be thought, then it is not nothing. Things thought exist in the order of thought. They are not nothing because, as the Goddess puts it, nothing cannot be thought. "Nothing" can only be mentioned; it cannot be talked about because, if it could, it would exist in the order of discourse: only the mention of "nothing" exists, in Parmenides' poem. The way of what-is-not is "not possible" (ouk anuston) for his Goddess. And discourse belongs with the All because the All includes everything: it excludes nothing. Thus, it also includes appearances. The appearances may be misleading, as the Goddess emphasizes; but they are not nothing, they belong with Being or the All. Becoming, in other words, is an aspect of Being.

Nietzsche takes no note of the substantive division of the poem, after the allegorical proemium, into two parts. But because he thinks that Parmenides started by trying to "answer Anaximander's questions," he divides Parmenides' thinking into two phases.–– What questions, we ask; all we've got of Anaximander's is an interestingly worded claim which the literalist transmitters found "somewhat (sic) metaphorical".––In the first phase, Nietzsche suggests, Parmenides came up with "an organized (durchgeführtes) philosophic-physical system." ––Philosophic yes, physical no.––Nietzsche has noted that there are two aspects to Parmenides' work; but they are not two phases of his development, they visibly correspond to the two main parts of his poem.

The sense in which the Goddess could be said to have a "physical" system is that in which she neatly and ironically outlines, for her young auditor in part two of the poem, a sample cosmography. She shows how easy it is to produce one, as long as your generative opposites are aptly chosen. She develops her own specimen cosmography only to illustrate what is true of all cosmographies (clever as they might otherwise be), that they are necessarily partial, two-headed (dikranoi, of two minds) and backward-turning (palintropos). They are partial because they refer to less than the All, to less than Being which, as all-inclusive, is not observable the way the astronomical universe is. The Goddess has not said that there is anything behind the visible appearances, but that the All is beyond them, in being more than is observable at a given time.

She had said to her auditor (verses 51–52, fr.8) that it would also be necessary to know what "the opinions of mortals [were] in which is no true belief." So, she is not asserting a cosmography; rather she is illustrating something about the limitations of cosmography. She reminds her auditor, at verse 52 of the fragment, that there is deception in the order (kosmon) of her words in this context, (or, else: in the order referred to by her words here). What we are reading in this part of the poem should, therefore, be taken as an exhibitive critique of nature-philosophy, a showing forth of its limitations. At verses 60–61 the Goddess says she has uttered these things so that the listener will not be "outdone by the opinion of mortals."

The connection between the Doxa, the account of the seemings, and the Alêtheia, the account of the subject of "is." is this. The auditor has been conducted through the former in the spirit of enlightenment which part one has brought. We should, implicitly, now be able to see that the claim "all is water" is a contrary of the claim "all is fire" or "all is motion." They could both be false; but they cannot be true together, unless water is also fire or either of these is identical with motion. Nature-philosophies, in other words, are necessarily mutually exclusive without necessarily being true (unless they are saying the same thing in different ways): they are only plausible or "acceptable." And they are all of them incomplete, in spite of the universal form of their claims about the generative principle, because they deal with less than the All. Thus, a nature-philosophy which says that everything is something-and-its-opposite is asserting contraries; it is two-headed, like any set of competing cosmologies. Nature-philosophy is backward-turning because, in not having the All for its subject, it is either arbitrary or involved in an exitless regress; for, you can always ask what is the origin of whatever originative principle is asserted. Only the All which always was is ungenerated; for there never was nothing. Given that there is all there is, there could not have been nothing at any time; for nothing can come from nothing. The Archaic Greeks, as Nietzsche knew, did not believe that the universe had a beginning which needed to be accounted for. Only the preservers of the remains of the sixth-century thinkers had this belief or this need.

Nietzsche should have seen that Parmenides' poem is not a propositional adventure but an expressive vision which conceptualizes and represents a complex insight. One of the main points it dramatizes is the error of forgetting that, while philosophic discourse can be made logical (two-valuedly consistent), only Being (the All) can be talked about consistently. And only the All can avoid being the subject of negative predications. Of any other "x" you can also say "it is not y." Of the All you cannot say that it is not x, y or z; for the All is "what is," and of "what is" you cannot say "it is not." You can only say that "it is," namely, "it is not what-is-not." There are no alternative accounts of complete Being, for Parmenides' Goddess, because there is nothing else besides. All-that-there-is is the only thing there is: all-inclusive Being is unique (mounogenes), as well as one (hen) and entire (oulon).16

To make sure we have understood the Goddess we complete our review of the attributes of Being. That it is imperishable (anôlethron) follows from the fact that it cannot become nothing. "It" can only be what it is, and what is. "It" is also immovable (atremes) since, if it were movable it might change and there would have to be something besides "it." And if it were possible for it to change then it might perish. Therefore, it is not possible for Being to be movable; so. Being is immovable atremes: <>M implies <>C; <>C impl. <>P; but -<>P; ergo... []-M.

And if Being is immovable, it couldn't have passed from some other state to what it is; namely, it couldn't have come from anything else. So, it must be agenêton "ungenerated." Finally, that Being is syneches "continuous" follows, for the Goddess, from the fact that it is "all alike" (pan estin homoion), and not different from itself. It cannot be attenuated or penetrated by not-being (empleon esti eontos), and is entirely in contact with itself (oudê diaireton); I say "nowhere penetrated by not-being" in order, precisely, to avoid sounding cosmographical. It is not the astronomical universe that Parmenides' Goddess is categorizing here, but the All.

Now, there is no way of observing Being as a whole; for we cannot stand outside it to observe "it." Note that if we could, we would be taking being out of time. This is the opposite of what Parmenides has avoided doing in order to help us conceptualize the All. He has rather taken time, purely conceptually, out of the continuum of Being. This, so to say, "collapses" Being, which is temporal, into purely conceptual "instantaneousness," isness (esti) and self-identity. This reminds us of something we easily forget, that the perception of extension is a function of time. In abstracting conceptually from it, Parmenides has not denied time or arrested it. For, time cannot be arrested, as in the mathematical fiction of the instant; and Parmenides has not asserted the extensional reality of the instant. On the contrary, his Goddess has implicitly affirmed Being as fundamentally temporal when describing it as endless. A spatially conceived limit can be visualized as reachable. Only a temporal envelope or coagulant, so to call it, can be both unending and a limiting principle in the required sense.

That Parmenides' "Way of Truth" is about Being as the All and not the visible cosmos, as Nietzsche's contemporaries thought, is confirmed by fragment 4, verse 1: "Behold things which, though absent, are nonetheless securely present to the mind." Similarly, fragment 5 from Proclus (another neoplatonist) must refer to the discourse about Being, not to the material universe: "It is the same to me/ whence I start out; for thereto shall I return." This cannot be a statement in Archaic cosmology; for, the point in that exercise was (according to the tradition itself) to come up with a convincing starting-point or first principle. But that the attributes of Being constitute a deductive series, which is of course circular, is just what we have been assuming and confirming in this articulation of Parmenides' poem.

That "it" is not not-being is the central negation, or determination, upon which Parmenides' conceptualization of Being rests. It is not the denial of difference or change, as those who take Parmenides cosmologically claim, that is basic to Parmenides. For change is not denied of becoming but of the All as the subject of "is," as Being. As "is-ness," it does not admit "alterability" or the concept of change. But Parmenides is not only talking about discourse, he is sharing discoveries with us about how to think without confusion about what it means that there is not nothing. More easily to appreciate this we need only grant that the poem involves an amount of second-order analysis or discourse, and that it presupposes a clear distinction between contrariety and contradiction as kinds of opposite (t'anantia).17 Thus "Being" and "not-being" are an exclusive disjunction or contradiction. But "Being" and "becoming" are an inclusive disjunction or only contraries, like the cosmographic night and light (fr.12.5). That the cosmographic opposites are only contraries could have been the miscue, both for taking nothingness and isness as cosmological and as contraries instead of contradictories. So it is perverse, and Sophistical, of the tradition to then take Being and becoming as mutually exclusive rather than only contraries!

However, though Nietzsche has dialectically accepted as canonical the Parmenides of the cosmo-Sophistical tradition, he saves the day for us in chapter 13 of Philosophy in the Tragic Age by criticizing and succinctly rejecting this misshapen figure. Poet that he is, Nietzsche cannot accept "the falsehood inherent in the absolute separation of senses (Sinnenwelt) and concepts (Begriffswelt)." How, he says, "can the senses (die Sinne) deceive if they are unreal? Not-being (das Nichtseiende) cannot even practice deceit." In the end, Nietzsche has felt the contradiction (Widerspruch) as much as the original Parmenides.

Finally, Nietzsche's assertion in this chapter of "a plurality of realities" (eine Mehrheit von Realitäten), also goes a long way towards rectifying the tortion in his misreading of fragment 3 which advances, not "the identity of being and thinking" in some cosmological sense, but the fact that if something can be thought then it exists. It at least exists, as we said above, in the order of discourse: the discourse, precisely, in which the Goddess has communicated to her young auditor how to think and speak consistently about the All.

Positivism and Ecstasy

## Rationality without Beauty. Release without Proportion

The false alternative which my headings posit is an extrapolation from, and a contrast to, Nietzsche's generative antithesis between the serenities of the Apollonian dream-experience and the ecstasies of the world of Dionysan peak-experiences.

Serenity and ecstasy can be brought together by Nietzsche, because they are alternate ways of intensifying the feelings of intelligibility and freedom in which our humanity is realized, and because they are both aesthetic or creative principles. In dream, we might say, begins intelligibility; but the form of the dreams must be beautiful. In release begins freedom; but the form of the ecstasis must be proportionate to the oppression it releases us from. This is the complex insight Nietzsche is elaborating: if we can see Apollo as "the most sublime expression of the principle of sufficient reason," then we may catch the intoxicating "glimpse into the nature of the Dionysan" which accompanies the terrifying but ecstatic perception of a seeming exception to the uniformity of nature.

Nietzsche takes it for granted, as he opens chapter 2 of The Birth of Tragedy, that the impulse to art is natural (aus der Natur selbst). More importantly, he asserts the societal derivation (ohne jeden Zusammenhang mit der... Bildung des Einzelnen) of the Apollonian artist's imagery, and the communal nature (des Einzelnen nicht achtet) of the feeling of oneness induced by the Dionysan maker's reality. There are, that is, two kinds of artistic energy relevant to an appreciation of Greek tragedy and both of them are instinct-driven social formations. One of them is informed by the imagistic or sculptural vision of Olympian art; the other by the musical, nonverbal expressionism of Dionysan insight.

The former is a reaction-formation, as Freud would say, to the terror of life, a triumphalist overcompensation for the horrors of history. The Apollonian is the negation of Silenus's assertion, before King Midas, of the pain of life. This art is completive (Ergänzung und Vollendung) of existence. With it "the Hellenic will made use of the Olympian world... as a transfiguring mirror. Thus do the Gods justify the life of man: they themselves live it–– the only satisfactory theodicy! Existence under the bright sunshine of such Gods is regarded as desirable in itself, and the real pain of Homeric men is caused by parting from it, especially by early parting." This consummately "naive art" (in Schiller's sense) combats the Hellenic talent for suffering and for learning deep things from great mistakes, by "immersion in the sheer beauty of appearance." And one of its beauties is that it is a shame-free, non-condemnatory art.

The impulse to beauty, however, is insistently challenged by bitter folk memories of cruel wars, as in the horrid Bronze-age myth of the overthrow of the Titans. Over against Homer, the Apollonian exemplar of the epic or collective muse, stands Archilochos, the passionate archetype of the individualist lyric poet who must document the pain and contradiction in life, and who does so musically. But just because the Dionysan is identical with the musical his subjectivity is transcended or validated in the process. Result: "the image that now shows [the artist] his identity with the heart of the world is a dream scene that embodies the primordial contradiction and primordial pain, together with the primordial pleasure of sheer appearance."

Out of this synthesis, Nietzsche was quick to see, of the epic with the lyric, of the visual with the musical, of the chorus with the protagonist, was born the dramatic dithyramb which we call Greek tragedy. And Tragedy, Nietzsche has massively implied, is the art-form in which our painful consciousness of existential insignificance––the ground of pessimism––is overcome, reflectively and satisfactorily. In this art-form, man is projected as fusible with the primal, self-reflective artist-begetter of the world as a whole. Nietzsche is saying that it is of the essence of art both to get at what is primordial and be self-reflective while, also, reaffirming the significance of the human.

As he says towards the end of chapter 5, "it is only as an aesthetic phenomenon that existence and the world are eternally justified." Just as importantly, Nietzsche is implying that the great disappointment that our knowledge is not the knowledge possessed by the world's maker is also overcome in the constructing of art. This will turn out to be decisive for our understanding of Nietzsche's oeuvre.

Nietzsche has recognized that when the energies available to the Apollonian impulse-to-art are fused with the energies available to the Dionysan impulse-to-art, "the acme of the Apollonian as well as the Dionysan aims of art" are achieved. This point is reiterated in chapter 24, towards the end of the book. Nietzsche is aware that his analysis of Greek tragedy is a contribution, not just to the aesthetics of drama, but to aesthetics itself and the metaphysics of art. What this contribution is will not become clear unless we work our way through some of the difficulties with which his discourse bristles.

Chapter 6 of The Birth of Tragedy articulates the complications in the fact that lyric poetry is the result of a combination of the verbal (images, concepts) with the musical. For Nietzsche, music appears as will within poetry; though music is not will but form. For will itself, Nietzsche says, is "unaesthetic." Now, the lyricist's expression requires "all the agitation of passion," passion being the raw material of music. So the lyric, in Nietzsche's explanation, is poetry imitating the dynamism of music.

But secondly, because the lyricist works with visual images, the passionate agitation or emotion is expressed in the Apollonian mode of seeing longing and aspiration in nature. For, the epic (in its turn) is poetry imitating the balanced serenity of sculpture. So that, though all that "the poet beholds through the medium of music is in urgent and active motion," the Apollonian poet necessarily "interprets music [itself] by means of verbal imagery," namely, in a contemplative way.

In corroboration, Nietzsche notes that when the poet looks at himself through the medium of music, his image appears as one of restlessness, willing, longing, groaning, rejoicing. Now these are the very things in terms of which he interprets music. But no paradox arises in the case of Greek tragedy because in it, as Nietzsche says in chapter 24, musical excitement is discharging itself in an Apollonian field––in the reflective way of the dramatized dithyramb. Thus, lyric images of it overcome in one way the sheer compulsiveness and anti-aesthetic nature of raw will. But the will, when symbolized in visual images, is not the same as the will expressed in music. For the way of the latter, from its raw state to its outcome in musical form, is Dionysan, while the former is Apollonian.

In other words, the two art-impulses out of whose mixing Tragedy was born, are not reducible to each other. They are interweavable but ever distinct aesthetic modalities. Notice the tour de force which tragedy paradoxically brings off: while "lyric poetry is dependent on the spirit of music... music itself in its absolute sovereignty does not need the image and the concept, but merely endures them as accompaniments." But because what music expresses is ineffable, all the eloquence of lyric poetry, says Nietzsche, cannot bring the deepest significance of the latter one step nearer to us. The Dionysan component of Tragedy will be dominant over the linguistic because

> language can never adequately render the cosmic symbolism of music, because music stands in symbolic relation to the primordial contradiction and primordial pain in the heart of the primal unity, and therefore symbolizes a sphere which is beyond and prior to all phenomena.... compared with it, phenomena are merely symbols: hence language, as the organ and symbol of phenomena, can never... disclose the innermost heart of music; language in its attempt to imitate it, can only be in superficial contact with music.

Nietzsche has now also said that the power of the dominant or tonic Dionysan component stems from its ineffability. So we can say, in terms of the metaphysics of human products, that it is in the carefully crafted exhibitive nature of the Tragic art that its depth-psychological effectiveness resides.1

Further, if what Nietzsche says is true––as I think it is––we have to conclude that music "symbolizes" (in the quotation above) as indexical symbols do in Peirce's semiotic, namely, causally, as agencies in the given process; but that visual and verbal images are merely iconic picturings of the life-process. Similarly, the phenomena or visual appearances are "symbolic" of the dynamic intimacies of the life-process only in this iconic sense. Thus, in Apollonian art, its "raw" material, the visible, is already, in being iconic, at one remove from the dynamic processes of life. The sculpture and the verbal imagery are, therefore, technically crafted icons of the naturally iconic visual process. That musical form, or the will-to-music, is indexical means that as a human development of the will in nature, it is an effect of nature but a cause of (humanizing) form. Music in the making is indexical because it is a factor in the generation of end-stages of the process of which it is both part and symbol. Its raw materials, what it abstracts from or transforms, are the motions and complex dynamic interactions of biopsychological life itself. This is why music involves us more deeply than sculpture or visually based verbal art.

And because of the level at which it works, musical form does not have to overlook as many of the contradictions and horrors of human life as does plastic art. So, with the addition of this less civilized Dionysan input, the reflectiveness of Greek tragedy is able to surpass that of purely Apollonian art––as sunlight supersedes lamplight, says Nietzsche. The "metaphysical comfort" which Dionysan-Apollonian tragedy affords is more thoroughgoing or therapeutic, as an abreactive experience and reflection, than less agitated Olympian art. Over and above the beautiful, tragic art can achieve the sublime precisely because it is, as Nietzsche says, "the artistic taming of the horrible."

As a complement to all this, and as a condition of understanding the archetype of the satyr, Nietzsche tells us that the art of comedy lies in its controlled (künsterlische) expression of the nausea of absurdity. The truthfulness of the satyr as symbol is found in his pre- or pro to-civilized character: he symbolizes both raw nature and human sexual, generative power. The satyr is constitutive of the chorus, which Nietzsche takes to be a healthy defense-mechanism because it is a non-distortive (depth-psychologically truthful) representation of what it defends against. The tragic chorus is so effective, in fact, that it makes poets out of its audiences: members of the audience surrendered their individuality, through involvement in the Tragedy, in an epidemic way.

This effectiveness is what distinguishes the Tragic chorus from the individualist lyrics and recitative choruses of the sixth and early fifth century. The Dionysan onlooker at the dramatic festival, "sees himself as a satyr, and as a satyr, in turn, he sees the God... in his metamorphosis he beholds a vision outside himself, as the Apollonian complement of his own [dionysan] state." Thus, says Nietzsche, "we must understand Greek tragedy as the Dionysan chorus which ever and anew erupts (entladet) in an Apollonian world of images." The Dionysan insights shared in the drama are what distinguish it so sharply, on the other hand, from the epic. There is a formalized modicum of Olympian spectacle in Greek tragedy since the protagonists are drawn mostly from the epic; but Tragedy does not bring redemption through the beauty of cultivated appearances. It does so by the musical achievement of a Dionysan unity with what is primordial in life.

Thus, if the dialogue of Tragedy is "lucid and precise" (Apollonian), it is so in compensation for the fact that its subject-matter consists of the worse and most horrible things that can happen to a human, as in the Oedipus plays. But the price of the fact that the enacted perceptions or deep insights are Dionysan, is that they can hurt the bearer of them even while benefitting others. So is the perception Dionysan, in the Prometheus of Aischylos, that there is an impious darkside to Dionysan insightfulness. That creative activity itself can be sacrilegious, is the troubling mystery at the heart of things which Prometheus Bound begins to abreact. This play is a valid, or healing, part of an abreactive trilogy because it begins to celebrate the great potential for good of activity and inventiveness, while refusing to blink at the Titanic disaster that comes to the daring innovator as part of the potential for evil of said activity. That the striving individual, that the active life itself, though it strive only for "the best and the highest," are, in the nature of things from a certain point of view, sacrilegious and Oedipal–– this is the Tragic truth that Aischylos enacts in his pursuit of justice through the medium of dramatic poetry.

Through the musical, Herculean power of tragedy, says Nietzsche, the Greek myths attained their most profound content, their most expressive form. But this highest and most effective of the arts, he then states, commits suicide upon itself in the person of Euripides the aesthetic Socratic, as Nietzsche calls him. The step which Euripidean tragedy took of making it possible for every spectator to identify fully with the actors on the stage, in collusion with the rationalistic side of Euripides' personality and that demon of logicality, Socrates, spelled for Nietzsche the death of Tragedy. We must now review how Nietzsche came to this conclusion.

## Poetry as Dianoia, Imagination as Rationality

Nietzsche sees Euripidean drama as having replaced the ecstasis provided by Dionysan tragedy with fiery emotionalism (feurige Affecte). At the same time, the work done in Dionysan tragedy by Apollonian thoughtfulness is replaced by the effect of cold paradoxes. The supreme law of aesthetic Socratism, says Nietzsche, is that "to be beautiful is to be intelligible" (verständig).

There seem to be three components, then, to Nietzsche's hypothesis about the death of Tragedy: (i) that Euripides the rational thinker is separable from Euripides the tragic poet and has overridden him; (ii) that a figure named "Socrates" is the pure exemplar and pioneer of the new logicality; and (iii) that the equation of beauty with "intelligibility" somehow deprives Tragedy of its Dionysan, or depth-psychological, effectiveness. Under thesis (ii) the new "Socratic" rationa lism does not achieve, for Euripides, "the Apollonian effect of the epos;" while, under (iii), Dionysan involvement is replaced by emotional realism.

But can the thinking or reflectiveness be separated from the art in poetic drama, as in thesis (i)? Not if by the reflectiveness of tragedy we mean the medium-bound thinking, the imagistic and rhythmic formativity, of its poet-composer; and not if art, as stated by Nietzsche himself, gives us knowledge like that of the Creator. It is because Euripides' dramas are easier to paraphrase, and because it is easier to verbalize reasons for the actions of his protagonists, that he has been called a rationalist. But does this make him less a poet than Aischylos or Sophocles, or only a different kind of Tragic poet? After all, is it not from his Bacchae that we get the very notion of Dionysan tragedy, or the notion that Tragedy ought to be Dionysan? The Bacchae is not the less Dionysan because its composer also invented the new genre of melodrama. It would be contrary to Nietzsche's own view of Tragedy to believe that Euripides could compose the Bacchae with the purely Dionysan side of himself, and the melodramas with his rationalizing and fantasizing parts. To think this is to beg the very question at issue in Nietzsche's works. For, it assumes that there is some point at which a person's rationality ends and his animality begins, and it assumes that reason and imagination are distinct and separate, rather than the inextricably mixed powers which they are.

Let us take a closer look at the "Socrates" whom Nietzsche introduces in sections 12 through 15 of The Birth of Tragedy. And let us examine the concept of rationality with which this unclarified figure is said to have subverted Euripides and the art of tragedy itself. We will not forget that Nietzsche noted that Euripides did after all honor Dionysos in the Bacchae. Nor will we neglect the fact that Nietzsche in his work is ever searching for the integrities of things and the non-dualistic wholeness of man. Nietzsche uses, but does not accept, absolute antitheses. Those that he posits, he posits dialectically, for the sake of the truth that will be found somewhere inbetween the ideational extremes.2

Under inspiration by Anaxagoras, Nietzsche tells us "what Euripides must have thought," namely that, "as long as the sole ruler and disposer of the universe, intelligence (nous), remained excluded from artistic or creative activity, things were all mixed together in primeval chaos" (ch.12). We note that, here, "intelligence" is equated with creative activity as a whole: as long as there was none, chaos ruled. When there is creative activity, intelligence is enthroned. This has to be intelligence in the broad, pre-rationalistic sense. Above, however, Nietzsche has used the word in the narrow sense that makes the slogans of "Socratism" so reductive: "to be beautiful everything must be intelligible (or conscious)" and "knowledge is virtue." According to these slogans the poet is "unintelligent" because he is not relying on conscious, logical reason but on his lyric or tragic instincts. The ironic quote-marks are Nietzsche's own.

So, who is this "Socrates" in whom "we may recognize... the opponent of Dionysos"? Is it Plato's Socrates properly understood or literalistically misunderstood; is it Xenophon's or Diogenes Laertius's Socrates, some composite of all of the above, and/or some suppositious historical Socrates? Plato's Socrates discusses Tragedy in both Phaedrus and Gorgias, he wittily invokes it upon himself in the Phaedo; and in the Symposium he claims that the composer of tragedies should also be able to compose comedies and vice-versa. Tragedy comes up in the Phaedrus at 268C-E in the context of a discussion about how to produce speeches which are well-ordered wholes. It comes up in the Gorgias at 501E-502 within a sarcastic allusion of Plato's Socrates to Meles and Kinesias as sophistic, crowd-pleasing dramatists.

At that point in the Gorgias Kallicles has perfunctorily but characteristically agreed, with Socrates leading, that all poetry (including tragedy) is merely for the sake of pleasure. Kallicles is perfunctory because by now he has been refuted four times, and is still answering only at the urging of the other interlocutors who want to see the discussion completed. The reader easily sees that to the question "do flute and harp playing, choral odes and dithyrambs aim only at our pleasure," he could have answered "no, some may also be trying to be good for us." The reader who remembers the anguish-causing verses and painful situations in which Greek tragedy abounds, will also see that it is contrary-to-fact to claim that the function of tragedy is only pleasure. ––Note that, at 502C, Kallicles rightly denies that all oratory is flattery and indifferent to the good of the citizens.

The claim about Tragedy is made ironically by Plato's Socrates as a step toward the equation he is making between certain kinds of audience-flattering drama and sophistry. He has gotten Kallicles to agree that what is left when tragic poetry has been stripped of meter, melody and rhythm is just speeches. [What is left of poetry when you have taken the poetry out of it?] He also gets Kallicles to agree that poetry is a kind of public speaking because speeches to a great crowd is what tragedy becomes when you take the poetry out of it. So, he continues, if poetry is public speaking then it must be rhetorical and poets must use rhetoric? Yes, says Kallicles. But must it not also be the worst kind of rhetoric, Socrates impishly presses the irony, since the public at the theater includes women, children and slaves––unlike the Assembly where only free men need to be flattered (502D)!

But over in the Phaedrus, Plato's Socrates had inferred (at 268C-E) that Tragedy cannot be reduced to the aggregate of mimetic speeches in it. And he accepts from Phaedrus (without irony?) the suggestion that Sophocles and Euripides would laugh "at anyone who thought that tragedy was anything other than a well-fitting synthesis of its parts into a whole in harmony with itself."

It is Sophistic rhetoric, then, not tragedy as such that is being condemned by Plato's Socrates in both the Gorgias and the Phaedrus: with irony and analogy in the former, categorically in the latter.3 It is also worth noting that in the Gorgias Plato's Socrates has ironically condemned all kinds of music as well as poetry. But if we take his fabulation in the "Republic"" literally, only poetry ought to be banned, since properly censored music––so his story runs in that dialogue––can make the guardians good, and remediate the fever of the luxurious city. The discourse of Plato's Socrates must ever be monitored for its attitudinizing toward some of its subjects!

We come to Aristodemus's report, in the fiction of the Symposium, that Socrates was driving his sleepy partners Agathon and Aristophanes to the admission that "the same person could have the know-how with which to compose tragedies and comedies, that the artful tragedian could also be a comedian." Taken literally, this claim is not as surprising as some readers have thought it to be, given that fifth-century tragedians customarily wrote the satyr-plays, or comic burlesques, which followed the completion of their own tragic triads. Euripides' melodramas are the recognized ancestors of fourth-century New comedy. And Euripides' short play Alcestis, which was used in place of the customary satyr-play, has some comic scenes. But since we have no record of well-known comedians who wrote tragedies too, it would not be a misreading to feel that Plato's Socrates is simply teasing Aristophanes here, or stirring up a discussion between his two expert but flagging companions.

Since it is also the case that Plato's Socrates calls Aristophanes a devotee of Dionysos in a context (177E) that teasingly identifies both himself and Aristophanes as claiming to know something about love-matters (ta erôtika), it cannot be Plato's Socrates whom "we may recognize [as] the opponent of Dionysos." For this Socrates is an ironizing critic of both Sophistic speech-making (in the Gorgias) and selfishly erotic rhetoric (in the Phaedrus), whether they are part of drama or politics or personal relations.

But if we take literally Socrates' program for remediating the feverishness of his, or Glaucon's, sardonically fabulated city in the "Republic", and fail to notice that this program has given Socrates just the scope he needs to put into witty exhibition the shortcomings of both pythagorism and spartanism, then the Socrates that results can indeed be taken for an enemy of classical Tragedy. But this is an illegitimately derived "Socrates," whose blinkered and blundering extraction from the dialogues that are by Plato, absolutely negates their nature as dramatic constructions wrought with careful artistry and intellectuality. The inner ugliness of this "Socrates" makes the surface ugliness noted by Nietzsche unredeemable, because it combines the contradictory and unsavory attributes of a pythagorizing or spartanizing elitism with the demotic sophistry of the plebeian that Xenophon's oligarchal propaganda would turn him into.

I remind the reader of Buchler's distinctions. An action or set of actions, as a human product, is, in the new determinacies it creates, an active judgment. As human products, statements and things made are, respectively, assertive and exhibitive judgments. Something made or constructed effects its judgment by virtue of the sheer shape or arrangement which constitutes it.

## The Socrates of the Pythagorizing and Oligarchal Tradition

As these traits are part of a composite Socrates handed down by the pythagorizing or platonist tradition of Plato-interpretation, and as Nietzsche accepts some of them as constitutive of his Socrates, we need to complete our survey of the conventional composite before discussing Nietzsche's Socrates any further. The traditional composite is, of course, not the historical Socrates, since the latter seems to have become a kind of public or literary property in his own lifetime. And the most valiant and scholarly efforts to recover the historical Socrates1 succeed only in clarifying further just how literary or mythical a product everything is that we think we know about Socrates. But this fact itself is a measure of how great the impact was of his personality (and what he represented) on Classical culture. It was, precisely, what he represented that came at once into dispute. This would seem to mean that he was the charismatic embodiment of an archetype that was controversial. It would also seem to mean, for the controversy to be so heated and so enduring, that not transient but fundamental human, and politicizable, values were being projected or challenged by the original Socrates.

The works of Xenophon, who was a successful military man and honorary Spartan, everywhere reflect his interest in defending the oligarchal way of life. This way of life was under permanent challenge by democrats, as well as subject to question by some of the Sophists. Over in Western Greece, the Pythagoreans had been advisors to dynasts and oligarchs, when not themselves rulers like Archytas, the stratêgos of Tarentum. Pythagoreans are not found questioning oligarchy, though it is possible that they sought to intellectualize it, as in Socrates' satire of it in the "Republic." It is possible that they tried to blend or replace it with what they called "scientific" (epistêmôn) monarchy, as in the exhibitive critique of this process developed in the Politicus. If they actually did either of these things, which involve appeals to an ideal constitution or ruler, then they were playing along with the new antimoderate and anti-democratic way of countering the standard appeal to the ancestral constitution. Sophists, on the other hand, could be found on either side of the question as long as they thought it was the side on which the power lay.

But it is not as a Sophist that Xenophon presents his Socrates. The Memorabilia is a rather inconsistent whitewash of a bland pedagogue who is both one of the people (dêmotikos, I.ii.60) and holds the opinions of a notable (kalosk'agathos).2 This Socrates has doctrines. Most of his associates seem to be notables, and he is said both always to make his hearers better (I.ii.61) and to be someone who "leads them towards gentlemanliness" (I.vi.14), though he fails in the case of bad men like Kritias and Alcibiades. He is said to identify happiness (eudaimonia) with the art of kingship (tên basilikên technên) at II.i.17. He knows all about good administration (!), and is religious in the most conventional way. He knows what is better and worse, and is good at definitions and refutations (IV.viii.11); for, Xenophon has no trouble ascribing what he thinks is knowledge to Socrates.

The one trait he might have had in common with Plato's Socrates, self-sufficiency (autarkeia), is qualified away by Xenophon as self-sufficiency with respect to knowledge, just what Plato's Socrates claims he doesn't have. We can gather how unhistorical Xenophon is being, by noting that this Socrates is said, at I.vi.14, to be both eclectic and a practiced reader of written books (en bibliois grapsantes). This is anachronistic because, as a Greek who grew up in an oral-aural culture, the historical Socrates would have read and written only with difficulty, if at all.

The pedagogue and country-gentleman's chauvinist tutor of the Memorabilia and Oeconimicus who––just like Xenophon––counts agriculture and warfare as the important occupations of man, is not only banalized but (contradictorily) denied good sense in Xenophon's Defense of Socrates. Here he is said to have been "most illconsidered" (aphronesteros) at his trial. Xenophon is explicitly attaching this adjective to his words on that occasion, in contrast to other authors who believe his speech to have been sublime. Paragraph 1.23 of Xenophon's Defense betrays its author by assuming that Socrates should not have objected to an unconversational retirement to the Attic countryside from the disputatious city. To Plato's Socrates this would, in principle, have been no different from the banishment he refuses even to consider. Since Socrates did., in fact, show up at his trial, this refusal may be considered historical.

Just as Xenophon's other Socratic writings seem to trivialize Socrates, so, to a reader without oligarchal preconceptions, Xenophon's Defense does not succeed at all as an apology for Socrates. At paragraph 6, the Socrates whom we prefer to remember as characteristically claiming to know nothing, is casually presented as knowing something, as concerned with "living pleasantly" (hêdeôs bioteuoimi), and anxious to avoid painful decrepitude. This characterization seems somehow unSocratic. So does the negative implication, at 1.8, that there was a (self-serving?) moment when Socrates and his friends considered "all and any means" to get him acquitted. This is certainly not "the dying Socrates" to whose romantic image, Nietzsche says, the new youth is rebelliously and tragically attached. For, Xenophon's Socrates' defense is of the orthodox nature of his daimôn, at 1.12 and 1.13. This defense depends upon a rather forced equation between his inner voice and the voice of the Pythô at Delphi; and its wording is both torpid and sophistical.

This Socrates makes conceited or righteous claims, as at 1.19 where he boasts of "all the blessings I think gods and men have bestowed on me, and my own opinion of myself." At 1.15–16, he calls himself wise in a strangely unSocratic way: he has to be called wise, he says, because from the time he first understood spoken words he persistently sought for "learning" and "whatever he could that was good." He eulogizes himself again at 1.19: "do I not unquestionably merit praise from both gods and man; and he implies at 1.26 that he knows he has been a good teacher to many people of good things. The point is that while it might be inaccurate of Socrates to deny all or some of these things, the affirmation of them about himself is necessarily hybristic and conceited. Finally, the quotation at 1.14 of the Delphic oracle about himself is embarassingly boastful. About the mention of Chaerephon here, we note that, like the fuzzy allusion to Anytus at 1.29, it sounds as if what Xenophon is doing is giving variants of incidents traditionally and obligatorily included in "lives" of Socrates.

As in the Memorabilia, this Socrates knows what is good (ho ti... agathon), unlike the Socrates of the "Republic." To refute Meletus at 1.20, Xenophon's Socrates offers with belief an argument that, in Plato's dialogues, Socrates advances only dialectically or ironically. This is the Sophistic appeal to the "authority of expertise," as we may call it. The rhetorical question or rationalization, at 1.27, "for, to start with, do you not know that from whenever I was born I have been condemned to death by nature," sounds Pythagorean or even stoic in its phrasing.

To cap it all, Xenophon then goes on to speak in his own voice at 1.32 of Socrates' "self-inflation" (to megalynein heauton) before the court. And this, we now see, is the very impression of Socrates which the oligarchist has been laboring to create throughout this supposed defense. The few favorable epithets used by Xenophon do not adequately mask the false, disingenuous claim that he Xenophon "cannot refrain from praising him" (1.34), precisely because Xenophon has damned him with faint praise.

Xenophon, in other words, is either trying to downgrade Socrates' practice as memorialized in Plato's dialogues or, else, he is trying (decades after the fact) to redefine in his own terms the general understanding or memory of Socrates' practice. While we cannot recover what that practice actually was, it is not to be believed that the mediocre pedagogue portrayed by Xenophon could have had the impact Socrates has in fact had, were Xenophon's the historical Socrates.

We already see that Nietzsche has incautiously allowed his Socrates to have some of the attributes which Xenophon gives him. We will review these when we have looked at what Diogenes Laertius has contributed to the traditional image of the composite Socrates. But we at once remind the reader of Laertius's historical unreliability by quoting his remark that "Xenophon made Socrates his exact model" (II.56). Xenophon certainly did not take a gentleman's tutor, namely, his own Socrates for a model! Nor could he have taken either Plato's or the historical Socrates for his model, since either or both of these is just what he's trying to replace with his own would-be Socratic discourses.3

But because Laertius records an echo of almost everything that was said about Socrates down to his own time (IIIc. A.D.), he sometimes accidentally hits the mark. At II.57 of his life of Xenophon, he says that "he and Plato were jealous of each other." The reason Laertius gives for this, what he calls "the sweetness of [Xenophon's] narrative," is most revealing as cultural history. Any student of ancient Greek knows that Xenophon's prose is easy to read, not because the student started Greek with Xenophon's prose, but because it is fairly straightforward if often clumsy Greek. That the shallow eclectic Laertius finds Xenophon's prose so pleasant, shows only that he and his century (i) knew no better and had no appreciation of classical Greek, and (ii) were not reading Plato's works themselves but only about them. For, anyone who can read Xenophon can, with a little effort, also read Plato. But to go to Plato's dialogues for themselves, and not just for the sake of plucking previously formulated doctrines from them without reading them, is to award to Plato not Xenophon the honorific title of "the Attic Muse." Further, the tradition that Xenophon saw himself as competing with Plato is also to be found in Aulus Gellius,4 and confirms the reader's impression that Xenophon is trying to paint over Plato's witty picture of a universally critical nonconformist and critical seeker after truth and competence.

Laertius's claims taken at face value can, however, be taken as representative of the state of popular belief about Socrates and Plato in his time. In Diogenes Laertius, about whom Nietzsche wrote some learned monographs,5 there is a repeated pairing of Euripides and Socrates; and Laertius quotes a number of sources on their relationship. Socrates is supposed to have been a great influence upon Euripides, even though, we note, Socrates was either 10 or 20 years younger than Euripides, according to DL himself (II.44). What is not certain is that this association "did not escape the notice of contemporaneous antiquity," if by "contemporaneous" (Nietzsche's word, ch.13) we mean oral or ocular witnesses of the two men. It could, like "Socrates'" association with Alcibiades, be a fourth-century phenomenon due, precisely, to their being feature together by the intervening literature.

This Socrates studied physics or nature-philosophy at II.45, and under Archelaus at II.19. But at II.21 he thinks it is not necessary to study physics. Again, this Socrates is said to have been liberated, either from slavery or his own workshop, by Crito and educated by Crito (II.21). But in Plato's Euthydemus, it is Crito who asks Socrates how best he may educate his son Critobolus. This Socrates was also a student of Anaxagoras, along with Euripides (II.45).––At the same time as his senior the playwright? After or before "he" decided it was not necessary to study physics?

At II.20, this Socrates was the first to teach rhetoric "with his student Aeschines," who was born a decade after Socrates' death. This, by the way, comes from DL's favorite source Favorinus, whose reliability we can now judge for ourselves. At II.22 this Socrates is supposed, also anachronistically, to have saved Xenophon's life at the battle of Delium. But the latter took place in 424/3 B.C., and Xenophon is believed to have been born around 426 B.C.

Just as believably, DL's Socrates may have been a money-maker and money-lender (II.20). He was vehement in argument, and often beaten upon physically because of it (II.21). But, at any rate, he was both very independent and a good democrat (II.24). He not only danced habitually, for the exercise, as Xenophon says in his Symposium, but learned to play the lyre at an advanced age (II.32).

Laertius' Socrates "held that geometry should be studied [only] to the point at which a man is able to measure the land which he acquires or parts with." This contrasts with Plato's Socrates who ironically holds ("Rep." V.527 Bff.) that geometry should be theoretical, and complemented with a study of the proportionalities which govern a priori the subjects of astronomy and harmonics; in turn, these studies will be capped by that of "the dialectic." It would seem that, on this point, popular opinion had sided with Xenophon, the anti-theorist, rather than with Plato literalistically or dialogically understood.

So inattentive to history is Laertius that he thinks that Anytus "in the first place stirred up Aristophanes and his friends [against Socrates]; then afterwards he helped persuade Meletus to indict him on a charge of impiety and corrupting the youth" (II.38). But Aristophanes' Clouds was first produced in 423 B.C., and invoked a stereotype to which he gave the name of "Socrates" because the historical Socrates had made that name well-known, not because he had the traits of the three different classes of thinker which the stereotype was made to combine by the caricaturing comedian. These traits were those of the impoverished or refugee Pythagoreans who had come to Athens from Western Greece, of the more mediocre, less successful Sophists, and of the nature-philosophers. It may well have been Aristophanes' comedy that, more than anything else, turned the original Socrates into a literary property in his lifetime. But it is misleading to take a play which uses the device of attaching famous names to dramatic characters who were "types" or caricatures, as a historical source. What happened twenty-three years later was that Anytus was able, for purposes of winning his law-suit against Socrates, to count on the associations which in the meantime had grown up in popular opinion between a philosopher who left no written record of his own and Aristophanes' sharply outlined composite.6

Interesting as all this is for the history of belief, what we need to note is that if the traits of Laertius's Socrates appear, or are implicit, in Nietzsche's it is because they also already belong either to Xenophon's Socrates or to Plato's Socrates literalistically abstracted from the dialogues. This is to say that the Socrates to which Nietzsche is responding is, more than anything else, the Socrates of the tradition. But, as the Socrates of the tradition is something of a pythagorizer––which Xenophon was not––it becomes clear that this trait has to be ascribed to Plato's Socrates literalistically understood. Where Plato's Socrates in the dialogues can be seen to be gently teasing or implicitly criticizing the Pythagoreans, as at "Republic" 527, for mathematical insufficiency in respect to harmonics, or for numerological pompousness, as at "Republic" 546, he is flatly taken to be himself pythagorizing. Where he says something abstractible as an apothegm, which seems to confirm or enhance later Pythagorean beliefs, what he says is ascribed to Pythagoras himself, as Socrates' last words in the Phaedo were ascribed by Olympiodorus to Pythagoras, centuries later.7

## Nietzsche's Traditionalist Reading of Plato

We must now address what Nietzsche says about Plato the author, since discussion of Nietzsche's Socrates cannot be completed without an understanding of Nietzsche's attitude to his work as a whole. As Dannhauser says, "according to most of the literature on 'the problem of Socrates'––and according to Nietzsche as well––its core is the proper understanding of Plato, which, in turn, involves an understanding of the distinction between Socrates and Plato."8 "Plato was not a pure Socratic," as Dannhauser says, only because Plato was not a non-writer, that is, not a communicator in an oral-aural society.

However, as part of a culture whose modes of communicating had become visual-graphic, Plato, on the dialogical understanding of his works, is on the contrary a true Socratic, but in the graphic mode, in writing. Plato's dialogues do in writing what Socrates did on his feet: they question and explore, they deduce consequences, they bring sets of doctrines and arguments into live confrontation––thus suspending the assertion of them. They are also intellectually open-ended and amusing even while, as dialogues and as an art-form, they achieve literary closures suited to the communicative interactions they have dramatized. Within the dialogues Plato's Socrates teases or is polite, refutes or rationalizes, is logical in argument or paralogical, tells stories to his interlocutors, allusively satirizes, or suspends judgment, and appears as seeking for definitions which he then cannot accept.

About Socratism in a sense other than that of the practice of interrogation and induction, Nietzsche himself says, in section 190 of Beyond Good and Evil, 9 that the morality of Plato, in common with philosophy as such and in spite of Plato, does not admit Socratism. Socratism means to him, here, the doctrine that the bad do wrong involuntarily and out of ignorance; they don't know that to do wrong is to hurt themselves. And removal of this error would make the bad good. Nietzsche thinks that Plato "was really too noble" for such a belief, and tried to make something good out of "the proposition of his teacher;" but only succeeded in mystifying it by playing "infinite" variations on the theme. The proposal we remember is most clearly broached by Plato's Socrates in the Gorgias.

It's interesting that in section 9 of The Birth of Tragedy, Nietzsche illuminates the nature of the dialogue-component of Greek tragedy in terms of the analogy of the famous "allegory of the cave," and that the analogy succeeds in explaining the complex, penetrating and aesthetically satisfying effect of this constituent of Tragedy. But note that he does not say that the analogy and imagery to which he has appealed are extracted from a monumental conversational exchange made up, after Book II of "Republic", of an extended fabulation (by a sardonic Socrates) consisting of stories and explanation within stories and explanations. For Nietzsche does not, here, address or ask after the nature of Plato's dialogue-form itself. Its most obvious difference with a stage-play is, precisely, that Plato's art-form is composed entirely of dialogue and that Plato must do everything he does in it and with it, by means of dialogue. The quality of Plato's imagery turns out, in any case, to be sufficient to support Nietzsche's analytic application of it to his account of Tragedy. But how could Nietzsche not have seen how close his own Thus Spoke Zarathustra is, as a philosophic art-form, to the form of Plato's Dialogues? Does the fact that he did not, imply that, because he takes the dialogical character Socrates to be Plato's spokesman, we should likewise take Zarathustra to be speaking everywhere for Nietzsche?

In section 14 of The Birth of Tragedy Nietzsche suggests that Socrates' Cyclopic but non-Dionysan eye misrepresented the nature of "the sublime and greatly lauded" nature of the art of tragedy. In contrast to Plato's ironic Socrates dialogically understood (whose mentions of tragedy we accounted for above), this is the Socrates of the pythagorized Plato: the non-artist who wrote actionless, humorless treatises in a search for, or puzzling exposition of, a deductive system. This Socrates understands and tolerates, of poetry, only the fables of Aesop.

We find Nietzsche, all the same, having to say that Plato "was nevertheless constrained by sheer artistic necessity to create an art-form that was related to those forms of art which he (sic) repudiated." He continues,

> we find Plato endeavoring to transcend reality and to represent the idea which underlies the pseudoreality. Thus Plato, the thinker, arrived by a detour where he had always been at home as a poet––at the point from which Sophocles and the older art protested.... If tragedy absorbed into all the earlier types of art, the same might also be said in an eccentric sense of the Platonic dialogue which, a mixture of all extant styles and forms, hovers midway between narrative, lyric and drama, between prose and poetry, and so has also broken the strict old law of the unity of linguistic form.

Here, Nietzsche has indeed taken note of the complex genesis of Plato's dialogue-form. But he hasn't yet come to a perception or appreciation of its integrity and proper effectiveness as an art-form. To call it "an infinitely escalated Aesopian fable" (sec. 14), is a partial categorization of its ethical effectiveness but miscategorizes its literary form. There is plenty of fabulation in the dialogues, and not only by Plato's Socrates; but a dialogue is a different genre from a fable. "The moral of the story" (ho mythos deloi) is never spelled out by its author at the end of the conversational exchange. Plato's dialogues are much closer to poetry than to the Aesopian fable, in that they cannot be paraphrased without great loss to their effectiveness. And Plato himself has not anywhere "repudiated... forms of art;" only one of his characters has, in a sardonic mood and in the context of a satirical fabulation which turns the ideal constitution into a counter-utopia.

Equally important, Nietzsche has approached Plato's new art-form on the assumption that it was invented for the special "philosophic" or doctrinal purpose of "transcending reality," and in order "to represent the idea which underlies the pseudo-reality." This grants before it can be questioned that Plato was a pythagorizing platonist. And it by-passes the duty of an intelligent reader of (i) taking the texts he has in hand for what they are, and of (ii) observing, as he completes the experience of reading them through, what form they have, what it is that they try and don't try to accomplish, and how they relate or fail to relate, in their individual designs, to each other. To mistake the picaresque novel Tom Jones, for instance, as a Bildungsroman about the spiritual development of a sensitive young man, is less of an error than to take a wittily dramatized conversation about intellectual matters, for a humorless expository treatise endeavoring to assert part of a system of doctrine. Nietzsche has not really gotten past Laertius's assertion (III.48, 55) that the dialogue is the form Plato chose to use for the "establishment of his own beliefs" (tôn heautôi dokountôn). Actually, it is the form least adapted to this use, if by beliefs we mean doctrines (as Laertius does). Of course, if by "his own views" we mean Plato's non-dogmatism (as I do), then Plato's dialogue-form is the perfect vehicle for the purpose.10

Though he fails to put them into operation, Nietzsche has broader conceptions of the dialogue-form and the dialectic than Laertius. For the latter, "a dialogue is a discourse consisting of question and answer on some philosophical or political subject, with due regard to the characters of the persons introduced and the choice of diction" (III.48). "Dialectic," he adds, "is the art of discourse by which we either refute or lay down something (ti) for the interlocutors (tôn prosdialegomenôn) by means of question and answer." Laertius, as is his usual practice, is only quoting others here, without much understanding of what he is saying. We note at once that, within the nominal format of question and answer, a dialogue of Plato's is much more than question and answer when the respondents or auditors include a Socrates, Protagoras, Aristophanes, Parmenides or, for that matter, an Anytus. We also note the slippage in Laertius according to which we, or the author of the dialogue, speaks for the interlocutors in it. This, again, does not fit Plato's dialogical practice, given that he nowhere speaks in his own voice and nowhere gives indications that one speaker rather than another should be taken as his spokesman. But it is the case that Laertius's confusion has ever since been faithfully perpetuated by traditionalist interpreters of the dialogues.

In answering the question "what ultimately grew out of this philosophic eroticism of Plato?" Nietzsche (in his turn) characterizes dialectics as "a new art-form of the Greek agon," namely, of the competitive spirit or practice of the Greeks.11 Now, in Daybreak 544, he had implied that the dialectic as practised within Plato's dialogues echoed the sounding triumph of "the new invention of rational thinking" (in the narrow, supposedly 'Socratic' sense).12 Here dialectics is said to consist of "speech and counter-speech." And, for the Greeks who were so intoxicated by it, it was a "rigorous and sober game of concept, generalization, refutation, limitation." At the same time, we do not forget that Nietzsche considered dialectic a symptom of decadence.13

But then in line with this, Nietzsche calls the Platonic dialogue "eine entsetzlich selbstgefallige und kindliche Art Dialektik," a shockingly self-satisfied and childish kind of dialectic.14 This not only calls for the response we have been giving in terms of the dialogue as an art-form; Nietzsche, we see, has not clarified for himself the relations between dialogue-form and "dialectic." But we may note, in passing, that Nietzsche derogatory description does apply to the spurious dialogues that are, with persistent perversity, included by the tradition in "the corpus of Plato's works."

Nietzsche has just admitted, in "What I Owe to the Ancients," that the ancient Greeks have made less of an impression upon him than the Romans. ––We remember that Greek scholarship, at this point in the history of classical studies, had not yet emerged from under the shadow of the Latin, Renaissance and Hellenistic modes of looking at classical Greece through Alexandrian and Roman lenses. In Plato studies, scholars such as E. Zeller were, by the 1870's, already retreating from the better understanding of Plato beginning to be found in the work of A. Boeckh, F. Ast and in Zeller's own Platonische Studien of 1839.15

Nietzsche makes the interesting claim that one learns how to write from the Romans better than from the Greeks. But this, one has to answer, is because Hellenistic Greek was an artificial language and because teachers have never taught those classical Greeks who could be taken as models of prose, as natural models of prose structure and versatility. And first among these is Plato himself in the dialogues that are by him.

The deeper difficulty is that most of the literature of Archaic and Classical Greece is the literature of an oral-aural or semi-literate (recitation-literate) society. And, outside of the historians and speech-writers, it is therefore mostly verse. But were prose models ever to be picked on the grounds of their stylistic interest to the apprentice-writer, Plato would certainly have to be included among them: both for the charm of his conversational style and the mimetic versatility of the characterizing diction with which he authenticates the intellectual reality of his speakers. His Gorgias talks as Gorgias is known to have talked, for example, while Polus talks just as we would expect a disciple of Gorgias to talk, and so on. The fact that Plato has never been taken this way, and that his formative and dramatizing prose has yet to become the subject of an adequate stylistic appreciation, shows only how little he is appreciated––or even thought of––as a literary master.16

It is from within this defective tradition that Nietzsche says: "For Heaven's sake, don't throw Plato at me. I am a complete skeptic about Plato, and I have never been able to join in the admiration for the artist Plato that is customary among scholars." Note that this "admiration" has never been more than lip-service, and has never included an operational understanding of Plato's dialogue-form as such, as I have shown at full length in Plato's Dialogues One by One. This is just the reason Nietzsche is able, in his coldness to Plato, to range himself with "the subtlest judges of taste among the ancients themselves." Of course, this is circular; for, those to whom Nietzsche has reference are the same who have transmitted to us the pythagorizing doxographical, anti-dialogical and humorless way of using Plato's works. That Nietzsche suffered from the standard blocks about Plato, is shown by the preference he expresses for the interesting, but still inferior, dialogues of Fontenelle––who, by the way, is not less "moralistic" or less "Christian" than Nietzsche thinks Plato was.17

"Plato, it seems to me," says Nietzsche, "throws all stylistic forms together and is thus a first-rate decadent in style." What follows from the first clause of this sentence is not the second, but that Nietzsche has not perceived the mimetic, or idiolectic, propriety of the different ways of talking which Plato has invented for the characters who hold forth against each other in his dialogues. Plato will certainly be "boring," as Nietzsche says, if he is scanned only for the illegitimately-derived, or preformulated, bits of doctrine that can be put together into a system called "platonism." The reading of any author whose wit, whose humor or whose ironies are suppressed by that reading, will necessarily be humorless and flat. How interesting can a satire be, to someone who does not perceive it as satire? Isn't the lesson of Gulliver's Travels that, when a work of satire can no longer be perceived as satire, it becomes at best a children's book because of the quality of its imagery literally understood. So in Plato's works the quality of the imagery, non-dialogically and non-satirically understood, is precisely enough to make them interesting to those who have reason to find pythagorizing platonism interesting.

Nietzsche would have been completely right had he said, as he almost did, "how much 'Platonism' there still is in the concept 'church,' in the construction, system, and practice of the church!" The sentence following this does indeed assert that it is Platonism that he and we are suffering from. So, if the reader, who takes Plato's works in their wittily allusive and creative brilliance, will substitute "platonism" in every place that Nietzsche complainingly writes "Plato," he or she will be able to take the extended point as validatable cultural criticism. The philosophical aspect of this criticism is, for Nietzsche, the distorting effect of the doctrines of idealism upon the thought and practice of the West. It is because Nietzsche takes Plato as an idealist, or pythagorizing doctrinemonger, that he can baldly equate "Greek philosophy" with "the decadence of the Greek instinct."18

Lovers of Thucydides can take Nietzsche's use of him as an antidote to anti-realism (idealism) to be a reinforcement of, rather than an antithesis to, the deflationary brush-strokes of Plato's allusive satire. In this section of "What I Owe to the Ancients," Thucydides (I would say) should not to be so fully identified with the Sophists, although he possessed all their techniques. This is because his history lets us see both the nature of, and the tragic, long-range consequences of the Sophistic mode of speech and thought in political life.19 Secondly, it is only a "fact" within the pythagorizing tradition of the transmission of Plato, that Plato "got his schooling from the Egyptians." For, in this tradition there is a practice of creating facts by consensus and repetition. There is no good historical or documentary evidence for the claim, outside of the platonist interpretation of the dialogues and the spurious epistles attributed to Plato by members or friends of the pythagorized Academy.20

That Nietzsche takes the "philosophers" as "the decadents of Greek culture" (TI 3), follows from his interpretation of Plato and the Postsocratics as all of them idealists, and of Aristotle as a pure theorist. But Plato's Socrates was inductive, interrogative, skeptical, antidogmatic and in that sense anti-systematic. He is a practitioner of, or apprentice to, the new conceptualist mode of thought, as Havelock has independently and more fully shown in his pioneering works.21 But Plato's Socrates is also a story-teller, poet-quoter, myth-maker, punster, ironic etymologizer and intellectually scrupulous. Meantime the uninterpolated, pre-Peripatetic Aristotle argues against the misapplication of theoretical thinking to practical and productive pursuits. We completely agree, however, with Nietzsche's assessment of Hellenistic philosophy as decadent in specifiable respects.

Nietzsche is not wrong when he asks, "how could one possibly judge the Greeks by their philosophers, as the Germans have done, and use the philistine moralism of the... schools as a clue to what is basically Hellenic?" As far as the Hellenistic schools and the platonists are concerned, the claim hardly needs defending––except from the platonists.22

With regard to Plato and Aristotle, what happened was that the latter was "platonized" during the centuries of the unguarded transmission of his lecture-notes, while the former was "pythagorized" by a jealous and unfree Academy, beginning with Speusippus the Pythagorean who was its first head. Given the greatness of Plato's antidogmatic achievement, Speusippus, as head of a pythagorizing school, had to be doctrinally jealous. And given what can be guessed about his relationship to the Macedonians, the Academy can be assumed to have felt unsafe as a consequence of the Macedonian conquest and the intrigues preceding it.23 Was Aristotle denied the headship of the Academy because he, too, wrote dialogues for publication rather than treatises, and because he would not countenance either the withholding of Plato's dialogues or the dismembering of them for doxographical purposes?

## Nietzsche's Dialectic and Anti-Systematics

Because Nietzsche's Plato is the doctrinal system-builder of the idealist tradition of transmission, Nietzsche has missed the important point that Plato's knowledge is just the kind of knowledge which only the creator of a world can have. Nietzsche had said in The Birth of Tragedy (sec.5) that this is the only kind of knowledge which does not fail in the human struggle for self-definition in the face of death and nihilistic pessimism. For, doctrines come and doctrines go; but the worlds of art endure. On the other hand, Nietzsche does seem to have read the Apology and the Symposium for themselves; for, it is from these works that he abstracts the traits of the Socrates whom he admires.1

Nietzsche, as we know, nominated Plato's Symposium as his Lieblingsdichtung, or favorite poetry, at the time of his graduation from Schulpforta.2 Nietzsche also says that

> Plato seems to have received the decisive thought as to how a philosopher ought to behave toward men from the apology of Socrates: as their physician, as a gadfly on the neck of man.3

About Plato's dialogue the Apology he says, in the same lecture-series, it is "a masterpiece of the highest rank." Note the lack of a distinction, in the quotation, between the judicial defense of the historical Socrates and the dialogue by Plato. Is this enough to suggest that Nietzsche's conception of himself as a philosopher, at this time, is partly derived from the Socrates of the Apology and Symposium? W. Kaufmann adduces as evidence of the possibility that Nietzsche did start, about 1873, an "untimely reflection" on "The Philosopher as the Physician of Culture."4

It does become clear that Nietzsche thought of this Socrates as a social or cultural critic like himself. Significantly Nietzsche also said about the Apology, "Some ancient writings one reads to understand antiquity: others... are such that one studies antiquity in order to be able to read them. To these belongs the Apology" (XVI, 6 Musarion ed.). And in The Wanderer and his Shadow he says that Socrates was superior to Jesus in intelligence and "by virtue of that joyful style of seriousness and roguish wisdom that goes to make up the best state of the human soul" (aphorism 86, The Wanderer and his Shadow).5

Now, though Nietzsche says many things in derogation of the dialectic as a tool of understanding, his reader has to register that Nietzsche himself engages in what are legitimate dialectical practices. This is important because recognition of the senses in which he is dialectical will be of the greatest help in completing our grasp of Nietzsche's attitude to "Socrates." Like the dialogical Plato in this respect, the aphoristic Nietzsche is a great anti-systematist to whom other philosophers perversely persist in ascribing a system in their own doctrinal or deductivist sense of "system." Thus, we shall find that Nietzsche is not dialectical in the pursuit of system, like Hegel or Schopenhauer. He is, rather, dialectical in the heuristic or Socratic sense of a discursive searcher.

A basic reason for which Nietzsche rejected system-building, is that he wished always to remain free to question his own premises. And this is just what the systematic thinker cannot do, since the system derives from his premises, and these are self-evident to him or, else, below the threshold of his awareness. Nietzsche saw the refusal to question one's own premises as plain intellectual corruption. So he says in part I of The Twilight of the Idols (aph. 26), "the will to a system is a lack of integrity; and "building systems is childishness."

> The will to a system: in a philosopher, morally speaking, a subtle corruption, a disease of the character; amorally speaking, his will to appear more stupid than he is.... I am not bigoted enough for a system––not even for my system.6

It is not just the poverty of deductivism that troubles Nietzsche, but the fact that (non-corrigibilist) belief in systematics blocks inquiry. Systems, instead of questioning presuppositions, seek to extend themselves to cover new phenomena. And this is what makes the systematist look more "stupid" than he really is. As he says of Hegel in the Untimely Meditations, the systematist lets "concepts, opinions, things past and books come between himself and things."7 So Nietzsche is dialectical in the fallibilist sense that he is a searcher after, and questioner of, presuppositions, hidden or revealed.8

A thinker who is alert about his own unnoticed assumption-making will, in principle at least, be more ready to enter into the presuppositions of other systems. So that (i), when he comes to criticize them, he is less in danger of making externalist criticisms of other people's thought. But (ii), in observing an alien system from within, the dialectician can the better categorize its spiritual weaknesses and its rhetorical or historical strengths. And this is the dialectical strength of Nietzsche's ongoing categorization of Platonism, of Christianity and the phenomena of proselytization and priesthood. His critique of Christianity is that of an insider, as is his critique of idealism. But in the case of Plato, as we are iterating, Nietzsche's critique is not internal to the works because these are dialogues, and his approach to them is not dialogical. He has run afoul of the pythagorizing miscategorization of Plato's project, not seen its self-serving purpose, and identified Plato with "platonism," namely, with pythagorism enriched by its doxographical looting of the dialogues.

Another sense in which Nietzsche is dialectical has already been noticed: that in which he uses antithetically extreme formulations in order to explore for the truth that may be found between them. It is also dialectical of Nietzsche, when dealing with cultural products that harmonize conflictive constituents, to begin his analysis by isolating out the dynamic components most opposed to each other in such complexes. And this is what he has so brilliantly done in the case of Greek tragedy.

In Dawn 195, Nietzsche understands dialectics to be "the fencing-art of conversation," as in the original Greek sense of dialegesthai "to converse together." This sense must remain primary, I would suggest, if we are to keep track of all the later meanings of "dialectics" and their interrelations. Nietzsche's contrast of dialectics with Christian short-cuts to perfection (Dawn 59), straightforwardly identifies dialectics with the hard, inductive road to truth. This is the sense in which the questioning Socrates, who is also often Nietzsche's Socrates, is dialectical: he does not impose solutions to problems on others, but shows them both what they have presupposed and that they do not know what they thought they knew.

Nietzsche rejects dialectic in the mystical, that is, nihilistic, sense in which "Plato," that is, platonism, asserts it to be "the way of attaining the divine being and getting behind the veil of appearance" (Dawn 196). Since Plato deals only in the dramatization of the assertions and counter-assertions of arguers "dialectically" engaged, he does not assert anything in his own voice. But Nietzsche ascribes the discovery of dialectics in the narrow rationalistic sense, to Socrates (Dawn 544).

Here, dialectics is anti-custom; it is "the antithetical magic" which works by identifying "cause and effect," ground and consequence." It is in its equation with anti-intuitive, anti-poetic and "anti-sensory" (Dawn 43) rationalism that Nietzsche disapproves of Socrates' dialectical activity, as he calls it. This is the sense in which to be dialectical is to follow the guidance of the abstract ideas of platonism. But notice that, at "Republic" 511 and 532, when Socrates contrasts, on the Divided Line, the section containing the mathematical objects with the next higher level––which is a "dialectical" level because it must question the assumptions made at lower levels––he is, by implication, telling the Pythagoreans that they do not question their own mathematicist assumptions. And he is ironically goading them to do this by offering them the chance or ideal of reaching, thereby, an unconditional first principle.9

In this same aphorism 43 of Dawn, Nietzsche suggests that as we have become more self-conscious about knowledge, its pursuit and the conditions under which it can be achieved, it becomes clear that what "the thinker needs" is "imagination, self-uplifting, abstraction, desensualization, invention, presentiment, induction, dialectics, deduction, the critical faculty, the assemblage of material, the impersonal mode of thinking, contemplativeness, and not least, justice and love for all that exists." He also suggests that it is when these means to knowledge are mistaken for final ends, that the contemplative life (vita contemplativa) is mistakenly equated with happiness. And this, we have to realize, is very Socratic of Nietzsche. For, by being himself dialectical here, he has both undermined an influential Christian ideal and exposed another dimension of the theoreticism that, as we know, derives from the pythagorizing platonism which has gotten between Nietzsche and his kindred spirit the dialogical Plato.

In The Birth of Tragedy Nietzsche had identified Socrates' love of knowledge (in the narrow sense) as a "sublime metaphysical delusion" which must have been operative in Athenian culture even prior to Socrates (sec. 14, 15). He adds that "Socrates" himself must have felt "a void, half a reproach, a possibly neglected duty" in connection with his neglect of music and poetry. The reference here (which Nietzsche does not give) has to be to the passage in the Phaedo in which it appears that Plato's Socrates has composed some verses and a hymn since he was imprisoned (60D). Socrates tells Kebes that he composed the verses not to excel poetically, but to make sure he had fully obeyed a frequent dream in which the Muses enjoined him to "make it your business to compose poetry and music" (mousikeên poiei kai ergazou). Nietzsche continues, "The voice of the Socratic dream vision is the... sign of... misgivings about the limits of logic:" perhaps "what is not intelligible [in so many words] to him is not necessarily unintelligent. Perhaps there is a realm of wisdom from which the logician is exiled? Perhaps art is... a necessary correlative of... science."

These statements, we note, aren't just interpretive; they are also Nietzsche's own beliefs. But as long as we have reference to Plato's Socrates dialogically understood, we must remember that he uses logic, just as he uses the poets. To be sure, there were not yet any logicians to satirize; there were only the mathematicist or numerological Pythagoreans whom he admonishes in the dialogues with the gentler irony which he reserves for them. And we have already invited the reader to go back to the dialogues and see for himself how Socrates' art of conversation (his "dialectic") consists not only of logic and paralogic, of question and answer, but of poet-quoting, story-telling, parabolizing and myth-making, antilogizing, etymologizing and all kinds of word-play. Note too that Nietzsche has qualified his intellectual history by allowing, here, that "Socrates" was merely "an unprecedentedly magnificent" expression of the narrower, anti-Dionysan rationalism, rather than its inventor.

Nietzsche is suggesting that, because Socrates was so honest and thorough in his questioning, "knowledge" as he examines it can be seen to be humanly insufficient and to require complementing by art. Plato's Socrates died, in other words, not for knowledge in the narrow sense but for the sake of freedom inquiry. For, as we have been showing, this Socrates lived in pursuit of enlightenment not "science;" and, as Nietzsche says, "his mission" was "to make existence appear comprehensible and thus justified." But as, in the end, "reasons do not suffice, myth has to come to their aid." So Nietzsche advances the historical paradox that Socrates, as conceptualist, is "one turning point... of world history." For if Socrates had not served "knowledge" so faithfully, the West would now (i) not love knowledge in the narrow sense, or have the goods that flow from it, and (ii) not know that art is an indefensible human necessity, because science cannot by itself be enough.

We are thus obliged to articulate how Nietzsche can, on one hand, condemn the conceptualist Socrates as anti-life but, on the other, praise him as "the first philosopher of life" (Lebensphilosoph),10 as he does in his lectures on pre-Platonic philosophy. Here, Nietzsche pairs Socrates, the ever-seeking sage, with Herakleitos, the lonely discoverer of pregnant truths (sec. 10). He also emphasizes how powerful the passions were that Socrates had to contend with in his nature. Against this, however, Nietzsche insists that "... he wanted death," just as he does later in Twilight of the Idols (Probl. of Socr. 1). And Nietzsche insists on this both in his interpretation of what he calls "Socrates'" apology, and in that of Plato's dialogues Apology and Phaedo. Notice again the failure to discriminate between Plato's Socrates and the historical Socrates.

But before questioning Nietzsche's interpretation of the Apology, let us quote his interpretive paraphrase of the relevant moment in the Phaedo. He has just made the Schopenhauerian point that "the wisest men of all ages have judged" that "[life] is not good." He adds:

> Even Socrates said, as he died: 'To live––that means to be sick a long time: I owe Asclepius the Savior a rooster.' Even Socrates was tired of it.

This is the interpretation that sees in Socrates' discourse to the јury a suicidal "affront to the court," as G. Grote called it.11 It is reinforced by the insidious fictions of Xenophon's Defense, even for libertarian and liberal admirers of Socrates such as Grote, Nietzsche's older contemporary. One reason for this was a wide, but by no means unchallenged, agreement about Xenophon's value as a historical source. But Xenophon's propagandistic Defense is no more a historical account than Plato's dramatization in the Apology. Because the former is less fully achieved as a work-of-art than Plato's, it is easier to uncover the ideology in Xenophon's counter-effort, as I have pointed out elsewhere.12

As it bears upon the Apology, the dramatic purpose of the aptly designed run-in with Anytus in the Meno (89E-95A), was (i) to show how angry a powerful opportunist could get with those who taught the public how to question authority, and (ii) to show why Anytus cannot distinguish between Socrates' ethical refutativeness and the professionalist hustling of the Sophists. The Sophists were a threat because of their skepticism, and because their defense of specialized expertise delegitimated Anytus's claim to leadership, which was based on wealth alone. Socrates' ethical consistency was a threat because, if generally adopted, it would have made politics as practiced by Anytus impossible.

Socrates' ethical consistency is highlighted by the account, in Apology 32B-E, of his resistance to the unjust motion of the hysterical Assembly to execute the generals after the losses at Arginusae, and of his resistance to the unjust order of the Thirty tyrants to arrest Leon of Salamis. The contrast with Anytus's opportunist switching from support, earlier in the decade, of Theramenes' oligarchism to his current support of the democrats could not be greater. It is brought to the public's and the reader's consciousness by Socrates' rehearsal, at this point in the trial, of his just responses to the contradictory orders of oligarchs and democrats. The јury at least is not allowed to forget, in the fiction of the Apology, who Anytus is and how sordid was the verbal and real coinage with which he has predisposed it to go against Socrates.

These points have to be rehearsed if we are to understand Socrates' attitude in the Apology. The history of Anytus, whose doings as a successful briber of a whole јury were notorious, provides the reason for the explicit allusions, at 29C, 31 A and 36 A, of Socrates to Anytus's effect upon the јury. Together with Meletus and Lycon, Anytus has arranged to obtain, through the trial, either the exile or the silencing of Socrates or, else, the death penalty for him. The design of the dialogue leads us to see that the magnificent old gadfly (myôps) Socrates has seized the opportunity to change this seeming disaster into a no-lose alternative, as follows.

He must either be condemned to die with a marmorealized reputation for consistency, courage and human excellence; or, he must be acquitted by the Athenians, and so sanctioned in his pursuit of enlightenment and the exposure of sordid reasoners. This is why he can come to the trial as coolly as to one of his daily discussions in the Agora. He could only have begged his life from the јury at the price of both inconsistency and silence in the future. For, it was his position that a good man, who pleads extenuating circumstances, only degrades himself and should be condemned because such pleading makes him appear guilty of what he hasn't done; it also makes him appear afraid of the death one must sometimes risk to do his duty (34C-D).

Since Socrates senses and the reader is understood to see, in the Apology, that he has been condemned in advance by the manipulation of his public image, Socrates had nothing to lose by addressing the јury in his usual tone of reflective admonition and obstetric mediation. As it is, his discourse falls only 30 or, else, 3 votes short of deconditioning a biased јury of over five hundred (according to how read the manuscripts: gamma being equal to 3, in Greek, and gamma' to 30)! It is no wonder that Plato's Socrates considers nothing less than the recognized honor of free meals in the Prytaneum as equivalent compensation for giving up his chance of certain fame. Under the alternative-penalty option given to defendants found guilty in capital cases, this was a suggestion that would not be an insult to Socrates' own sense of justice and is an exemplification of it (36D-37B): namely, it is a recognition of the civic usefulness of his philosophic mission, for the short remainder of his life, in exchange for the universal fame after death that was sure to embarrass the Athenians if they did not acquit him.

We can say, then, that neither Nietzsche nor Grote are right to see in the attitude of Plato's Socrates a conveniently suicidal or world-weary intent. Such an attitude is to be found, by would-be cunning implication, only in Xenophon's Defense of Socrates. So it is by the illegitimate conflation of a literary work-of-art (Plato's) with a literary work-of-ideology that this example of Plato-interpretation comes up with a suicidal "Socrates." And it can do so because the conventional tradition of Plato-interpretation has never adequately insisted on the differences between the diverse "Socrates" who are the distinct products of different authors, or on the difference between these and the historical Socrates. We conclude that the Socrates of Plato's dialogues is, at least, exempted from Nietzsche's objection to the "unwisdom" of "philosophers]" who "see a problem in the value of life."13

## Plato's Socrates Was Not a Twilit Idol

We notice in aphorism 3 of Twilight that Nietzsche anachronistically applies the Roman term "plebs" to the Socrates who lived at the height of the classical age of Greece. In making so much that is negative out of the reputed bad looks of Socrates, Nietzsche also lapses from the anti-philistine's knowledge that surface ugliness does not in fact prevail over spiritual beauty. Since Nietzsche seems to believe that Socrates' charm or charisma was genuine, we note further that, in doing this, Nietzsche has missed a chance to score points against the Philistinism that is otherwise his constant target. Whatever may be said of the several unsorted Socrates extant in the tradition, it is certainly the case that in Plato's dialogues the real charm of Socrates is clearly established, by his interlocutors, as overriding the surface ugliness.

It is also the case that Plato's Socrates, dialogically understood, transcends the class distinctions that might or might not be applicable to classical Athens. For, in the accounts given by Laches (Laches 181A8) and Alcibiades (Symposium 220–221) of Socrates' military service, he appears to be functioning as a hoplite, that is, as a heavy-armed infantryman. And the military classification of hoplites was drawn, not from the "lowest," or economically poorest, class (the thêtês) but from that which could afford its own heavy armor.

Let us look next at Nietzsche's equation, in aphorism 4 of Twilight, between "the hypertrophy of the logical faculty" and what he calls "Socrates' decadence." Nietzsche assumes that the hypertrophy corresponds to the anarchy of Socrates' powerful instincts. Is it the "exaggerated" nature of this dynamic match that is decadent? I would say not, since what it results in is a character larger than life rather than one that is decadent. So, it must be the sarcasm which results from his logical hypertrophy that is decadent; or else it is the concealedness or "subterranean" nature of Socrates' idiosyncracies, that Nietzsche thinks is decadent. But how can a deeply complicated character, who is larger than life, be decadent––even if he, as a married man, inhabits the world of comedy and is sarcastic (Genealogy III.7)? Is the auditory hypersensitivity, which Nietzsche attributes to him and which expresses itself as Socrates' daimôn, decadent because it has been interpreted religiously? The daimôn of Plato's Socrates is, on the contrary, acted on by Socrates himself in a spirit of philosophic scruple, even when he ironically allows his auditors to interpret it religiously if they want to. So, is it not a contradiction or a non-sequitur to call this Socrates "rachitic?"

If this is so, does not this composite of Nietzsche's imagination entirely escape the accusation of "decadent?" We have to conclude (i) that the predicate is properly attachable only to what Nietzsche calls the hypertrophy of the logical faculty, his real target, and (ii) that it is a development in culture-history which Nietzsche is attacking rather than the composite "Socrates" which he thinks illustrates it. For, we find that while Plato's Socrates is good at logic-chopping, he is just as good at poet-quoting, fabulating, attitude-fitting, telling stories, leading people on, and playing with words in all the dialogues in which he is the main speaker. And this, in turn, indicates that Nietzsche's idea of the historical Socrates leaves out just the imaginative, playful and ironic traits which Plato's Socrates abundantly illustrates in the dialogues. Thus, it has to be the historical Socrates that Nietzsche is blaming as the prototypical advancer of conceptualist thinking and logicalism.

But Nietzsche had praised Socrates, in The Birth of Tragedy, for being a passionate and honest pusher of logicalism. This "honesty" stands in contrast to the lack of it in the Sophists and demagogic users of Sophistic rhetoric, like Cleon. But the evidence for the ethicality of Socrates' use of logic and paralogic is, all of it, locatable only in Plato's dialogues (unless this ethicality was also true of the historical Socrates, in whose case we cannot verify it). By "passionate" Nietzsche here means consistent and inspiredly persistent; by "honest" I mean concerned with the good of his interlocutor or auditors.

So what Nietzsche is puzzled by is what he calls "that Socratic equation of reason, virtue, and happiness... which is opposed to all the instincts of the earlier Greeks (Twilight, Probl. of Socr. 4). Nietzsche means "reason" in the scientistic sense here, and he does not spell out what he means by "virtue," the standard inadequate translation of aretê (human excellence). What we have to question is whether the equation is not, rather, semi-Socratic or sophistic than truly Socratic. The inspired Socrates of Plato's dialogues is not so much concerned with happiness as he is with the interrogative pursuit of knowledge and enlightenment. And when he says that a good man, someone who possesses aretê, cannot be made unhappy, this Socrates does not mean "virtue" in our narrower, moralistic sense.

By aretê he means "human excellence" in its original sense of an inclusive competence. And this is the meaning that we can still find in Aristotle, properly understood, when the latter says that a kind of aretê is necessary for happiness (N. Eth. X. viii). Classical aretê is the excellence of the whole human individual, not the other-worldly notion of "virtue" that was to be found in some of the new religions. Aristotle's view in the Ethics was that only that individual who, with practice and reflection, can construct himself into a good self, will be capable of an excellent life, a life judged to be happy.14 The aretê which Plato's Socrates exemplifies, and talks about in various moods, includes courage, temperance, knowledgeability and justness. What this Socrates says, in the Apology (41D), is that no evil can get to a good man, and that an unjust and wicked person is unhappy (Gorgias 470E).

Finally, if it is Plato's Socrates whom we are talking about, we cannot allow that it is reason in the narrow sense that he exercises in the dialogues. For this Socrates not only tests the theory of ideas whenever he can, and improves upon it in testing or using it; he not only asks assertive questions and fights the Sophists, he also tells ingenious stories. He constructs apt myths, is good at metaphor and quotes the poets, whom he knows but persistently teases no less than15 he knows and teases the Pythagoreans, whose doctrines he is presented as understanding better than they do. Nor should we fail to reflect that, in what I call Socrates' testing of the theory of ideas in the dialogues, he and his interlocutor repeatedly fail to come up with what the theory (in any version) desiderates or presupposes, namely, satisfactory essentialist definitions of important ideas: that of knowledge in the Theaetetus, of beauty in the Hippias Major, of piety in the Euthyphro, of courage in the Laches and of justice in the "Republic." Doesn't this show, in the case of Socrates' "imaginative rationality" as we may call it, that he has implicit doubts about the theory of ideas rather than that he believes it literally? It's as if he was always hoping it will work in yielding clear definitions, but it never does.

On this basis Plato's Socrates could even be taken as either exhibitively illustrating for us the weakness of the hyperlogical theory of ideas or, else, as having himself the right to some doubts about it. Nietzsche would thus have to approve of Plato's Socrates as already doing the same thing that Nietzsche does in his own writings, namely, putting on exhibit what the defects are of excessive logicality. But Nietzsche's intellectual history is, on the whole, not wrong in aphorism 5 of "The Problem of Socrates," when he says that "Greek taste changes" in the time of Socrates, "in favor of dialectics... with dialectics the plebs come to the top." The culture, as we now know, was still oral and dialectical in the minimal sense that communicative interactions were dialogical. When Socrates' contemporaries, the competitive Sophists, added the techniques of refutation and rationalization, namely, of antilogistic reasoning, to the discursive arsenal of the Athenians, not only argumentation but speech-making became more "logical" for the same reasons that they became more Sophistic.

So it is the Sophists as much as "Socrates" who are turning the questioning of authority and the questioning of belief into an institution in democratic Athens. In tandem with this development, we know that the dêmos (not the "plebs") had surfaced as politically important during the century-and-a-half of classical Athens. Since it was the Sophistic speech-makers who prided themselves on being able to handle the correspondingly "sophistic beast of the multitude" ("Rep." 493A-E), and since Plato's Socrates explicitly repudiates the art of "playing to the gallery" (Protag. 317C-D), it is rather the Sophists than this Socrates who qualify for Nietzsche's apellation of them as "buffoons who got themselves taken seriously." That they were taken seriously is proved by the amount of money they made at it. That some of them were buffoons, Plato himself shows us by staging an encounter between two of them and Socrates in the Euthydemus. But that they were not all buffoons, but sometimes very clever, is shown by Platos' Protagoras as well as by the Sophist and Politicus. The rhetorical Sophist from Elea, in the latter dialogues, is even allowed to suggest (as he plays to the gallery) that people who (like Socrates) do not take pay in exchange for exemplary disputation, are "garrulous fools." We have to ask, does Nietzsche really want to be on the side of the Sophists in calling Socrates a buffoon?

Nietzsche grants that Socrates was not atypical, at this point in Athenian history, with respect to the powerful anarchy of his instincts. In aphorism 9 of "The Problem of Socrates," he perceives that Athenian culture as a whole had come to need the counter-force or tyranny of reason (in the narrow sense) over instincts that were no longer noble. Thus, "Socrates understood that all the world needed him" and his dialectical talents. What Socrates brought that was appealing to the new dialectical game of the Sophists was, first of all, agonism, the sense of it as a real and worthwhile contest not divorcible from the erotic dimension of life (aph.8). He could do this, in Nietzsche's perception, because he was both "a great erotic" and "master over himself." To be the latter, to survive spiritually, he had to become a fanatic of rationality in the narrow sense (aph. 10). And this is what led to the counter-extreme in which reason becomes moralistic, because fanatic and "absurdly rational." In a culture where "every[one] was within five paces of excess," the only remedy was to "imitate Socrates." One had to be "clever, clear, bright at any price: any concession to the instincts, to the unconscious, leads downward."

This analysis fits the anthropological understanding that instinct and passion come to be feared, in the transition from tribal to civic society, because tribal control over them is dissolving. This is why reason, or the authority of reason, has to be used to control the instincts. While the rationalist cure, says Nietzsche in aphorism 11, made Socrates look like a savior, this "faith in reason at any price" is itself decadent and will not extricate us from decadence. This is because it is "without instinct, in opposition to the instincts." To counter-act an instinctual force, only another instinctual force will avail. Socrates could become master of himself because his instinct for reason took the form of an authentic human passion (Birth of Tr. sec. 15). But because most people do not achieve this authenticity, rationality becomes a morality of imposed improvement, fanaticism or tyranny. "To have to fight the instincts," concludes Nietzsche, "that is the formula of decadence: as long as life is ascending, happiness equals instinct."

If the above, so far, is an acceptable clarification of Nietzsche's thought, then we have to grant that some of his formulations about Socrates have an unedited penumbra to them. It is not just Plato's Socrates who begins to escape Nietzsche's strictures against positivism and neoplatonism; it is his own composite of Socrates that does so. For, how can the latter be decadent if he is also "master over himself"? Nietzsche must mean that he is a delusory model for those who, in non-tribal society, cannot rise to Socrates instinctualization (so to call it) of the urgent need for clarity and control while holding also to his kind of consistent, existential moderation. It is these who are the decadents and who will, by definition, be imposed upon.

And how can Socrates, if he is the "great master of irony" Nietzsche says he is, be decadent or in fact "absurdly rational?" The dialogical study of Plato's Socrates shows us how a judicious modulation of logical ability with wit and humor, with story-telling, imagination and irony, makes this Socrates the exemplar of a rationality that is not absurd in its narrowness, but is healthy because it is attentive to the human need for art and play. The climate of opinion and the consensus of nineteenth-century philologists inhibited Nietzsche from taking this Socrates to his bosom, and allowed him to recover only a glimpse of his rich possibilities.

Nietzsche does see Socrates' irony, in aphorism 7, as an expression of revolt. But he fears it might be a symptom of ressentiment rather than the creative, because moderated, rebelliousness which it is in Plato's Socrates. He fears it is plebeian, when it could just as well be seen as the means to a humanly egalitarian, proportionate or fair-dealing responsiveness to every kind of interlocutor or person: Sophist or senior (Kephalos), clever (Protagoras) or not (Hippias, Theodorus), earnest (Ion, Euthyphro) or cynical (Philebos), handsome (Phaedrus, Charmides, Alcibiades) or not (Theaetetus, Socrates the younger), overbearing (Meno) or docile (Protarchos). Nietzsche, like Kallicles in the Gorgias (495), does hint at Socrates' "foxiness" in aphorism 6. But, in Plato's Socrates, it is not mere attitude-fitting; it could also be an ethical kind of responsiveness that could only be called "vengeful" or "repellent" (aph. 7, 8) by the list of Socrates' enemies that begins with Anytus.

Finally, we must note that Plato's Socrates can be said to have an "improvement-morality" akin to Christianity (aph. 11), only if (i) he is violently assimilated to neoplatonism on (ii) pythagorizing assumptions external to the dialogues, and only by (iii) dismantling the integrity of the dialogues as dialogues.16 About the claim, in aphorism 12, that "Socrates wanted to die," we have already said that it is Xenophon, not Plato, who presents him as wanting to. Nor does Plato present Socrates in the dialogues as a "self-outwitter." He is always in command of himself in the dialogues, though he can get angry, as when he shames the companions in the Phaedo into holding back their tears and letting him die in silence. And he is, of course, susceptible to erotic shock, as in the Phaedrus or Charmides. Plato's Socrates is, rather, the outwitter and circumventer of sordid reasoners. It is to be noted that when he is mostly silent, as in the two dialogues that feature the Sophist from Elea, the work of exposure is done for the reader through the exhibitive dimension of Plato's architectonic craftsmanship. By this I mean that, by the end of the dialogues, the dialogical reader finds himself in the position of being able to judge for himself the value of the discourses and reasonings which he has been led through.

Nietzsche read the Phaedo, or passages therefrom, as a schoolboy in Pforta, as part of the last stage in the learning of Greek, under a teacher named Karl Steinhart. Skeptical as he became after graduating from Schulpforta, would he have come easily to a similar appreciation of a dialogue taught literally as offering several "proofs" (paramuthia, pistis, mean "reassurance" and "faith" respectively; 70Bf.) of the immortality of the soul? See chapter 2 of Plato's Dialogues One by One, "Plato's Tragic Humor." The documentation is in R. Bohley's "Über die Landesschule zur Pforte." in Nietzsche Studien Band 5 (1976). His Greek courses there went from Jacob's Griech. Lesebuch, Xenoph. Anabasis, Arrian Anab., and Homer (Odyss. XVII-XVIII) and Herodotus (VI-VIII) to Sophocles (Ajax). Demosthenes and Plato's Phaedo. Compositions. as was the custom, were in Latin; Nietzsche's credits in Latin came to a total of 63, in Greek to 36.

On the Tyranny of "Reason"

## "Rationalism" and "Morality," Reason and Nature

Nietzsche's attack on the philosophers' narrow sense of "reason" is, among other things, an attack on their habit of de-historicizing whatever subject they deal with. "They think they show their respect for a subject when they de-historicize it, sub specie eterni," Nietzsche says in "Reason in Philosophy" (Twilight). With the philosophers' decision that "whatever becomes does not have being," the attack on history and change becomes an attack on the senses. This is because philosophers now believed in being, but never succeeded in grasping it. So the senses are accused of a deception that keeps being from their logicist grasp. "These senses," they say, "which are so immoral in other ways too, deceive us concerning the true world.... let us free ourselves from the deception of the senses, from becoming, from history, from lies; history is nothing but faith in the senses, faith in lies."

Herakleitos knew better: in stating that there is only becoming, he earned Nietzsche's respect. For "when the rest of the philosophic folk rejected the testimony of the senses because they showed multiplicity and change, he rejected their testimony because they showed things as if they had permanence and unity." But since this also does the senses an injustice, Nietzsche has to conclude that it is what reason (in the narrow sense)makes of the testimony of the senses that is "the cause of our falsification of the testimony of the senses." However, since the apparent world of becoming, passing away, and change is the only world, Herakleitos was right to believe that "being is an empty fiction." The "true" world of the philosophers, whether Pythagorean, idealist or scientistic, is a superaddition and a fiction.

A related idiosyncrasy of the rationalist philosophers is to confuse the last with the first.1 The "highest concepts... the most general, the emptiest concepts" which, if they come at all "come at the end," are placed "in the beginning as the beginning." Nietzsche verbalizes the taboo: "the higher may not grow out of the lower, may not have grown at all." The highest must be the cause of itself.

So far so good; but when he says, "origin out of something else is considered an objection, a questioning of value," we must stop to note that this claim is a Hellenistic belief that should not be ascribed to the thinkers of the classical and archaic ages of Greece. The latter did not believe that what there is had a beginning, or that anything could come out of nothing. But cosmologizing Eleatics of the second generation after Parmenides, some Sophists and all pythagorizers can be found maintaining, contrary to Parmenides himself, (i) that what there is is not in some sense, and (ii) that our changing temporal world must have had its origin in something changeless and timeless.

The prejudice of "reason" (in favor of unity, identity, permanence, substance, cause, thinghood, being) is reinforced, says Nietzsche in aphorism 5, by the similar presuppositions of speech. For speech, in addition, fetishizes these artifacts of consciousness. Speech believes in the ego as being, as substance, and it projects substance upon all things. "Everywhere 'being' is projected by thought, pushed underneath, as the cause." Anticipating by 50 years B. Russell's remark about the light the study of grammar can throw on philosophical problems,2 Nietzsche says, "I am afraid we are not rid of God because we still have faith in grammar." Like the Indians in this, we believe "we must once have been divine, for we have reason!"

Nietzsche is led to conclude that the idea of the "true world," such as that posited by the pythagorizing platonists, should be abolished as useless, superfluous, refuted and decadent. We mustn't, however, forget

> That the artist esteems appearance higher than reality, is no objection to this proposition. For 'appearance' in this case means reality once more, only by way of selection, reinforcement and correction. The tragic artist is no pessimist: he is precisely the one who says Yes to everything questionable, even to the terrible-he is Dionysan.

Abolishing the "true" world, Nietzsche has to add, naturally abolishes the apparent one; it disappears along with the erroneous distinction. With the end of this error, Nietzsche triumphantly adds, incipit Zarathustra: here begins the visionary, poetic and ironic, mode of perception which uses language without being misled by it, and which can cope with the tragic aspect of human existence without succumbing to pessimism.

Fully to appreciate the depth-psychological accuracy of Nietzsche's aphorism about "morality as anti-nature," we should remember that his Socrates was said in The Birth of Tragedy to have "spiritualized" his passion for logical reason, to have "instinctualized" this kind of reason in himself. We must also keep in mind that Nietzsche's Socrates is a master of moderation. Taken in this spirit, the six aphorisms of this section of Twilight are not only effective as an analysis of the hostility to life of Christianity but are an equally effective rejection of the platonist (or literalist) reading of the anti-erotic story told by Socrates' Diotima in Plato's Symposium. The church, Nietzsche says, seeks to excise and destroy passion instead of using it: instead of asking "how can one spiritualize, beautify, deify a craving," it: tries to suppress the desire entirely.

Nietzsche's use of "spiritualize" and "deify" in this context, we note, accidentally parallels Diotima's description of procreation as a "sacred matter" (Symp. 206C). I say accidentally because it is clear to me that Socrates' is using his Diotima just so as to be able to propose, to his audience of erotics, that they can do entirely without sex, if only they will learn to contemplate the idea of beauty in its stead! "An attack on the roots of passion," says Nietzsche, "means an attack on the roots of life: the practice of the Church is hostile to life." So is the discipline of Diotima, if taken literally or platonistically. But on a dialogical reading, this is not what Plato's Socrates is recommending. Rather he is responding agonistically, with an equally clever and farfetched intellectualist story about love, to Aristophanes' far-fetched comic myth about love and what it can do for us.

If the erotics can believe that love makes us twice the persons we are, then they can also give credence to Diotima's talk about total abstinence as a remedy for the pains of love. To take Aristophanes' myth less seriously than the story of Socrates' mantic (and sophistic) woman from Mantinea, is just as wrong a reading as not to take her story to be as comic a proposal, to its auditors, as Aristophanes'. Not sensuousness suppressed, but passion spiritualized is called love by Nietzsche in aphorism 3.

We must also spiritualize hostility, and not suppress the enemy as Christianity once sought to do. Only when creativity is in opposition, Nietzsche says, does it feel itself necessary. The risk of not being in opposition is that we become complacent and cease to transcend conditions. The only kind of "peace of soul" Nietzsche allows in this aphorism is the kind that "is the expression of maturity and mastery in the midst of doing, creating, working and willing-calm breathing, achieved 'freedom of the will'." He is so earnest about this that he allows himself a self-reflective doubt about the kind of calm he gets from calling his critique of decadence the Twilight of the Idols. The pay-off for this tolerance and spiritualization of conflict, he implies, is that even the "internal enemy," our demons and conflicts, become material for creativity.

This resonates with Nietzsche's insistence upon remaining free to question or revise his own presuppositions. We are bound to remark that it bears on what Nietzsche missed in Plato, the dramatic composer of communicative interactions. For, had Nietzsche stopped to look at the dialogue-form in Plato as such, rather than talk as he did only about dialogue in general, he would have perceived that the dialogue-form is a design that allows its user to remain unbound by the assumptions of the arguments or sets of arguments he is bringing into confrontation within his dialogues. We find, again, that Plato, the ironic composer of dialogues, and Nietzsche, the ironic poet-philosopher, arc not at odds. Each works at philosophy by exploiting his chosen literary medium, whether the aphorism or the dialogue-as-encounter.

Just as in aphorism 5 Nietzsche allows that an antilife morality is still a form of life, so we must concede that his equations implicitly allow that the "reason" of the platonist or positivist philosophers is, still, a form of reason. However, the morality of anti-life, "the holy witlessness" of the priest and "the diseased reason" of scientism, are each "only a symptom of one certain kind of life," and "a value judgment of life." As driving parts of a system of life, these aberrations escape questioning by those positing them or living by them.

Thus, because Nietzsche is able to see that the enemy has life, he can also see that in telling their opponents to perish, in denying them the right to live, Christian and scientistic condemners condemn themselves. And we have to remark that Plato, like Nietzsche, can now be seen to have used a literary form that equally enables him to take the measure of systems of value without having to deny them the life they have. By working exclusively in the exhibitive mode, Plato lets arguments and attitudes condemn or commend themselves to the reader, entirely of themselves.

## Man's Fatedness is Existential

Aphorism 8 in "The Four Great Errors" (Twilight) repudiates the philosophic doctrine that there are givens: "no one gives man his qualities-neither God, nor society, nor... himself." Like the classic American philosophers in this, Nietzsche also takes man as firmly embedded in his existential context, as of a piece with what there is. "The fatality of his essence is not to be disentangled from the fatality of all that has been and will be." The concept of "end" is an invented one; "in reality there is no end." So it is absurd, arbitrary, to try to define man in terms of some end.

"One is necessary" says Nietzsche, "one is a piece of fatefulness, one belongs with the whole, one is the whole; there is nothing which could judge... or sentence our being, for that would mean judging... or sentencing the whole." As the reason for this Nietzsche invokes Parmenides' basic insight that "there is nothing besides the whole." To understand this is a "great liberation," because it restores "the innocence of becoming" and relieves us of the need either to seek a first cause or to blame some godhead for the way things are. "We redeem the world" by doing without this idea of God, because it has been "until now the greatest objection to existence." "That nobody is held responsible any longer, that the mode of being may not be traced back to a causa prima, that the world does not form a unity... that alone is a great liberation."

It is also a sound metaphysical insight of Nietzsche's to have reminded us, here, "that the world does not form a unity." For this is the unstated assumption that motivates the illusory search for some all-inclusive purpose to what there is, to existence. Now it is implicit in Parmenides' poem that, because the all is a (grammatical) subject of discourse, it has to be taken as one. And the Goddess in the poem makes it clear that the All is one in the sense that there is nothing else; the All is all there is. As Nietzsche says, "there is nothing besides the whole." So, we see that it does not necessarily follow that the world in the sense of the all is a unity. And this is one of the great points in Buchler's metaphysics of natural complexes, namely, that while the world is distributively exhaustive we should not ascribe a collective integrity to it.3 So, as long as we don't take Parmenides cosmologically, Nietzsche can be said to have benefitted from or rediscovered the insight of the Greek thinker whom Plato's Socrates calls the father of philosophy.

We come to the set of aphorisms which concludes Twilight of the Idols: "What I Owe to the Ancients." When Nietzsche says that his sense of style, of the epigram as a style, was formed by his reading of Sallust, our suggestion is confirmed that there was little in Nietzsche's pedagogic environment that could have cued him into Plato's stylistic versatility, or to a literary or poetic respect for the dialogue-form as such. His sense of style, he confesses, is Roman not Greek.

> To the Greeks I do not by any means owe similarly strong impressions [as to the Romans].

Nietzsche goes so far as to say that "one does not learn from the Greeks" because "their manner is too foreign, and too fluid, to have an imperative, 'classical' effect." By "classical" here, Nietzsche obviously means Roman in the sense of "Augustan." Since he seems, in fact, to have learned how to write from the Romans, he mistakenly, and gratuitously, implies that he could never have learned from a Greek.

As we said earlier, Nietzsche may well have been put off by what was mere, unimplemented lip-service to Plato as a literary master. And, outside of the Apology and the Symposium, he seems not to have read any of the other dialogues for their own sake, or as such. Plato simply is not "boring," as Nietzsche claims, if he is read dialogically and in a text that: does not suppress (as do the translations) the witty allusiveness of the conversational exchanges, or the exhibitive brilliance of their dramatic and ironic structuring. It is the humorless, doxographical or propositional scanning of the dialogues that has turned them into a fountain-head of what is called platonism. And it is platonism, not Plato, that is "so moralistic, so pre-existently Christian."

It is the platonizing idealism about which Plato's Socrates is so playful, and which Plato's Parmenides refutes, that is "the higher swindle," in Nietzsche's harsh words. Given the artistic risks that Plato took in his literary medium, as well as the modesty which has allowed many of his readers to give to "Socrates" the credit that ought to be Plato's, we can easily reject Nietzsche's imputation of spiritual cowardice to Plato. It is Hellenistic Greece, and the idealist tradition which it generated, that "fled into the ideal"-away from the kind of reality that the historian Thucydides had to deal with. But this reality (we cannot refrain from saying) is the very same that Plato, the master of irony, copes with in an even more completely exhibitive way than Thucydides.4

It's interesting that Nietzsche ascribes the competitive, historical destruction of each other by each other of the classic city-states, to the same psychic or instinctual "inner explosives" that he says caused the hypertrophy of Socrates' logicalism (aph.3 "What I Owe"). "I saw," he says, "how all their institutions grew out of preventive measures taken to protect each other against their inner explosives... their] tremendous inward tension." Now, we already found in [chapter I that, in Nietzsche, "the whole phenomenon Plato," or "idealism" actually refers to the Academic or pythagorizing platonism that, in Nietzsche's view prepared the way for Christianity and Western nihilism. In other words, what Nietzsche is deploring, besides pythagorism, in Hellenic culture is not Hellenic but Hellenistic, namely, Syrianized or Alexandrianized Greek culture. It is, thus, the non-poetic, pythagorized Plato and the post-Socratic schools that Nietzsche is including in "the philosophers [who] are the decadents of Greek culture."

In the last two aphorisms of Twilight, Nietzsche repeats that it is his identification of the Dionysan form which the excesses of Greek energy took, that is the key insight needed to understand the distinctive greatness of Greek culture. And he is proud that the historian Burckhardt honored the insight in his lectures on Greek culture.5 But insofar as his otherwise beloved Goethe did not include the Dionysan among "the possibilities of the Greek soul," Goethe, for Nietzsche "did not understand the Greeks."6 The later thinker insists,

> For it is only in the Dionysan mysteries, in the psychology of the Dionysan state, that the basic fact of the Hellenic instinct finds expression, its will to 'life'.

The Dionysan mysteries provided the Hellene with "the triumphant Yes to life" which, in divinizing the mysteries of sexuality, overcomes the disruptions of change and death. In this mystery, pain is helped by being sanctified, "all becoming and growing-all that guarantees a future–– involves pain. That there may be the eternal joy of creating, that the will to life may forever affirm itself, the agony of the woman in labor must also be there eternally," and hallowed. The way to life, the way of generation is holy, says Nietzsche, as he challenges the element of ressentiment in Christianity for throwing "filth on the origin and presupposition of our life," instead of blessing it.

## Nietzsche's Remarks on Aristotle, and the Tragic Sense

Nietzsche says that it was his being able to understand the orgiastic "as an overflowing feeling of life and strength, where even pain still has the effect of a stimulus," that "gave [him] the key to the concept of tragic feeling" (aph.5). But the Aristotle intended here has to be that of the Roman and Renaissance neo-classicists. For, the Greek Aristotle does not say that we go to tragedies "in order to be liberated from terror and pity," or "in order to purge oneself of a dangerous affect by its vehement discharge," as a I have shown in chapter 4 of Art and Human Intelligence and chapter 3 of Modes of Greek Thought. What tragedy does in the original Aristotle is to give form, within a perspective of humanity, to our feelings of compassion and fears about consequences. It does not "purge" us of responsiveness; rather, it purifies the horrible or tragic acts (parricide, incest, fratricide, etc.) of their repulsive quality, by contextualizing them dramatically (i.e. aesthetically) in such a way that they can be looked at and digested with humane intelligence––like ghastly war-wounds in a medical book, or slimy insects in a drawing which, looked at in the original, would be nauseating.

The original Aristotle does fall short of identifying the aesthetic principle at work, here, as Dionysan. Nietzsche is right about tragedy, right that "saying Yes to life even in its strangest and hardest problems, the will to life rejoicing over its own inexhaustibility even in the very sacrifice of its highest types," is the key to understanding tragedy. But the non-neoclassicist Aristotle of the original Poetics says nothing incompatible with this; rather, he provides a basis for being able to say it. It is too bad that the revaluation of all values that Nietzsche says began with The Birth of Tragedy did not include, with its rejection of rationalist neo-classicism, the revaluation of the Poetics that Nietzsche was quite capable of.

Nietzsche ends Twilight by reaffirming his discipleship to Dionysus and saying that he Nietzsche is the teacher of eternal recurrence. Now, this is one of the few places in works which he published that mention "eternal recurrence" explicitly. But he tells us in Ecce Homo that (i) this "doctrine" is not to be taken literally, and that (ii) he has long doubted that Herakleitos held it in the cosmological sense that some Stoics did. "I retained a doubt about Heraclitus in whose company I feel... more cheerful than anywhere else. Saying Yes to the flux and destruction, the decisive element in a Dionysan philosophy, saying Yes to contradiction and strife, becoming, together with the radical rejection of... the concept of 'being'-in this I... acknowledge that which has the closest affinity to my thought so far" (EH on "Birth of Tr." 3).

It is significant, given that Nietzsche had taken Herakleitos too cosmologically in Philosophy in the Tragic Age, that he now says:

> The doctrine of 'eternal recurrence,' that is to say of the unconditional and endlessly repeated circular course of all things––this doctrine of Zarathustra could possibly already have been taught by Heraclitus. At least the Stoa, which inherited almost all its fundamental ideas from Heraclitus, shows traces of it.

Of course the Stoa "shows traces of [the doctrine]": it took Herakleitos cosmologically! And note that Nietzsche says that the doctrine is Zarathustra's, not necessarily his own. The irony in intellectual history here is that, just as Nietzsche took Herakleitos too cosmologically, so his own interpreters are taking what is an injunction in his Lebensphilosophie as a dictum in nature-philosophy.

The injunction to which the last aphorism of Twilight has reference is Dionysan: a good philosophy, like a good tragedy, will not deny the existence of evil. The personal application of this insight consists in affirmatively accepting what there is, including the deficits and contradictions in our lives; so that, had we to live them over in every detail we would, in despite of wishfulness, will to live our lives just as we have in fact lived them. We note, in clarification of this stark insight, that it anticipates, in a different formulation, Camus' insight, in The Myth of Sisyphus, that only those should be living their lives who find it worth while, and that those who do not find it worth living should end it, if they are serious. The choric or laconic sense in which Santayana's sense of life could be said to be Dionysan too, throws a ray of contrasting light on Nietzsche's, because Santayana's sense of life is not ultimately tragic. Unamuno's, on the other hand, can now be seen to be agonistic only in the sense of strenuous, and not tragic but elegaic.7 And if we required Nietzsche's own sense of life to be governed by his special notion of the "eternal recurrence," we can understand better how it can be both tragic and affirmative. For the eternal recurrence turns out, on reflection, to be the rehearsal of what a life has suffered or achieved under the poetic form of eternity, the seeing of what one has done and undergone as a prevalence, to use Buchler's term for one of the dimensions of being.

When dismissing the moralities that are only "recipes against [the] passions," Nietzsche also alludes, at Beyond Good and Evil 198, to "that tuning down of the affects to a harmless mean according to which they may be satisfied, the Aristotelianism of morals." Does this mean that Nietzsche is against intelligent moderation? Doesn't he recognize the highly tempered nature of the creative process, for instance, in aphorism 188 of this same work?

> Every artist knows how far from any feeling of letting himself go his 'most natural' state is-the free ordering, lacing, disposing, giving form in the moment of 'inspiration'-and how strictly and subtly he obeys thousandfold laws... that defy all formulation through concepts...

As Kaufmann points out, it is unjustifiable to infer from Nietzsche's disagreement with the neo-classicist theory of tragedy that Aristotle did not mean much to Nietzsche. Aphorism 80 of The Gay Science, in fact, honors Aristotle in spite of what Nietzsche thought was his position about the end of tragedy. And we must remember that Nietzsche rejects the false virtu and merely imitative strength embodied in extreme states.8 He rejects the cult of passion, the furore espressivo that overcompensates for neediness instead of expressing needfulness.

Just as in Aristotle human excellence (aretê) and the knowledges are both kinds of competence, so, in Nietzsche's thinking about power, the weaknesses which he deplores--ressentiment, unhealthiness, spiritual poverty-are all failures to develop competence. Nietzsche was more Greek in the original Aristotelian sense than he knew: "A profound spirit," he says in aphorism 57 of The Antichrist, does not object to mediocrity as such. For, like Aristotle, he knows that the stability of the state and quality of culture depend upon "those in the middle," upon "handicraft, trade, agriculture, science, the greatest part of art... of professional activity." It should not surprise us that Nietzsche is able to say, "when the exceptional human being treats the mediocre more tenderly than himself and his peers, this is not mere politeness of the heart-it is simply his duty." But what is this if not spiritual sympathy, namely, the measured compassion that Nietzsche is taken to be decrying elsewhere?

Aphorism 7 of The Antichrist has for its theme the nihilistic consequences of the emotion of pity. But it makes the mistake of attributing to Aristotle the view that tragedy "purges" us of pity; so does Ecce Homo in aphorism 3 on "The Birth of Tragedy." As we have said, the allusion is to the neo-classicist's Aristotle. What has to be worked out is that Nietzsche is praising the neo-classicist doctrine of tragedy for the wrong reasons; for, it contradicts his own Dionysan insight into the way tragedy works, namely, by a kind of musical immersion in the horror of life which holds to, or achieves, a perspective of humanity. Nietzsche's whole view of pity needs to be understood in relation to the ethics and aesthetics of the large-souled man.

Aphorism 2 of The Birth of Tragedy is not incorrect in taking "the imitation of nature" to be a relation between the thing made poiêma and "the archetype;" for this is one of the connotations of mimêsis in Aristotle properly understood. The opening of the Poetics takes mimêsis to be a kind of making (poiêsis) What kind? A "mimetic" or suggestive kind of making. Thus, mimetic-making is an expressive process as well as a constructive one. And this is as it should be, speaking aesthetically; for, those who call Aristotle's an imitation theory forget that imitating is a kind of abstracting, namely, an abstraction of the likeness from the model and a transposition of it onto a distinct medium. But an abstraction designed to be artistically effective is, precisely, an expression.

So it is misleading, speaking historically, to say: "Never since Aristotle has an explanation of the tragic effect been offered from which aesthetic states or an aesthetic activity of the listener could be inferred" (Birth aph.22). For, while it is true that what the Poetics discusses is not the psychological effect of tragedy upon the audience but the aesthetic process by which the composer deals with the sickening quality of the horrible acts, Aristotle has offered an explanation of the aesthetic activity of the tragic composer. And it is an expressionist as much as an imitationist explanation, in just the measure that mimêsis is a constructive and suggestive activity as well as a representational one. For, mimêsis can be said to be representational in the way it relates the protagonists of tragedy to the mythological archetypes.

It's interesting, by the way, that Nietzsche implies in aphorism 18 that nineteenth-century Germany is in important respects uncreative and "Alexandrian," on the analogy of the cataloging age of the Hellenistic grammarians. For, we note that he himself did not entirely succeed in overcoming the influence of "Alexandrian" philology upon his own interpretations of the Greek classics.

Aphorism 7 of The Birth of Tragedy also misses the fact that Aristotle's account of the development of tragedy into its fifth-century forms was, though very summary, still genetic. For, Nietzsche characterizes Aristotle's view that the chorus represents "an ideal spectator" as non-genetic. But Nietzsche is not wrong to bring into question the political over-use of this view by democrats. We should not allow the function of the chorus to be oversimplified in the interest of a reductive political analysis.

Nietzsche's difference with Aristotle in aphorism 14 of The Birth of Tragedy is striking. Where Aristotle had called Euripides "the most tragic of the poets" (Poet. 1453a), Nietzsche, with equal overstatement, presents him as the most "optimistic." The former opinion was no doubt based on such of the extant plays as The Bacchae, the latter on the melodramas with non-tragic endings.
