It shall prepare and maintain its own separate books and financial records and
statements, showing its assets and liabilities separate and apart from the books
and financial records and statements of any member of the Company, any other
Affiliate of the Company or any other Person (other than any Restricted
Subsidiary); except that the Company’s assets may be included in consolidated
financial statements of its Affiliates so long as appropriate notation is made
on such consolidated financial statements to indicate the separateness of the
Company from such Affiliate and to disclose the separate nature of the Company’s
indebtedness.

 

  d)

(A) It shall prepare and file its own tax returns separate from those of any
Person (other than any Restricted Subsidiary) except to the extent that the

required to be paid by applicable law.

 

  e)

It shall observe all limited liability company procedures necessary to maintain
its separate existence and formalities, including without limitation,

of the Managers and/or Member(s), including, when applicable, the Independent

(iii) conducting its own business in its own name and through authorized agents
pursuant to its organizational documents.

 

  f)

entity separate, distinct and independent from any other entity.

permitted or contemplated by the Transaction Documents.

and obligations; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not require any
Member to make additional capital contributions to the Company.

 

  j)

It shall directly manage its own liabilities and pay the salaries of its own
employees, if any, and maintain a sufficient number of employees in light of its
contemplated business operations, which operations may be carried out pursuant

of a Restricted Subsidiary (except as required under the Accounts Agreement).

 

  n)

It shall not enter into any transaction with any Affiliate except on an
arm’s-length basis on terms that are no less favorable than would be available
in comparable transactions with unaffiliated third parties (or, if no comparable
transactions with unaffiliated third parties would be available, then on terms
that are determined by a Majority of the Managers to be fair in light of all
factors considered by the Managers to be pertinent to the Company), and shall
(A) have been approved in accordance with its organizational documents,
(B) otherwise comply with the provisions of the Financing Documents and (C) be
pursuant to written, enforceable agreements.
