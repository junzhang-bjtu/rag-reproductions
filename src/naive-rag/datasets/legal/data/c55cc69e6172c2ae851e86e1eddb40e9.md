3.           Management of Research Program

3.1.         Formation of Joint Steering Committee.  The Parties shall establish
a “Joint Steering Committee” or “JSC” (the “JSC”) to oversee the Research
Program.  Each Party shall initially appoint three (3) representatives of such
Party or its Affiliates to the JSC. The JSC may change its size from time to
time by mutual consent of its members, provided that the JSC shall consist at
all times of an equal number of representatives of each of Universal and
Adaptimmune. Each Party may replace its JSC representatives at any time upon
written notice to the other Party or may delegate performance to an alternative
representative by written notice to the other Party where any representative
cannot attend meetings or is unable to vote.  The JSC may invite non-members
(including consultants and advisors of a Party who are under an obligation of
confidentiality consistent with this Agreement), but with a maximum of three (3)
per Party, to participate in the discussions and meetings of the JSC, provided
that such participants shall have no voting authority at the JSC.  The JSC shall
have a chairperson who shall be selected by Adaptimmune.  The role of the
chairperson shall be to convene and preside at meetings of the JSC, to prepare
and circulate agendas and to ensure the preparation of minutes, but shall have
no additional powers or rights beyond those held by the other JSC
representatives. Attendance of representatives of a Party at meetings (including
any associated travel or accommodation costs) of the JSC shall be at the cost
and expense of the relevant Party.

3.2.         Meetings . The JSC shall meet every three calendar months during
performance of the Research Program unless the Parties mutually agree in writing
to a different frequency for such meetings or as reasonably necessary.  Meetings
may be held in person or by telephone as agreed by the JSC. The JSC shall cease
following completion of the Research Program.

3.3.         Specific Responsibilities of the JSC.  The JSC shall be responsible
for overseeing the activities of the Parties under the Research Program. In

3.4.         Decision-Making of JSC. The JSC shall act by consensus.  The
representatives from each of (a) Universal and (b) Adaptimmune, will have,
collectively, one (1) vote.  If the JSC cannot reach consensus on an issue that
comes before the JSC, then the Parties shall refer such matter to the CEO of
Adaptimmune and the President of Universal (collectively, the “Senior
Officers”). The Senior Officers shall use reasonable efforts to resolve such
issue within thirty (30) days of the issue being referred to them. In the event
that the Senior Officers cannot reach agreement, Adaptimmune shall have the
casting vote to resolve such issue save where such issue would result in any of
the following: (a) an increase in capital commitment for Universal which is not
reimbursed by Adaptimmune; or (b) a material increase in resource commitment or
financial commitment by Universal which is not reimbursed by
Adaptimmune.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is a dispute as to whether
a particular Phase of the Research Plan has been achieved (including without
limitation for purposes of a Development Milestone being due), then Adaptimmune
will not have the decision-making right and the Parties shall submit the dispute
to an independent, neutral expert (mutually agreed in good faith) with
biopharmaceutical expertise to determine whether the Phase or Development
Milestone has been achieved.  The Parties shall be bound by any such expert
determination in the absence of manifest fraud and the non-prevailing Party
shall pay the reasonable costs of such expert. Furthermore, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any and all amendments to the Research Plan  (including without

(30) days written notice and unless there is mutual agreement by the Parties
otherwise this Agreement shall terminate.  For the purposes of interpreting the
Development Milestones above: [***] Cell Bank (“MCB”) of a B2M-edited,
pluripotent Universal Donor Cell (“UDC”) line engineered to prevent cell surface
expression of polymorphic HLA class I molecules and with mutations in the RFXANK
gene to prevent HLA-class II expression and as further defined in the Research
Plan; “TCA-UDC” shall mean a T-cell adapted UDC line engineered to express a
specific TCR or TCR variant with further mutations to prevent the expression of
the endogenous TCR; “WCB” shall mean a Working Cell Bank.

6.3.         Modifications to Development Milestones. The Parties accept that
the above milestones are based on the Research Program as outlined in
Schedule  1 and reflect reimbursement of the anticipated development expenses
undertaken by Universal.  Where the scope of such Research Program materially
changes or requires Universal to take on a materially higher resource or
financial burden, the Parties shall negotiate adjustment to the above
Development Milestones in good faith to reflect such increased scope, resource
or financial burden.





20




6.4.         Adjustments to Development Milestones. Where any Research
Activities are specified to be performed by Universal in the Research Plan and
Universal is unable to perform such Research Activities or alternatively is
delayed in the start of performance of such Research Activities and in
accordance with Section 2.3 Adaptimmune takes over the performance of such
Research Activities or appoints a Third Party to carry out such Research
Activities, the Development Milestone will be reduced on a pro-rated basis to
reflect the reduction in work activities being conducted by Universal. Where a
Third Party is used by Adaptimmune to perform such Research Activities the
reduction shall additionally cover the costs of such Third Party performing the
Research Activities where greater than the pro-rated reduction in level of
Development Milestone.  Where no activities are performed by Universal under a
Development Milestone as a result of an inability to perform by Universal, no
Development Milestone shall become due and owing on achievement of such
milestone by Adaptimmune.

6.5.         Product Milestones.  Adaptimmune shall pay the following product
milestone payments on the first Product to achieve each of the following
milestones (“Product Milestones”):

 

 

 

(1) [***]

    

US$[***]

 

 

 

(2) [***]

 

US$[***]

 

 

 

(3) [***]

 

US$[***]

 

In this Section 6.5: (a) a “Pre-Existing Adaptimmune Product” shall mean a

twenty (20) Business Days of the first achievement of each milestone event set
forth in Sections 6.2 (to the extent Universal is not already aware of
achievement) and 6.5 above.  After receiving such written notice, Universal
shall submit an invoice to Adaptimmune for the amount of such milestone payment,
and Adaptimmune will pay Universal the applicable milestone payment within
thirty (30) days after receipt of an invoice from Universal.

6.7.         One-Time Payments.  Each individual milestone payment (whether a
Development Milestone or Product Milestone) is payable one time only regardless
of the number of Products developed and/or commercialized and regardless of the
number of times any of the applicable events occurs with respect to any
Product.  Where any milestone event is not achieved the relevant Product
Milestone or Development Milestone shall not be due and owing.





21




6.8.         No Additional Milestones.  In addition and for the avoidance of
doubt, Adaptimmune will not be obligated to make any other payments in respect
of the above milestone events to Universal and/or Third Parties.

6.9.         Profit Share.  Following expiry of the first [***] period after

Affiliate or sublicensee, Adaptimmune will calculate the profit share due to
Universal in relation to the commercialisation of such First Multi-Indication
Product. The profit share for such [***] period, and each consecutive [***]
period (each a “Profit Share [***]”) until expiration of the last Valid Claim,
shall be calculated as follows:

[***]

The New Mean Average Cost of Supply shall be the [***] over the [***] of sale
for the [***] sold by Adaptimmune or its Affiliate or sublicensee, the first
month starting on date of First Commercial Sale of such Product.

The Old Mean Average Cost of Supply shall be the [***] for the product sold by
Adaptimmune or its Affiliate or sublicensee [***] as used in the [***] as
calculated using the [***] immediately preceding date of First Commercial Sale
of the First Multi-Indication Product. [***].

The Profit share due and payable shall be calculated in US dollars. Where any
calculation of Mean Average Cost of Supply requires conversion from a currency
other than US dollars, Adaptimmune shall carry out such conversion using
Adaptimmune’s customary and standard internal exchange rates. Where the Old Mean
Average Cost of Supply is lower than the New Mean Average Cost of Supply, no
profit share shall be payable.

If the Profit Share Amount is negative, then the First Multi-Indication Product
shall be subject to the royalty under Section 6.12 and no further Profit Share
shall be payable or owing from Adaptimmune.

6.10.       Valid Patent limitation. The profit share payable in accordance with
Section 6.9 above shall only be payable on Products which are Covered by a Valid
Claim. Once the last Valid Claim to Cover the First Multi-Indication Product
expires, any obligation to pay the profit share in relation to such Product
shall cease.  Except as set forth in the last paragraph of Section 6.9, for
clarity no royalty shall be payable on the sale of a First Multi-Indication
Product.

6.11.       Profit Share report.  Adaptimmune will deliver to Universal a report
detailing the profit share due to Universal and calculated in accordance with
Section 6.9 within sixty (60) calendar days of the expiry of each Profit Share
[***]. Adaptimmune will pay the relevant profit share to Universal following
receipt of invoice from Universal and within 30 days of receipt of such invoice.

6.12.       Royalties. In addition to the profit share payable under
Section  6.9, on a country by country and Product by Product basis and for all
Products other than the First Multi-Indication Product (unless subject to a
royalty pursuant to the last paragraph of Section





22




6.9), Adaptimmune shall pay to Universal a royalty of [***]% of Net Sales.
Adaptimmune’s obligation to pay royalty with respect to any Product shall
commence upon the First Commercial Sale of a Product in a country and shall
expire on the earlier of (i) the expiration of the last Valid Claim to Cover
such Product; and (ii) the date that is [***] years from the First Commercial
Sale of such Product in a country (“Royalty Term”). On expiration of the Royalty
Term in relation to any Product, no further royalties shall be due or payable in
relation to the sale of such Product.

6.13.       Currency Conversion for Net Sales. With respect to sales of Product
in US dollars, the Net Sales shall be expressed in US dollars. With respect to
sales of Products in a currency other than US dollars, the Net Sales shall be
reported in US dollars and converted using Adaptimmune’s customary and standard
internal exchange rates. The basis of any conversion shall be specified in the
relevant Royalty Report.

6.14.       Royalty Reports. Following First Commercial Sale of a Product other
than the First Multi-Indication Product, Adaptimmune shall provide a report to
Universal within [***] of each calendar quarter (“Royalty Report”), the first
such report being due within [***] days after expiry of the calendar quarter in
which the First Commercial Sale of a Product (excluding the First
Multi-Indication Product unless subject to a royalty pursuant to the last
paragraph of Section 6.9) is made. The Royalty Report shall include (a) the
total Net Sales for each Product worldwide; and (b) calculation of the royalty
due to Universal under Section 6.12 above. On receipt of such Royalty Report,
Universal will provide an invoice for the royalty and Adaptimmune shall pay such
royalty within 30 days of receipt of invoice.

6.15.       Interest. Payments which are not made when due may bear interest as
of the due date until the date the amount is effectively received on the account
of Universal, at a rate of EURIBOR (12 months) plus [***]% calculated on a
weekly basis for every week that the payment is due but unpaid. Universal shall
notify Adaptimmune prior to making any interest charge on any overdue payment,
providing at least 5 Business Days prior notice.

6.16.       Mode of Payment.  All payments set forth in this Section 6 shall be
remitted by wire transfer to a bank account as Universal may designate in
writing.

6.17.       Currency.  All payments required under this Section 6 shall be made
in U.S. Dollars.

6.18.       Taxes.

6.18.1          General. Universal alone shall be responsible for paying any and
all taxes (other than withholding taxes required by Applicable Law to be paid by
Adaptimmune) levied on account of, or measured in whole or in part by reference
to, any Payments it receives.  Adaptimmune shall deduct or withhold from the
Payments any taxes that it is required by Applicable Law to deduct or withhold
and shall reasonably assist Universal in obtaining any such deductions.

6.18.2          Indirect Taxes.  All amounts payable by Adaptimmune under this
Agreement are stated exclusive of any Indirect Taxes, which Universal may be
obliged to





23




charge.  If any Indirect Taxes are chargeable in respect of any Payments,
Adaptimmune shall pay such Indirect Taxes at the applicable rate in respect of
such Payments following receipt, where applicable, of an Indirect Taxes invoice
in the appropriate form issued by Universal in respect of those Payments.  The
Parties shall issue invoices for all amounts payable under this Agreement
consistent with Indirect Tax requirements and irrespective of whether the sums
may be netted for settlement purposes.  If such amounts of Indirect Taxes are
refunded by the applicable Governmental Authority or other fiscal authority to
Universal subsequent to payment, the Party receiving such refund will transfer
such amount to the paying Party within sixty (60) days of receipt. The Parties
agree to reasonably cooperate to provide any information required by the Party
pursuing a refund of Indirect Taxes paid.

6.19.       Operating Licences. Each Party is solely responsible for payment
required under any operating licences or permits including any required to
perform its Research Activities in accordance with Applicable Laws.

6.20.       Records. Adaptimmune shall keep and maintain records of its sales of
Products in sufficient detail to enable Universal to verify the accuracy of
Payments due from Adaptimmune and pursuant to an inspection under Section  6.21.
Adaptimmune shall keep such records for a period of  five (5) years from the end
of the calendar year in which the relevant Product sales were made.

6.21.       Inspections. Universal shall be entitled to appoint an independent
third party qualified accountant or a person possessing similar professional
status and associated with an independent accounting firm acceptable to the
Parties to verify the level of Net Sales accounted for by Adaptimmune in
accordance with Section 6.12 and the basis for the calculation of profit share
in accordance with Section  6.9.  Adaptimmune shall make its records available
as set forth in this Section 6.21.  The accounting firm shall enter into
appropriate obligations with Adaptimmune to treat all information it receives
during its inspection in confidence.  Such audit right shall apply no more than
once in any calendar year and shall only relate to the previous three (3)
calendar year’s records (to the extent not previously audited by Universal). The
independent third party shall only be entitled to report to Universal as to
whether or not the Net Sales of any Product or the calculation of Profit Share
are materially accurate. Where any inspection identifies any shortfall in the
Payments required to Universal, Adaptimmune shall make up such shortfall within
30 days of receiving notice of such shortfall. Where any inspection identifies
an overpayment in the Payments required to Universal, Adaptimmune shall be
entitled to deduct the amount of such overpayment from the next Payment or
Payments made to Universal. Universal shall pay the cost of any inspection
unless such inspection identifies a shortfall in payments in the preceding
calendar year in excess of five (5) percent in which case Adaptimmune shall pay
the reasonable costs of the Third Party carrying out such inspection.

6.22.       Investment. In addition to the above Payments, Universal shall
provide Adaptimmune with the right to participate in the next two (2) Qualified
Equity Investment Events that occur after the Effective Date, on the following
terms:





24




6.22.1     If Universal proposes to conduct a Qualified Equity Investment Event,
then it will provide Adaptimmune with as much notice as reasonably possible and
in any event at least twenty (20) Business Days prior written notice of the
estimated initial closing of such Qualified Equity Investment Event (a
“Financing Notice”), which Financing Notice will also describe the principal
terms of the Qualified Equity Investment Event.

6.22.2       If Adaptimmune wishes to participate in such Qualified Equity
Investment Event, it must notify Universal within ten Business Days after
delivery of the Financing Notice, in which case:

6.22.2.1. Universal will allow Adaptimmune to participate in the initial closing
of the Qualified Equity Investment Event;

6.22.2.2. Universal will permit Adaptimmune to review the initial closing, such
stock purchase agreement, investors’ rights agreement, co-sale agreement, voting
agreement and/or other agreements as are entered into by the investors in the
Qualified Equity Investment Event generally (“Investment Documents”) and both
Universal and Adaptimmune will negotiate in good faith and on a timely basis any
changes required by Adaptimmune to such Investment Documents; and

6.22.2.3. Adaptimmune will execute and deliver to Universal at the initial
closing, the agreed Investment Documents.

“Qualified Equity Investment Events” means a transaction or series of related
transactions, conducted primarily for the purpose of raising additional working
capital, in which Universal sells shares of its preferred stock to new or
existing investors, other than to a Universal licensee or collaborator in
connection with the grant of a license or entering into a collaboration.

Adaptimmune’s rights and Universal’s obligations under this Section 6.22 shall
terminate on the earliest to occur of (a) the initial closing of the second
Qualified Equity Investment Event occurring after the date of this Agreement,
(ii) a Change of Control of Universal, or (iii) an initial public offering of
Universal’s common stock pursuant to a registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

jointly owned Arising IP without restriction.  Neither Party shall be entitled
to assign its interest in such jointly owned Arising IP without the consent of
the other Party save that either Party shall be entitled to assign its interest
to an Affiliate or to an assignee to this Agreement (in accordance with Section
17). Both Parties shall be entitled to sub-license their interest in such
jointly owned Arising IP without the requirement of consent from the other Party
and in each case subject to the licences granted under Section 5.1.  Universal
shall not be entitled to use the jointly owned Arising IP under Section 7.2.5
within the Field (including to sub-license or license its interest within the
Field) without the prior written consent of Adaptimmune.

7.5.         Sublicensed IP. The Sublicensed IP will be licensed to Adaptimmune
in accordance with the terms of the Sublicenses. Universal agrees that it shall
notify Adaptimmune prior to any amendments to the terms of the
AAC/HLA-engineering Licence or the Elf Licence. Such notification shall include
the detail of the amendment proposed. Universal shall not agree any amendment
that would adversely affect Adaptimmune’s rights unless Adaptimmune provides its
prior written consent to such amendment.

sole discretion to control and take decisions in relation to the filing,
prosecution, maintenance and obtaining, (including carrying out any
interferences, reissue proceedings and re-examinations), throughout the world of
any patent application Covering any Arising IP solely or jointly owned by
Adaptimmune and all Patents granted therefrom at its expense and save as
provided further below. Adaptimmune shall keep Universal reasonably informed
through the JSC (to the extent still in existence or otherwise by notice in
writing) of any filings of patent applications Covering any such Arising IP and
the progress of such patent applications. Universal shall provide all necessary
powers of attorney to Adaptimmune to allow Adaptimmune to carry out such
prosecution and maintenance.  Universal shall





27




be entitled in its sole discretion to control and take decisions in relation to
the filing, prosecution, maintenance and obtaining, (including carrying out any
interferences, reissue proceedings and re-examinations), throughout the world of
any patent application Covering any Arising IP solely owned by Universal and all
Patents granted therefrom at its expense. In relation to any patent applications
covering any jointly owned Arising IP under Section 7.2.5, such patent
applications shall be drafted jointly by the Parties and advisers for each Party

applications. Any patent application filing shall require the approval of both
Parties prior to filing. Adaptimmune will file and prosecute any mutually
approved patent application but shall keep Universal fully informed of the
prosecution of such patent applications and Patents granted therefrom. The
parties shall cooperate to coordinate same-day Patent application filings for
Arising IP, as requested by the other party, for any provisional or
nonprovisional patent applications (but for clarity not any continuations,
continuations-in-part or divisionals) as for Patent application filings within
the Universal Cells Background IP or Adaptimmune Background IP that are directed
to subject matter inventions that were used to identify, produce or develop a
Product during the performance of activities under this Agreement to avoid
jeopardizing patentability of any such Patent.

8.3.         Support. Universal shall provide reasonable support in relation to
Adaptimmune's prosecution and maintenance of any patent applications or Patents
Covering the Arising IP solely or jointly owned by Adaptimmune, subject to

the JSC or on the occurrence of any material event in relation to any Patent) in
relation to the progress of any patent application or Patent claiming any such
Arising IP.

8.4.         Election not to Prosecute.  If, Adaptimmune or Universal (each a
“Prosecuting Party”) elects not to pursue or continue the filing, prosecution
(including any interferences, reissue proceedings and re-examinations) or
maintenance of any Patent Covering any Arising IP solely or jointly owned by
Adaptimmune or Universal respectively in any Major Territory, the relevant
Prosecuting Party shall so notify the other Party promptly in writing in
sufficient time (usually 45 days but may be a shorter period depending on the
notice given to Prosecuting Party by the relevant patent office) in advance to
enable other Party to meet any deadlines by which an action must be taken to
establish or preserve any such rights in such notified Patent.  Upon receipt of
any such notice from Prosecuting Party and to the extent possible under any
Third Party agreement existing as at the Effective Date, the non-Prosecuting
Party shall have the right, but not the obligation, to pursue the filing or
registration, or support the continued prosecution (but excluding any
interferences, reissue proceedings and re-examinations) or maintenance, of such
notified Patent, at its expense in such country. The non-Prosecuting Party will
keep the Prosecuting Party reasonably informed with regard to the current status
of any Patent for which non-Prosecuting Party takes over responsibility for
under this Section  8.4, including providing copies of any material
correspondence with relevant patent offices.

8.5.         CREATE Act.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 8 no Party shall have the right to make an election under the

Enhancement Act of 2004, 35 U.S.C. 103(c)(2)-(c)(3) (the “CREATE Act”) when
exercising its rights under this Section 8 without the prior written consent of
the other Party. With respect to any such permitted election, the Parties shall
use reasonable efforts to cooperate and coordinate their activities with respect
to any submissions, filings or other activities in support thereof.  The Parties
acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is a “joint research agreement” as
defined in the CREATE Act.

9.           Enforcement of Patents

9.1.         Rights and Procedures. In the event that a Party is notified that a
Third Party may be infringing any of the Arising IP, Universal Patents or
Universal Know-How, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party in writing,
identifying the alleged infringer (to the extent not in breach of any Third
Party obligation of confidence) and the alleged infringement complained of and
furnishing the information of which it has been notified.

9.1.1            [***]

9.1.2            Save as provided in Section 9.1.1 and subject to Section 9.3
below, in relation to any other infringement or alleged infringement of a Patent
within the Universal IP, Universal may, in its sole discretion and in its own
name, through counsel of its choosing, take any measures it deems appropriate to
stop such infringing activities by such Third Party in any part of the Territory
or to grant to the infringing Third Party adequate rights and licenses necessary
for continuing such activities. Any licences granted to any Third Party shall
not restrict or conflict with the licences and rights granted to Adaptimmune
under this Agreement.

9.1.3            Upon reasonable request by the enforcing Party and at the
enforcing Party’s cost and expense, the other Party shall provide all reasonable
information and assistance, including allowing access to files and documents and
to personnel who may have possession of relevant information and, if necessary
for prosecution of any legal action, joining in the legal action.

9.2.         Recovery. Any amounts recovered by an enforcing Party pursuant to
Section 9.1.1 (expressly excluding Section 9.1.3), whether by settlement or
judgment, shall be shared as follows:  the enforcing Party shall first reimburse
its costs and expenses for the infringement action and retain [***] ([***]%) of
the remainder and provide the non-enforcing Party with the remaining [***]
 ([***]%) of the remainder.

9.3.         Enforcement of Sublicensed IP. Any enforcement of any Sublicensed
IP shall be subject to the terms of the Sublicenses.

10.         Potential Third Party Actions

10.1.       Third Party Licenses.  If, in the opinion of Adaptimmune, the
Exploitation of the Products by Adaptimmune, its Affiliates or any of their
licensees infringes or misappropriates any Patent or any Intellectual Property
Right of a Third Party in any country, then, Adaptimmune shall have the right,
but not the obligation to negotiate and obtain a license from such Third Party
as necessary for Adaptimmune and its Affiliates and licensees to





29




Exploit the Products in such country.  Adaptimmune will be responsible for the
performance of any license agreement it executes with such Third Party.
Adaptimmune understands and accepts that it shall be responsible for negotiation
of any agreements with Third Parties required for the commercial use of any
Third Party cell lines or cell banks required for commercial manufacture and
sale of Product (excluding any use for research and development or clinical
trials).

10.2.       Invalidity or Unenforceability Defences or Actions.

10.2.1          In the event that a Third Party asserts, as a defence or as a
counterclaim in any infringement action, that any Universal Patent (excluding
any Arising IP) or any Arising IP solely owned by Universal is invalid or
unenforceable, then Universal shall have the right, but not the obligation,
through counsel of its choosing to respond to such defence or defend against
such counterclaim (as applicable), including the right to settle or otherwise
compromise such claim.

10.2.2          Similarly, if a Third Party asserts, in a declaratory judgment
action or similar action or claim filed by such Third Party, that any Patent
within the Arising  IP solely or jointly owned by Adaptimmune is invalid or
unenforceable, then Adaptimmune shall have the right, but not the obligation,
through counsel of its choosing to defend against such action or claim.

10.3.       Third Party Litigation.  In the event of any actual or threatened
suit against Adaptimmune or Universal alleging that the Exploitation of Products
by or on behalf of Adaptimmune under this Agreement infringes the Patent or
Intellectual Property Rights of any Person (an “Infringement Suit”), the Party
first becoming aware of such Infringement Suit shall promptly give written
notice to the other Party.  In relation to any Products, Adaptimmune shall have
the right, but not the obligation, through counsel of its choosing, to assume
direction and control of the defence of claims arising therefrom (including the
right to settle such claims in its sole discretion).

10.4.       Cooperation.  Each Party will provide to the other Party all
reasonable assistance requested by such Party in connection with any action,
claim or suit under Section 10.2 or 10.3, including allowing such Party access
to the other Party 's files and documents and to the other Party 's personnel
who may have possession of relevant information. The requesting Party shall pay
the other Party’s reasonable out of pocket expenses in relation thereto. In
particular the other Party will promptly make available to the requesting Party,
all information in its possession or control that it is aware will assist such
Party in responding to any such action, claim or suit under Section 10.2 or
10.3.

11.         Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure

11.1.       Confidentiality.  At all times during the term of this Agreement and
for a period of [***] years following termination or expiration hereof, each

Information  to the extent that such disclosure is:

11.2.1          made in response to a valid order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or other competent authority; provided, however, that the Receiving
Party shall first have given notice to the Disclosing Party and given the
Disclosing Party a reasonable opportunity to quash any such order or obtain a
protective order requiring that the Confidential Information and documents that
are the subject of such order be held in confidence by such court or authority
or, if disclosed, be used only for the purpose for which the order was issued;
and provided further that if such order is not quashed or a protective order is
not obtained, the Confidential Information disclosed in response to such court
or governmental order shall be limited to that information that is legally
required to be disclosed in response to such court or governmental order;

11.2.2          made by Adaptimmune or its Affiliates or its licensees to a

the extent such protection is available;

11.2.4          otherwise required by Applicable Law or by stock exchange or
other financial authority requirement;

11.2.5          made by Adaptimmune or its Affiliates or its licensees to Third
Parties as may be necessary or useful in connection with the Exploitation of

possible, agreeing confidentiality obligations substantially equivalent to those
set out in this Agreement ; or

11.2.6          made by Universal or its Affiliates to actual or prospective
investors or acquirers to the extent necessary for the purposes of such

31




Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Adaptimmune or any of its
Affiliates is required by Applicable Law or the requirements of a national
securities exchange or another similar regulatory body to disclose this
Agreement, in whole or in part, the Parties shall reasonably agree on a redacted
version of this Agreement as necessary to protect the Confidential Information
of Universal prior to making such disclosure.

11.3.       Exclusions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information
shall not include any information that:

11.3.1          is or hereafter becomes part of the public domain by public use,
publication, general knowledge or the like through no wrongful act, fault or
negligence on the part of the Receiving Party;

Affiliates without reference to the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

Specific aspects or details of Confidential Information shall not be deemed to
be within the public domain or in the possession of the Receiving Party merely
because the Confidential Information is embraced by more general information in
the public domain or in the possession of the Receiving Party.  Further, any
combination of Confidential Information shall not be considered in the public
domain or in the possession of the Receiving Party merely because individual
elements of such Confidential Information are in the public domain or in the
possession of the Receiving Party unless the combination and its principles are
in the public domain or in the possession of the Receiving Party.

11.4.       Results. Universal and Adaptimmune shall each keep the Results
confidential as if such Results were Confidential Information of the other
Party, save:

11.4.1          To the extent such disclosure is permitted for Confidential
Information under Section 11.2 above;

11.4.2          to the extent such Results need to be disclosed to Third Parties
(i) in the case of Universal for the further development of the Universal
Technology outside of the Field provided that if the Results to be disclosed
would include information regarding the Field, then where reasonably possible
subject to such Third Party agreeing to obligations of confidentiality
substantially equivalent to those set out in this Agreement; and (ii) in the
case of Adaptimmune for the further development and Exploitation of Products
within the Field and where

otherwise use the name, insignia, symbol, trademark, trade name or logotype of
another Party or its Affiliates in any publication, press release, promotional
material or other form of publicity without the prior written consent of such
other Party.  The restrictions imposed by this Section 11.6 shall not prohibit a
Party from making any disclosure identifying another Party that is required by
Applicable Law or the requirements of a national securities exchange or another
similar regulatory body, provided that any such disclosure shall be governed by
this Section 11.  Further, the restrictions imposed on each Party under this
Section 11.6 are not intended, and shall not be construed, to prohibit a Party
from identifying the other Party in its internal business communications,
provided that any Confidential Information in such communications remains
subject to this Section 11.

11.7.       Public Announcements. No public announcement concerning this
Agreement, its subject matter or the transactions described herein shall be

rule without first obtaining the approval of the other Party and agreement upon
the nature, text and timing of such announcement, which approval and agreement
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  The Party desiring to make any
such voluntary public announcement shall provide the other Party with a written
copy





33




of the proposed announcement in reasonably sufficient time prior to public
release to allow such other Party to comment upon such announcement, prior to
public release.  In the case of press releases or other public communications
legally required, or required by stock exchange or quotation system rule, to be
made, the Party making such press release or public announcement shall provide
to the other Party a copy of the proposed press release or public announcement
in written or electronic form upon such advance notice as is practicable under
the circumstances for the purpose of allowing the notified Party to review and
comment upon such press release or public announcement.  Under such
circumstances, the releasing Party shall not be obligated to delay making any

relevant Research Activities. Where any part of the Research Plan or Phase of
the Research Plan was part performed, following Adaptimmune taking over
performance of such part or Phase of the Research Plan the Development Milestone
for such part or Phase will be pro-rated accordingly based on the Research
Activities performed prior to receipt by Universal of notification from
Adaptimmune. Universal will cooperate with Adaptimmune to ensure that any
handover of Materials and Information required for Adaptimmune to take over
performance of Research Activities occurs promptly and Universal will make
relevant





39




personnel available to ensure a smooth transition in such Research Activities.
In the event of a Change in Control and Adaptimmune electing to take over the
Research Plan in accordance with Section 15.6(b) or in the event of a Change in

continue to report on the progress of the Research Program or to share any
results or development of any Deliverable or Product with Universal.

15.6.3          Universal shall immediately (a) provide to Adaptimmune all
Results generated to date including any Deliverables (even if not in final form)
or otherwise provide access to such Results and Deliverables (in the case of
cell lines, cell banks or other cell based deliverables or materials); and (b)
to the extent any Research Activities are provided by a Third Party, provide
access to such Third Party and facilitate an ongoing relationship between such
Third Party and Adaptimmune to enable Adaptimmune to complete the Research
Program in its sole discretion.

15.6.4          The licence rights and access reports granted to Adaptimmune
shall continue in full force and effect for the Term. The diligence obligations
under Section 5.2 shall continue to apply but for clarity, Adaptimmune shall be
under no obligation to provide any reports on progress or any detailed reports
on Product sales, nature of Product, manufacturing process for Product or
timelines for Exploitation of any Product.

15.6.5          The JSC shall immediately cease as shall any project or other
sub-committees save where such committees are required to facilitate transition
of the Research Activities to Adaptimmune.

15.6.6          Other terms of the Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect.

Pending notice of Change in Control under this Section 15.6 with a Competitor
and termination or transfer of Research Program to Adaptimmune in accordance
with this Section 15.6, Universal will not permit the Third Party Competitor (or
any of its employees) in respect of which the relevant Change in Control has
occurred to have access to any Confidential Information of Adaptimmune (other
than Confidential Information permitted to be provided in accordance with
Section 11 above).

15.7.       Application of US Bankruptcy Code. The Parties agree that the

laws and regulations outside of the





40




United States, licenses of rights to “intellectual property” as defined under
Section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code or such other laws and regulations.
The Parties shall retain and may fully exercise all of their respective rights
and elections under Section 365(n) of the Bankruptcy Code or similar laws and
regulations outside of the United States. During the duration of the Research
Program, Universal agrees to provide to Adaptimmune a copy of its audited
accounts (or if not audited, its annual accounts or financial statements) within
30 days of finalisation, or alternatively the CEO of Universal will telephone
the CEO of Adaptimmune within 30 days of annual accounts being finalised to
discuss the contents of the annual accounts and in particular financial status
of Universal.

15.8.       Accrued Rights; Surviving Obligations.

15.8.1          Survival.  The termination of this Agreement shall not relieve

in order to influence official action of any Government Official, or (b) with
the intention of or as a condition to inducing any person to carry out a duty or
function improperly or to reach a favourable decision on an improper basis, in
each case in connection with the activities contemplated under this Agreement.

16.2.       Universal shall promptly provide Adaptimmune with written notice of
(a) becoming aware of a Material Anti-Corruption Law Violation by it or any of

Agreement, or (b) upon receiving a formal notification that it or any of its
employees, directors or officers is the target of a formal investigation by any
Governmental Authority for a Material Anti-Corruption Law Violation.

16.3.       Universal acknowledges that its undertakings given in this Section
16 are material to Adaptimmune in entering into this Agreement.  Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, if Adaptimmune becomes aware of what it
determines, acting reasonably, to be a breach of these undertakings, then
Adaptimmune shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement in its entirety, and
any other agreement among the Parties, on notice with immediate effect.  Subject
to the accrued rights of the Parties pursuant to termination, Adaptimmune shall
have no liability to Universal for any fees, reimbursements or other
compensation or for any loss, cost, claim or damage resulting, directly or
indirectly, from such termination.  At the sole discretion of Adaptimmune, any
breach of a Universal obligation with respect to its obligation in this Section

being cured) within a reasonable period of time after learning of such material
breach or Material Anti-Corruption Law Violation.

17.         Assignment

in interest (whether by merger, acquisition, asset purchase or otherwise) to all
or substantially all of the business to which this Agreement relates, provided
that such Party shall provide written notice to the other Party within ninety
(90) days after such assignment or delegation.  All validly assigned rights of
any of Universal or Adaptimmune shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by, and all validly delegated obligations of such party shall be binding on and
be enforceable against, the permitted successors and assigns of such party. Any
attempted assignment or delegation in violation of this Section 17 shall be
void.

18.         Severability

To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Parties waive any
provision of law that would render any provision in this Agreement invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect.  If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, in any respect, then such
provision will be given no effect by any of the Parties and shall not form part
of this Agreement.  To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law and if the
rights or obligations of any Party will not be materially and adversely
affected, all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect, and each Party shall use their best efforts to negotiate a provision in
replacement of the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable that is
consistent with Applicable Law and achieves, as nearly as possible, the original
intention of each of the Parties.

with the terms of the Research and Collaboration Agreement.

3.4.2. If Universal receives notice under the AAV/HLA-engineering licence that
the University has been solicited by a Third Party who wishes to license
Licensed Patents for any field within the Field of Use that Adaptimmune or
Universal is not diligently pursuing (hereinafter “Third Party Field”),
Universal shall so notify Adaptimmune, and Adaptimmune shall be entitled to be
actively involved in any notifications made to University in relation to such
Third Party Field notification from University. Universal and Adaptimmune shall
discuss which of the following options should be exercised in response to such
University’s notification:





 




3.4.2.1. Development Plan. Provide University with a reasonable rationale as to
why offering a sublicense in Third Party Field would be competitive with market
opportunity Adaptimmune or Universal is either actively pursuing, or planning on
pursuing; or

3.4.2.2. Direct Grant. Universal to grant a sublicense to the said soliciting
Third Party in the Third Party Field on commercially reasonable licence terms,
such terms being subject to review and approval by Adaptimmune. Adaptimmune will
not unreasonably withhold or delay its review and approval of such terms, but
will be involved in discussions relating to the scope of any sublicense granted
and the terms applicable to such grant.

3.4.3. University Direct Grant. Adaptimmune understands that if Universal has
not proceeded under either Subsection 3.4.2.1 or 3.4.2.2 within ninety (90) days
of notification to Universal by University under AAV/HLA-engineering licence,

4.1. Patent Application Filings during the Term of this Agreement.

4.1.1. University Prosecutes Patents. Adaptimmune understands that the
University retains the sole and exclusive right to file or otherwise prosecute
Licensed Patents. Universal shall use reasonable efforts to copy Adaptimmune on
any material correspondence, material filings or other material communications
relating to the prosecution of the Licensed Patents to the extent relevant to
the Fields of Use and in each case (a) which relate to the filing or not filing
of any patent application or patent, the lapse of any patent or patent
application, in which the scope of any claims are restricted or narrowed, any
third party observations or oppositions or any communication where any patent
office indicates any claim is invalid or insufficient for any reason and any
response to such patent office communication; and (b) to the extent possible
under the AAV/HLA-engineering Licence will provide Adaptimmune with an
opportunity to comment on any proposed response, including the countries in
which any patent application or patent is filed.

notify Adaptimmune where University wishes to file, prosecute or maintain any
Licensed Patents in a country that Universal does not wish the University to
file in.





 




4.2. Maintenance of Licensed Patents. Universal shall notify Adaptimmune on a
timely basis of any failure on its part to comply with any reimbursement or
other payment obligation under the AAV/HLA-engineering licence or other default
which may cause or result in any Licensed Patent to cease to fall within the
Sub-licence or which might result in any Licensed Patent lapsing or ceasing to

obligation of Universal. Any correction made by Adaptimmune shall be reimbursed
in full by Universal.

4.3. Ownership of the Licensed Patents. No provision of this Agreement grants
Adaptimmune any rights, titles, or interests (except for the grant of license in
Subsection 3.1.1 “License Grant” of this Agreement) in the Licensed Patents.

5.1. Covenants Regarding the Manufacture of Licensed Products. Adaptimmune
hereby covenants and agrees that the manufacture, use, sale, or transfer of
Licensed Products will comply with all applicable federal and state laws,
including all federal export laws and regulations. Adaptimmune understands that
there is a requirement under the AAV/HLA-engineering licence requiring that all
products embodying or produced through the use of an invention that is subject
to the rights of the federal government of the United States of America shall be
substantially manufactured in the United States of America. Due to the nature of
the product concerned, Universal understand that this may not always be
commercially feasible and hence Universal agrees to work with Adaptimmune and to
approach the University on a timely basis during the performance of the Research
Plan (as defined in the Research and Collaboration Agreement) to obtain waiver
from the University in relation to such manufacture and as permitted in
accordance with 35 United States Code Section 204.

5.2. Use of University’s Name and Trademarks or the Names of University Faculty,
Staff, or Students. No provision of this Agreement grants Adaptimmune or any of
its Sublicensees any right or license to use the name or trademarks of
University or the names or identities of any member of the faculty, staff, or
student body of University. Adaptimmune shall not use, and shall not permit a
Sublicensee to use, any such trademarks, names, or identities without
University’s and, as the case may be, such member’s prior written approval.





 




5.3. Records Retention and Audit Rights.

5.3.1. Records Retained. Throughout the term of this Agreement and for 5 years
thereafter, Adaptimmune, at its expense, shall keep and maintain and shall cause
each Sublicensee to keep and maintain complete and accurate records of all
sales, leases, and other dispositions of Licensed Products during the term of
this Agreement and all other records related to this Agreement.

5.3.2. Auditing Rights. Adaptimmune shall permit, at the request of University,
one or more accountants selected exclusively by the University (“Accountants”)
to have access to Adaptimmune’s records and books of account pertaining to this
Agreement, but not more than once per calendar year. Accountants’ access will be
during ordinary working hours to audit Adaptimmune’s records for any payment
period ending prior to such request, the correctness of any report or payment
made by Universal under this Agreement, or to obtain information as to the
payments due for any period in the case of failure of Adaptimmune to report
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Any such inspection shall be subject to
Accountants signing confidentiality agreements with Adaptimmune to ensure the
confidentiality of Adaptimmune’s information. Access under this clause shall
only be provided to records relating to sales of Licensed Products and not to
any other products or services. The cost of any audit under this clause shall be
at the cost of the University.

5.3.3. Scope of Disclosure. Accountants shall not disclose to University any
information relating to the business of Adaptimmune except that which is
necessary to inform University of: the accuracy or inaccuracy of Adaptimmune’s
reports provided to Universal under this Agreement (and which Universal
subsequently provides to University under the AAV/HLA-engineering licence); and
the extent of any inaccuracy or noncompliance.

6. Infringement.

6.1. Third-Party Infringement of a Licensed Patent.

6.1.1. Notice of Third Party’s Infringement. If a Party learns of substantial,
credible evidence that a Third Party is infringing a Licensed Patent in the
Field of Use in the Territory, that Party will promptly deliver written notice
of the possible infringement to the other Party, describing in detail all
relevant information to which that





 




Party has access or control suggesting infringement of the Licensed Patent.
Adaptimmune understands that under the terms of the AAV/HLA-engineering licence,
Universal is not able to grant a right to Adaptimmune to enforce the Licensed
Patents. Universal will work with Adaptimmune in relation to the exercise of
Universal’s rights to enforce and prosecute an infringement or potential
infringement action under the AAV/HLA-engineering licence and to the extent
permitted by the University, will permit Adaptimmune to be present at any court
hearings, material meeting or other actions taken in relation to enforcement of
the Licensed Patents to the extent in each case relevant to the Fields of Use or
scope of Research and Collaboration Agreement. To the extent Universal proposes
to settle any action for infringement or potential infringement, Universal will
discuss and obtain Adaptimmune’s approval to such settlement, such approval not
to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. To the extent the University has control
of any infringement suit or action under the AAV/HLA-engineering licence,
Universal will to the extent permitted by University keep Adaptimmune informed
of the progress of such infringement suit or action and permit Adaptimmune to be
actively involved in such infringement suit or action including the terms of any
sublicense proposed to be granted by the University. Any involvement of
Adaptimmune shall be at Adaptimmune’s cost and expense save where University
requests any assistance from Adaptimmune, in which case University shall pay for
any direct associated expenses related to provision of such assistance.

7. Patent Validity.

7.1. Notice and Investigation of Third Party Challenges. If any Third Party
challenges the validity or enforceability of any of the Licensed Patents, the
Party having such information shall immediately notify the other Party.
Universal shall keep Adaptimmune informed of the status of any defense of any
claim challenging validity or enforceability, where the University assumes
control and defense of the claim in accordance with the terms of the
AAV/HLA-engineering licence. Where Universal assumes the defense of any such
claim, Universal will cooperate with Adaptimmune and enable Adaptimmune to be
actively involved in the defense of such claim and any decisions taken in
relation to such claim at Adaptimmune’s cost and expense.

7.2. Enforceability of Licensed Patents. Notwithstanding challenge by any Third
Party, any Licensed Patent will be enforceable under this Agreement until such
Licensed Patent is determined to be invalid.





 




8. Termination.

8.1. By Universal.

8.1.1. Breach by Adaptimmune. If Adaptimmune breaches or fails to perform one or
more of its material duties under this Agreement, Universal may deliver to
Adaptimmune a written notice of default. Universal may terminate this Agreement

of such notice, Universal shall procure (to the extent necessary under the
AAV/HLA-engineering licence) that University and Adaptimmune shall enter into a
license agreement the terms of which shall be substantially similar to the terms
of the AAV/HLA-engineering licence; and the scope of such direct license, the
licensed territory or the duration of the license grant shall be comparable to
the corresponding terms granted under this Agreement; provided that Adaptimmune
will be granted at least the same scope of rights as it obtained from
Adaptimmune under this Agreement. For the sake of clarity, the financial terms,
including without limitation, the running royalty rate and milestone payments,
shall be identical to the corresponding financial terms set forth in the
AAV/HLA-engineering licence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Adaptimmune
understands that its right to enter into such direct license shall be
conditioned upon:

8.5.1. Written Notification to University. Adaptimmune informing University in
writing, pursuant to Article 21 “Notices” of the AAV/HLA-engineering licence,
that it wishes to enter into such direct license with University, within the
Initial Notice Period;

8.5.2. Good Standing. Adaptimmune being in good standing with Universal under
this Agreement, and this Agreement not being the subject of a dispute between
Universal and Adaptimmune, or between Universal and University under the

reasonable efforts to certify or otherwise demonstrate that the conditions set
forth in this Section 8.5 have been met within 30 days of expiration of the
Initial Notice Period (or within such longer period of time as University agrees
is reasonable under the circumstances, based on the nature and extent of any
documentation reasonably requested by University); and

8.5.5. Time Limitations. Such negotiations for a direct license not exceeding 90
days from the end of the 30-day (or longer, if applicable) period described in
subsection 8.5.4 “Sublicensee Certification that Conditions Satisfied” (subject
to extension of said 90-day period by mutual written agreement of University and
Sublicensee).

University may, at its sole discretion, waive any of the above requirements.
Adaptimmune understands and Universal confirms that if all of the conditions set
forth in this Section 8.5 are met, then Adaptimmune will be granted such direct
license by University. If any condition set forth in this Section 8.5 is not
met, then after





 




expiration of any time period granted to Adaptimmune with respect to meeting
such condition , Adaptimmune shall not make, have made, use, offer to sell or
sell, offer to lease or lease, import, or otherwise offer to dispose or dispose

12. Amendment and Waiver.

This Agreement may be amended from time to time only by a written instrument
signed by the Parties. No term or provision of this Agreement will be waived and
no breach excused unless such waiver or consent will be in writing and signed by
the Party claimed to have waived or consented. No waiver of a breach will be
deemed to be a waiver of a different or subsequent breach.

13. Assignment.

The rights and licenses granted by Universal in this Agreement are personal to
Adaptimmune and Adaptimmune shall not assign its interest or delegate its duties
under this Agreement without the written consent of Universal; any such
assignment or delegation made without written consent of Universal will not
release Adaptimmune from its obligations under this Agreement. The preceding
sentence notwithstanding, Adaptimmune, without the prior approval of Universal,
may assign all, but no less than all, its rights and delegate all, but no less
than all, its duties under this Agreement to a Third Party provided that:

(i)



the assignment is made to such Third Party as a part of and in connection with
(a) the sale by Adaptimmune of all but no less than all of its assets to the
Third Party, (b) the sale, transfer, or exchange by the shareholders, partners,
or equity owners of Adaptimmune of a majority interest in Adaptimmune to the
Third Party, or (c) the merger of Adaptimmune into the Third Party (each of the
events described in part (a), (b) or (c) of this paragraph, an “Acquisition”),

(ii)



Adaptimmune obtains from such Third Party written agreement to honor all
obligations under this Agreement accrued by Adaptimmune before Acquisition and
all obligations under this Agreement to accrue by such Third Party assignee
after Acquisition, including any and all financial obligations, and

(iii)



no later than 10 days after the close of the transaction pursuant to which such
Acquisition is made, Adaptimmune shall provide written notice to Universal of
the Acquisition, as well as a substitution of parties document, in which such
Third Party assignee assumes responsibility for all of Adaptimmune’s outstanding
and future obligations relating to this Agreement. Any assignment made in
violation of this Article will be void and will, without further act, cause the
immediate termination of this Agreement, effective retroactively to the date of
the Acquisition.

This Agreement will inure to the benefit of Adaptimmune and Universal and their
respective permitted assignees and trustees.

14. Confidentiality.

14.1. Form of transfer. Confidential Information may be conveyed in tangible or
intangible form. Disclosing Party must clearly mark its Confidential Information
“confidential.” If disclosing Party communicates Confidential





 




Information in non-written form, it shall reduce such communications to writing,
clearly mark it “confidential”, and provide a copy to receiving Party within 30
days of original communication at the address in Article 21 “Notices”.

14.2. No Unauthorized Disclosure of Confidential Information. Beginning on the
Effective Date and continuing throughout the term of this Agreement and
thereafter for a period of 5 years, receiving Party shall not disclose or
otherwise make known or available to any Third Party any disclosing Party
Confidential Information, without the express prior written consent of
disclosing Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, receiving Party shall be
permitted to disclose disclosing Party Confidential Information to (i) actual or
potential investors, lenders, consultants, collaborators, sublicensees, or
development partners, which disclosure will be made under conditions of
confidentiality and limited use and (ii) its attorney or agent as reasonably
required. In no event shall receiving Party incorporate or otherwise use
disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in connection with any patent
application filed by or on behalf of receiving Party.  Receiving Party shall
restrict the use of disclosing Party’s Confidential Information exclusively to
the terms of this Agreement. Receiving Party shall use reasonable procedures to
safeguard disclosing Party’s Confidential Information.

14.3. Access to University Information. University is an agency of the state of
Washington and is subject to the Washington Public Records Act, RCW 42.56 et
seq., (“Act”). If University receives a request for public records under the Act
for documents containing Adaptimmune Confidential Information, and if University
concludes that the documents are not otherwise exempt from public disclosure,
University will provide Universal notice of the request before releasing such
documents. Universal will provide such notice to Adaptimmune. Such notice will
be provided in a timely manner to afford Adaptimmune sufficient time to review
such documents and/or seek a protective order to the extent agreed as necessary
with Universal in good faith and utilizing the procedures described in RCW
42.56.540

14.4. Disclosure as Required by Law. Either Party shall have the right to
disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information as required by law or valid
court order, provided that such Party shall inform the Party who owns such
Confidential Information prior to such disclosure and shall limit the scope and
recipient of disclosure to the extent required by such law or court order.

University and Adaptimmune (and to the extent required Universal shall
facilitate such negotiations and finalization) shall enter into a license
agreement the terms of which shall be substantially similar to the terms of the
Elf Licence; and the scope of such direct license, the licensed territory or the
duration of the license grant shall be comparable to the corresponding terms
granted to Adaptimmune under this Agreement; provided that Adaptimmune will be
granted at least the same scope of rights as it obtained from Universal under
this Agreement. For the sake of clarity, the financial terms, including without
limitation, the running royalty rate and milestone payments, shall be identical
to the corresponding financial terms set forth in the Elf Licence. Universal
shall keep Adaptimmune informed of all material changes to the Elf Licence,
including changes to the financial terms that Adaptimmune would be required to
accept under this Section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Adaptimmune’s
right to enter into such direct license shall be conditioned upon:

10.2.3.4 Certification that Conditions Satisfied. Adaptimmune using reasonable
efforts to certify or otherwise demonstrate that the conditions set forth in the
above subsections subsections have been met within 30 days of expiration of the
Initial Notice Period (or within such longer period of





 




time as University agrees is reasonable under the circumstances, based on the
nature and extent of any documentation reasonably requested by University); and

10.2.3.5 Time Limitations. Such negotiations for a direct license not exceeding
90 days from the end of the 30-day (or longer, if applicable) period described
in subsection 9.2.3.2 “Adaptimmune Certification that Conditions Satisfied”

University and Adaptimmune). University may, at its sole discretion, waive any
of these requirements. If all of the conditions set forth in this Subsection
9.2.3 “Termination of Sublicenses” are met, then Adaptimmune will be granted
such direct license by University. If any condition set forth in this Section
10.2.3 “Termination of Sublicenses” is not met, then after expiration of any
time period granted to Adaptimmune with respect to meeting such condition,
Adaptimmune shall not make, have made, use, offer to sell or sell, offer to
lease or lease, import, or otherwise offer to dispose or dispose of Licensed
Products and University shall be free to license or not license Licensed Patents

University’s rights in certain patents and patent applications listed in Section
A1 “Licensed Patents” of Exhibit A “Patent License Schedule” have been licensed
to a third party prior to this Agreement on a co-exclusive basis, as defined
below;

Company desires that University grant it a license to use, develop, and

following: (i) whether Company has been engaged in Sublicensing negotiations
with such Third Party, (ii) the terms of such Sublicense offered by Company to
such Third Party, and (iii) the length of time over such negotiations have

Company’s receipt of University’s notification:

3.5.1. Company Development Plan. Provide University with a reasonable rationale

offices and foreign counsel, and University shall seek input from the Company on
the prosecution of the Licensed Patents. Once Company begins reimbursing
University for Patent Expenses pursuant to Section A4 “Patent Cost

value of transactions conducted in non-United States dollar currencies.

6.3. Late Payments. University may charge Company a late fee for all amounts
owed to University that are overdue by 30 days or more. The late fee will be
computed as [***] plus [***]%, compounded monthly, as set forth by The Wall

of a late fee will not foreclose or limit University from exercising any other
rights it may have as a consequence of the lateness of any payment.

6.4. Sales Reports. Within 30 days after the last day of each calendar quarter
commencing the calendar quarter after Company effects its first commercial sale
of a Licensed Product and during the term of this Agreement, Company shall
deliver to University a written sales report (a copy of the form of which is

period in the case of failure of Company to report or make payment pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement or to verify Company’s compliance with its payment
obligations hereunder. Company shall cause each Sublicensee that manufactures,
sells, leases, or otherwise disposes of Licensed Products on behalf of Company
to grant University the right to inspect and audit Sublicensee’s records.

photocopies) of any pertinent portions of the records and books of account.

6.5.5. Costs of Audit. If Company’s royalties calculated for any calendar year
quarterly period are under-reported by more than 5%, the costs of any audit and
review initiated by University will be borne by Company; otherwise, University

7. Infringement.

7.1. Third-Party Infringement of a Licensed Patent.

7.1.1. Notice of Third Party’s Infringement. If a Party learns of substantial,
credible evidence that a Third Party is infringing a Licensed Patent in the
Field of Use in the Territory, that Party will promptly deliver written notice
of the possible infringement to the other Party, describing in detail all
relevant information to which that Party has access or control suggesting
infringement of the Licensed Patent.

7.1.1. Company’s First Right to Settle. During the term of this Agreement,
Company has the first right to respond to, defend, and prosecute in its own name
and at its own expense actions or suits relating to exclusively Licensed
Patents. To enjoy said first right, Company must initiate bona fide action to
respond to any alleged infringement within 90 days of learning of said
infringement. If required by law, University agrees to be joined as a party
plaintiff; provided that Company must notify University at least 10 days before
filing suit and provided that Company shall reimburse University for all
reasonable legal fees and costs incident thereto. Company shall not settle any
suits or actions in any manner relating to the Licensed Patents without
obtaining the prior written consent of University. University will work with
Company and Third Party Co-Licensee to determine the best course of action for
dealing with infringement of Group 2 Licensed Patents.

7.1.1.1. Distribution of Proceeds from Settlement. Out of any proceeds from any
settlement for infringement of Licensed Patents led by Company, Company is
allowed to first recover its reasonable attorney’s fees and other out-of-pocket
expenses directly related to any action, suit, or settlement for infringement of
Licensed Patents. Any remaining proceeds will be distributed as follows: Company
shall retain [***]% and shall distribute [***]% to University. Any payment by an
alleged infringer that constitutes consideration for Net Sales of infringing
product, however, will be handled according to the payment provisions of Article
6 “Payments, Reimbursements, Reports, and Records” and Section A3.1 “Running
Royalty Payments” of Exhibit A “Patent License Schedule”. Any payment by an
alleged infringer that constitutes consideration for the grant of a Sublicense
will be handled according to Section A3.8 “Sublicensing Consideration” of
Exhibit A “Patent License Schedule”.

7.1.1.2. Limitation on Infringement Actions. Excluded from the rights granted
herein is the right to bring an infringement action against any inventor or
their present or future not-for-profit employers, for infringement of the
Licensed Patents in carrying out not-for-profit research.





 




7.1.2. University Right to Institute Action. If Company has first right to
pursue infringers and fails, within 90 days of learning of an alleged
infringement, to secure cessation of the infringement, institute suit against
the infringer, or to provide to University satisfactory evidence that Company is
engaged in bona fide negotiations for the acceptance by infringer of a
Sublicense in and to relevant patents in Licensed Patents for the Field of Use,
then University may, upon written notice to Company, assume full right and
responsibility to secure cessation of the infringement, institute suit against
the infringer, or secure acceptance of a Sublicense by Company from the alleged
infringer in and to relevant patents in Licensed Patents. Such license shall not
be subject to Company’s approval. If University, in accordance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, chooses to institute suit against an alleged
infringer, University may bring such suit in its own name (or, if required by
law, in its and Company’s name) and at its own expense, and Company shall, but
at University’s expense for Company’s direct associated expenses, fully and
promptly cooperate and assist University in connection with any such suit. All
license fees, royalties, damages, awards, or settlement proceeds arising from a
University-initiated action will be solely for the account of University.

7.1.3. No Obligation to Institute Action. Neither Company nor University is
obligated under this Agreement to institute or prosecute a suit against any
alleged infringer of Licensed Patents.

8. Patent Validity.

8.1. Notice and Investigation of Third Party Challenges. If any Third Party
challenges the validity or enforceability of any of the Licensed Patents, the
Party having such information shall immediately notify the other Party.





 




8.2. Tender to University of Third Party Actions. In the event of Third Party
legal action challenging the validity or enforceability of any of the Licensed
Patents, University, at its sole discretion, shall have the right to assume and
control the sole defense of the claim at University’s expense. If University
opts not to assume and control the sole defense of the claim within 30 days
after becoming aware of challenge, Company shall have the right to assume the
defense of the claim at its own expense. Company shall not settle any suits or
actions in any manner relating to the Licensed Patents without obtaining the
prior written consent of University.

8.3. Enforceability of Licensed Patents. Notwithstanding challenge by any Third
Party, any Licensed Patent will be enforceable under this Agreement until such
Licensed Patent is determined to be invalid.

9. Termination.

9.1. By University.

9.1.1. Breach by Company. If Company breaches or fails to perform one or more of
its material duties under this Agreement, University may deliver to Company a
written notice of default. University may terminate this Agreement by delivering
to Company a written notice of termination if the default has not cured in full
within 60 days of the delivery to Company of the notice of default.

9.1.2. Events of Default. University may terminate this Agreement by delivering
to Company a written notice of termination at least 10 days prior to the date of
termination if Company (i) becomes insolvent; (ii) voluntarily files or has
filed against it a petition under applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws that
Company fails to have released within 30 days after filing; (iii) proposes any
dissolution, composition, or financial reorganization with creditors or if a
receiver, trustee, custodian, or similar agent is appointed; (iv) makes a
general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (v) if Company challenges
the validity of the Licensed Patents.





 




9.2. By Company. Company may terminate this Agreement at any time by delivering
to University a written notice of termination at least 60 days prior to the
effective date of termination.

9.3. Effect of Termination.

9.3.1. License Terminated. After termination of this Agreement, Company shall
destroy Licensed Materials, and Company shall not make, have made, use, offer to
sell or sell, offer to lease or lease, import, or otherwise offer to dispose or
dispose of Licensed Products.

9.3.2. Final Report to University. Within 60 days after the end of the calendar
quarter following the expiration or termination of this Agreement, Company shall
submit a final report to University. Any payments, including those incurred but
not yet paid (such as the pro-rata minimum annual royalty, and those related to
patent expense incurred as of the date of termination but not yet paid), due to
University shall become immediately due and payable upon termination or
expiration.

9.3.3. Termination of Sublicenses. At any time within 30 days following
termination of this Agreement, a Sublicensee may notify University that it
wishes to enter into a direct license with University in order to retain its
rights to the Licensed Patents and/or Licensed Materials granted to it under its
Sublicense (such 30-day period following termination, the “Initial Notice
Period”). Following receipt of such notice, University and Sublicensee shall
enter into a license agreement the terms of which shall be substantially similar
to the terms of this Agreement; and the scope of such direct license, the
licensed territory or the duration of the license grant shall be comparable to
the corresponding terms granted by the Company to such Sublicensee; provided
that such Sublicensee will be granted at least the same scope of rights as it
obtained from Company under its Sublicense. For the sake of clarity, the
financial terms, including without limitation, the running royalty rate and
milestone payments, shall be identical to the corresponding financial terms set
forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Sublicensee’s right
to enter into such direct license shall be conditioned upon:





 




9.3.3.1. Written Notification to University. Such Sublicensee informing
University in writing, pursuant to Article 21 “Notices”, that it wishes to enter
into such direct license with University, within the Initial Notice Period;

9.3.3.2. Sublicensee Good Standing. Such Sublicensee being in good standing with
Company under its Sublicense, and such Sublicense not being the subject of a
dispute between Sublicensee and Company, or between Company and University under
this Agreement;

9.3.3.3. Valid Sublicense. Such Sublicense having been validly entered into by
Company and Sublicensee pursuant to the terms of Section 3.1.5 “Sublicenses”;

9.3.3.4. Sublicensee Certification that Conditions Satisfied. Such Sublicensee
using reasonable efforts to certify or otherwise demonstrate that the conditions
set forth in subsections 9.3.3.1 “Written Notification to University”, 9.3.3.2
“Sublicensee Good Standing”, and 9.3.3.3 “Valid Sublicense” have been met within
30 days of expiration of the Initial Notice Period (or within such longer period
of time as University agrees is reasonable under the circumstances, based on the
nature and extent of any documentation reasonably requested by University); and

9.3.3.5. Time Limitations. Such negotiations for a direct license not exceeding
90 days from the end of the 30-day (or longer, if applicable) period described
in subsection 9.3.3.4 “Sublicensee Certification that Conditions Satisfied”
(subject to extension of said 90-day period by mutual written agreement of
University and Sublicensee).

University may, at its sole discretion, waive any of these requirements. If all
of the conditions set forth in this Section 9.3.3 “Termination of Sublicenses”
are met, then Sublicensee will be granted such direct license by University. If
any condition set forth in this Section 9.3.3 “Termination of Sublicenses” is
not met, then after expiration of any time period granted to Sublicensee with
respect to meeting such condition (for example and to the extent applicable, the
Initial Notice Period and/or the periods described in Subsections 9.3.3.4
“Sublicensee Certification that Conditions Satisfied” and 9.3.3.5 “Time
Limitations”), Sublicensee shall not make, have made, use, offer to sell or
sell, offer to





 




lease or lease, import, or otherwise offer to dispose or dispose of Licensed
Products and University shall be free to license or not license Licensed Patents
to such Sublicensee according to its sole discretion.

10. Release, Indemnification, and Insurance.

10.1. Company’s Release. For itself and its employees, Company hereby releases
University and its regents, employees, and agents forever from any suits,
actions, claims, liabilities, demands, damages, losses, or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ and investigative expenses) relating to or arising out of
(i) the manufacture, use, lease, sale, or other disposition of a Licensed
Product or Licensed Material; or (ii) the assigning or sublicensing of Company’s
rights under this Agreement.

10.2. Company’s Indemnification. Throughout the term of this Agreement and
thereafter, Company shall indemnify, defend, and hold University and its
regents, employees, and agents harmless from all suits, actions, claims,
liabilities, demands, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys’ and investigative expenses), relating to or arising out of the
manufacture, use, lease, sale, or other disposition of a Licensed Product or
Licensed Materials, including, without limitation, personal injury, property
damage, breach of contract and warranty and products-liability claims relating
to a Licensed Product or Licensed Materials and claims brought by a Sublicensee.

10.3. Company’s Insurance.

during such period as the Parties shall agree in writing, Company shall
maintain, and shall cause each Sublicensee to maintain, in full force and effect
commercial general liability (CGL) insurance, with single claim limits
consistent with industry standards. Such insurance policy will include coverage
for claims that may be asserted by University against Company under section 10.2
“Company’s Indemnification”. Such insurance policy must name the Board of
Regents of the University of Washington as an additional insured and will
require the insurer to deliver written notice to University at the address set
forth in Article 21 “Notices” of this Agreement, at least 45 days prior to the
termination of the policy. Company shall deliver to University a copy of the
certificate of insurance for such policy.





 




10.3.2. Clinical Trial Liability Insurance. Within 30 days prior to the
initiation of human clinical trials with respect to Licensed Products, Company
shall provide to University certificates evidencing the existence and amount of
clinical trials liability insurance. Company shall issue irrevocable
instructions to its insurance agent and to the issuing insurance company to
notify University of any discontinuance or lapse of such insurance not less than
45 days prior to the time that any such discontinuance is due to become
effective. Company shall provide University a copy of such instructions upon
their transmittal to the insurance agent and issuing insurance company. Company
shall further provide University, at least annually, proof of continued
coverage.

11. Warranties.

11.1. Authority. Each Party represents and warrants to the other Party that it

RELIANCE OR EXPECTANCY, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
OF ANY KIND.

12.2. Damage Cap.  IN NO EVENT WILL UNIVERSITY’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR THE BREACH
OR NONPERFORMANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED [***]

. THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY TO CONTRACT, TORT, AND ANY OTHER CLAIM OF WHATEVER
NATURE.





 




13. Amendment and Waiver.

This Agreement may be amended from time to time only by a written instrument
signed by the Parties. No term or provision of this Agreement will be waived and
no breach excused unless such waiver or consent will be in writing and signed by
the Party claimed to have waived or consented. No waiver of a breach will be
deemed to be a waiver of a different or subsequent breach.

14. Assignment.

The rights and licenses granted by University in this Agreement are personal to
Company and Company shall not assign its interest or delegate its duties under
this Agreement without the written consent of University; any such assignment or
delegation made without written consent of University will not release Company
from its obligations under this Agreement. The preceding sentence
notwithstanding, Company, without the prior approval of University, may assign
all, but no less than all, its rights and delegate all, but no less than all,
its duties under this Agreement to a Third Party provided that:

(i)



the assignment is made to such Third Party as a part of and in connection with
(a) the sale by Company of all but no less than all of its assets to the Third
Party, (b) the sale, transfer, or exchange by the shareholders, partners, or
equity owners of Company of a majority interest in Company to the Third Party,
or (c) the merger of Company into the Third Party (each of the events described
in part (a), (b) or (c) of this paragraph, an “Acquisition”),

(ii)



Company obtains from such Third Party written agreement to honor all obligations
under this Agreement accrued by Company before Acquisition and all obligations
under this Agreement to accrue by such Third Party assignee after Acquisition,
including any and all financial obligations, and

(iii)



no later than 10 days after the close of the transaction pursuant to which such
Acquisition is made, Company shall provide written notice to University of the
Acquisition, as well as a substitution of parties document, in which such Third
Party assignee assumes responsibility for all of Company’s





 




outstanding and future obligations relating to this Agreement. Any assignment
made in violation of this Article will be void and will, without further act,
cause the immediate termination of this Agreement, effective retroactively to
the date of the Acquisition.

This Agreement will inure to the benefit of Company and University and their
respective permitted assignees and trustees.

15. Confidentiality.

15.1. Form of transfer. Confidential Information may be conveyed in tangible or
intangible form. Disclosing Party must clearly mark its Confidential Information
“confidential.” If disclosing Party communicates Confidential Information in
non-written form, it shall reduce such communications to writing, clearly mark
it “confidential”, and provide a copy to receiving Party within 30 days of
original communication at the address in Article 21 “Notices”.

15.2. No Unauthorized Disclosure of Confidential Information. Beginning on the
Effective Date and continuing throughout the term of this Agreement and
thereafter for a period of 5 years, receiving Party shall not disclose or
otherwise make known or available to any Third Party any disclosing Party
Confidential Information, without the express prior written consent of
disclosing Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, receiving Party shall be
permitted to disclose disclosing Party Confidential Information to (i) actual or
potential investors, lenders, consultants, collaborators, Sublicensees, or
development partners, which disclosure will be made under conditions of
confidentiality and limited use and (ii) its attorney or agent as reasonably
required. In no event shall receiving Party incorporate or otherwise use
disclosing Party’s Confidential Information in connection with any patent
application filed by or on behalf of receiving Party. Receiving Party shall
restrict the use of disclosing Party’s Confidential Information exclusively to
the terms of this Agreement. Receiving Party shall use reasonable procedures to
safeguard disclosing Party’s Confidential Information. In the case where Company
is the receiving Party, Company’s confidentiality obligations will also apply
equally to Sublicensees.

15.3. Access to University Information. University is an agency of the state of
Washington and is subject to the Washington Public Records Act, RCW 42.56 et
seq., (“Act”), and no obligation assumed by University under this Agreement
shall be deemed to be inconsistent with University’s obligations as defined
under the Act and as interpreted by University in its sole discretion. If





 




University receives a request for public records under the Act for documents
containing Company Confidential Information, and if University concludes that
the documents are not otherwise exempt from public disclosure, University will
provide Company notice of the request before releasing such documents. Such
notice will be provided in a timely manner to afford Company sufficient time to
review such documents and/or seek a protective order, at Company’s expense
utilizing the procedures described in RCW 42.56.540. University shall have no
obligation to protect Company Confidential Information from disclosure in
response to a request for public records.

15.4. Disclosure as Required by Law. Either Party shall have the right to
disclose the other Party’s Confidential Information as required by law or valid
court order, provided that such Party shall inform the Party who owns such
Confidential Information prior to such disclosure and shall limit the scope and
recipient of disclosure to the extent required by such law or court order.

16. Consent and Approvals.

Except as otherwise expressly provided, all consents or approvals required under
the terms of this Agreement must be in writing and will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

17. Construction.

The headings preceding and labeling the sections of this Agreement are for the
purpose of identification only and will not in any event be employed or used for

versa, and masculine, feminine, and neuter expressions are interchangeable.

18. Enforceability.

If a court of competent jurisdiction adjudges a provision of this Agreement
unenforceable, invalid, or void, such determination will not impair the
enforceability of any of the remaining provisions hereof and the provisions will
remain in full force and effect.





 




19. No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

No provision of this Agreement, express or implied, confers upon any person
other than the Parties to this Agreement any rights, remedies, obligations, or
liabilities hereunder. No Sublicensee shall have a right to enforce or seek
damages under this Agreement.

other documents and instruments that a Party hereto elects or is required by the
terms of this Agreement to deliver to the other Party hereto will be in English.

24. Relationship of Parties.

In entering into, and performing their duties under, this Agreement, the Parties
are acting as independent contractors and independent employers. No provision of
this Agreement shall create or be construed as creating a partnership, joint
venture, or agency relationship between the Parties. No Party shall have the
authority to act for or bind the other Party in any respect.

25. Relationship with Principal Investigator.

Company acknowledges that Principal Investigator is employed by University and
has certain pre-existing obligations to University, including obligations with
respect to disclosure and ownership of intellectual property and obligations
arising from sponsored research agreements between University and Third Parties.
Accordingly, Company agrees that to the extent that any consulting agreement is
inconsistent with any of Principal Investigator’s obligations to University,
including the reporting of all inventions developed while employed by University
(regardless of where arising) and including contractual obligations arising
under any sponsored research agreements between University and Third Parties,
then Principal Investigator’s obligations to University shall prevail and to





 




such extent any inconsistent provisions of this consulting agreement shall be
deemed inapplicable and unenforceable.

26. Security Interest.

In no event shall Company grant, or permit any person to assert or perfect, a
security interest in Licensed Patents or in Company’s rights under this
Agreement.

27. Survival.

Immediately upon the termination or expiration of this Agreement all Company’s
rights under this Agreement will terminate; provided, however, Company’s
obligations that have accrued prior to the effective date of termination or
expiration of this Agreement (e.g., the obligation to report and make payments
on sales, leases, or dispositions of Licensed Products and to reimburse
University for costs) and the obligations specified in Sections 6.1 “Payments”
and 6.4 “Sales Reports” will survive. The obligations and rights set forth in
Sections 6.5 “Records Retention and Audit Rights” and 9.3 “Effect of
Termination” and Articles 10 “Release, Indemnification, and Insurance”, 11
“Warranties”, 12 “Damages”, 15 “Confidentiality”, 29 “Applicable Law” and 30
“Forum Selection” will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

28. Collection Costs and Attorneys’ Fees.

the terms of this Agreement, the other Party may recover from the non-performing
breaching Party all its costs (including actual attorneys’ and investigative
fees) to enforce the terms of this Agreement.

29. Applicable Law.

The internal laws of the state of Washington will govern the validity,
construction, and enforceability of this Agreement, without giving effect to the
conflict of laws principles thereof.





 




30. Forum Selection.

A suit, claim, or other action to enforce the terms of this Agreement will be
brought exclusively in the state and federal courts of King County, Washington.
Company hereby submits to the jurisdiction of that court and waives any
objections it may have to that court asserting jurisdiction over Company or its
assets and property.

31. Entire Agreement.

final and complete understanding between the Parties concerning licensing the
Licensed Patents. This Agreement supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous
negotiations, representations, and agreements, whether written or oral,

Exhibit C

SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT

SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT, dated the date indicated below on the signature page
hereof, by and between the Company and the University. If and when accepted by
the Company, this Subscription Agreement, when executed below, shall constitute
a subscription for that number of shares of the Securities indicated on the
attached Appendix A. All capitalized terms are defined on Appendix A.

INTENDING TO BE LEGALLY BOUND, and in consideration of the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, Company
and University hereby agree as follows:

1. Representations and Warranties of the University. The University hereby
represents and warrants to the Company as of the date of this Agreement as
follows:

1.1 The University: (a) is an Accredited Investor as that term is defined in 17
CFR § 230.501(a); (b) has been furnished with all information deemed necessary
by the University to evaluate the merits and risks of the Securities; (c) has
had the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers concerning the Company
and the Securities; and (d) has been given the opportunity to obtain any
additional information necessary to verify the accuracy of any information
obtained concerning the Company.

1.2 Ability to Bear Risk. The University is in a financial position to hold the
Securities and is able to bear the economic risk and withstand a complete loss
of the investment in the Securities.

1.3 Risk Factors. The University recognizes that the Securities as an investment
involve an extremely high degree of risk. There can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to meet its projected goals and the Company may need
significant additional capital to be successful, which capital may not be
readily





 




available or available upon terms that are not substantially dilutive to the
University. If provided, the University has reviewed the risk factors
description provided by the Company.

1.4. Sophistication. The University is a sophisticated investor, is able to fend
for itself in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of
evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment in the Securities.

1.5. Suitability. The investment in the Securities is suitable for the
University based upon its investment objectives and financial needs, and the
University has adequate net worth and means for providing for its current
financial needs and contingencies and has no need for liquidity of investment
with respect to the Securities.

1.6. Overall Commitment to Illiquid Investments. The University’s overall
commitment to investments which are illiquid or not readily marketable is not
disproportionate to its net worth, and investment in the Securities will not
cause such overall commitment to become excessive.

1.7. Restricted Securities. The University realizes that (i) none of the
Securities have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the “Act”), (ii) the Securities are characterized under the Act as “restricted
securities” and, therefore, cannot be sold or transferred unless they are
subsequently registered under the Act or an exemption from such registration is
available and (iii) there is presently no public market for the Securities and
the University may not be able to liquidate his investment in the event of an
emergency or pledge the Securities as collateral security for loans. In this
connection, the University represents that it is familiar with Rule 144
promulgated under the Act, and understands the resale limitations imposed
thereby and by the Act.

1.8. Exemption Reliance. The University has been advised that the Securities are
not being registered under the Act or the applicable state securities laws but
are being offered and sold pursuant to exemptions from such laws. The University
understands that the Company’s reliance on such exemptions is predicated in part
upon the truth and accuracy of the University’s representations in this
Agreement. The University represents and warrants that the Securities are being
purchased for its own account, for investment and without the intention of
reselling, redistributing or transferring the same, that it has made no
agreement with others regarding any of such Securities and that its financial
condition is such that it is not likely that it will be necessary to dispose of
any of such Securities in the foreseeable future.





 




2. Covenants. The University agrees that:

2.1. Transfer Restriction. The Securities for which the University hereby
subscribes shall be assigned or transferred only in accordance with all
applicable laws.

2.2. Disposition of Securities. The University shall in no event make any
disposition of all or any portion of the Securities which it is purchasing
unless and until:

a. There is then in effect a registration statement under the Act covering such
proposed disposition and such disposition is made in accordance with said
registration statement; or

b. (i) It shall have furnished the Company with an opinion of its own counsel to
the effect that such disposition will not require registration of such shares
under the Act, and (ii) such opinion of its counsel shall have been concurred in
by counsel for the Company, such concurrence not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, and the Company shall have advised the University of such concurrence;
or

c. The transfer shall comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 144 as
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or is otherwise exempt
from the registration requirements of such act.

2.3. No Revocation. The University may not cancel, terminate or revoke this
subscription, and this subscription shall be binding upon its successors and
assigns.

2.4 Execution of Related Documents. The University agrees to execute other
customary, investment-related agreements as proposed by Company and executed by
other investors in Company that contain solely one or more of the following
provisions:

 General prohibition on transfer of the Securities





 




 Right of first refusal on proposed transfer

 Right of co-sale on proposed transfer

 “Tag along, drag along” rights (both must be included)

 Market “standoff” agreements up to 180 days following an initial public
offering

provided, however, that such agreements do not discriminate against the
University and do not contain any of the following provisions:

 Rights to repurchase Securities owned by the University

 Vesting requirements applicable to Securities owned by the University

 Indemnification obligations by the University

 Requirement to vote Securities owned by the University

 Penalties on the University, or limitations on the University’s rights, as a
result of the University’s failure to make follow-on investments

 Any provision that would apply solely to the University (and not to all other
persons who hold the same type and class of Securities as the University)

 Confidentiality restrictions or limitations that purport to prevent the
University from complying with applicable open records requirements.

3. Intentionally Left Blank

4. Issuance of Stock Certificate. Company agrees to issue and deliver to the
University at the Treasury Office address provided in Appendix A a duly-executed
stock certificate promptly (and in any case within 30 days) following the
execution of this Agreement.





 




5. Governing Law; Successors. The University agrees that this Subscription
Agreement shall be enforced, governed and construed in all respects in
accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, that the rights, powers and
duties set forth herein shall be binding upon the University, its successors and
assigns, and shall inure to the benefit of its successors and assigns.

THE INVESTOR HAS BEEN ADVISED, PRIOR TO ITS PURCHASE OF THE SECURITIES, THAT
NEITHER THE OFFERING OF THE SECURITIES NOR ANY OFFERING MATERIALS HAVE BEEN
REVIEWED BY ANY ADMINISTRATOR UNDER THE ACT OR ANY OTHER APPLICABLE SECURITIES
ACT (THE “ACTS”) AND THAT NONE OF THE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER ANY
OF THE ACTS AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE RESOLD UNLESS THEY ARE REGISTERED UNDER THE
ACTS OR UNLESS AN EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION IS AVAILABLE.

NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE AGREEMENT

THIS AGREEMENT  (“Agreement”) is dated and effective as of the date of last
signature (“Effective Date”), and is made by and between the University of
Washington, a public institution of higher education and an agency of the state
of Washington acting through its administrative offices at UW Center for
Commercialization, 4311 Eleventh Avenue NE, Suite 500, Seattle, WA 98105
(“University”), and Universal Cells, a Corporation under the laws of the state
of Washington (“Company”), agree as follows:

1. BACKGROUND

1.1 University has certain rights to Biological Material known as New naive
human embryonic stem cell line - Elf1 (as defined in Section 2.1), developed in
the laboratory of Dr. Carol Ware.

1.2 University desires to have Biological Material marketed at the earliest
possible time in order that products resulting therefrom may be available for
public use and benefit.

1.3 Company has previously entered into an exclusive license agreement with
University for inventions and materials related to or useful for
Adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene targeting and HLA engineering, UW Ref
# 34243A on June 27, 2014 “Exclusive Agreement”.

1.4 Company wishes to acquire a license to said Biological Material to make,
use, and sell Licensed Product(s) in the Internal Research Field of Use and
Product Field of Use.

2. DEFINITIONS

2.1 “Biological Material” means New naive human embryonic stem cell line - Elf1
(with a University Reference UW # 45910).

2.2 “Internal Research Field of Use” means internal research. Internal Research
Field of Use specifically excludes any use which requires regulatory approval,
including any in vitro and in vivo diagnostic or therapeutic applications.

2.3 “Product Field of Use” means in vivo therapeutics excluding any therapeutic
agent for cardiac regeneration and cardiovascular disease.





 




2.4 “Licensed Product” means any product or good or service that is a
Modification and is used, made by, made for, sold, transferred, offered for
sale, imported or otherwise disposed of during the term of this Agreement..

2.5 “Licensed Territory” means worldwide.

2.6 “Modifications” means any derivatives or modifications of Biological
Material that, but for the rights granted under Exclusive Agreement, would
otherwise infringe a Valid Claim of Groups 2 and 3 Licensed Patents as defined
in Exclusive Agreement as originally executed. Modifications generated at
University and to be provided to Company are listed in Section A1 “UW Materials
to be Delivered” in Exhibit A.

2.7 [***]





 




2.8 “Product Family 1” means Licensed Products in which Company receives no
further consideration (including but not limited to royalties and/or
commissions) beyond the price for the initial sale and limited to sales to
end-users for research and development purposes. “Product Family 2” means
Licensed Products that requires regulatory approval, including any in vitro and
in vivo diagnostic or therapeutic applications.

2.9 “Service Partner” means a legal entity that is a Third Party with whom
Licensee has contracted to provide services within the Internal Research Field
of Use and Product Field of Use. For clarity, a legal entity is only a Service
Partner for so long as the definition remains true. If such entity terminates
its contractual obligation with Licensee, it thereafter is an arm-length Third
Party for the purposes of this Agreement.

2.10 “Sublicense” means the grant by Company to a Third Party of any license,
option, first right to negotiate, or other right granted in the Licensed
Products, in whole or in part. For the avoidance of doubt, any sale of a
Licensed Product by Company or Sublicensee to an arm’s length Third Party
distributor (“Distributor”) for resale of Licensed Product by the Distributor,
and where Distributor has no other rights other than to resell Licensed Product,
and for which resale Company and Sublicensees receive no further consideration
(including but not limited to royalties and/or commissions) beyond the price for
the initial sale to the Distributor shall be considered a sale, and shall not be
a considered a Sublicense.

2.11 “Sublicensee” means a Third Party holding a Sublicense under the
Modifications.

2.12 “Sublicensing Consideration” means all consideration, including but not
limited to upfront fees, milestone payments, maintenance fees, non-cash
consideration, and premiums over Fair Market Value of stock, but excluding
royalties, payable by each Sublicensee for the grant of a Sublicense. For
avoidance of doubt, consideration paid to Company by Sublicensees for the
performance of bona fide product development work, research work, clinical
studies and regulatory approvals performed by Company, pursuant to and as
supported by an express agreement including a performance plan and commensurate
budget is not deemed to be Sublicensing Consideration.





 




2.13 “Third-Party” means any individual or entity other than University and
Company.

3. GRANT

3.1 University hereby grants, and Company accepts, a nonexclusive license to
make and use Biological Material for Internal Research Field of Use only.
Company shall not transfer Biological Material to any Third-Party, including
Sublicencee(s) for any purpose.

3.2 University hereby grants, and Company accepts, a nonexclusive license in the
(i) Product Field of Use and Licensed Territory to make, use, offer, and sell
Licensed Product(s) for Product Family 2 and (ii) make, use, offer, and sell
Licensed Products in the Internal Research Field of Use for Product Family 1.

3.3 Service Partners of Licensee. Licensee shall have the right to transfer
Modifications to Service Partners working on behalf of Licensee solely for the
purpose of carrying out services in direct connection with using the
Modifications in the Internal Field of Use and Product Field of Use. Any such

agreement between Licensee and such Service Partner which (a) shall be in
writing, (b) shall be subject to, subordinate to, and consistent with, the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, (c) shall not adversely affect the rights of
University or limit the obligations of Licensee under this Agreement, (d) shall
contain terms substantially similar to those contained in this Agreement, and
(e) shall expressly provide that the Service Partner has no rights to use the

connection with the Licensed Field of Use, and that such Service Partner shall
not transfer the Modifications to any Third-Party. Licensee will be responsible
for the performance of all Service Partner in compliance with all obligations of
Licensee under this Agreement. For purposes of clarity, Company has no right to
transfer Biological Material to Service Partners.

3.4 Sublicenses. Company has the right, exercisable from time to time during the
term of this Agreement, to Sublicense its rights in the Product Field of Use
granted in Paragraph 3.2 of this Agreement, including for evaluation of the
suitability of Licensed Products as a therapeutic product for limited time
periods





 




(“Evaluation Period”). Said right does not include the right to transfer
Licensed Products(s) to Third Parties or affiliates for resale other than as
incorporated in a therapeutic product. Company shall remain responsible for its
obligations under this Agreement, and shall ensure that the Sublicense
agreement: i) contains terms and conditions requesting Sublicensee to comply
with the applicable terms and conditions under this Agreement (including a
release substantially similar to that provided by Company in Section 6.1

Sublicenses” is not met, then after expiration of any time period granted to
Sublicensee with respect to meeting such condition (for example and to the
extent applicable, the Initial Notice Period and/or the periods described in
Subsections 10.2.3.4 “Sublicensee Certification that Conditions Satisfied” and
10.2.3.5 “Time Limitations”), Sublicensee shall not make, have made, use, offer

termination of this Agreement (e.g., the obligation to report and make payments
on sales, leases, or dispositions of Licensed Products ) and the obligations
specified in Sections 4.1 “Payments” and 4.2 “Sales Reports” will survive. The
