  (b)

the actions permitted under the Existing Facilities (prior to discharge) as they

7.

INTEREST

 

7.1

Calculation of interest

The rate of interest on each Interim Loan for its Interest Period is the
percentage rate per annum equal to the aggregate of:

 

  (a)

the Margin; and

 

  (b)

the LIBOR for that Interest Period.

 

7.2

Payment of interest

 

  (a)

The period for which each Interim Loan is outstanding shall be divided into
successive interest periods (each, an “Interest Period”), each of which will
start on the expiry of the previous Interest Period or, in the case of the first
Interest Period for an Interim Loan, on the relevant Drawdown Date.

 

  (b)

The Borrower of each Interim Loan shall select an Interest Period of one (1),
two (2), three (3) or four (4) weeks, two (2) months or ninety (90) days (or any
other period agreed with the Interim Facility Agent) in each Drawdown Request
and (in relation to subsequent Interest Periods for the Interim Loans)
thereafter no later than 09.30 a.m. (London time) one Business Day prior to the
end of the existing Interest Period for the outstanding Interim Loans.

 

  (c)

If the Borrower does not select an Interest Period for an Interim Loan, the
default Interest Period shall (subject to paragraph (e) below) be four (4) weeks
(or, if earlier, a period ending on (i) in respect of any UK Interim Asset Sale
Bridge Facility Loan, the Final Repayment Date applicable to the UK Interim
Asset Sale Bridge Facility, or (ii) in respect of any UK Interim Cash
Confirmation Bridge Facility Loan, the Final Repayment Date applicable to the UK
Interim Cash Confirmation Bridge Facility).

 

  (d)

The Borrower must pay accrued interest on each Interim Loan made to it on the
last day of each Interest Period in respect of that Interim Loan and on any date
on which that Interim Loan is repaid or prepaid.

 

  (e)

Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above, no Interest Period will
(i) in respect of any UK Interim Asset Sale Bridge Facility Loan, extend beyond
the Final Repayment Date applicable to the UK Interim Asset Sale Bridge
Facility, or (ii) in respect of any UK Interim Cash Confirmation Bridge Facility
Loan, extend beyond the Final Repayment Date applicable to the UK Interim Cash
Confirmation Bridge Facility.

 

  (f)

If an Interest Period would otherwise end on a day which is not a Business Day,
that Interest Period will instead end on the next Business Day in that calendar
month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not),
provided that no Interest Period will (i) in respect of any UK Interim Asset
Sale Bridge Facility Loan, extend beyond the Final Repayment Date applicable to
the UK Interim Asset Sale Bridge Facility, or (ii) in respect of any UK Interim
Cash Confirmation Bridge Facility Loan, extend beyond the Final Repayment Date
applicable to the UK Interim Cash Confirmation Bridge Facility.

 

7



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  (g)

If there is a repayment, prepayment or recovery of all or any part of an Interim
Loan other than on the last day of its Interest Period, the Borrower will pay
the Interim Finance Parties promptly following demand their break costs (if
any). The break costs (the “Break Costs”) will be the amount by which:

 

  (i)

LIBOR (disregarding for this purpose any interest rate floor) which would have
been payable at the end of the relevant Interest Period on the amount of the
Interim Loan repaid, prepaid or recovered; exceeds

 

  (ii)

if positive, the amount of interest the Interim Lenders would have received by
placing a deposit equal to the relevant amount with leading banks in the
relevant interbank market for a period starting on the Business Day following
receipt and ending on the last day of the relevant Interest Period.

 

7.3

Interest on overdue amounts

 

  (a)

If the Borrower fails to pay when due any amount payable by it under the Interim
Finance Documents, it must immediately on demand by the Interim Facility Agent
pay interest on the overdue amount from its due date up to the date of actual
payment, both before, on and after judgment.

 

  (b)

Interest on an overdue amount is payable at a rate determined by the Interim
Facility Agent to be one (1) per cent. per annum above the rate which would have
been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment,
constituted part of that Interim Loan.

 

  (c)

Interest (if unpaid) on an overdue amount will be compounded with that overdue
amount on the last day of each Interest Period (or such duration as selected by
the Interim Facility Agent acting reasonably) to the extent permitted under any
applicable law and regulation.

 

7.4

Interest calculation

 

  (a)

Interest shall be paid in the currency of the relevant Interim Loan and shall
accrue from day to day and be calculated on the basis of the actual number of
days elapsed and a 365 day year.

 

  (b)

The Interim Facility Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Party of the
determination of a rate of interest under this Agreement.

 

7.5

Replacement of Screen Rate

 

  (a)

Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c) below, any amendment or waiver which relates
to providing for an additional or alternative benchmark rate, base rate or
reference rate to apply in relation to that currency in place of that Screen
Rate for an applicable Interim Facility (including any amendment, replacement or
waiver to the definition of “LIBOR” or “Screen Rate”, including an alternative
or additional page, service or method for the determination thereof) (or which
relates to aligning any provision of an Interim Finance Document to the use of
that other benchmark rate, base rate or reference rate, including making
appropriate adjustments to this Agreement for basis, duration, time and
periodicity

 

8



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  for determination of that other benchmark rate, base rate or reference rate
for any Interest Period and making other consequential and/or incidental
changes) (a “Benchmark Rate Change”) may be made with the consent of the
Majority Interim Lenders participating in the applicable Interim Facility to
which that Benchmark Rate Change shall apply and the Borrower.

 

  (b)

If either the Borrower or the Interim Facility Agent (acting on the instructions
of the Majority Interim Lenders) requests the making of a Benchmark Rate Change,
the Borrower shall notify the Interim Facility Agent (or, as the case may be,
the Interim Facility Agent shall notify the Borrower) thereof and if such
Benchmark Rate Change cannot be agreed upon by the date which is five
(5) Business Days before the end of the current Interest Period (or in the case
of a new Interim Loan, the date which is five (5) Business Days before the date
upon which the Drawdown Request will be served, as notified by the Borrower to
the Interim Facility Agent), the Screen Rate applicable to any Interim Lender’s
share of an Interim Loan shall be replaced by the rate certified to the Interim
Facility Agent by that Interim Lender as soon as practicable (and in any event
by the date falling two (2) Business Days before the date on which interest is
due to be paid in respect of the relevant Interest Period) to be that which
expresses as a percentage rate per annum of the cost to the relevant Interim
Lender of funding its participation in that Interim Loan in the relevant
interbank market.

 

  (c)

Notwithstanding the definitions of “LIBOR” or “Screen Rate” in Schedule 1
(Definitions and Interpretation) or any other term of any Interim Finance
Document, the Interim Facility Agent may from time to time (with the prior
written consent of the Borrower) specify a Benchmark Rate Change for any
currency for the purposes of the Interim Finance Documents, and each Interim
Lender authorises the Interim Facility Agent to make such specification.

 

7.6

Absence of quotations

If LIBOR is to be determined by reference to the Reference Banks but a Reference
Bank does not supply a quotation by 12.00 noon (London time) on the Rate Fixing
Day then LIBOR shall be determined on the basis of the quotations of the
remaining Reference Banks, subject to Clause 7.7 (Market Disruption Notice).

 

7.7

Market Disruption Notice

If, in relation to any actual or proposed Interim Loan (a “Disrupted Loan”):

 

  (a)

LIBOR is to be determined by reference to rates supplied by Reference Banks and
none or only one of the Reference Banks supplies a rate by 12.00 noon (London
time) on the Rate Fixing Day; or

 

  (b)

before close of business in London on the Rate Fixing Day for the relevant
Interest Period, one or more Interim Lenders whose participations in that
Disrupted Loan equal or exceed in aggregate forty (40) per cent. of the amount
of that Disrupted Loan notify the Interim Facility Agent that by reason of
circumstances affecting the relevant interbank market generally the cost to
those Interim Lenders of obtaining matching deposits in the relevant interbank
market would be in excess of LIBOR,

the Interim Facility Agent will promptly give notice of that event to the
Borrower and the Interim Lenders (a “Market Disruption Notice”).

 

9



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.8

Proposed Disrupted Loans

If a Market Disruption Notice is given in respect of a proposed Disrupted Loan,
the interest rate applicable on each Interim Lender’s participation in that
Disrupted Loan will be the rate certified by that Interim Lender to the Interim
Facility Agent no later than five (5) Business Days after the Rate Fixing Day to
be its cost of funds (from any source which it may reasonably select) plus the
Margin.

 

8.

TAXES

 

8.1

Gross-up

 

  (a)

The Borrower must make all payments under the Interim Finance Documents without
any Tax Deduction, unless a Tax Deduction is required by law.

 

  (b)

If the Borrower or an Interim Lender becomes aware that the Borrower must make a
Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax
Deduction), it shall promptly notify the Interim Facility Agent. Failure to give
such notice shall not affect the obligations of the Borrower under the Interim
Finance Documents. If the Interim Facility Agent receives such notification from
an Interim Lender it shall notify the Borrower.

 

  (c)

If any Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by the Borrower (or by the
Interim Facility Agent on behalf of the Borrower):

 

  (i)

except as provided in Clause 8.2 (Exceptions from gross-up), the amount of the
payment due from the Borrower will be increased to an amount which (after taking
into account any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the amount which would
have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required; and

 

  (ii)

the Borrower will:

 

  (A)

ensure that the Tax Deduction and any payment required in connection with it
does not exceed the minimum amount required by law;

 

  (B)

make the Tax Deduction and any payment required in connection with such Tax
Deduction within the time allowed by law; and

 

  (C)

within thirty (30) days of making any Tax Deduction or any payment to the
relevant Tax authorities required in connection with it, deliver to the Interim
Facility Agent (for the Interim Finance Party entitled to the payment) evidence
satisfactory to that Interim Finance Party (acting reasonably) that such Tax
Deduction has been made or (as applicable) such payment paid to the appropriate
authority.

 

  (d)

Each Treaty Interim Lender, or Interim Lender that would have been a Treaty
Interim Lender but for such Interim Lender’s failure to complete any necessary
procedural formalities, upon reasonable request shall co-operate with the
Borrower in completing any procedural formalities necessary for the Borrower to
obtain authorisation to make a payment to that Interim Lender either without a
Tax Deduction or, where a payment cannot be made without a Tax Deduction, with a
reduced Tax Deduction, and maintain that authorisation where an authorisation
expires or otherwise ceases to have effect.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(e)

 

  (i)

A Treaty Interim Lender which is an Original Interim Lender and that holds a
passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme, and which wishes that scheme
to apply to this Agreement, shall confirm its scheme reference number and its
jurisdiction of tax residence opposite its name in Schedule 8 (The Original
Interim Lenders); and

 

  (ii)

a New Interim Lender that is a Treaty Interim Lender which is not an Original
Interim Lender and that holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport
scheme, and which wishes that scheme to apply to this Agreement, shall confirm
its scheme reference number and its jurisdiction of tax residence in the
Transfer Certificate or Assignment Agreement which it executes,

and, having done so, that Interim Lender shall be under no obligation pursuant
to paragraph (d) above.

 

  (f)

If an Interim Lender has confirmed its scheme reference number and its
jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with paragraph (e) above and:

 

  (i)

a Borrower making a payment to that Interim Lender has not made a Borrower DTTP
Filing in respect of that Interim Lender; or

 

  (ii)

a Borrower making a payment to that Interim Lender has made a Borrower DTTP
Filing in respect of that Interim Lender but:

 

  (A)

that Borrower DTTP Filing has been rejected by HM Revenue & Customs; or

 

  (B)

HM Revenue & Customs has not given the Borrower authority to make payments to
that Interim Lender without a Tax Deduction within 30 days of the date of the
Borrower DTTP Filing,

and in each case, the Borrower has notified that Interim Lender in writing, that
Interim Lender and the Borrower shall co-operate in completing any additional
procedural formalities necessary for that Borrower to obtain authorisation to
make that payment without a Tax Deduction.

 

  (g)

If an Interim Lender has not confirmed its scheme reference number and
jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with paragraph (e) above, no
Borrower shall make a Borrower DTTP Filing or file any other form relating to
the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme in respect of that Interim Lender’s Interim
Commitment(s) or its participation in any Loan unless the Interim Lender
otherwise agrees.

 

  (h)

The Borrower shall, promptly on making a Borrower DTTP Filing, deliver a copy of
that Borrower DTTP Filing to the Agent for delivery to the relevant Interim
Lender.

 

8.2

Exceptions from gross-up

The Borrower is not required to make any increased payment to an Interim Lender
under Clause 8.1 (Gross-up) by reason of a Tax Deduction if:

 

  (a)

the Tax Deduction is the result of Taxes described in paragraph (b)(i) of Clause
8.3    (Tax indemnity); or

 

11



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  (b)

the Tax Deduction is on account of Tax imposed by the United Kingdom and:

 

  (i)

on the date the payment falls due the payment could have been made to the
relevant Interim Lender without the Tax Deduction if the Interim Lender had been
a Qualifying Interim Lender, but on that date that Interim Lender is not or has
ceased to be a Qualifying Interim Lender (unless that Interim Lender has ceased
to be a Qualifying Interim Lender as a result of a Change of Law); or

 

  (ii)

the Borrower is able to demonstrate such Tax Deduction is the result of, or has
been increased by, that Interim Lender’s failure to comply with its obligations
under paragraph (d) of Clause 8.1 (Gross-up).

 

  (c)

If, in relation to Tax imposed by the United Kingdom:

 

  (i)

a Tax Deduction is required by law in respect of a payment made by or on account
of the Borrower to an Interim Lender under an Interim Finance Document;

 

  (ii)

the Borrower was unaware, and could not reasonably be expected to have been
aware, that the Tax Deduction was required and as a result does not make the Tax
Deduction; and

 

  (iii)

the Borrower is not required to make an increased payment under Clause 8.1(c)
above in respect of that Tax Deduction,

then the Interim Lender that received the payment in respect of which the Tax
Deduction should have been made undertakes as soon as reasonably practicable to
reimburse the Borrower for the amount of the Tax Deduction that should have been
made (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not any penalty or interest payable in
connection with any failure to pay or any delay in paying the Tax Deduction to a
relevant Tax Authority) less reasonably incurred costs of reimbursement.

 

8.3

Tax indemnity

 

  (a)

The Borrower shall (or shall procure that another Group Company will) (within
five (5) Business Days of demand by the Interim Facility Agent) pay to an
Interim Finance Party an amount equal to the loss, liability or cost which that
Interim Finance Party determines (acting reasonably and in good faith) will be
or has been (directly or indirectly) suffered for or on account of Tax by that
Interim Finance Party in relation to a payment received or receivable from the
Borrower under an Interim Finance Document.

 

  (b)

Paragraph (a) above shall not apply:

 

  (i)

to any Tax assessed on an Interim Finance Party under the law of the
jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) in which:

 

  (A)

that Interim Finance Party is incorporated or, if different, in which that
Interim Finance Party is treated as resident for tax purposes; or

 

  (B)

that Interim Finance Party’s Facility Office or other permanent establishment is
located in respect of amounts received or receivable in that

 

12



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) or in respect of amounts
attributed to the permanent establishment on the basis that personnel of the
Interim Finance Party are undertaking relevant functions in the jurisdiction (or
any political subdivision thereof) where that permanent establishment is
located; or

 

  (C)

that Interim Finance Party has a present or former connection (other than any
connection arising solely under this Interim Facility or any transactions
contemplated thereby) in respect of amounts received or receivable under the
Interim Finance Documents in that jurisdiction,

if that Tax is imposed on or calculated by reference to the net income received
or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by that
Interim Finance Party or if that Tax is a franchise Tax, branch profits Tax or
similar Tax; or

 

  (ii)

to the extent a loss or liability:

 

  (A)

is compensated for by payment of an amount under Clause 8.1 (Gross-up);

 

  (B)

would have been compensated for by payment of an increased amount under Clause
8.1 (Gross-up) but was not so compensated solely because one of the exclusions
in Clause 8.2 (Exceptions from gross-up) applied;

 

  (C)

is compensated for by payment of an amount under Clause 8.6 (Stamp Taxes) or
Clause 8.7 (Value added taxes) or would have been compensated for by payment of
an increased amount under such Clauses but was not so compensated solely because
one of the exclusions in the applicable Clause applied;

 

  (D)

(for the avoidance of doubt) is suffered or incurred in respect of any Bank Levy
(or any payment attributable to, or liability arising as a consequence of, a
Bank Levy); or

 

  (E)

relates to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a party.

 

  (c)

An Interim Finance Party making, or intending to make a claim under paragraph
(a) above shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Interim Facility Agent of
the event which has given, or will give, rise to the claim.

 

8.4

Tax Credit

If the Borrower or a Group Company pays an additional amount under Clause 8.1
(Gross-up) or Clause 8.3 (Tax indemnity) and an Interim Finance Party determines
(in good faith) that it (or one of its Affiliates) has obtained and utilised a
Tax Credit attributable to that additional amount or the Tax Deduction in
consequence of which the additional amount was required, then, subject to the
penultimate sentence of this Clause 8.4, that Interim Finance Party shall pay to
the Borrower or that Group Company (as the case may be) an amount equal to such
Tax Credit (but only to the extent of the additional amounts paid under Clause
8.1 (Gross-up) or Clause 8.3 (Tax indemnity) with respect to the Taxes giving
rise to such Tax Credit and subject to that penultimate sentence), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such Interim Finance Party and its
Affiliates (as applicable) and without interest (other than any interest paid by
the relevant governmental or

 

13



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tax authority with respect to such Tax Credit); provided that, the Borrower,
upon the request of such Interim Finance Party, shall repay to such Interim
Finance Party the amount paid over pursuant to this Clause 8.4 in the event that
such Interim Finance Party (or any of its Affiliates) is required to repay such
Tax Credit to the relevant governmental or tax authority or it otherwise
transpires that the Interim Finance Party is unable to obtain and utilize the
Tax Credit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Clause 8.4, in no
event will the Interim Finance Party be required to pay any amount to the
Borrower pursuant to this Clause 8.4 the payment of which would place the
Interim Finance Party and its Affiliates in a less favourable net after-Tax
position than the Interim Finance Party and its Affiliates would have been in if
the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such Tax Credit had not
been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or
additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This Clause 8.4
shall not be construed to require any Interim Finance Party to make available
its Tax returns (or the Tax returns of any Affiliate) (or any other information
relating to its or any of its Affiliate’s Taxes that it deems confidential) to
the Borrower or any other Person.

 

8.5

Interim Lender Status Confirmation

 

  (a)

Each Interim Lender which becomes a Party to this Agreement after the date of
this Agreement shall indicate, in the Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement
or Increase Confirmation which it executes on becoming a Party, and for the
benefit of the Interim Facility Agent and without liability to the Borrower,
which of the following categories it falls in respect of the United Kingdom:

 

  (i)

not a Qualifying Interim Lender;

 

  (ii)

a Qualifying Interim Lender (other than a Treaty Interim Lender); or

 

  (iii)

a Treaty Interim Lender.

 

  (b)

To the extent that a New Interim Lender fails to indicate its status in
accordance with this Clause 8.5 then such New Interim Lender shall be treated
for the purposes of this Agreement (including by the Borrower) as if it is not a
Qualifying Interim Lender until such time as it notifies the Interim Facility
Agent which category applies (and the Interim Facility Agent, upon receipt of
such notification, shall inform the Borrower).

 

  (c)

For the avoidance of doubt, a Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement or
Increase Confirmation shall not be invalidated by any failure of an Interim
Lender to comply with this Clause 8.5.

 

  (d)

Each Original Interim Lender (by executing this Agreement), each New Interim
Lender (by executing the applicable Transfer Certificate or Assignment
Agreement) and each Increase Lender (by executing the applicable Increase
Confirmation) confirms, on the date it becomes a Party, to the Borrower that,
following the United Kingdom ceasing to be a member state of the European Union
as a consequence of the notification given by the United Kingdom on 29 March
2017 of its intention to exit the European Union pursuant to Article 50 of the
Treaty on European Union (“Brexit”) (and assuming no changes to any applicable
law or regulation other than changes to the laws of the United Kingdom resulting
from Brexit), based upon information available on the date it becomes a Party,
that it or its branch or Affiliate will be permitted to carry out all of that
Interim Lender’s lending and other obligations under the Interim Finance
Documents in all jurisdictions in which the Borrower is or may be incorporated
from time to time (provided that such jurisdiction is an Approved Borrowing
Jurisdiction (as defined below)), either pursuant to its (or its branch

 

14



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  or Affiliate’s) continued authorisation as an EEA Credit Institution under CRD
IV or by virtue of its (or its branch or Affiliate) having obtained all
necessary authorisations (if any) required under all applicable laws and
regulations in each such jurisdiction, and for the purposes of this paragraph
(d), “Approved Borrowing Jurisdiction” means, for any Interim Facility in
respect of which this paragraph (d) applies, the jurisdiction of incorporation
of the Borrower as at the date of this Agreement and any other jurisdiction
which has been approved in accordance with this Agreement.

 

8.6

Stamp Taxes

The Borrower shall pay (or shall procure that another Group Company pays) within
five (5) Business Days of demand and indemnify each Interim Finance Party
against all losses, costs and liabilities which that Interim Finance Party
(directly or indirectly) suffers or incurs in relation to any stamp duty, stamp
duty reserve tax, transfer tax, registration or other similar Tax payable in
respect of any Interim Finance Document except for:

 

  (a)

any such Tax payable in respect of any transfer, assignment, sub-participation
or other disposal of an Interim Finance Party’s rights or obligations under an
Interim Finance Document, unless such transfer, assignment, sub-participation or
other disposal is (i)    pursuant to Clause 9.2 (Mitigation) or (ii) at the
request of the Borrower under Part 3 (Replacement of an Interim Lender/Increase)
of Schedule 5 (Impairment and Replacement of Interim Finance Parties) other than
such a request in respect of a Defaulting Lender; or

 

  (b)

any such Tax to the extent it becomes payable upon a voluntary registration made
by any Interim Finance Party if such registration is not necessary to evidence,
prove, maintain, enforce, compel or otherwise assert the rights of such Interim
Finance Party under an Interim Finance Document.

 

8.7

Value added taxes

 

  (a)

All amounts expressed to be payable under an Interim Finance Document by any
party to an Interim Finance Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the
consideration for a supply or supplies for VAT purposes shall be deemed to be
exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on such supply or supplies and
accordingly, subject to paragraph (b) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on
any supply or supplies made by any Interim Finance Party to any party in
connection with an Interim Finance Document, and such Interim Finance Party is
required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, that party shall
pay to the Interim Finance Party (in addition to and at the same time as paying
the consideration for that supply or supplies) an amount equal to the amount of
the VAT (upon such Interim Finance Party providing an appropriate VAT invoice to
such party).

 

  (b)

If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Interim Finance Party
(the “Supplier”) to any other Interim Finance Party (the “Recipient”) under an
Interim Finance Document, and any party other than the Recipient (the “Relevant
Party”) is required by the terms of any Interim Finance Document to pay an
amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than
being required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that
consideration):

 

  (i)

(where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax
authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at the
same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the
VAT. The Recipient must (where this paragraph (i) applies) promptly pay to the
Relevant

 

15



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the Recipient receives from
the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines relates to
the VAT chargeable on that supply; and

 

  (ii)

(where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax
authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand from
the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on
that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that
it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in
respect of that VAT.

 

  (c)

Where an Interim Finance Document requires any party to reimburse or indemnify
an Interim Finance Party for any costs or expenses, that party shall reimburse
or indemnify (as the case may be) the Interim Finance Party against any VAT
incurred by the Interim Finance Party in respect of the costs or expenses, to
the extent that the Interim Finance Party reasonably determines that neither it
nor any group of which it is a member for VAT purposes is entitled to credit or
receive repayment in respect of the VAT from the relevant tax authority.

 

  (d)

Any reference in Clause 8.7 to any party shall, at any time when such party is
treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and
unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the person who is treated
as making the supply or (as appropriate) receiving the supply under the grouping
rules (as provided for in Article 11 of the Council Directive 2006/112/EC (or as
implemented by the relevant member state of the European Union or any other
similar provision in any jurisdiction which is not a member state of the
European Union)) so that a reference to a party shall be construed as a
reference to that party or the relevant group or unity (or fiscal unity) of
which that party is a member for VAT purposes at the relevant time or the
relevant member (or head) of that group or unity (or fiscal unity) at the
relevant time (as the case may be).

 

  (e)

In relation to any supply made by an Interim Finance Party to any party under an
Interim Finance Document, if reasonably requested by such Interim Finance Party,
that party must promptly provide such Interim Finance Party with details of that
party’s VAT registration and such other information as is reasonably requested
in connection with such Interim Finance Party’s VAT reporting requirements in
relation to such supply.

 

8.8

FATCA information

 

  (a)

Subject to paragraph (c) below, each Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days
of a reasonable request by another Party:

 

  (i)

confirm to that other Party whether it is:

 

  (A)

a FATCA Exempt Party; or

 

  (B)

not a FATCA Exempt Party;

 

  (ii)

supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information
relating to its status under FATCA as that other Party reasonably requests for
the purposes of that other Party’s compliance with FATCA; and

 

16



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  (iii)

supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information
relating to its status as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes
of that other Party’s compliance with any other law, regulation or exchange of
information regime.

 

  (b)

If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to paragraph (a)(i) above that it
is a FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not, or has
ceased to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party
reasonably promptly.

 

  (c)

Paragraph (a) above shall not oblige any Interim Finance Party to do anything,
and paragraph (a)(iii) above shall not oblige any other Party to do anything,
which would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of:

 

  (i)

any law or regulation;

 

  (ii)

any fiduciary duty; or

 

  (iii)

any duty of confidentiality.

 

  (d)

If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to
supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with
paragraphs (a)(i) or (a)(ii) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where
paragraph (c) above applies), then such Party shall be treated for the purposes
of the Interim Finance Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a
FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the Party in question provides the
requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information.

 

8.9

FATCA Deduction

 

  (a)

Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any
payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall be
required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA
Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA
Deduction.

 

  (b)

Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA
Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA
Deduction), notify the Party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition,
shall notify the Borrower and the Interim Facility Agent, and the Interim
Facility Agent shall notify the other Interim Finance Parties.

 

9.

INCREASED COSTS

 

9.1

Increased Costs

 

  (a)

If (i) the introduction of, or a change in, or a change in the interpretation,
administration or application of, any law, regulation or treaty occurring after
the date on which it becomes party to this Agreement, or (ii) compliance with
any law, regulation or treaty made after the date on which it becomes party to
this Agreement or (iii) the implementation or application of or compliance with
Basel III and/or CRD IV or any other law or regulation which implements Basel
III and/or CRD IV, results in any Interim Finance Party (a “Claiming Party”) or
any Affiliate of it incurring any Increased Cost (as defined in paragraph
(c) below):

 

  (i)

the Claiming Party will notify the Borrower and the Interim Facility Agent of
the circumstances giving rise to that Increased Cost as soon as reasonably
practicable after becoming aware of it and will as soon as reasonably
practicable provide a certificate confirming the amount of that Increased Cost
with (to the extent available) appropriate supporting evidence; and

 

17



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  (ii)

within five (5) Business Days of demand by the Claiming Party, the Borrower will
(or shall procure that another Group Company will) pay to the Claiming Party the
amount of any Increased Cost incurred by it (or any Affiliate of it).

 

  (b)

No Group Company will be obliged to compensate any Claiming Party under
paragraph (a) above in relation to any Increased Cost:

 

  (i)

to the extent already compensated for by a payment under Clause 8 (Taxes) (or
would have been so compensated but for an exclusion in Clauses 8.2 (Exceptions
from gross-up), 8.3 (Tax indemnity), 8.6 (Stamp Taxes) or 8.7 (Value added
taxes));

 

  (ii)

attributable to the breach by the Claiming Party of any law, regulation or
treaty or any Interim Finance Document;

 

  (iii)

attributable to a Tax Deduction required by law to be made by the Borrower;

virtue of its having exceeded any country or sector borrowing limits or breached
any directives imposed upon it;

 

  (v)

attributable to the implementation or application of or compliance with the
“International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards, a

amendment to Basel II arising out of Basel III (as defined in
paragraph (c)(ii) below)) (“Basel II”) or any other law or regulation which
implements Basel II (whether such implementation, application or compliance is
by a government, regulator, Interim Finance Party or any of its Affiliates) but
excluding any Increased Cost attributable to Basel III or any other law or
regulation which implements Basel III (in each case, unless an Interim Finance
Party was or reasonably should have been aware of that Increased Cost on the
date on which it became an Interim Finance Party under this Agreement);

 

  (vi)

attributable to any Bank Levy (or any payment attributable to, or liability
arising as a consequence of, a Bank Levy);

 

  (vii)

attributable to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a Party;

 

  (viii)

attributable to the implementation or application of, or compliance with, Basel
III or CRD IV or any other law or regulation which implements or applies Basel
III or CRD IV, in each case, to the extent the relevant Interim Finance Party
was aware of (or could reasonably be expected to have been aware of) the
relevant Increased Cost at the date of this Agreement or, if later, the date it
became an Interim Finance Party; or

 

18

  (ix)

not notified to the Borrower in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) above.

 

  (c)

In this Agreement:

 

  (i)

an additional or increased cost;

 

  (B)

a reduction in any amount due, paid or payable to the Claiming Party under any
Interim Finance Document; or

 

  (C)

a reduction in the rate of return from an Interim Facility or on the Claiming

Document or making or maintaining its participation in any Interim Loan; and

 

  (ii)

operating the countercyclical capital buffer” published by the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision in December 2010, each as amended, supplemented or
restated;

 

  (B)

the rules for global systemically important banks contained in “Global
systemically important banks: assessment methodology and the additional loss
absorbency requirement Rules text” published by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision in November 2011, as amended, supplemented or restated; and

9.2

Mitigation

 

  (a)

If circumstances arise which entitle an Interim Finance Party:

 

  (i)

to receive payment of an additional amount under Clause 8 (Taxes);

 

19



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  (ii)

to demand payment of any amount under Clause 9.1 (Increased Costs); or

 

  (iii)

to require cancellation or prepayment to it of any amount under Clause 9.3
(Illegality),

then that Interim Finance Party will, in consultation with the Borrower, take
all reasonable steps to mitigate the effect of those circumstances (including by
transferring its rights and obligations under the Interim Finance Documents to
an Affiliate or changing its Facility Office or transferring its Interim
Commitments and participation in each Interim Loan for cash at par plus all
accrued but unpaid interest thereon to another bank, financial institution or
other person nominated for such purpose by the Borrower).

 

  (b)

No Interim Finance Party will be obliged to take any such steps or action if to
do so is likely in its opinion (acting in good faith) to be unlawful or to have
an adverse effect on its business, operations or financial condition or breach
its banking policies or require it to disclose any confidential information.

 

  (c)

The Borrower shall (or shall procure that another Group Company will), within
five (5) Business Days of demand by the relevant Interim Finance Party,
indemnify such Interim Finance Party for any costs or expenses reasonably
incurred by it as a result of taking any steps or action under this Clause 9.2.

 

  (d)

This Clause 9.2 does not in any way limit, reduce or qualify the obligations of
the Borrower under the Interim Finance Documents.

 

9.3

Illegality

If after the date of this Agreement (or if later, the date the relevant Interim
Lender became a Party) it becomes unlawful in any applicable jurisdiction for an
Interim Finance Party to participate in an Interim Facility, maintain its
Interim Commitment or participation in any Interim Loan or perform any of its
obligations under any Interim Finance Documents, then:

 

  (a)

that Interim Finance Party shall promptly so notify the Interim Facility Agent
and the Borrower upon becoming aware of that event; and

 

  (b)

the Borrower shall (or shall procure that a Group Company will) prepay that
Interim Finance Party’s participation in all outstandings under the relevant
Interim Facility (together with any related accrued interest) and pay (or
procure payment of) all other amounts due to that Interim Finance Party under
the Interim Finance Documents and that Interim Finance Party’s Interim
Commitment will be cancelled, in each case, to the extent necessary to cure the
relevant illegality and, on the date specified by that Interim Finance Party in
such notice (being the last Business Day immediately prior to the illegality
taking effect or the latest date otherwise allowed by the relevant law (taking
into account any applicable grace period)) unless an earlier date is otherwise
agreed or required by the Borrower, provided that on or prior to such date the
Borrower shall have the right to require that Interim Lender to transfer its
Interim Commitments and participation in each Interim Loan to another bank,
financial institution or other person nominated for such purpose by the Borrower
which has agreed to purchase such rights and obligations at par plus accrued
interest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.

PAYMENTS

 

10.1

Place

 

  (a)

Unless otherwise specified in an Interim Finance Document, on each date on which
payment is to be made by any Party (other than the Interim Facility Agent) under
an Interim Finance Document, such Party shall pay, in the required currency, the
amount required to the Interim Facility Agent, for value on the due date at such
time and in such funds as the Interim Facility Agent may specify to the Party
concerned as being customary at that time for settlement of transactions in the
relevant currency in the place of payment. All such payments shall be made to
the account specified by the Interim Facility Agent for that purpose in the
principal financial centre of the country of the relevant currency (or in
relation to euro, US Dollars and Sterling, London).

 

  (b)

Unless otherwise specified in an Interim Finance Document (including any
Drawdown Request), each payment received by the Interim Facility Agent under the
Interim Finance Documents for another Party shall, subject to paragraphs (c) and
(d) below and to Clause 10.3 (Assumed receipt), be made available by the Interim
Facility Agent as soon as practicable after receipt to the Party entitled to
receive payment in accordance with this Agreement (in the case of an Interim
Lender, for the account of its Facility Office), to such account as that Party
may notify to the Interim Facility Agent by not less than five (5) Business
Days’ notice with a bank in the principal financial centre of the country of
that currency (or in relation to euro, US Dollars and Sterling, London).

 

  (c)

The Interim Facility Agent may with the consent of the Borrower (or in

the Interim Facility Agent is satisfied that it has actually received that
amount.

 

  (b)

If the Interim Facility Agent nonetheless pays that amount to the Payee (which
it may do at its discretion) and the Interim Facility Agent had not in fact
received that amount, then the Payee will on demand refund that amount to the

any reference in any Interim Finance Document to, and any obligations arising

translated into, and paid in, the currency or currency unit designated by the
Interim Facility Agent (after consultation with the Borrower); and

 

  (ii)

any translation from one currency or currency unit to another shall be at the
official rate of exchange recognised by the central bank of that country for the
conversion of that currency or currency unit into the other, rounded up or down
by the Interim Facility Agent (acting reasonably).

 

  (b)

If a change in any currency of a country occurs, the Interim Finance Documents
will, to the extent the Interim Facility Agent specifies is necessary (acting

14.5

The Arrangers and the Agents individually

 

  (a)

If it is an Interim Lender, each of the Arrangers and Agents has the same rights
and powers under the Interim Finance Documents as any other Interim Lender and

Each of the Agents and the Arrangers may:

retain for its own benefit and without liability to account to any other person
any fee, profit or other amount received by it for its own account under or in
connection with the Interim Finance Documents or any of the activities referred

All communications to the Borrower (or any Affiliate of the Borrower) under or

of the Borrower) on any matter concerning the Interim Facility or the Interim
Finance Documents.

acquired by it otherwise than in its capacity as Agent under the Interim Finance
Documents may be treated by it as confidential and will not be treated as

35



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14.7

Non-reliance

 

  (a)

Each other Interim Finance Party confirms that it has made (and will continue to
make) its own independent investigation and appraisal of the assets, business,
financial condition and creditworthiness of the Group and the Target Group and
of any risks arising under or in connection with any Interim Finance Document,
and has not relied, and will not at any time rely, on any Agent or Arranger:

 

  (i)

to assess the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of any information (whether
oral or written) provided by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Group Company
or any member of the Target Group under or in connection with any Interim
Finance Document (whether or not that information has been or is at any time
circulated to it by an Arranger or an Agent), or any document delivered pursuant
thereto, including any contained in the Reports or the transactions contemplated
thereby;

 

  (ii)

to assess whether that Interim Finance Party has recourse, and the nature and
extent of that recourse, against any Party or any of its respective assets under
or in connection with any Interim Finance Document;

 

  (iii)

to assess the assets, business, financial condition or creditworthiness of the
Borrower, any Group Company, the Target Group or any other person; or

 

  (iv)

to assess the validity, legality, adequacy, accuracy, completeness,
enforceability or admissibility in evidence of any Transaction Document or any
document delivered pursuant thereto.

the information supplied by it or on its behalf under or in connection with the
Interim Finance Documents and the Borrower remains responsible for all such
information.

No Party (other than the relevant Agent) may take any proceedings against any
officer, delegate, employee or agent of an Agent in respect of any claim it may
have against that Agent or in respect of any act or omission by that officer,
delegate, employee or agent in connection with any Interim Finance Document.

 

  (d)

No Agent will be liable for any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting
an account with an amount required under the Interim Finance Documents to be
paid by that Agent if that Agent has taken all necessary steps as soon as
reasonably practicable to comply with the regulations or operating procedures of
any recognised clearing or settlement system used by that Agent for that
purpose.

 

14.8

Know your customer

Nothing in this Agreement shall oblige the Agents or the Arrangers to carry out
know your customer or other checks in relation to any person on behalf of any
Interim Lender and each Interim Lender confirms to the Agents and the Arrangers
that it is solely responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out
and that it may not rely on any statement in relation to such checks made by the
Agents or the Arrangers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14.9

Agents’ indemnity

 

  (a)

Each Interim Lender shall on demand indemnify each Agent for its share of any
cost, loss or liability incurred by the relevant Agent in acting, or in
connection with its role, as Agent under the Interim Finance Documents, except
to the extent that the cost, loss or liability is incurred as a result of the
relevant Agent’s fraud, negligence or wilful misconduct.

 

  (b)

An Interim Lender’s share of any such loss or liability shall be the proportion
which:

 

  (i)

that Interim Lender’s participation in the outstanding Interim Loan bears to the
outstanding Interim Loan at the time of demand; or

 

  (ii)

if there is no outstanding Interim Loan at that time, that Interim Lender’s
Interim Commitment bears to the Total Interim Commitments at that time; or

 

  (iii)

if the Total Interim Commitments have been cancelled, that Interim Lender’s
Interim Commitment bore to the Total Interim Commitments immediately before
being cancelled.

 

  (c)

The provisions of this Clause 14.9 are without prejudice to any obligations of
the Borrower to indemnify the Agents under the Interim Finance Documents.

 

14.10

Role of the Interim Security Agent

 

  (a)

The Interim Security Agent declares that it shall hold the Interim Security on
trust for itself and the other Interim Finance Parties on the terms contained in
this Agreement and shall administer the Interim Security Documents for itself
and the other Interim Finance Parties and will apply all payments and other
benefits received by it under the Interim Security Documents in accordance with
the Interim Finance Documents.

 

  (b)

Each of the Parties agrees that the Interim Security Agent shall have only those
duties, obligations and responsibilities expressly specified in this Agreement
or in the Interim Security Documents to which the Interim Security Agent is
expressed to be a party (and no others shall be implied).

 

  (c)

Each Interim Finance Party hereby authorises the Interim Security Agent (whether
or not by or through employees or agents):

 

  (i)

to exercise such rights, remedies, powers and discretions as are specifically
delegated to or conferred upon the Interim Security Agent under the Interim
Security Documents together with such powers and discretions as are reasonably
incidental thereto; and

 

  (ii)

to take such action on its behalf as may from time to time be authorised under
or in accordance with the Interim Security Documents.

The Interim Security Agent shall not be liable for any failure, omission or
defect in registering, protecting or perfecting any Security Interest
constituted, created or evidenced by any Interim Security Document.

 

  (e)

The Interim Security Agent has no duty or obligation to require the deposit with
it of, or to hold, any title deeds, share certificates, transfer documents or
other documents in connection with any asset charged or encumbered or purported
to be charged or encumbered under any Interim Security Document.

 

37



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  (f)

Each Interim Finance Party confirms its approval of each Interim Security
Document and authorises and directs the Interim Security Agent (by itself or by
such person(s) as it may nominate) to execute and enforce the same as trustee
(or agent) or as otherwise provided.

 

  (g)

It is agreed that, in relation to any jurisdiction the courts of which would not
recognise or give effect to the trust expressed to be created by this Agreement,
the relationship of the Interim Finance Parties to the Interim Security Agent
shall be construed as one of principal and agent but, to the extent permissible
under the laws of such jurisdiction, that all the other provisions of this
Agreement shall have full force and effect between the parties hereto.

 

15.

PRO RATA PAYMENTS

 

15.1

Recoveries

Subject to Clause 15.3 (Exceptions to sharing), if any amount owing by the
Borrower under any Interim Finance Document to an Interim Lender (the
“Recovering Interim Lender”) is discharged by payment, set-off or any other
manner other than through the Interim Facility Agent in accordance with Clause
10 (Payments) (the amount so discharged being a “Recovery”), then:

 

  (a)

within three (3) Business Days of receipt of the Recovery, the Recovering
Interim Lender shall notify details of such Recovery to the Interim Facility
Agent;

 

  (b)

the Interim Facility Agent shall determine whether the amount of the Recovery is
in excess of the amount which such Recovering Interim Lender should have
received had such amount been paid to the Interim Facility Agent under Clause 10
(Payments) without taking account of any Tax which would have been imposed on
the Interim Facility Agent in relation to the Recovery (any such excess amount
being the “Excess Recovery”);

 

  (c)

within three (3) Business Days of demand, the Recovering Interim Lender shall
pay to the Interim Facility Agent an amount equal to the Excess Recovery;

 

  (d)

the Interim Facility Agent shall treat that payment as if it was a payment made
by the Borrower to the Interim Lenders under Clause 10 (Payments) and distribute
it to the Interim Lenders (other than the Recovering Interim Lender)
accordingly; and

 

  (e)

on a distribution by the Interim Facility Agent under paragraph (d) above of any
payment received by a Recovering Interim Lender from the Borrower as between the
Borrower and the Recovering Interim Lender, the amount of the Excess Recovery
shall be treated as not having been paid and (without double counting) the
Borrower will owe the Recovering Interim Lender a debt (immediately due and
payable) in an amount equal to the Excess Recovery.

 

15.2

Notification of Recovery

If any Recovery has to be wholly or partly refunded by the Recovering Interim
Lender after it has paid any amount to the Interim Facility Agent under
paragraph (c) of Clause 15.1 (Recoveries), each Interim Lender to which any part
of the Excess Recovery (or amount in respect of it) was distributed will, on
request from the Recovering Interim Lender, pay to the Recovering Interim Lender
that Interim Lender’s pro rata share of the amount (including any related
interest) which has to be refunded by the Recovering Interim Lender.

 

38



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15.3

Exceptions to sharing

Notwithstanding Clause 15.1 (Recoveries), no Recovering Interim Lender will be
obliged to pay any amount to the Interim Facility Agent or any other Interim
Lender in respect of any Recovery:

 

  (a)

if it would not (after that payment) have a valid claim against the Borrower
under paragraph (e) of Clause 15.1 (Recoveries) in an amount equal to the Excess
Recovery; or

 

  (b)

which it receives as a result of legal proceedings taken by it to recover any
amounts owing to it under the Interim Finance Documents, which proceedings have
been notified to the other Interim Finance Parties and where the Interim Lender
concerned had a right and opportunity to, but does not, either join in those
proceedings or promptly after receiving notice commence and diligently pursue
separate proceedings to enforce its rights in the same or another court.

 

15.4

No security

The provisions of this Clause 15 shall not constitute a charge by any Interim
Lender over all or any part of any amount received or recovered by it under any
of the circumstances mentioned in this Clause 15.

 

16.

SET-OFF

If a Major Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, an Interim Finance
Party may set off any matured obligation (to the extent beneficially owned by
the Interim Finance Party) due and payable by the Borrower to it under an
Interim Finance Document against any matured obligation due and payable by it to
the Borrower, regardless of currency, place of payment or booking branch of
either obligation. The relevant Interim Finance Party may convert either
obligation at a market rate of exchange in its ordinary course of business in
order to effect such set-off.

activities:

 

  (i)

involving or for the benefit of any Restricted Person or in any Sanctioned

  (f)

This Clause 20.2 shall not be interpreted or applied in relation to BidCo, the
Borrower or any member of the Combined Group to the extent that the obligations
of this Clause 20.2 would violate or expose such entity or any director, officer
or employee thereof to any liability under anti-boycott or blocking law,
regulation or statute that is in force from time to time in the European Union

21.2

Transfers by Interim Lenders

assign any of its rights or benefits, or transfer by novation or sub-participate
any of its rights or benefits and obligations under or by reference to any
Interim Finance Document to another bank or financial institution or to a trust,
fund or other entity which is regularly engaged in or established for the
purpose of making, purchasing or investing in loans, securities or other
financial assets (a “New Interim Lender”).

 

  (b)

Any assignment, transfer, sub-participation or other syndication of any rights,
benefits and/or obligations under or by reference to the Interim Finance
Documents by an Interim Lender shall:

 

  (i)

on or prior to the expiry of the Certain Funds Period, require the prior written
consent of the Borrower (in its sole discretion); and

 

  (ii)

after the expiry of the Certain Funds Period, require the prior written consent
of the Borrower (in its sole discretion) unless:

 

  (A)

such assignment, transfer or sub-participation is to another Interim Lender or
an Affiliate of an Interim Lender; or

 

  (B)

a Major Event of Default has occurred and is continuing provided that, in all
cases (and regardless of whether a Major Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing) no assignment, transfer or sub-participation shall be made to any of
the following persons unless the prior written consent of the Borrower (in its
sole discretion) is obtained:

 

46



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  (I)

an Industry Competitor or private equity sponsor; or

 

  (II)

any person that is (or would, upon becoming an Interim Lender, be) a Defaulting
Lender,

and further provided that, in all cases (other than where a Major Event of
Default under paragraphs 1, 5 and 6 of Part 3 (Major Events of Default) of
Schedule 4 (Major Representations, Undertakings and Events of Default) has
occurred and is continuing) no assignment, transfer or sub-participation shall
be made to a Loan to Own/Distressed Investor unless the prior written consent of
the Borrower (in its sole discretion) is obtained.

 

  (c)

Each New Interim Lender, by executing the relevant Transfer Certificate or
Assignment Agreement, confirms, for the avoidance of doubt, that the Interim
Facility Agent has authority to execute on its behalf any consent, release,
waiver or amendment that has been approved by the applicable Existing Interim
Lender in accordance with this Agreement on or prior to the date on which the
transfer or assignment becomes effective in accordance with this Agreement and
that it is bound by that agreement or consent to the same extent as the Existing
Interim Lender would have been had it remained an Interim Lender.

 

  (d)

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither the Borrower or
another Group Company shall be liable to any other Party (by way of
reimbursement, indemnity or otherwise) for any stamp, transfer or registration
taxes, notarial and security registration or perfection fees, costs or other
amounts payable by any Party in connection with any re-taking, re-notarisation,
perfection, presentation, novation, re-registration of any Interim Security or
otherwise in connection with any assignment, transfer, sub-participation or
other back-to-back arrangement (except where such assignment, transfer,
sub-participation or other back-to-back arrangement is at the request of the
Borrower or, in respect of costs and liabilities which an Interim Finance Party
(directly or indirectly) suffers (provided that all such costs and liabilities
are reasonable) in relation to any stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, transfer
tax, registration or other similar Tax payable in respect of any Interim Finance
Document, as a result of any action taken pursuant to Clause 9.2 (Mitigation)).

 

  (e)

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Clause 21, if prior to the end of
the Certain Funds Period, an Existing Interim Lender transfers or assigns any of
its rights and obligations under any Interim Finance Document in accordance with
this Clause 21, it shall remain on risk and liable to fund any amount which any
New Interim Lender (or subsequent New Interim Lender), following such transfer
of rights and obligations in accordance with this Clause 21, is obliged to fund
during the Certain Funds Period, but has failed to fund on a date during such
period, as if such transfer never occurred.

 

  (f)

Each Interim Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this
purpose as a non- fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which
it enters the name and address of each participant and the principal amounts
(and stated interest) of each participant’s interest in the Interim Loans or
other obligations under the Interim Finance Documents (the “Participant
Register”); provided that no Interim Lender shall have any obligation to
disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity
of any participant or any information relating to a participant’s interest in
any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any
Interim Finance Document) to any person except to the extent that such
disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of
credit or other obligation is in registered form under U.S. Treasury regulations

Lender but excludes an Interim Lender if no amount is or may become owed to it
under this Agreement.

 

  (h)

Unless the Interim Facility Agent agrees otherwise and excluding an assignment
or transfer:

 

  (i)

to an Affiliate of an Interim Lender; or

 

  (ii)

to a Related Fund,

the New Interim Lender shall, on or before the date upon which an assignment or
transfer to it takes effect pursuant to this Clause 21, pay to the Interim
Facility Agent (for its own account) a fee of £3,500.

 

21.3

Limitation of responsibility of Existing Interim Lenders

 

  (a)

Unless expressly agreed to the contrary, an Existing Interim Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility to a New Interim Lender
for:

 

  (i)

the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of the Interim
Security, the Transaction Documents or any other documents;

 

  (ii)

the financial condition of the Borrower;

 

  (iii)

the performance and observance by the Borrower or other Group Company of its
obligations under the Transaction Documents or any other documents; or

 

  (iv)

the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made in or in
connection with any Transaction Document or any other document,

and any representations or warranties implied by law are excluded.

 

  (b)

Each New Interim Lender confirms to the Existing Interim Lender and the other
Interim Finance Parties that it:

 

  (i)

has made (and shall continue to make) its own independent investigation and
assessment of the financial condition and affairs of the Borrower and its
related entities in connection with its participation in this Agreement and has
not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing Interim
Lender or any other Interim Finance Party in connection with any Transaction
Document or the Interim Security; and

 

  (ii)

will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of
the Borrower and its related entities whilst any amount is or may be outstanding
under the Interim Finance Documents or any Interim Commitment is in force.

 

  (c)

Subject to paragraph (e) of Clause 21.2 (Transfers by Interim Lenders), nothing
in any Interim Finance Document obliges an Existing Interim Lender to:

accept a re-transfer or re-assignment from a New Interim Lender of any of the
rights and obligations assigned or transferred under this Clause 21; or

 

48



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  (ii)

support any losses directly or indirectly incurred by the New Interim Lender by
reason of the non-performance by the Borrower of its obligations under the
Transaction Documents or otherwise.

 

21.4

Procedure for transfer

 

  (a)

Subject to the conditions set out in paragraphs (b) and (e) of Clause 21.2
(Transfers by Interim Lenders), a transfer is effected in accordance with
paragraph (c) below when the Interim Facility Agent executes an otherwise duly
completed Transfer Certificate delivered to it by the Existing Interim Lender
and the New Interim Lender. The Interim Facility Agent shall, subject to
paragraph (b) below, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by it of a
duly completed Transfer Certificate appearing on its face to comply with the
terms of this Agreement and delivered in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, execute that Transfer Certificate.

 

  (b)

The Interim Facility Agent shall only be obliged to execute a Transfer
Certificate delivered to it by the Existing Interim Lender and the New Interim
Lender once it is satisfied it has complied with all necessary “know your
customer” or similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in
relation to the transfer to such New Interim Lender.

 

  (c)

On the Transfer Date:

 

  (i)

subject to the conditions set out in paragraph (e) of Clause 21.2 (Transfers by
Interim Lenders), to the extent that in the Transfer Certificate the Existing
Interim Lender seeks to transfer by novation its rights and obligations under
the Interim Finance Documents and, in respect of the Interim Security, the
Borrower (and any provider of Interim Security) and the Existing Interim Lender
shall be released from further obligations towards one another under the Interim
Finance Documents and in respect of the Interim Security and their respective
rights against one another under the Interim Finance Documents and in respect of
the Interim Security shall be cancelled (being the “Discharged Rights and
Obligations”);

 

  (ii)

the Borrower and the New Interim Lender shall assume obligations towards one
another and/or acquire rights against one another which differ from the
Discharged Rights and Obligations only insofar as the Borrower or another Group
Company and the New Interim Lender have assumed and/or acquired the same in
place of the Borrower;

 

  (iii)

subject to the conditions set out in paragraph (e) of Clause 21.2 (Transfers by
Interim Lenders), the Interim Facility Agent, the Arrangers, the Interim
Security Agent, the New Interim Lender and the other Interim Lenders shall
acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations between themselves and
in respect of the Interim Security as they would have acquired and assumed had
the New Interim Lender been an Original Interim Lender with the rights and/or
obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of the transfer and to that
extent the Interim Facility Agent, the Arrangers, the Interim Security Agent and
the Existing Interim Lender shall each be released from further obligations to
each other under the Interim Finance Documents; and

 

  (iv)

the New Interim Lender shall become a Party as an “Interim Lender”.

 

49



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  (d)

If any assignment, transfer, sub-participation or other syndication of any
rights, benefits and/or obligations under or by reference to the Interim Finance
Documents in accordance with Clause 21.2 (Transfers by Interim Lenders) is
executed in breach of the provisions contemplated in this Clause 21, such
assignment, transfer or sub-participation, shall be void and deemed not to have
occurred.

 

21.5

Procedure for assignment

 

  (a)

Subject to the condition set out in paragraphs (b) and (e) of Clause 21.2
(Transfers by Interim Lenders), an assignment may be effected in accordance with
paragraph (c) below when the Interim Facility Agent executes an otherwise duly
completed Assignment Agreement delivered to it by the Existing Interim Lender
and the New Interim Lender. The Interim Facility Agent shall, subject to
paragraph (b) below, as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt by it of a
duly completed Assignment Agreement appearing on its face to comply with the
terms of this Agreement and delivered in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, execute that Assignment Agreement.

 

  (b)

The Interim Facility Agent shall only be obliged to execute an Assignment
Agreement delivered to it by the Existing Interim Lender and the New Interim
Lender once it is satisfied it has complied with all necessary “know your
customer” or similar checks under all applicable laws and regulations in
relation to the assignment to such New Interim Lender.

 

  (c)

On the Transfer Date:

 

  (i)

subject to paragraph (e) of Clause 21.2 (Transfers by Interim Lenders), the
Existing Interim Lender will assign absolutely to the New Interim Lender its
rights under the Interim Finance Documents and in respect of the Interim
Security expressed to be the subject of the assignment in the Assignment
Agreement;

 

  (ii)

subject to paragraph (e) of Clause 21.2 (Transfers by Interim Lenders), the
Existing Interim Lender will be released from the obligations (the “Relevant
Obligations”) expressed to be the subject of the release in the Assignment
Agreement (and any corresponding obligations by which it is bound in respect of
the Interim Security);

 

  (iii)

the New Interim Lender shall become a Party as an “Interim Lender” and will be
bound by obligations equivalent to the Relevant Obligations; and

 

  (iv)

subject to paragraph (e) of Clause 21.2 (Transfers by Interim Lenders), if the
assignment relates only to part of the Existing Interim Lender’s share in the
outstanding Interim Loans, the assigned part will be separated from the Existing
Interim Lender’s share in the outstanding Interim Loans, made an independent
debt and assigned to the New Interim Lender as a whole debt.

 

21.6

Copy of Transfer Certificate or Assignment Agreement to the Borrower

The Interim Facility Agent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after it has
executed a Transfer Certificate or an Assignment Agreement, send a copy of that
Transfer Certificate or Assignment Agreement to the Borrower.

 

50



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21.7

Increased costs

If:

 

  (a)

an Interim Lender assigns, transfers, sub-participates or otherwise disposes of
any of its rights or obligations under the Interim Finance Documents or changes
its Facility Office or lending office or branch; and

 

  (b)

as a result of circumstances existing at the date the assignment, transfer,
sub-participation or other change occurs, the Borrower would be obliged to make
a payment or increased payment to the New Interim Lender, the Interim Lender
granting the sub-participation or Interim Lender acting through its new office,
branch or Facility Office under Clauses 8.1 (Gross-up), 8.3 (Tax indemnity) or
9.1 (Increased Costs),

then the New Interim Lender, the Interim Lender granting the sub-participation
or Interim Lender acting through its new office, branch or Facility Office is
not entitled to receive a payment under Clauses 8.1 (Gross-up), 8.3 (Tax
indemnity) or 9.1 (Increased Costs) to the extent such payment would be greater
than the payment that would have been made to the Existing Interim Lender or
Interim Lender acting through its previous office, branch or Facility Office had
the assignment, transfer sub-participation or other change not occurred.

 

21.8

Pro rata interest settlement

 

  (a)

If the Interim Facility Agent has notified the Interim Lenders that it is able
to distribute interest payments on a “pro rata basis” to Existing Interim
Lenders and New Interim Lenders then (in respect of any transfer pursuant to
Clause 21.4 (Procedure for transfer) or any assignment pursuant to Clause 21.5
(Procedure for assignment) the Transfer Date of which, in each case, is after
the date of such notification and is not on the last day of an Interest Period):

 

  (i)

any interest or fees in respect of the relevant participation which are
expressed to accrue by reference to the lapse of time shall continue to accrue
in favour of the Existing Interim Lender up to but
excluding    the    Transfer    Date    (“Accrued Amounts”) and shall become due
and payable to the Existing Interim Lender (without further interest accruing on
them) on the last day of the current Interest Period; and

 

  (ii)

the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Interim Lender will not
include the right to the Accrued Amounts so that, for the avoidance of doubt:

 

  (A)

when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable
for the account of the Existing Interim Lender; and

 

  (B)

the amount payable to the New Interim Lender on that date will be the amount
which would, but for the application of this Clause 21.8, have been payable to
it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.

 

  (b)

In this Clause 21.8, references to “Interest Period” shall be construed to
include a reference to any other period for accrual of fees.

 

  (c)

An Existing Interim Lender which retains the right to the Accrued Amounts
pursuant to this Clause 21.8 but which does not have an Interim Commitment shall
be deemed not to be an Interim Lender for the purposes of ascertaining whether
the agreement of any specified group of Interim Lenders has been obtained to
approve any request for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote of Interim
Lenders under the Interim Finance Documents.

  (a)

To the extent that the Interim Finance Documents provide support, through a

thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of such Supported
QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding
that the Interim Finance Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be stated
to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States
or any other state of the United States): in the event a Covered Entity that is
party to a Supported QFC (each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a

obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United
States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC
Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S.
Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Interim Finance Documents
that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that

greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S.
Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Interim Finance Documents
were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and
remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event
affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any

whole) under the Interim Finance Documents.

 

  (b)

The Borrower shall procure that Bidco shall not amend or waive or treat as
satisfied any material term or condition relating to the Acquisition as set out

Offer to a Scheme or from a Scheme to an Offer.

 

  (c)

For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that:

BidCo from subsequently proceeding with an Offer, provided that the terms and

applicable law or regulation, the Borrower shall procure that BidCo shall not
prior to the end of the Offer Period (as defined in the City Code) make any
press release or other public statement in respect of the Acquisition which

prejudicial to the interests of the Interim Lenders (taken as a whole) under the

such actions) complete a Squeeze-out.

 

88



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  (h)

Subject always to the Companies Act 2006 and any applicable listing rules, in
the case of a Scheme, within 60 days after the Scheme Effective Date, and in

or indirectly) owns shares in Target (excluding any shares held in treasury),
which, when aggregated with all other shares in Target owned directly or
indirectly by BidCo, represent not less than 75 per cent. of all shares in
Target (excluding any shares held in treasury), the Borrower shall procure that
BidCo uses all reasonable endeavours to procure that such action as is necessary
is taken to procure that trading in the shares in Target on the Main Market of
the London Stock Exchange is cancelled and as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter, procure that the Target is re-registered as a private limited
company.

 

  (i)

Subject to any confidentiality, regulatory, legal or other restrictions relating
to the supply of such information, the Borrower will procure that BidCo will
keep the Interim Facility Agent informed as to any material developments in
relation to the Acquisition, including if the Scheme or the Offer lapses or is
withdrawn, and, will from time to time, if the Interim Facility Agent reasonably
requests, give the Interim Facility Agent reasonable details as to the current
level of acceptances from any Offer.

 

  (j)

The Borrower will procure that BidCo shall provide to the Interim Facility Agent

SCHEDULE 5

IMPAIRMENT AND REPLACEMENT OF INTERIM FINANCE PARTIES

Part 1

Impaired Agent

 

1.

IMPAIRED AGENT

 

  (a)

If, at any time, an Agent becomes an Impaired Agent, the Borrower or an Interim
Lender which is required to make a payment under the Interim Finance Documents
to the Agent in accordance with Clause 10 (Payments) or otherwise under an
Interim Finance Document may instead either pay that amount direct to the
required recipient or pay that amount to an interest bearing account held with
an Acceptable Bank in relation to which no Insolvency Event has occurred and is
continuing, in the name of the Borrower or the Interim Lender making the payment
and designated as a trust account for the benefit of the Party or Parties
beneficially entitled to that payment under the Interim Finance Documents. In
each case such payments must be made on the due date for payment under the
Interim Finance Documents.

 

  (b)

All interest accrued on the amount standing to the credit of the trust account
shall be for the benefit of the beneficiaries of that trust account pro rata to
their respective entitlements.

 

  (c)

A Party which has made a payment in accordance with this paragraph 1 shall be
discharged of the relevant payment obligation under the Interim Finance
Documents and shall not take any credit risk with respect to the amounts
standing to the credit of the trust account.

 

  (d)

Promptly upon the appointment of a successor Agent in accordance with paragraph
3 (Replacement of an Interim Facility Agent) below, each Party which has made a
payment to a trust account in accordance with this paragraph 1 shall give all

transfer the amount (together with any accrued interest) to the successor Agent

  (ii)

that it has been provided with the necessary information by that recipient,

give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held
to transfer the relevant amount (together with any accrued interest) to that
recipient.

 

2.

COMMUNICATION WHEN INTERIM FACILITY AGENT IS IMPAIRED INTERIM FACILITY AGENT

If an Agent is an Impaired Agent, the Parties may, instead of communicating with
each other through the Agent, communicate with each other directly and (while
the Interim Facility Agent is an Impaired Agent) all the provisions of the
Interim Finance Documents which require communications to be made or notices to
be given to or by the Agent shall be varied so that communications may be made
and notices given to or by the relevant Parties directly. This provision shall
not operate after a replacement Agent has been appointed.

 

93



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.

REPLACEMENT OF AN INTERIM FACILITY AGENT

 

  (a)

The Majority Interim Lenders or the Borrower may by giving ten (10) days’ notice
to an Agent which is an Impaired Agent replace that Agent by appointing a
successor Agent (which shall be acting through an office in England).

 

  (b)

The retiring Agent shall (at its own cost, and otherwise at the expense of the
Interim Lenders):

 

  (i)

make available to the successor Agent such documents and records and provide
such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request for the purposes
of performing its functions as Agent under the Interim Finance Documents; and

 

  (ii)

enter into and deliver to the successor Agent those documents and effect any
registrations and notifications as may be required for the transfer or
assignment of all its rights and benefits under the Interim Finance Documents to
the successor Agent.

 

  (c)

The Borrower must take any action and enter into and deliver any document which
is necessary to ensure that any Interim Security Document provides for effective
and perfected Interim Security in favour of any successor Agent.

 

  (d)

The appointment of the successor Agent shall take effect on the date specified
in the notice from the Majority Interim Lenders or the Borrower to the retiring
Agent. As from this date, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any
further obligation in respect of the Interim Finance Documents (and any agency
fees for the account of the retiring Agent shall cease to accrue from (and shall
be payable on) that date).

 

  (e)

Any successor Agent and each of the other Parties shall have the same rights and
obligations amongst themselves as they would have had if such successor had been
an original Party.

 

  (f)

The Interim Facility Agent shall resign and the Majority Interim Lenders shall
replace the Interim Facility Agent in accordance with paragraph (i) above if on
or after the date which is three months before the earliest FATCA Application
Date relating to any payment to the Interim Facility Agent under the Interim
Finance Documents, either:

 

  (i)

the Interim Facility Agent fails to respond to a request under Clause 8.8 (FATCA
information) and the Borrower or an Interim Lender reasonably believes that the
Interim Facility Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt
Party on or after that FATCA Application Date;

 

  (ii)

the information supplied by the Interim Facility Agent pursuant to Clause 8.8
(FATCA information) indicates that the Interim Facility Agent will not be (or
will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application
Date; or

 

94



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  (iii)

the Interim Facility Agent notifies the Borrower and the Interim Lenders that
the Interim Facility Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA
Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date;

and (in each case) the Borrower or an Interim Lender reasonably believes that a
Party will be required to make a FATCA Deduction that would not be required if
the Interim Facility Agent were a FATCA Exempt Party, and the Borrower or that
Interim Lender, by notice to the Interim Facility Agent, requires it to resign.

 

95



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 2

Defaulting Lender

 

1.

For so long as a Defaulting Lender has any undrawn Interim Commitment, in
ascertaining (i) the Majority Interim Lenders; or (ii) whether any given
percentage (including, for the avoidance of doubt, unanimity) of the Total
Interim Commitments under the relevant Interim Facility/ies or the agreement of
any specified group of Interim Lenders has been obtained to approve any request
for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote of Interim Lenders under the
Interim Finance Documents, that Defaulting Lender’s Interim Commitments under
the relevant Interim Facility/ies will be reduced by the amount of its undrawn
Interim Commitments under the relevant Interim Facility/ies and, to the extent
that that reduction results in that Defaulting Lender’s Total Interim
Commitments being zero, that Defaulting Lender shall be deemed not to be an
Interim Lender for the purposes of (i) and (ii) above.

 

2.

For the purposes of paragraph 1 above, the Interim Facility Agent may assume
that the following Interim Lenders are Defaulting Lenders:

 

  (a)

any Interim Lender which has notified the Interim Facility Agent that it has
become a Defaulting Lender;

 

  (b)

any Interim Lender in relation to which it is aware that any of the events or
circumstances referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of
Defaulting Lender has occurred,

unless it has received notice to the contrary from the Interim Lender concerned
(together with any supporting evidence reasonably requested by the Interim
Facility Agent) or the Interim Facility Agent is otherwise aware that the
Interim Lender has ceased to be a Defaulting Lender.

 

3.

Without prejudice to any other provision of this Agreement, the Agents may
disclose and, on the written request of the Borrower or the Majority Interim
Lenders, shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, disclose the identity of a
Defaulting Lender to the Borrower and to the other Interim Finance Parties.

 

4.

If any Interim Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the Borrower may, at any time
whilst the Interim Lender continues to be Defaulting Lender, give the Interim
Facility Agent three (3) Business Days’ notice of cancellation of all or any
part of each undrawn Interim Commitment of that Interim Lender.

 

96



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 3

Replacement of an Interim Lender / Increase

 

1.

REPLACEMENT OF AN INTERIM LENDER

 

  (a)

If at any time:

 

  (i)

any Interim Finance Party becomes or is a Non-Consenting Lender (as defined in
paragraph (d) below); or

 

  (ii)

the Borrower becomes obliged to repay any amount in accordance with Clause 9.3
(Illegality) or to pay additional amounts pursuant to Clause 8.1 (Gross-up),
Clause 8.3 (Tax indemnity) or Clause 9.1 (Increased Costs) to any Interim
Finance Party;

 

  (iii)

any Interim Finance Party invokes the benefit of Clauses 7.6 (Absence of
quotations) to 7.8 (Proposed Disrupted Loans) (inclusive); or

 

  (iv)

any Interim Finance Party becomes or is a Defaulting Lender,

then the Borrower may, on no less than five (5) Business Days’ prior written
notice (a “Replacement Notice”) to the Interim Facility Agent and such Interim
Finance Party (a “Replaced Lender”):

 

  (A)

replace a participation of such Replaced Lender by requiring such Replaced
Lender to (and such Replaced Lender shall) transfer pursuant to Clause 21
(Changes to Parties) on such dates as specified in the Replacement Notice all or
part of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to an Interim Lender
constituting a New Interim Lender under Clause 21.2 (Transfers by Interim
Lenders) selected by the Borrower, which confirms its (or their) willingness to
assume and does assume all or part of the obligations of the Replaced Lender
(including the assumption of the Replaced Lender’s participations or unfunded or
undrawn participations (as the case may be) on the same basis as the Replaced
Lender) for a purchase price in cash payable at the time of transfer in an
amount equal to the applicable outstanding principal amount of such Replaced
Lender’s participation in the outstanding Interim Loans and all related accrued
interest, Break Costs and other amounts payable in relation thereto under the
Interim Finance Documents in respect of such transferred participation; and/or

 

  (B)

prepay on such dates as specified in the Replacement Notice all or any part of
such Interim Lender’s participation in the outstanding Interim Loans and all
related accrued interest, Break Costs and other amounts payable in relation
thereto under the Interim Finance Documents in respect of such participation;
and/or

cancel all or part of the undrawn Interim Commitments of that Replaced Lender on
such dates as specified in the Replacement Notice.

 

  (b)

Any notice delivered under paragraph (a) above (or any subsequent notice for
this purpose, as applicable) may be accompanied by a Transfer Certificate
complying with Clause 21.4 (Procedure for transfer) and/or an Assignment
Agreement complying with Clause 21.5

 

97



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  (Procedure for assignment) and any other related documentation to effect the
transfer or assignment, which Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement and any
other related documentation to effect the transfer or assignment (if attached)
shall be promptly (and by no later than three (3) Business Days from receiving
such Transfer Certificate, Assignment Agreement and any other related
documentation) executed by the relevant Replaced Lender and returned to the
Borrower.

 

  (c)

Notwithstanding the requirements of Clause 21 (Changes to Parties) or any other
provisions of the Interim Finance Documents, if a Replaced Lender does not
execute and/or return a Transfer Certificate, an Assignment Agreement and any
other related documentation to effect the transfer or assignment as required by
paragraph (b) above within three (3) Business Days of delivery by the Borrower,
the relevant transfer or transfers or assignment and assignments shall
automatically and immediately be effected for all purposes under the Interim
Finance Documents on payment of the replacement amount to the Interim Facility
Agent (for the account of the relevant Replaced Lender), and the Interim
Facility Agent may (and is authorised by each Interim Finance Party to) execute,
without requiring any further consent or action from any other party, a Transfer
Certificate, Assignment Agreement and any other related documentation to effect
the transfer or assignment on behalf of the relevant Replaced Lender which is
required to transfer its rights and obligations or assign its rights under this
Agreement pursuant to paragraph (a) above which shall be effective for the
purposes of Clause 21.4 (Procedure for transfer) and Clause 21.5 (Procedure for
assignment). The Interim Facility Agent shall not be liable in any way for any
action taken by it pursuant to this paragraph (c) and, for the avoidance of
doubt, the provisions of Clause 14.4 (Exoneration of the Arrangers and the
Agents) shall apply in relation thereto.

 

  (d)

If the Borrower or the Interim Facility Agent (at the request of the Borrower)
has requested the Interim Lenders to give a consent in relation to, or to agree
to a release, waiver or amendment of, any provisions of the Interim Finance
Documents or other vote of the Interim Lenders under the terms of this
Agreement, where the requested consent, release, waiver or amendment is one
which requires greater than Majority Interim Lender consent pursuant to this
Agreement and has been agreed to by the Majority Interim Lenders, then any
Interim Lender who has not consented or agreed (or fails to reject) to such
request by the end of the period of ten (10) Business Days (or any other period
of time notified by the Borrower, with the prior agreement of the Interim
Facility Agent if the period for this provision to operate is less than ten
(10) Business Days) of a request being made such Interim Lender shall be deemed
a “Non-Consenting Lender”.

 

  (e)

If any Non-Consenting Lender fails to assist with any step required to implement
the Borrower’s right to prepay that Non-Consenting Lender or to replace that
Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to this paragraph 1 within three (3) Business
Days of a request to do so by the Borrower, then that Non-Consenting Lender
shall be automatically excluded from participating in that vote, and its
participations, Interim Commitments and vote (as the case may be) shall not be
included (or, as applicable, required) with the Total Interim Commitments or
otherwise when ascertaining whether the approval of Majority Interim Lenders,
all Interim Lenders, or any other class of Interim Lenders (as applicable) has
been obtained with respect to that request for a consent or agreement; and its
status as an Interim Lender shall be disregarded for the purpose of ascertaining
whether the agreement or any specified group of Interim Lenders has been
obtained to approve the request.
