(e) In the event that the Sellers deliver a Dispute Notice to Investor, the
Sellers and Investor shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute as
promptly as practicable and, upon such resolution, if any, any adjustments to
the Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet, Preliminary Cash, Preliminary
Indebtedness, and Preliminary Company Transaction Expenses shall be made as
agreed upon by the Sellers and Investor. If the Sellers and Investor are unable
to resolve any such dispute within twenty (20) Business Days (or such longer
period as the Investors and Seller shall mutually agree in writing) of the
Sellers’ delivery of such Dispute Notice, such dispute shall be resolved by the
dispute resolution practice of the Independent Accounting Firm, acting as an
expert and not an arbitrator, and such determination by the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the parties, except that (i) the
Independent Accounting Firm may consider only those items and amounts (and
related items and amounts) as to which the Sellers and Investor have disagreed
within the time periods and on the terms specified above, and (ii) the
Independent Accounting Firm’s determination of none of Preliminary Cash,
Preliminary Indebtedness, and Preliminary Company Transaction Expenses may be
less than the lower, or more than the higher, of the Sellers’ and Investor’s
respective calculations of the applicable amount. The resolution of disputed
matters by the Independent Accounting Firm, shall be final and binding for
purposes of this Agreement and shall not be subject to court review or otherwise
appealable. The parties hereto agree that judgment may be entered upon the final
resolution of the Independent Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction
over the party against which such determination is to be enforced. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be paid proportionately by
Investor, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand, based on the
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm of the unresolved objections
submitted to it pursuant to this Section 2.4(e). The calculation of such
proportionate payments shall be based on the relative position of the
determination of the Independent Accounting Firm in comparison to the positions
submitted to it by Investor and the Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.4(e). The
Independent Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use reasonable best efforts
to make its final determination within thirty (30) days of submission by the
parties hereto of the dispute to it and, in any case, as promptly as
18



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



practicable after such submission. Each of the Sellers and Investor shall
furnish the Independent Accounting Firm such work papers and other documents and
information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent Accounting Firm
shall reasonably request. The Preliminary Closing Date Balance Sheet,
Preliminary Cash, Preliminary Indebtedness, and Preliminary Company Transaction
Expenses, (i) if deemed final in accordance with Section 2.4(c), as originally
submitted by Investor, or (ii) if a Dispute Notice has been timely delivered by
the Sellers in accordance with this Section 2.4(e), as determined pursuant to
the resolution of such dispute in accordance with this Section 2.4(e), shall be,
respectively, the “Final Closing Date Balance Sheet”, “Final Cash”, “Final
Indebtedness”, and “Final Company Transaction Expenses”.
(f) In the event that the amount that is equal to Final Cash minus Estimated
Cash plus (B) Estimated Indebtedness minus Final Indebtedness plus (C) Estimated
Company Transaction Expenses minus Final Company Transaction Expenses (such
amount, the “Post-Closing Adjustment”) is a positive amount, Investor shall pay
each Seller such Seller’s Percentage Portion of the amount equal to the amount
that the Post-Closing Adjustment exceeds $250,000 to the Sellers by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the bank accounts specified by the
Sellers. In the event that the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount and,
to the extent the absolute amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment exceeds
$250,000, the Sellers shall each pay such Seller’s Percentage Portion of the
amount equal to the absolute amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment less $250,000
to Investor, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by Investor. For the avoidance of doubt, no payment will be made in
respect of any Post-Closing Adjustment if (i) the Post-Closing Adjustment is a
positive amount and does not exceed $250,000, or (ii) if the Post-Closing
Adjustment is zero or a negative amount and is not less than negative $250,000.
Each payment under this Section 2.4(f) shall be made within five (5) Business
Days after the determination of Final Cash, Final Indebtedness and Final Company
Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section 2.4(c) or Section 2.4(e) (as
applicable). The “Purchase Price” shall be equal to (i) the Preliminary Purchase
Price, plus (ii) the amount, if any, paid by Investor to the Sellers pursuant to
this Section 2.4(f) or minus (iii) the amount, if any, paid by the Sellers to
Investor pursuant to this Section 2.4(f).
Section 2.5 Tax Withholding. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, Investor shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be
deducted or withheld) from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable
pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under any provision of the U.S. federal, state, local or
non-U.S. Tax Law or under any applicable Law. Investor shall use commercially
reasonable best efforts to notify Sellers in writing of any such requirement at
least five Business Days prior to, and shall consider any exemptions,
documentation or positions provided by the Sellers in good faith prior to,
deducting or withholding any amount. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
or withheld and duly paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.
19



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Section 2.6 Tax Treatment. The parties agree that for U.S. federal and
applicable state income Tax purposes, Investor’s acquisition of the Sale
Interests shall be treated as the purchase of an interest in a partnership.

conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere
with the business or operations of the Business Group Companies. If the Seller
Group Parties determine, in their reasonable judgment and on the advice of
counsel, that providing such information would waive or jeopardize the

immunity, the Seller Group Parties shall cooperate in good faith to enable

litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes including, for the
avoidance of doubt reasonable assistance with any voluntary disclosure or
discussions with any taxing authority relating to sales tax. In particular,
Sellers, on the one hand, and Investor, on the other hand, shall (and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to) use commercially reasonable efforts to
furnish or cause to be furnished to the other, upon written request, such
information and assistance as is reasonably necessary for the filing of any Tax

for the prosecution or defense of any lawsuit, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation relating to any adjustment or proposed adjustment with respect to

explanations of any material provided hereunder. Investor and Sellers shall
retain all records with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Company and the
Company’s Subsidiaries for a period of at least seven (7) years following the
Closing Date and shall give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such records, and allow such other
party to take possession of such records. Investor and Sellers shall cooperate
with each other in the conduct of any lawsuit, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation relating to Taxes involving the Company and the Company’s
Subsidiaries.
(c) Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns.
(i) The Sellers shall, at the Sellers’ expense, timely prepare and file, or
shall cause to be timely prepared and filed, all Pre-Closing Tax
Returns; provided that the Sellers shall provide a copy of such Pre-Closing Tax
Return to Investor in a commercially reasonable period of time prior to the due
date (including applicable extensions) of such Pre-Closing Tax Return, and the
Sellers shall consider in good faith any suggested changes; provided, further,
that if such Pre-Closing Tax Return would reasonably be expected to have the
effect of (a) causing Investor to bear any Taxes due and owing on such
Pre-Closing Tax Return (taking into account Section 9.1 hereof and the
limitations in Section 9.4 hereof) or (b) materially increasing the Tax
liability of Investor for any tax period following the Closing Date, the filing
of such Pre-Closing Tax Return shall be subject to Investor’s consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).
51



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(ii) The Company shall timely prepare and file, or shall cause to be timely
prepared and filed, all other Tax Returns (including any partnership return and
applicable K-1s) of the Company and its Subsidiaries consistent with and subject
to the applicable provisions of the A&R LLC Agreement addressing the preparation
and filing of post-Closing Tax Returns; provided, however that the Company shall
provide a copy of any Straddle Tax Return to the Sellers a commercially
reasonable period of time prior to the due date (including applicable
extensions) of such Straddle Tax Return, and Investor shall consider in good
faith any suggested changes; provided, further, that the filing of such Straddle
Tax Return shall be subject to such Sellers’s consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed).
(iii) The Company shall have in effect an election under Section 754 of the Code
for the taxable year that includes the Closing Date. Investor shall not make an
election under Section 336 or 338 of the Code (or any comparable applicable
provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.
(iv) Following the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not (and the
Investor shall not cause the Company or any Subsidiaries to): (a) amend any
Pre-Closing Tax Return or Straddle Tax Return prepared and filed in accordance
with Section 6.12(c)(i) or Section 6.12(c)(ii), or otherwise filed prior to the
Closing Date, (b) make or change any Tax election or change any method of
accounting that would have retroactive effect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or
(c) except for Tax Returns prepared and filed in accordance with Section
6.12(c)(i) or Section 6.12(c)(ii), file any original Tax Returns of the Company
or its Subsidiaries (or otherwise initiate discussions or examinations with a
Governmental Entity, other than pursuant to the VDA Procedures described in
Section 6.12(h)) with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case,
without the Sellers’ consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).
(d) Tax Contests.
(i) Investor shall deliver a written notice to the Sellers promptly following
any demand, claim, or notice of commencement of a claim, proposed adjustment,
assessment, audit, examination or other administrative or court proceeding with
respect to Taxes of (or relating to) any of the Company or its Subsidiaries for
which the Sellers may have an indemnification obligation pursuant to this
Agreement or for which the Sellers may otherwise be liable (a “Tax Claim”) and
shall describe in reasonable detail, to the extent practicable, the facts
constituting the basis for such Tax Claim, the nature of the relief sought, and
the amount of the claimed Losses (including Taxes), if any, provided, however,
that the failure or delay to so notify the Sellers shall not relieve the Sellers
of any
52



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



claim of indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent that
the Sellers are prejudiced thereby.
(ii) The Sellers shall have the right to control and Investor shall have the
right to participate in (at its own expense) any Pre-Closing Tax
Contest; provided that (a) the Sellers shall keep Investor reasonably informed
of all material developments and events relating to such Pre-Closing Tax Contest
and to the extent any settlement or compromise of a Pre-Closing Tax Contest
could reasonably be expected to have the effect of increasing a Tax liability of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or owners in a taxable period or portion
thereof ending after the Closing Date, the Sellers shall not settle such
Pre-Closing Tax Contest without Investor’s prior written consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), (b) the Sellers shall provide
Investor with evidence reasonably acceptable to Investor that the Sellers will
have the financial resources necessary to conduct the defense of such contest
and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, and (c) the Company shall
have the right to make an election under Section 6226 of the Code for any
applicable taxable period with respect to such contest unless (i) each Seller
shall have paid, no fewer than 20 calendar days before the date on which such
election under Section 6226 of the Code is due, such Seller’s pro rata portion
of any imputed underpayment (as determined under Section 6225 of the Code)
attributable to such Seller plus any related interest and penalties and (ii) the
total amount paid by the Sellers is 100 percent of such imputed underpayment and
related interest and penalties.
(iii) The Company shall have the right to control and the Sellers shall have the
right to participate in (at their own expense), any Straddle Tax
Contest; provided that Investor shall keep the Sellers reasonably informed of
all material developments and events relating to such Straddle Tax Contest and
the Company shall not settle such Straddle Tax Contest without the Sellers’
prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed).
(iv) To the extent of any inconsistency between Article IX and this Section
6.12(d), the procedures in this Section 6.12(d) shall govern all Tax Claims.
(e) Closing Date Course of Business. For the portion of the Closing Date after
the Closing, other than transactions expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
Investor shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to carry on their business
only in the ordinary course in the same manner as heretofore conducted.
(f) Transfer Taxes. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Transfer Taxes that become payable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Sellers and
fifty percent (50%) by Investor. The parties shall cooperate in filing such
forms and documents as may be necessary to minimize or eliminate any such
Transfer Taxes to the extent commercially reasonable.
53



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(g) Allocation of Purchase Price. Within forty-five (45) days following the
final determination of the Post-Closing Adjustment, Investor shall prepare and
deliver to the Sellers an allocation of the Purchase Price (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, assumed liabilities) amongst the assets of the Company (the
“Purchase Price Allocation”). The Purchase Price Allocation shall be prepared in
accordance with applicable Law, including in accordance with Sections 1060, 751
and 755 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any
similar Law, as appropriate), and the methodology set forth on Schedule 6.12(g).
The Purchase Price Allocation shall be final and binding on all Parties unless,
within sixty (60) days after delivery thereof to Sellers, Sellers deliver a
written notice to Investor of its objections to the Purchase Price Allocation.
Sellers and Investor shall use their reasonable efforts to resolve any disputed
items specifically set forth in such written notice. If the Sellers and Investor
cannot come to a mutual agreement on the Purchase Price Allocation, the matter
shall be resolved in accordance with substantially identical procedures as set
forth for the resolution of disputes in Section 2.4(e). If Sellers do not timely
object to the Purchase Price Allocation or if all disputed items are resolved in
accordance with the foregoing sentence, then such Purchase Price Allocation,
taking into account the final resolution of any such disputed items (the “Final
Allocation Schedule”) shall be binding on all Parties for all Tax purposes. The
Investor shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers from time to time revised
copies of such Final Allocation Schedule so as to report any matters on the
Final Allocation Schedule that need updating. None of the Sellers, Investor, the
Company, or any of the Company’s Subsidiaries shall, nor shall they permit their
respective Affiliates to, take any position inconsistent with the Final
Allocation Schedule on any applicable Tax Return; provided, however, that if the
IRS (or comparable state, local or non-U.S. authority) makes an inconsistent
determination with respect to such position in a final audit determination, a
party shall be entitled to take an inconsistent position following the
conclusion of such audit.
(h) Sales Taxes.
(i) Promptly following the Closing Date, Investor shall engage a recognized
accounting or Sales Tax specialty firm as mutually agreed by Investor and
Sellers (the “Tax Consultant”) to, in consultation with Investor and Sellers,
determine with respect to each Pre-Closing Tax Period (1) other than states or
countries in which the Company, and each of the Company’s Subsidiaries, has at
all times collected Sales Taxes, as relevant, the states and countries in which
the Company, or any of the Company’s Subsidiaries, are required to collect (or
to have collected) Sales Taxes (any such state or country shall be a “Tentative
Nexus Jurisdiction”) and (2) a reasonable estimate of the aggregate liability
with respect to such Sales Taxes (including interest and penalties) for each
Tentative Nexus Jurisdiction (the “Nexus Study”). Investor and Sellers shall
cooperate with the Tax Consultant in its production of the Nexus Study, and both
Investor and the Sellers shall have the opportunity to participate in any
discussions with the Tax Consultant, to receive copies of any written
correspondence from the Tax Consultant and to review and comment on any written
submissions to the Tax Consultant. The Tax Consultant shall, as promptly as
possible, deliver a written Nexus Study to Investor and Sellers. If neither
54



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Investor nor Sellers object to the Nexus Study with respect to a Tentative Nexus
Jurisdiction, such state shall become an “Identified Nexus Jurisdiction”. If
either Investor or Sellers object to the report with respect to a Tentative
Nexus Jurisdiction, then the parties shall follow the review procedures set
forth in Section 2.4(e) of this Agreement, except that the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be a recognized expert in Sales Tax matters. Subject to
the remainder of this Section 6.12(h), the decision of the Independent
Accounting Firm with regard to whether any Tentative Nexus Jurisdiction is a
state or country where the Company, or any of the Company’s Subsidiaries, is
required to collect (or to have collected) Sales Taxes (which state or country
would then be an Identified Nexus Jurisdiction) and any revised amount of the
liability with respect to such Sales Taxes (including interest and penalties)
shall be final.
(ii) With regard to any Identified Nexus Jurisdiction, Investor shall have the
right to enter into and control “voluntary disclosure agreements” or other
similar programs with respect to the liability of the Company and/or any its
Subsidiaries for Sales Taxes with the applicable taxing authorities in the
Identified Nexus Jurisdictions for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods (such programs,
“VDA Procedures”); provided, however, that (i) Sellers shall have the right to
participate, at their own expense, in any VDA Procedure, (ii) Investor shall
consult with and keep Sellers reasonably informed of the status of such matter
(including consulting with and providing Sellers with copies of all written
correspondence regarding such matter, and shall not settle a matter without the
consent of Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), and (iii) Investor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
expeditiously commence and conclude (or to determine not to commence, in
consultation with the Sellers in good faith) any VDA Procedure.
(iii) Investor and Sellers shall cause the Company to use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate the Company’s Sales Tax liability for Pre-Closing
Tax Periods and Straddle Periods by, for each customer: (i) obtaining evidence
that such customer has remitted Sales Taxes where required or (ii) obtaining an
exemption certificate that sales to such customer are (or were, as applicable)
exempt from Sales Tax.
(i) K Skin LLC Tax Classification. As of the Closing Date, the Parties hereto
shall cause K Skin, LLC to be classified as disregarded as separate from its
owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes.
Section 6.13 KMJ and KKJ Trust Matters. Within ten (10) Business Days of the
date of this Agreement, each of KMJ Trust and KKJ Trust shall prepare and
deliver to Investor a certification of trust, signed and acknowledged by all of
the trustee(s) of KMJ Trust and KKJ Trust, as applicable, stating the powers of
such trustee(s) under the Trust Documents that establish the basis for the
representations described in Section 3.2 as applied to KMJ Trust and KKJ Trust,
as applicable and otherwise meeting the requirements of a “certification of
trust” or
55



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



“trust certificate” under the Law governing the Trust Documents of KMJ Trust and
KKJ Trust, as applicable (a “Certification of Trust”); provided, however, that
if the Law governing the Trust Documents of KMJ Trust and KKJ Trust, as
applicable, does not set forth requirements for a Certification of Trust, within
five (5) Business Days of the date of this Agreement, KMJ Trust and KKJ Trust,
as applicable shall instead prepare and deliver to Investor excerpts from such
Trust Documents that establish the basis for the representations described in
Section 3.2 as applied to KMJ Trust and KKJ Trust, as applicable.
Section 6.14 Notification of Certain Matters.
(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, each party hereto shall promptly notify the
other parties in writing of (i) any Actions that are instituted against such
party or its Affiliates seeking to restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the
legality of any of the Contemplated Transactions, or (ii) any claim by any
Person that such Person’s consent is required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by a Transaction Document; provided, however, that,
for the avoidance of doubt, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
6.14 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available to the parties
hereunder.
(b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Seller Group Parties shall give Investor
prompt written notice of any material development that would reasonably be
expected to cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.2 not to
be satisfied on the Closing Date.
(c) During the Pre-Closing Period, Investor shall give prompt written notice to
the Sellers of any material development that would reasonably be expected to
cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 or 7.3 on the Closing Date
not to be satisfied.
Section 6.15 Representation and Warranty Insurance. Prior to the Closing, upon
the reasonable request of Investor, the Seller Group Parties shall reasonably
cooperate with Investor in the procurement of a buy-side representation and
warranty policy, the costs, fees and premium of which shall be paid by Investor.
Section 6.16 Minimum Cash Amount. The Seller Group Parties shall cause the
Company to have an aggregate amount of Cash as of the Closing of no less than
$4,500,000 and prior to the Closing shall deliver Investor such documentation
(including bank account statements) as may be appropriate or as reasonably
requested by Investor evidencing the satisfaction of the foregoing obligation.
Section 6.17 Further Assurances. From and after the Closing, each party hereto
shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver such
additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and take such
further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions of
this Agreement and give effect to the Contemplated Transactions.

actually incurred by the Investor Indemnified Parties, and, subject to this
Article IX, reimburse, to the applicable Investor Indemnified Parties the amount
of, any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from:
(i) any Action by a third party arising from any Business Group Company’s
operation of any business other than the Business;
60

(b) Investor shall use and shall cause the Investor Indemnified Parties to use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Loss to the
extent required by applicable Law upon and after becoming aware of any event
which would reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses that may be
indemnifiable under this Section 9.1 (it being understood and agreed that any
reasonable out-of-pocket fees, costs or expenses incurred in connection with
such mitigation shall themselves constitute Losses, to the extent the Losses
mitigated would have been indemnifiable pursuant to this Article IX).

Agreement shall be treated for all purposes to be an adjustment to the Purchase
Price paid hereunder, except as otherwise required by Law.

that explicitly contemplates performance after the Closing, will, in each case

asserted hereunder is hereinafter referred to as the “Indemnifying Party”. A
claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may
be asserted by written notice (which shall include reasonable detail regarding
the claim and, if reasonably determinable, an estimate of the Losses thereunder)
(a “Direct Claim Notice”) to the Sellers, in respect of a claim for which
indemnification is sought under Section 9.1 prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period pursuant to Section 9.2(a).
(b) In the event that any Action is initiated that has or is reasonably expected
to result in Losses being asserted against or sought to be collected from an

Party shall with reasonable promptness notify the Indemnifying Party of the
Action, specifying the nature of and specific basis for the indemnity claim and
the amount or its good faith estimate of the amount of any Losses resulting
therefrom to the extent then feasible and enclosing a copy of all papers (if
any) served with respect to the claim, audit or other proceeding (the
“Third-Party Claim Notice”), but in any event not later than thirty (30) days
after receipt of such notice of such Third-Party Claim; provided, however that
any failure on the part of an Indemnified Party to so notify an Indemnifying
Party shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnifying Party under
this Article IX (except to the extent such failure materially and actually
prejudices the Indemnifying Party, and then only to the extent the Indemnifying
Party was actually prejudiced).
(c) In the event of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right, upon written notice to the Indemnified Party, to investigate, contest,
defend or settle any Third-Party Claim that may result in Losses or Expenses, as
applicable, with respect to which the Indemnified Party is entitled to make a
claim pursuant to this Article IX with the assistance of reputable outside legal
counsel that is acceptable to both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party (acting reasonably, and which for the avoidance of doubt shall include
Cooley); provided, however, that (i) the Third-Party Claim does not relate to or
arise in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation
or investigation; and (ii) the Third-Party Claim solely seeks (and continues to
seek) monetary damages.
(d) If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense, (i) the Indemnified Party
may, at its option and at its own expense (provided, however, that if in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party based on the advice of outside
counsel, there exists an actual or potential conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnified Party may assume its own defense, at its own expense,
participate in the investigation, contesting, defense or settlement of any such
Third-Party Claim through Representatives and legal counsel of its own choosing;
and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not settle or compromise any Third-Party
Claim unless the Indemnified Party shall have consented to the terms of such
settlement or compromise, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld
(other than any such settlement or compromise that causes each Indemnified Party
to be fully and unconditionally released from all Liability with respect to such
claim).
62



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(e) If reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in
contesting any Third-Party Claim or, if appropriate and related to the
Third-Party Claim in question, in making any reasonable counterclaim against the
Person making such Third-Party Claim, or any cross complaint against any Person
(other than Investor or its Affiliates) or similar action. If the Indemnifying
Party shall not have elected to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim
within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt of the Third-Party Claim Notice, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option, to do so; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise any
Third-Party Claim for which it seeks to make a claim pursuant to this Article IX
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld (other than any such settlement or compromise that causes
each Indemnified Party to be fully and unconditionally released from all
Liability with respect to such claim). If the Indemnified Party elects to assume
the defense of a Third-Party Claim pursuant to this Section 9.3(e), the
Indemnifying Party shall pay the Expenses (which for the avoidance of doubt
shall be Losses for which the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the Indemnified
Party actually and reasonably incurred in defending and such Third-Party Claim
upon receipt of any invoices and other documentation reasonably evidencing that
such Expenses are payable. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to
participate in (but not to control) the defense of any Third-Party Claim which
it has not elected to defend with its own counsel. For the avoidance of doubt,
no settlement of any such Third-Party Claim with third-party claimants shall be
determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter without the prior
consent of the Indemnifying Party,
(f) From and after the delivery of a Direct Claim Notice or a Third-Party Claim
Notice under this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall give the Indemnified
Party reasonable access to the books, records and properties of the Indemnifying
Party to the extent reasonably related to the matters to which such Direct Claim
Notice or Third-Party Claim Notice relates.
Section 9.4 Limitations.
(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Article IX shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the indemnified
party under insurance policies or otherwise with respect to such Losses (net of
any expenses incurred in connection with such recovery). If amounts are
recovered from an insurance policy after an indemnifying party makes a payment
to or on behalf of an indemnified party pursuant to this Article IX, the net
proceeds thereof shall promptly be remitted to the indemnifying party that made
such payment up to the amount of the indemnification payment made by the
applicable indemnifying party (less any costs to recover under such insurance
policy).
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no
party shall, in any event, be liable to any other Person for any punitive or
exemplary damages of such other Person, except to the extent payable to a third
party as a result of a final, non-appealable determination by a court or
arbitral tribunal of competent jurisdiction in respect of a Third-Party Claim.
63



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(c) Except for Losses arising out of or resulting from Fraud or Willful Breach,
or Losses indemnified under Section 9.1(a)(v), the Investor Indemnified Parties
shall not have the right to receive any indemnification for Losses arising from
any individual claim or a series of related claims pursuant to Section 9.1
unless and until the aggregate amount of Losses for any individual claim or
series of related claims under Section 9.1 exceeds $250,000, whereupon the
Investor Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
the terms hereof for the amount of all Losses in respect of all claims in excess
of such $250,000 amount, subject to the further limitations set forth in
Article IX.
(d) Except for Losses arising out of or resulting from Fraud or Willful Breach,
the aggregate liability of the Seller Group Parties (i) for Losses pursuant to
Section 9.1(a)(i) shall not exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price; (ii)
for Losses pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(ii) shall not exceed the amount set forth
in Schedule 9.1(a)(ii); (iii) for Losses pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(iii) shall
not exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price; and (iv) for Losses pursuant
to Section 9.1(a)(v) shall not exceed $20,000,000; provided that in no event
shall total indemnifiable Losses exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price.
Section 9.5 Materiality. The parties hereto hereby acknowledge and agree that
for the purpose of determining the amount of the applicable Losses and for
purposes of determining whether a breach or Loss has occurred, qualifications as
to materiality or material adverse effect (or any similar qualification) in any
representation, warranty or covenant set forth herein or in any other document
contemplated by this Agreement shall be ignored.
Section 9.6 Exclusive Remedy. Except in respect of Fraud or Willful Breach, the
remedies provided in this Article IX shall constitute the sole and exclusive
remedies available to the Investor Indemnified Parties for recourse against the
Seller Group Parties or any Person that controls the Seller Group Parties with
respect to any monetary claim arising under this Agreement, under any theory of
recovery, whether contract, tort or otherwise; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not limit the availability of any party hereto for relief
pursuant to Section 10.10; provided that the Investor Indemnified Parties’
remedy for recourse against the Seller Group Parties for a breach of Section
6.1(b)(xi) shall be to set-off an amount equal to the sum of (i) the accounts
payable incurred outside the ordinary course of business in breach of such
Section, plus (ii) the accounts payable whose payment was delayed in breach of
such Section, against a marketing fee payment that otherwise would be owed by
Investor to the Company pursuant to the Evergreen Collaboration Agreement.
Investor may only exercise the foregoing remedy once, within one (1) year
following the Closing, and in good faith after providing written notice of its
intention to the Seller Group Parties, such notice to contain reasonably
detailed information supporting the use of such remedy.

Section 10.3 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is

adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties will negotiate

whole or in part, to one or more of its Affiliates; provided, however, that no
such assignment shall relieve Investor of its obligations hereunder. Any
purported assignment in breach of this Section 10.6 shall be null and void.

such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other right.
No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute
