Second Lien Collateral Trustee, any other Second Lien Secured Party, the Third
Lien Collateral Trustee or any other Third Lien Secured Party shall commence any
judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a

case, without any consultation with or the consent of the Second Lien Collateral
Trustee, any other Second Lien Secured Party, the Third Lien Collateral Trustee
or any other Third Lien Secured Party. In exercising rights and remedies with
respect to the Collateral, the Priority Lien Agent and the other Priority Lien
Secured Parties may enforce the provisions of the Priority Lien Documents and

any Third Lien Security Document or any other Third Lien Document, as
applicable, shall be deemed to restrict in any way the rights and remedies of
the Priority Lien Agent or the other Priority Lien Secured Parties with respect
to the Collateral as set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
subject to Section 3.05, each of the Second Lien Collateral Trustee, on behalf
of the Second Lien Secured Parties, and the Third Lien Collateral Trustee, on
behalf of the Third Lien Secured Parties, may, but will have no obligation to,

create, preserve or protect (but not enforce) the Second Liens in the Collateral
or to perfect or continue the perfection of the Third Liens in the Collateral or
to create, preserve or protect (but not enforce) the Third Liens in the
Collateral, as applicable. Nothing herein shall limit the right or ability of
the Second Lien Secured Parties or any Third Lien Secured Parties to (i)
purchase (by credit bid or otherwise) all or any portion of the Collateral in

extent that, and so long as, the Priority Lien Secured Parties receive payment
in full in cash of all Priority Lien Obligations after giving effect thereto
until Discharge of Priority Lien Obligations has occurred or (ii) file a proof
of claim with respect to the Second Lien Obligations or the Third Lien
Obligations, as applicable.

Trustee nor any other Third Lien Secured Party shall commence any judicial or
nonjudicial foreclosure proceedings with respect to, seek to have a trustee,
receiver, liquidator or similar official appointed for or over, attempt any
action to take possession of, exercise any right, remedy or power with respect
to, or otherwise take any action to enforce its interest in or realize upon, or

Third Lien Security Document, applicable law or otherwise (including but not
limited to any right of setoff), it being agreed that only the Second Lien
Collateral Trustee, acting in accordance with the applicable Second Lien
Documents, shall have the exclusive right (and whether or not any Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding has been commenced), to take any such actions or exercise
any such remedies, in each case, without any consultation with or the consent of
the Third Lien Collateral Trustee or any other Third Lien Secured Party. In
exercising rights and remedies with respect to the Collateral following the
Discharge of Priority Lien Obligations and until the Discharge of Second Lien
Obligations, the Second Lien Collateral Trustee and the other Second Lien
Secured Parties may enforce the provisions of the Second Lien Documents and
exercise remedies thereunder, all in such order and in such manner as they may
determine in their sole discretion and regardless of whether such exercise and
enforcement is adverse to the interest of any Third Lien Secured Party. Such
exercise and enforcement following the Discharge of Priority Lien Obligations
and until the Discharge of Second Lien Obligations, shall include the rights of
an agent appointed by them to Dispose of Collateral upon foreclosure, to incur
expenses in connection with any such Disposition and to exercise all the rights
and remedies of a secured creditor under the Uniform Commercial Code, the
Bankruptcy Code or any other Bankruptcy Law and any other applicable laws.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, following the Discharge of
Priority Lien Obligations and until the Discharge of Second Lien Obligations,
the Second Lien Collateral Trustee will have the exclusive right to deal with
the Accounts, including exercising rights under control agreements with respect
to such Accounts. The Third Lien Collateral Trustee, for itself and on behalf of
the other Third Lien Secured Parties, hereby acknowledges and agrees that no
covenant, agreement or restriction contained in any Third Lien Security Document
or any other Third Lien Document shall be deemed to restrict in any way the
rights and remedies of the Second Lien Collateral Trustee or the other Second
Lien Secured Parties with respect to the Collateral as set forth in this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to Section 3.05, the Third
Lien Collateral Trustee may, but will have no obligation to, on behalf of the
Third Lien Secured Parties, take all such actions (not adverse to the Second
Liens or the rights of the Second Lien Collateral Trustee and the Second Lien
Secured Parties) it deems necessary to perfect or continue the perfection of the
Third Liens in the Collateral or to create, preserve or protect (but not
enforce) the Third Liens in the Collateral.

notice shall describe in reasonable detail the subject Collateral, the parties
involved in such Disposition or release, the place, time, manner and method

Excess Priority Lien Obligations and (B) if applicable, all Obligations
(including principal, unpaid interest, fees, reasonable attorneys’ fees and
legal expenses, but excluding contingent indemnification and reimbursement

(including unpaid amounts) then due in respect of such Hedging Obligations,
calculated pursuant to the terms of the applicable Swap Contract and after
giving effect to any netting arrangements;

 

(ii) a cash collateral deposit in such amount as the Priority Lien Agent
determines is reasonably necessary to secure the payment of any outstanding
letters of credit constituting Priority Lien Obligations that may become due and
payable after such sale (but not in any event in an amount greater than one
hundred and two percent (102%) of the amount then reasonably estimated by the
Priority Lien Agent to be the aggregate outstanding amount of such letters of
credit at such time), which cash collateral shall be (A) held by the Priority
Lien Agent as security solely to reimburse the issuers of such letters of credit
that become due and payable after such sale and any fees and expenses incurred
in connection with such letters of credit and (B) returned to the Second Lien
Trustee (except as may otherwise be required by applicable law or any order of
any court or other Governmental Authority) promptly after the expiration or
termination from time to time of all payment contingencies affecting such
letters of credit; and

Proceedings. (a) The parties hereto acknowledge that this Agreement is a
“subordination agreement” under Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and shall
continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding the commencement of any
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding by or against Gulfport or any subsidiary of
Gulfport. All references in this Agreement to Gulfport or any subsidiary of

(b) If Gulfport or any of its subsidiaries shall become subject to any
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding and shall, as debtor(s)-in-possession, or
if any receiver or trustee for such Person or Persons shall, move for approval
of financing (“DIP Financing”) to be provided by one or more lenders (the “DIP
Lenders”) under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code or the use of cash collateral
under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code, (i) the Second Lien Collateral
Trustee, for itself and on behalf of each Second Lien Secured Party, agrees that
neither it nor any other Second Lien Secured Party and (ii) the Third Lien
Collateral Trustee, for itself and on behalf of each Third Lien Secured Party,

such financing or to the Liens on the Collateral securing the same (“DIP
Financing Liens”), or to any use, sale or lease of cash collateral that

the Collateral to the Priority Liens, to such DIP Financing Liens and to any
customary carve-out in respect of professional fees and expenses and expenses of
the U.S. trustee, in each case, in connection with such Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding, so long as the Second Lien Collateral Trustee, on behalf
of the Second Lien Secured Parties, retains Liens on all the Collateral,
including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of any Insolvency or
Liquidation Proceeding, with the same priority relative to the Priority Liens

on the Collateral to the Priority Liens, the Second Liens, to such DIP Financing
Liens and to any customary carve-out in respect of professional fees and
expenses and expenses of the U.S. trustee, in each case, in connection with such
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, so long as the Third Lien Collateral
Trustee, on behalf of the Third Lien Secured Parties, retains Liens on all the
Collateral, including proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of any
Insolvency or Liquidation Proceeding, with the same priority relative to the
Priority Liens and the Second Liens as existed prior to the commencement of the
case under the Bankruptcy Code.

the Priority Lien Agent, in its sole discretion, each of the Second Lien
Collateral Trustee, for itself and on behalf of each Second Lien Secured Party
and the Third Lien Collateral Trustee, for itself and on behalf of each Third
Lien Secured Party, agrees not to propose, support or enter into any DIP
Financing.

Second Lien Secured Party and the Third Lien Collateral Trustee, for itself and
on behalf of each Third Lien Secured Party, agrees that it will not object to,

opposing or contesting) a sale or other Disposition, a motion to sell or Dispose
of any Collateral (or any portion thereof) under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy
Code or any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code, a motion to approve of the
bidding procedures for such sale or Disposition of any Collateral (or any
portion thereof) under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code or any other provision
of the Bankruptcy Code, or a motion to retain professionals that may provide
services in connection with any such sale or Disposition of any Collateral (or
any portion thereof), in each case, if the Priority Lien Agent (acting at the
direction of the requisite Priority Lien Secured Parties under the Priority Lien
Documents) or the requisite Priority Lien Secured Parties under the Priority
Lien Documents shall have consented to such sale or Disposition, such motion to
sell or Dispose, such bidding procedure for such sale or Disposition of such
Collateral, or such motion to retain professionals, and all Priority Liens,
Second Liens and Third Liens will attach to the proceeds of the sale in the same
respective priorities as set forth in this Agreement.

 

(e) Each of the Second Lien Collateral Trustee, for itself and on behalf of each
other Second Lien Secured Party and the Third Lien Collateral Trustee, for

Second Lien Secured Party, agrees that neither the Second Lien Collateral
Trustee nor any other Second Lien Secured Party and the Third Lien Collateral

motion for adequate protection (or any comparable request for relief) based upon
their interest in the Collateral, nor object to, oppose or contest (or join with
or support any third party objecting to, opposing or contesting) (i) any request
by the Priority Lien Agent or any other Priority Lien Secured Party for adequate
protection or (ii) any objection by the Priority Lien Agent or any other
Priority Lien Secured Party to any motion, relief, action or proceeding based on
the Priority Lien Agent or Priority Lien Secured Parties claiming a lack of
adequate protection, except that

 

(A) the Second Lien Collateral Trustee and the other Second Lien Secured Parties

Proceeding to, or for the benefit of, the Priority Lien Secured Parties; and

of the other of the Second Lien Secured Parties and the Third Lien Collateral
Trustee, for itself and on behalf of each of the other Third Lien Secured

Third Lien Secured Party, as applicable, may now or hereafter have against the
Priority Lien Agent or any other Priority Lien Secured Party (or their
representatives) arising out of any election by the Priority Lien Agent or any
Priority Lien Secured Parties, in any proceeding instituted under the Bankruptcy
Code, of the application of Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

Collateral Trustee and the Third Lien Collateral Trustee shall receive on or
prior to incurrence of a Priority Substitute Credit Facility, Second Lien
Substitute Facility or Third Lien Substitute Credit Facility (A) an Officer’s

their behalf), (ii) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Priority
Lien Obligations, after giving effect to such Priority Substitute Credit
Facility, shall not exceed the Priority Lien Cap and (iii) on or before the date

in an Officer’s Certificate delivered to the Priority Lien Agent, the Second

Debt”, “Second Lien Debt” or “Third Lien Debt”, as applicable, for the purposes
of the Secured Debt Documents and this Agreement; provided that no Series of
Secured Debt may be designated as more than one of Priority Lien Debt, Second
Lien Debt or Third Lien Debt.

 

37

 

  

(b) Gulfport will be permitted to designate as an additional holder of Second
Lien Obligations or Third Lien Obligations hereunder each Person who is, or who
becomes, the registered holder of Second Lien Debt or Third Lien Debt, as
applicable, incurred by Gulfport after the date of this Agreement in accordance

a Second Lien or Third Lien, as applicable, equally and ratably with all
previously existing and future Second Lien Debt or Third Lien Debt, as
applicable;

 

(ii) an authorized agent, trustee or other representative on behalf of the
holders or lenders of any Additional Second Lien Obligations, Initial Third Lien
Obligations or Additional Third Lien Obligations, as applicable, must be
designated as an additional holder of Secured Obligations hereunder and must,
prior to such designation, sign and deliver on behalf of the holders or lenders
of such Additional Second Lien Obligations, Initial Third Lien Obligations or
Additional Third Lien Obligations, as applicable, a Priority Confirmation
Joinder, and, to the extent necessary or appropriate to facilitate such
transaction, a new intercreditor agreement substantially similar to this
Agreement, as in effect on the date hereof; and

recorded (or caused to be recorded) in each appropriate governmental office all
relevant filings and recordations deemed necessary by Gulfport and the holder of
such Additional Second Lien Obligations, Initial Third Lien Obligations or
Additional Third Lien Obligations, as applicable, or its Secured Debt
Representative, to ensure that the Additional Second Lien Obligations, Initial
Third Lien Obligations or Additional Third Lien Obligations are secured by the
Collateral in accordance with the Second Lien Security Documents or the Third
Lien Security Documents, as applicable (provided that such filings and
recordings may be authorized, executed and recorded following any incurrence on
a post-closing basis if permitted by the Second Lien Representative or Third
Lien Representative for such Additional Second Lien Obligations or Additional
Third Lien Obligations, as applicable).

 

For the avoidance of doubt, the deliveries set forth in clauses (i) through
(iii) of Section 4.04(b) shall not be required (and shall be deemed satisfied)
in connection with an issuance of Additional Notes constituting Second Lien
Indenture Notes.

 

(c) Gulfport will be permitted to enter into an Initial Third Lien Debt Facility
to the extent such Initial Third Lien Debt Facility is permitted by the Priority

such Initial Third Lien Debt Facility may be secured by a Third Lien under and
pursuant to the Initial Third Lien Security Documents provided the Third Lien
Collateral Trustee, acting for itself and on behalf of the Initial Third Lien
Secured Parties, becomes a party to this Agreement by satisfying the conditions
set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately succeeding paragraph.

 

In order for the Third Lien Collateral Trustee to become a party to this
Agreement,

 

(i) the Priority Lien Agent, the Second Lien Collateral Trustee and the Third
Lien Collateral Trustee shall have executed and delivered a Priority
Confirmation Joinder pursuant to which (a) such Third Lien Collateral Trustee
becomes a Secured Debt Representative hereunder and (b) the Third Lien Debt and
the related Initial Third Lien Secured Parties become subject hereto and bound
hereby;

 

38

 

  

(ii) Gulfport shall have delivered to the Priority Lien Agent and the Second
Lien Collateral Trustee (A) true and complete copies of each Initial Third Lien
Document and (B) an Officer’s Certificate certifying such copies as being true
and correct and identifying the obligations to be designated as Initial Third
Lien Obligations and the initial aggregate principal amount thereof; and

 

(iii) without limiting Section 4.06, the Initial Third Lien Documents relating
to such Third Lien Debt shall provide, in a manner satisfactory to the Priority
Lien Agent and the Second Lien Collateral Trustee, that each Initial Third Lien
Secured Party shall be subject to and bound by the provisions of this Agreement
in its capacity as a holder of such Third Lien Debt.

 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will be construed to
allow Gulfport or any other Grantor to incur additional indebtedness unless
otherwise permitted by the terms of each applicable Secured Debt Document.

 

Each of the then-existing Priority Lien Agent, the Second Lien Collateral
Trustee and the Third Lien Collateral Trustee shall be authorized to execute and
deliver such documents and agreements (including amendments or supplements to
this Agreement) as such holders, lenders, agent, trustee or other representative
may reasonably request to give effect to any such Replacement or any incurrence
of Additional Notes, Additional Second Lien Obligations, Initial Third Lien
Obligations or Additional Third Lien Obligations, it being understood that the
Priority Lien Agent, the Second Lien Collateral Trustee and the Third Lien
Collateral Trustee or (if permitted by the terms of the applicable Secured Debt
Documents) the Grantors, without the consent of any other Secured Party or (in
the case of the Grantors) one or more Secured Debt Representatives, may amend,
supplement, modify or restate this Agreement to the extent necessary or
appropriate to facilitate such amendments or supplements to effect such
Replacement or incurrence all at the expense of the Grantors. Upon the
consummation of such Replacement or incurrence and the execution and delivery of
the documents and agreements contemplated in the preceding sentence, the holders
or lenders of such indebtedness and any authorized agent, trustee or other
representative thereof shall be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement.

the Third Lien Collateral Trustee or any other Third Lien Secured Party or any
other Person for such perfection or failure to perfect, it being understood that
