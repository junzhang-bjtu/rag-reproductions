Ladies and Gentlemen:
The undersigned, Oil-Dri Corporation of America, a Delaware corporation (the
“Company”), hereby agrees with Prudential, the Existing Holders, the Effective
Date Purchasers and the other Purchasers as follows:
INTRODUCTION
The Company and the Existing Holders are parties to a Note Agreement, dated as
of November 12, 2010 (the “Existing Agreement”). Under the Existing Agreement,
the Company has issued and sold, and the Existing Holders have purchased a
series of its senior promissory notes dated November 12, 2010 in the aggregate
original principal amount of $18,500,000 (the “Existing Notes”), which notes
shall be deemed amended and restated in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A-1
(as amended and restated, the “Series A Notes”). The Series A Notes mature

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof until the
principal thereof shall have become due and payable at the rate of 3.96% per
annum (provided that, during any period when an Event of Default shall be in
existence, at the election of the Required Holder(s) of the Series A Notes the
outstanding principal balance of the Series A Notes shall bear interest from and
after the date of such Event of Default and until such Event of Default ceases
to be in existence at the rate per annum from time to time equal to the Default
Rate) and on overdue payments at the rate per annum from time to time equal to
the Default Rate. The terms “Series A Note” and “Series A Notes” as used herein
shall include each Series A Note delivered pursuant to any provision of the
Existing Agreement or this Agreement and each Series A Note delivered in
substitution or exchange for any such Series A Note pursuant to any such
provision.
The Company, Prudential, the Existing Holders and the Effective Date Purchasers
desire to enter into this Agreement so as to, among other things (i) amend and
restate the Existing Agreement to read as set forth herein, (ii) provide for the
$3,083,330.33 aggregate principal amount of the Series A Notes outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Date to be outstanding under and subject to
the terms of this Agreement, (iii) provide for the issuance and sale of the
Series B Notes (as hereinafter defined) and (iv) provide for the possibility of
the issuance of Shelf Notes during the Issuance Period. Effective upon the
execution and delivery hereof by the Company, Prudential, the Existing Holders
and the Effective Date Purchasers agree that (a) the Existing Agreement shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth in this Agreement and
(b) each of the Series A Notes outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Date shall be deemed to be outstanding under this Agreement and be
entitled to the benefits hereof.
Accordingly, effective upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
paragraph 3A hereof, the parties hereto agree that the Existing Agreement is
amended and restated in its entirety to read as set forth in this Agreement and
that each of the Series A Notes outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Date and representing, in the aggregate, $3,083,330.33 outstanding
principal amount, shall be deemed to be outstanding under this Agreement and be
entitled to the benefits hereof and all references therein to the “Agreement” as
defined in any Series A Note, shall be deemed to be a reference to this
Agreement. This Agreement is in no way intended to constitute a novation of the
Series A Notes. All accrued and unpaid interest on the Series A Notes at the
interest rate set forth therein for periods prior to the date hereof shall
remain outstanding and be payable to the holders thereof on the first interest
payment date hereunder following the date hereof.
Reference is made to paragraph 10 hereof for definitions of capitalized terms
used herein and not otherwise defined herein.
1.    AUTHORIZATION OF ISSUE OF NOTES.
1A.    Authorization of Issue of Series B Notes. The Company will authorize the
issue of its senior promissory notes (the “Series B Notes”) in the aggregate
principal amount of $10,000,000, to be dated the date of issue thereof, to
mature May 15, 2030, to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the
date thereof until the principal thereof shall have become due and payable at
the rate of 3.95% per annum (provided that, during any period when an Event of
Default shall be in existence, at the election of the Required Holder(s) of the
Series B Notes the outstanding principal balance of the Series B Notes shall
bear interest from and after the date of such Event of


2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Default and until such Event of Default ceases to be in existence at the rate
per annum from time to time equal to the Default Rate) and on overdue payments
at the rate per annum from time to time equal to the Default Rate, and to be
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 attached hereto. The terms “Series B
Note” and “Series B Notes” as used herein shall include each such senior
promissory note delivered pursuant to any provision of this Agreement and each
such senior promissory note delivered in substitution or exchange for any such
Series B Note pursuant to any such provision.
1B.    Authorization of Issue of Shelf Notes. The Company may authorize the
issue of additional senior promissory notes (the “Shelf Notes”) in the aggregate
principal amount of the then applicable Available Facility Amount, to be dated
the date of issue thereof, to mature, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued,
no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an
average life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no more than 15 years
after the date of original issuance thereof, to bear interest on the unpaid
balance thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such
other particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so
issued, in the Confirmation of Acceptance with respect to such Shelf Note
delivered pursuant to paragraph 2B(5), and to be substantially in the form of
Exhibit A-3 attached hereto. The terms “Shelf Note” and “Shelf Notes” as used
herein shall include each Shelf Note delivered pursuant to any provision of this
Agreement and each Shelf Note delivered in substitution or exchange for any such

herein shall include each Series A Note, each Series B Note and each Shelf Note.
Notes which have (i) the same final maturity, (ii) the same principal prepayment
dates, (iii) the same principal prepayment amounts (as a percentage of the
original principal amount of each Note), (iv) the same interest rate, (v) the
same interest payment periods and (vi) the same date of issuance (which, in the
case of a Note issued in exchange for another Note, shall be deemed for these
purposes the date on which such Note’s ultimate predecessor Note was issued),
are herein called a “Series” of Notes.
2.    PURCHASE AND SALE OF NOTES.
2A.    Purchase and Sale of Series B Notes. The Company hereby agrees to sell to
each Effective Date Purchaser and, subject to the terms and conditions herein
set forth, each Effective Date Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Company the
aggregate principal amount of Series B Notes set forth opposite such Effective
Date Purchaser’s name on the Purchaser Schedule attached hereto at 100% of such
aggregate principal amount. On May 15, 2020 (the “Effective Date”), the Company
will deliver to each Effective Date Purchaser at the offices of Schiff Hardin
LLP, at 233 South Wacker Drive, Suite 7100, Chicago, IL 60606, one or more
Series B Notes registered in such Effective Date Purchaser’s name (or, if
specified in the Purchaser Schedule, in the name of the nominee(s) for such
Effective Date Purchaser specified in the Purchaser Schedule), evidencing the
aggregate principal amount of Series B Notes to be purchased by such Effective
Date Purchaser and in the denomination or denominations specified with respect
to such Effective Date Purchaser in the Purchaser Schedule attached hereto,
against payment of the purchase price thereof by transfer of immediately
available funds for credit to the account or accounts as shall be specified in a

attached hereto, from the Company to the Effective Date Purchasers delivered
prior to the Effective Date.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





2B.    Purchase and Sale of Shelf Notes.
2B(1).    Facility. Prudential is willing to consider, in its sole discretion
and within limits which may be authorized for purchase by Prudential Affiliates
from time to time, the purchase of Shelf Notes pursuant to this Agreement. The
willingness of Prudential to consider such purchase of Shelf Notes is herein
called the “Facility”. At any time, $75,000,000.00 minus the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of Notes and (without duplication) the aggregate
principal amount of Accepted Notes (as hereinafter defined) which have not yet
been purchased and sold hereunder prior to such time is herein called the
“Available Facility Amount” at such time. NOTWITHSTANDING THE WILLINGNESS OF
PRUDENTIAL TO CONSIDER PURCHASES OF SHELF NOTES BY PRUDENTIAL AFFILIATES, THIS
AGREEMENT IS ENTERED INTO ON THE EXPRESS UNDERSTANDING THAT NEITHER PRUDENTIAL
NOR ANY PRUDENTIAL AFFILIATE SHALL BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE OR ACCEPT OFFERS TO
PURCHASE SHELF NOTES, OR TO QUOTE RATES, SPREADS OR OTHER TERMS WITH RESPECT TO
SPECIFIC PURCHASES OF SHELF NOTES, AND THE FACILITY SHALL IN NO WAY BE CONSTRUED
AS A COMMITMENT BY PRUDENTIAL OR ANY PRUDENTIAL AFFILIATE.
2B(2).    Issuance Period. Shelf Notes may be issued and sold pursuant to this
Agreement until the earlier of (i) the third anniversary of the Effective Date
(or if the date of such anniversary is not a Business Day, the Business Day next
preceding such anniversary), (ii) the 30th day after Prudential shall have given
to the Company, or the Company shall have given to Prudential, a written notice
stating that it elects to terminate the issuance and sale of Shelf Notes
pursuant to this Agreement (or if such 30th day is not a Business Day, the
Business Day next preceding such 30th day), or in the case of notice given by
the Company to Prudential, such earlier date as is acceptable to Prudential in
its sole discretion), (iii) the termination of the Facility pursuant to
paragraph 7A of this Agreement, and (iv) the acceleration of any Note under
paragraph 7A of this Agreement. The period during which Shelf Notes may be
issued and sold pursuant to this Agreement is herein called the “Issuance
Period”.
2B(3).    Request for Purchase. The Company may from time to time during the
Issuance Period make requests for purchases of Shelf Notes (each such request
being a “Request for Purchase”). Each Request for Purchase shall be made to
Prudential by e-mail, facsimile transmission or overnight delivery service, and
shall (i) specify the aggregate principal amount of Shelf Notes covered thereby,
which shall not be less than $10,000,000 and not be greater than the Available
Facility Amount at the time such Request for Purchase is made, (ii) specify the
principal amounts, final maturities, principal prepayment dates (if any) and
amounts and interest payment periods (quarterly or semi-annually in arrears) of
the Shelf Notes covered thereby, (iii) specify the use of proceeds of such Shelf
Notes, (iv) specify the proposed day for the closing of the purchase and sale of
such Shelf Notes, which shall be a Business Day during the Issuance Period not
less than 10 days and not more than 25 days after the making of such Request for
Purchase (unless Prudential otherwise consents to a longer period), (v) specify
the number of the account and the name and address of the depository institution
to which the purchase prices of such Shelf Notes are to be transferred on the
Closing Day for such purchase and sale, (vi) certify that the representations
and warranties contained in paragraph 8 are true on and as of the date of such
Request for Purchase


4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





and that there exists on the date of such Request for Purchase no Event of
Default or Default, and (vii) be substantially in the form of Exhibit C attached
hereto. Each Request for Purchase shall be in writing and shall be deemed made
when received by Prudential.
2B(4).    Rate Quotes. Not later than five Business Days after the Company shall
have given Prudential a Request for Purchase pursuant to paragraph 2B(3),
Prudential may, but shall be under no obligation to, provide to the Company by
telephone, e-mail or facsimile transmission, in each case between 9:30 A.M. and
1:30 P.M. New York City local time (or such later time as Prudential may elect)
interest rate quotes for the several principal amounts, maturities, principal
prepayment schedules and interest payment periods of Shelf Notes specified in
such Request for Purchase. Each quote shall represent the interest rate per
annum payable on the outstanding principal balance of such Shelf Notes at which
a Prudential Affiliate or Affiliates would be willing to purchase such Shelf
Notes at 100% of the principal amount thereof.
2B(5).    Acceptance. Within the Acceptance Window with respect to any interest
rate quotes provided pursuant to paragraph 2B(4), the Company may, subject to
paragraph 2B(6), elect to accept such interest rate quotes as to not less than
$10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of the Shelf Notes specified in the
related Request for Purchase. Such election shall be made by an Authorized
Officer of the Company notifying Prudential by telephone, e-mail or facsimile
transmission within the Acceptance Window that the Company elects to accept such
interest rate quotes, specifying the Shelf Notes (each such Shelf Note being an
“Accepted Note”) as to which such acceptance (an “Acceptance”) relates. The day
the Company notifies Prudential of an Acceptance with respect to any Accepted
Notes is herein called the “Acceptance Day” for such Accepted Notes. Any
interest rate quotes as to which Prudential does not receive an Acceptance
within the Acceptance Window shall expire, and no purchase or sale of Shelf
Notes hereunder shall be made based on such expired interest rate quotes.
Subject to paragraph 2B(6) and the other terms and conditions hereof, the
Company agrees to sell to a Prudential Affiliate or Affiliates, and Prudential
agrees to cause the purchase by a Prudential Affiliate or Affiliates of, the
Accepted Notes at 100% of the principal amount of such Notes. As soon as
practicable following the Acceptance Day, the Company and each Prudential
Affiliate which is to purchase any such Accepted Notes will execute a
confirmation of such Acceptance substantially in the form of Exhibit D attached
hereto (a “Confirmation of Acceptance”). If the Company should fail to execute
and return to Prudential within three Business Days following the Company’s
receipt thereof a Confirmation of Acceptance with respect to any Accepted Notes,
Prudential or any Prudential Affiliate may at its election at any time prior to
Prudential’s receipt thereof cancel the closing with respect to such Accepted
Notes by so notifying the Company in writing.
2B(6).    Market Disruption. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2B(5),
if during an Acceptance Window and prior to the time of the applicable
Acceptance the domestic market for U.S. Treasury securities, derivatives or
other financial instruments shall have closed or there shall have occurred a
general suspension, material limitation, or significant disruption of trading in
securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange or in the domestic market
for U.S. Treasury securities, derivatives or other financial instruments, then
such interest rate quotes shall expire, and no purchase or sale of Shelf Notes
hereunder shall be made based on such expired interest rate quotes. If the
Company thereafter notifies Prudential of the Acceptance of any such interest
rate


5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





quotes, such Acceptance shall be ineffective for all purposes of this Agreement,
and Prudential shall promptly notify the Company that the provisions of this
paragraph 2B(6) are applicable with respect to such Acceptance.
2B(7).    Facility Closings. Not later than 11:30 A.M. (New York City local
time) on the Closing Day for any Accepted Notes, the Company will deliver to
each Purchaser listed in the Confirmation of Acceptance relating thereto at the
offices of Prudential Private Capital, 180 North Stetson Street, Suite 5600,
Chicago, Illinois 60601, Attention: Law Department, or at such other place as
Prudential may have directed, the Accepted Notes to be purchased by such
Purchaser in the form of one or more Notes in authorized denominations as such
Purchaser may request for each Series of Accepted Notes to be purchased on the
Closing Day, dated the Closing Day and registered in such Purchaser’s name (or
in the name of its nominee), against payment of the purchase price thereof by
transfer of immediately available funds for credit to the Company’s account
specified in the Request for Purchase of such Notes. If the Company fails to
tender to any Purchaser the Accepted Notes to be purchased by such Purchaser on
the scheduled Closing Day for such Accepted Notes as provided above in this
paragraph 2B(7), or any of the conditions specified in paragraph 3 shall not
have been fulfilled by the time required on such scheduled Closing Day, the
Company shall, prior to 1:00 P.M., New York City local time, on such scheduled
Closing Day notify Prudential (which notification shall be deemed received by
each Purchaser) in writing whether (i) such closing is to be rescheduled (such
rescheduled date to be a Business Day during the Issuance Period not less than
one Business Day and not more than 10 Business Days after such scheduled Closing
Day (the “Rescheduled Closing Day”)) and certify to Prudential (which
certification shall be for the benefit of each Purchaser) that the Company
reasonably believes that it will be able to comply with the conditions set forth
in paragraph 3 on such Rescheduled Closing Day and that the Company will pay the
Delayed Delivery Fee in accordance with paragraph 2B(8)(iii) or (ii) such
closing is to be canceled. In the event that the Company shall fail to give such
notice referred to in the preceding sentence, Prudential (on behalf of each
Purchaser) may at its election, at any time after 1:00 P.M., New York City local
time, on such scheduled Closing Day, notify the Company in writing that such
closing is to be canceled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary appearing in
this Agreement, the Company may not elect to reschedule a closing with respect
to any given Accepted Notes on more than one occasion, unless Prudential shall
have otherwise consented in writing.
2B(8).    Fees.
2B(8)(i).    [Reserved].
2B(8)(ii).    [Reserved].
2B(8)(iii).    Delayed Delivery Fee. If the closing of the purchase and sale of
any Accepted Note is delayed for any reason beyond the original Closing Day for
such Accepted Note, the Company will pay to each Purchaser which shall have
agreed to purchase such Accepted Note (a) on the Cancellation Date or actual
closing date of such purchase and sale and (b) if earlier, the next Business Day
following 90 days after the Acceptance Day for such Accepted Note and on each
Business Day following 90 days after the prior payment hereunder, a fee (the
“Delayed Delivery Fee”) calculated as follows:


6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





(BEY – MMY) X DTS/360 X PA
where “BEY” means Bond Equivalent Yield, i.e., the bond equivalent yield per
annum of such Accepted Note; “MMY” means Money Market Yield, i.e., the yield per
annum on a commercial paper investment of the highest quality selected by
Prudential and having a maturity date or dates the same as, or closest to, the
Rescheduled Closing Day or Rescheduled Closing Days for such Accepted Note (a
new alternative investment being selected by Prudential each time such closing
is delayed); “DTS” means Days to Settlement, i.e., the number of actual days
elapsed from and including the original Closing Day for such Accepted Note (in
the case of the first such payment with respect to such Accepted Note) or from
and including the date of the next preceding payment (in the case of any
subsequent Delayed Delivery Fee payment with respect to such Accepted Note) to
but excluding the date of such payment; and “PA” means Principal Amount, i.e.,
the principal amount of the Accepted Note for which such calculation is being
made. In no case shall the Delayed Delivery Fee be less than zero. Nothing
contained herein shall obligate any Purchaser to purchase any Accepted Note on
any day other than the Closing Day for such Accepted Note, as the same may be
rescheduled from time to time in compliance with paragraph 2B(7).
2B(8)(iv).    Cancellation Fee. If the Company at any time notifies Prudential
in writing that the Company is canceling the closing of the purchase and sale of
any Accepted Note, or if Prudential notifies the Company in writing under the
circumstances set forth in the last sentence of paragraph 2B(5) or the
penultimate sentence of paragraph 2B(7) that the closing of the purchase and
sale of such Accepted Note is to be canceled, or if the closing of the purchase
and sale of such Accepted Note is not consummated on or prior to the last day of
the Issuance Period (the date of any such notification or the last day of the
Issuance Period, as the case may be, being the “Cancellation Date”), the Company
will pay to each Purchaser which shall have agreed to purchase such Accepted
Note on the Cancellation Date in immediately available funds an amount (the
“Cancellation Fee”) calculated as follows:
PI X PA
where “PI” means Price Increase, i.e., the quotient (expressed in decimals)
obtained by dividing (a) the excess of the ask price (as determined by
Prudential) of the Hedge Treasury Note(s) on the Cancellation Date over the bid
price (as determined by Prudential) of the Hedge Treasury Notes(s) on the
Acceptance Day for such Accepted Note by (b) such bid price; and “PA” has the
meaning ascribed to it in paragraph 2B(8)(iii). The foregoing bid and ask prices
shall be as reported by TradeWeb LLC (or, if such data for any reason ceases to

the Series B Notes, without premium, the sum of $1,000,000.00 on May 15 in each
of the years 2021 through 2029, and such principal amounts of the Series B
Notes, together with interest thereon to the prepayment dates, shall become due
on such prepayment dates (provided that upon any prepayment or purchase of the
Series B Notes pursuant to paragraph 4E or 4F the principal amount of each
required prepayment of the Series B Notes becoming due under this paragraph
4A(2) on and after the date of such prepayment or purchase shall be reduced in

on any one occurrence or, if less, the aggregate total outstanding principal
amount of the Notes of such Series), at the option of the Company, at 100% of
the principal amount so prepaid plus interest thereon to the prepayment date and
the Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any, with respect to each such Note.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may not prepay any Series of Notes
under this paragraph 4B if a Default or Event of Default shall exist or would
result from such optional prepayment unless all Notes at the time outstanding
are prepaid on a pro rata basis. Any partial prepayment of a Series of Notes
pursuant to this paragraph 4B shall be applied in satisfaction of required
payments of principal thereof (including the required payment of principal due
upon the maturity thereof) in inverse order of their scheduled due dates.
4C.    Notice of Optional Prepayment. The Company shall give the holder of each
Note of a Series to be prepaid pursuant to paragraph 4B irrevocable written
notice of such prepayment not less than 10 Business Days prior to the prepayment
date (which shall be a Business Day), specifying such prepayment date and the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes of such Series, and the Notes of such
Series held by such holder, to be prepaid on such date, and stating that such
prepayment is to be made pursuant to paragraph 4B. Notice of prepayment having
been given as aforesaid, the principal amount of the Notes specified in such
notice, together with interest thereon to the prepayment date and together with
the Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any, with respect thereto, shall become due and
payable on such prepayment date and subject only to consummation of a financing
or other transaction (a “Payoff Transaction”) described in reasonable detail
therein.  The Company shall keep each applicable holder of Notes reasonably and

occur and (z) any determination by the Company that efforts to effect such
Payoff Transaction have ceased or been abandoned (in which case the prepayment
notice given pursuant to this paragraph 4C in respect of such proposed
prepayment shall be deemed rescinded); provided that, in any event, the Company
shall give the applicable holders of the Notes no less than three Business Days’
prior notice of such prepayment. The Company shall, on or before


12

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





the day on which it gives written notice of any prepayment pursuant to
paragraph 4B, give telephonic notice of the principal amount of the Notes to be
prepaid and the prepayment date to each holder of the Notes that is an
Institutional Investor which shall have designated a recipient of such notices
in the Purchaser Schedule attached hereto or the applicable Confirmation of
Acceptance or by notice in writing to the Company.
4D.    Application of Prepayments. In the case of each prepayment of less than
the entire outstanding principal amount of all Notes of any Series pursuant to
paragraphs 4A or 4B, the principal amount so prepaid shall be allocated pro rata
to all Notes of such Series at the time outstanding in proportion to the
respective outstanding principal amounts thereof.
4E.    Offer to Prepay Notes in the Event of a Change of Control.
4E(1).    Notice of Change of Control. The Company will, at least 10 days prior

the Notes as described in paragraph 4E(3) and shall be accompanied by the
certificate described in paragraph 4E(6).
4E(2).    Notice of Acceptance of Offer under Paragraph 4E(1). If the Company
shall at any time receive an acceptance to an offer to prepay Notes under
paragraph 4E(1) from some, but not all, of the holders of the Notes, then the
Company will, within two Business Days after the receipt of such acceptance,
give written notice of such acceptance to each other holder of the Notes.
4E(3).    Offer to Prepay Notes. The offer to prepay Notes contemplated by
paragraph 4E(1) shall be an offer to prepay, in accordance with and subject to
this paragraph 4E, all, but not less than all, of the Notes held by each holder
(in this case only, “holder” in respect of any Note registered in the name of a
nominee for a disclosed beneficial owner shall mean such beneficial owner) at
the time of the occurrence of the Change of Control.
4E(4).    Rejection; Acceptance. A holder of Notes may accept or reject the
offer to prepay made pursuant to this paragraph 4E by causing a notice of such
acceptance or rejection to be delivered to the Company prior to the prepayment
date. A failure by a holder of Notes to so respond to an offer to prepay made
pursuant to this paragraph 4E shall be deemed to constitute a rejection of such
offer by such holder.
4E(5).    Prepayment. Prepayment of the Notes to be prepaid pursuant to this
paragraph 4E shall be at 100% of the principal amount of such Notes, together
with interest on such Notes accrued to the date of prepayment but without any
Yield-Maintenance Amount with respect thereto. The prepayment shall be made at
the time of occurrence of a Change of Control.
4E(6).    Officer’s Certificate. Each offer to prepay the Notes pursuant to this
paragraph 4E shall be accompanied by a certificate, executed by a Responsible
Officer of the Company and dated the date of such offer, specifying (i) the
proposed prepayment date

(which shall be the date of the Change of Control), (ii) that such offer is made
pursuant to this paragraph 4E, (iii) the principal amount of each Note offered
to be prepaid, (iv) the interest that would be due on each Note offered to be
prepaid, accrued to the prepayment date, (v) that the conditions of this
paragraph 4E have been fulfilled, (vi) in reasonable detail, to the extent
permitted by applicable confidentiality provisions related to the Change of
Control, the nature and anticipated date of the Change of Control, and (vii)
that the information contained in the notice and in the certificate of
Responsible Officer, including the prospect of an anticipated Change of Control,
constitutes Confidential Information.
4F.    No Acquisition of Notes. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, prepay or otherwise retire in whole or in
part prior to their stated final maturity (other than by prepayment pursuant to
paragraph 4A or 4B, upon acceptance of an offer to prepay pursuant to
paragraph 4E, or upon acceleration of such final maturity pursuant to
paragraph 7A), or purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, Notes
of any Series held by any holder unless the Company or such Subsidiary or
Affiliate shall have offered to prepay or otherwise retire or purchase or
otherwise acquire, as the case may be, the same proportion of the aggregate
principal amount of Notes of such Series held by each other holder of Notes of
such Series at the time outstanding upon the same terms and conditions; provided
that the Company may offer to purchase Notes of only a given Series (as opposed
to an offer to purchase all, or a pro rata portion of all, Notes at the time
outstanding) under this paragraph 4F only to the extent no Default or Event of
Default shall exist or would result from such purchase. Any Notes so prepaid or
otherwise retired or purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall not be deemed to be outstanding for any
purpose under this Agreement.

(b)    Default -- if a Default or Event of Default then exists, at the expense
of the Company, to visit and inspect any of the offices or properties of the
Company or any Subsidiary, to examine all their respective books of account,
records, reports and other papers, to make copies and extracts therefrom, and to
discuss their respective affairs, finances and accounts with their respective
officers and independent public accountants (and by this provision the Company
authorizes said accountants to discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the
Company and its Subsidiaries), all at such times and as often as may be
requested.
5D.    Restricted Subsidiaries. So long as no Default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, the Company may at any time and from time to
time, upon not less than 30 days’ prior written notice given to Prudential and
each holder of the Notes, designate a previously Restricted Subsidiary as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a previously Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary, provided that immediately after such designation and after giving
effect thereto no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, and provided further that the status of such Subsidiary had not been
changed more than twice.


5E.    Compliance with Law. The Company will and will cause each of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to comply with all laws, ordinances or governmental
rules or regulations to which each of them is subject, including, without
limitation, Environmental Laws, and will obtain and maintain in effect all
licenses, certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental
authorizations necessary to the ownership of their respective properties or to
the conduct of their respective businesses, in each case to the extent necessary
to ensure that non-compliance with such laws, ordinances or governmental rules
or regulations or failures to obtain or maintain in effect such licenses,
certificates, permits, franchises and other governmental authorizations could
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.
5F.    Insurance. The Company will and will cause each of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurers,
insurance with respect to their respective properties and businesses against
such casualties and contingencies, of such types, on such terms and in such
amounts (including deductibles, co-insurance and self-insurance, if adequate
reserves are maintained with respect thereto) as is customary in the case of
entities of established reputations engaged in the same or a similar business
and similarly situated.
5G.    Maintenance of Properties. The Company will and will cause each of its
Restricted Subsidiaries to maintain and keep, or cause to be maintained and
kept, their respective properties in good repair, working order and condition
(other than ordinary wear and tear), so that the business carried on in
connection therewith may be properly conducted at all times, provided that this
paragraph 5G shall not prevent the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary from
discontinuing the operation and the maintenance of any of its properties if such
discontinuance is desirable in the


18

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





conduct of its business and the Company has concluded that such discontinuance
could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.
5H.    Payment of Taxes and Claims. The Company will and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to file all tax returns required to be filed in any jurisdiction
and to pay and discharge all taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns
and all other taxes, assessments, governmental charges, or levies imposed on
them or any of their properties, assets, income or franchises, to the extent
such taxes and assessments have become due and payable and before they have
become delinquent and all claims for which sums have become due and payable that
have or might become a Lien on properties or assets of the Company or any
Subsidiary, provided that neither the Company nor any Subsidiary need pay any
such tax or assessment or claims if (i) the amount, applicability or validity
thereof is contested by the Company or such Subsidiary on a timely basis in good
faith and in appropriate proceedings, and the Company or a Subsidiary has
established adequate reserves therefor in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles on the books of the Company or such Subsidiary or (ii) the
nonpayment of all such taxes, assessments and claims in the aggregate could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
5I.    Corporate Existence, etc. The Company will at all times preserve and keep
in full force and effect its corporate existence, except as otherwise permitted
by paragraph 6D. The Company will at all times preserve and keep in full force
and effect the corporate existence of each of its Restricted Subsidiaries
(unless merged into the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary) and all rights
and franchises of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries unless, in the
good faith judgment of the Company, the termination of or failure to preserve
and keep in full force and effect such corporate existence, right or franchise
could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
5J.    Ranking. The Company will ensure that, at all times, all liabilities of
the Company under the Notes will rank in right of payment either pari passu or
senior to all other Debt of the Company except for Debt which is preferred as a
result of being secured as permitted by paragraph 6C (but then only to the
extent of such security).
5K.    Additional Guarantors. The Company covenants that, if at any time any
Subsidiary becomes party to a Guarantee of any Debt of the Company, and such
Subsidiary is not a Guarantor at such time, the Company will, at the same time,
cause such Subsidiary to deliver to Prudential and the holders of the Notes a
joinder to the Guaranty Agreement in the form attached to the Guaranty Agreement
or a Guaranty Agreement substantially in the form of the Guaranty Agreement
delivered on the Effective Date pursuant to paragraph 3A(ii) hereof. Each such
joinder or such Guaranty Agreement shall be accompanied by a certificate of the
Secretary or Assistant Secretary of such Subsidiary certifying such Subsidiary’s
charter and by-laws (or comparable governing documents), resolutions of the
board of directors (or comparable governing body) of such Subsidiary authorizing
the execution and delivery of such joinder or such Guaranty Agreement and
incumbency and specimen signatures of the officers of such Subsidiary executing
such documents, and by such other certificates, documents, instruments and legal
opinions in connection therewith as may be reasonably requested by the Required
Holder(s), each in from and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required
Holder(s).


19

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





5L.    Most Favored Lender. (i) If, on any date following the Effective Date,
the Credit Agreement is amended to contain one or more Additional Covenants or
Additional Defaults, then (a) the Company will promptly, and in any event within
10 days thereafter, notify Prudential and the holders of the Notes thereof, and
(b) whether or not the Company provides such notice, the terms of this Agreement
shall, without any further action on the part of the Company, Prudential, or any
holder of the Notes, be deemed to be amended automatically to include each
Additional Covenant and each Additional Default in this Agreement. The Company
further covenants to promptly execute and deliver at its expense (including,
without limitation, the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and
expenses of counsel for Prudential and the holders of the Notes) an amendment to
this Agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Prudential and
the Required Holders evidencing the amendment of this Agreement to include such
Additional Covenants and Additional Defaults in this Agreement, provided that
the execution and delivery of such amendment shall not be a precondition to the
effectiveness of such amendment as provided for in this paragraph 5L, but shall
merely be for the convenience of the parties hereto.
(ii)    If after the time this Agreement is amended pursuant to clause (i) of
this paragraph 5L to include in this Agreement any Additional Covenant or
Additional Default (an “Incorporated Provision”) contained in the Credit
Agreement, such Incorporated Provision ceases to be in effect under or is
deleted from the Credit Agreement or is amended or modified for the purposes of
the Credit Agreement so as to become less restrictive with respect to the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries or Subsidiaries, as applicable, then,
upon the request of the Company, Prudential and the holders of the Notes will
amend this Agreement to delete or similarly amend or modify, as the case may be,
such Incorporated Covenant as in effect in this Agreement, provided that (a) no
Default or Event of Default shall be in existence immediately before or after
such deletion, amendment or modification (including under such Incorporated
Provision otherwise to be deleted, amended or modified), and (b) if any fees or
other remuneration were paid to any lender under the Credit Agreement with
respect to causing such Incorporated Provision to cease to be in effect or be
deleted or to be so amended or modified, then the Company shall have paid to the
holders of the Notes the same fees or other remuneration on a pro rata basis in
proportion to the relative outstanding principal amounts of the Notes and the
principal amount of the Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment to this Agreement pursuant to this
clause (ii) as the result of any Incorporated Provision ceasing to be in effect
or being deleted, amended or otherwise modified shall cause any covenant or
Event of Default in this Agreement to be less restrictive as to the Company or
its Restricted Subsidiaries or Subsidiaries, as applicable, than such covenant
or Event of Default as contained in this Agreement as in effect on the date
hereof, and as amended other than as the result of the application of clause (i)
of this paragraph 5L originally caused by such Incorporated Provision in the
Credit Agreement.
5M.    Information Required by Rule 144A. For so long as any of the Notes remain
outstanding and constitute “restricted securities” under Rule 144 under the
Securities Act and the Company is not filing reports pursuant to Section 13(a)
or Section 15 of the Exchange Act, the Company will, upon the request of the
holder of any Note, provide such holder, and any qualified institutional buyer
designated by such holder, to the extent available without unreasonable efforts,
the information specified under Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act in
connection with any


20

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





permitted resale of Notes,. For the purpose of this paragraph 5M, the term
“qualified institutional buyer” shall have the meaning specified in Rule 144A
under the Securities Act
6.    NEGATIVE COVENANTS. During the Issuance Period and so long thereafter as
any Note or other amount due hereunder is outstanding and unpaid, the Company
covenants as follows:
6A.    Financial Covenants.

Charges Coverage Ratio (“Ratio”) for any period of four consecutive fiscal
quarters ending at any time to be less than 1.50 to 1.

any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume,
guarantee, have outstanding, or otherwise become or remain directly or
indirectly liable with respect to, any Debt other than:


(i)    Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary outstanding as of the Effective Date and
disclosed in Schedule 8S, provided that such Debt may not be extended, renewed
or refunded except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement;


(ii)    Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary owed to the Company or another
Restricted Subsidiary;


(iii)    Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary outstanding at the time such Restricted
Subsidiary becomes a Subsidiary, provided that, (a) such Debt shall not have
been incurred in contemplation of such Restricted Subsidiary becoming a
Subsidiary, and (b) immediately after such Restricted Subsidiary becomes a
Subsidiary no Default or Event of Default shall exist, and any extension,
renewal or refunding of such Debt, provided that the principal amount thereof
outstanding immediately before giving effect to such extension, renewal or
refunding is not increased and no Default or Event of Default exists at the time
of such extension, renewal or refunding; and


(iv)    Debt of a Restricted Subsidiary in addition to that otherwise permitted
by the foregoing provisions of this paragraph 6B, provided that on the date the
Restricted Subsidiary incurs or otherwise becomes liable with respect to any
such additional Debt and immediately after giving effect thereto and the
concurrent retirement of any other Debt, (a) no Default or Event of Default
exists, and (b) Priority Debt does not exceed 20% of Consolidated Total
Capitalization, provided that Debt of Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of
industrial revenue bonds, secured by Liens permitted by paragraph 6C(viii) and
guaranteed by the Company shall not be included in Priority Debt for purposes of
determining compliance with this paragraph 6B(iv).




21

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Any Person which becomes a Restricted Subsidiary after the date hereof shall for
all purposes of this paragraph 6B be deemed to have created, assumed or incurred
at the time it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary all Debt of such corporation
existing immediately after it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary.


6C.    Liens. The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or permit to exist
(upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any Lien on or with respect
to any property or asset (including, without limitation, any document or
instrument in respect of goods or accounts receivable) of the Company or any
such Restricted Subsidiary, whether now owned or held or hereafter acquired, or
any income or profits therefrom, or assign or otherwise convey any right to

(vi)    Liens on property or assets of the Company or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries securing Debt owing to the Company or to another Restricted
Subsidiary;


(vii)    Liens existing as of Effective Date and securing the Debt of the

closing, provided that,


(a)    any such Lien shall extend solely to the item or items of such property
(or improvement thereon) so acquired or constructed and, if required by the
terms of the instrument originally creating such Lien, other property (or
improvement thereon) which is an improvement to or is acquired for specific use
in connection with such acquired or constructed property (or improvement

board of directors of the Company) of such property (or improvement thereon) at
the time of such acquisition or construction, and


(c)    any such Lien shall be created contemporaneously with, or within 180 days

by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary at the time such property is so
acquired (whether or not the Debt secured thereby shall have been assumed),
provided that (1) no such Lien shall have been created or assumed in
contemplation of such consolidation or merger or such Person’s becoming a
Restricted Subsidiary or such acquisition of property, and (2) each such Lien
shall extend solely to the item or items of property so acquired and, if

Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary so long as in any merger or
consolidation involving the Company, the Company shall be the surviving or
continuing corporation; and

the surviving entity is a solvent corporation organized and existing under the
laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the District of
Columbia, (b) the surviving entity (if other than the Company) expressly assumes
in writing the Company’s obligation under the Notes and this Agreement, (c) the

such assets to either (A) the acquisition of fixed assets useful and intended to
be used in the operation of the business of the Company and its Restricted

Subsidiaries with the right to obtain loans or other extensions of credit from
time to time, except to the extent that in connection with such payment of Debt
the availability of credit under such credit facility is permanently reduced by
an amount not less than the amount of such proceeds applied to the payment of
such Debt). It is understood and agreed by the Company that any such proceeds
paid and applied to the prepayment of the Notes as hereinabove provided shall be
prepaid as and to the extent provided in paragraph 4B.


(ii)    The Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to issue or sell
any shares of stock of any class (including as “stock” for the purposes of this
paragraph 6E, any warrants, rights or options to purchase or otherwise acquire
stock or other Securities exchangeable for or convertible into stock) of such
Restricted Subsidiary to any Person other than the Company or a Wholly-Owned
Restricted Subsidiary, except for the purpose of qualifying directors, or except
in satisfaction of the validly pre-existing preemptive rights of minority
stockholders in connection with the simultaneous issuance of stock to the
Company and/or a Restricted Subsidiary whereby
the Company and/or such Restricted Subsidiary maintain their same proportionate
interest in such Restricted Subsidiary.


(iii)    The Company will not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares
of stock of any Restricted Subsidiary (except to qualify directors) or any Debt
of any Restricted Subsidiary, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of (except to the Company or a Wholly-Owned
Restricted Subsidiary) any shares of stock or any Debt of any other Restricted
Subsidiary, unless:

stock and all Debt of such Restricted Subsidiary at the time owned by the
Company and by every other Restricted Subsidiary shall be sold, transferred or

mutatis mutandis.


25

6F.    Nature of Business. Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary
will engage in any business if, as a result, the general nature of the business,

on the Effective Date.

any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into directly or indirectly any transaction

service) with any Affiliate, except in the ordinary course and pursuant to the
reasonable requirements of the Company’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s
business and upon fair and reasonable terms no less favorable to the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary than would be obtainable in a comparable arm’s-length
transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.

shares of capital stock or similar equity interests of any Restricted Subsidiary
to be owned by an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

or (b) is prohibited by or subject to sanctions under any U.S. Economic
Sanctions Laws.

shall cease to be in full force and effect or shall be declared by a court or
governmental authority of competent jurisdiction to be void, voidable or
unenforceable against any such Guarantor; (ii) the Company or any Guarantor
shall contest the validity or enforceability of any Guaranty Agreement against
any such Guarantor, or (iii) the Company or any Guarantor shall deny that such
Guarantor has any further liability or obligation under any Guaranty Agreement
unless in each case the Guaranty Agreement is replaced by an equivalent new
Guaranty Agreement lacking the defect at issue;


then (a) if such event is an Event of Default specified in clause (i) or (ii) of
this paragraph 7A, any holder of any Note (other than the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates) may at its option, by notice in writing to the
Company, declare all of the Notes held by such holder to be, and all of the
Notes held by such holder shall thereupon be and become, immediately due and
payable at par together with interest accrued thereon, without presentment,
demand, protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by
the Company, (b) if such event is an Event of Default


28

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





specified in clause (vii) or (viii) (other than an Event of Default described in
clause (a) of paragraph 7A(vii) or described in clause (f) of paragraph 7A(vii)
by virtue of the fact that such clause encompasses clause (a) of paragraph
7A(vii)) of this paragraph 7A with respect to the Company, all of the Notes at
the time outstanding shall automatically become immediately due and payable
together with interest accrued thereon and together with the Yield-Maintenance
Amount, if any, with respect to each Note, without presentment, demand, protest
or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Company, and the
Facility shall automatically terminate, and (c) if such event is not an Event of
Default specified in clause (vii) or (viii) of this paragraph 7A with respect to
the Company or is an Event of Default described in clause (a) of paragraph
7A(vii) or described in clause (f) of paragraph 7A(vii) by virtue of the fact
that such clause encompasses clause (a) of paragraph 7A(vii) with respect to the
Company, the Required Holder(s) may at its or their option, by notice in writing
to the Company, declare all of the Notes to be, and all of the Notes shall
thereupon be and become, immediately due and payable together with interest
accrued thereon and together with the Yield-Maintenance Amount, if any, with
respect to each Note, without presentment, demand, protest or other notice of
any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the Company, and Prudential may at
its option, by notice in writing to the Company, terminate the Facility. The
Company acknowledges, and the parties hereto agree, that each holder of a Note
has the right to maintain its investment in the Notes free from repayment by the
Company (except as herein specifically provided for) and without the occurrence
of a Default or an Event of Default and that the provision for payment of
Yield-Maintenance Amount by the Company in the event the Notes are prepaid or
are accelerated as a result of an Event of Default is intended to provide
compensation for the deprivation of such right under such circumstances.
7B.    Rescission of Acceleration. At any time after any or all of the Notes
shall have been declared immediately due and payable pursuant to paragraph 7A,
the Required Holder(s) may, by notice in writing to the Company, rescind and
annul such declaration and its consequences if (i) the Company shall have paid
all overdue interest on the Notes, the principal of and Yield-Maintenance
Amount, if any, payable with respect to any Notes which have become due
otherwise than by reason of such declaration, and interest on such overdue
interest and overdue principal and Yield-Maintenance Amount at the Default Rate,
(ii) the Company shall not have paid any amounts which have become due solely by
reason of such declaration, (iii) all Events of Default and Defaults, other than
non-payment of amounts which have become due solely by reason of such
declaration, shall have been cured or waived pursuant to paragraph 11C, and (iv)
no judgment or decree shall have been entered for the payment of any amounts due
pursuant to the Notes or this Agreement. No such rescission or annulment shall
extend to or affect any subsequent Event of Default or Default or impair any
right arising therefrom.
7C.    Notice of Acceleration or Rescission. Whenever any Note shall be declared
immediately due and payable pursuant to paragraph 7A or any such declaration
shall be rescinded and annulled pursuant to paragraph 7B, the Company shall
forthwith give written notice thereof to the holder of each Note at the time
outstanding.
7D.    Other Remedies. If any Event of Default or Default shall occur and be
continuing, the holder of any Note may proceed to protect and enforce its rights
under this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and such Note by
exercising such remedies as are available to such holder


29

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





in respect thereof under applicable law, either by suit in equity or by action
at law, or both, whether for specific performance of any covenant or other
agreement contained in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or in
aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Agreement or any Transaction
Document. No remedy conferred in this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents upon the holder of any Note is intended to be exclusive of any other
remedy, and each and every such remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in
addition to every other remedy conferred herein or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.
8.    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The Company represents and warrants as
follows:
8A(1).    Organization; Subsidiary Preferred Stock. (i) The Company is a
corporation duly organized and existing in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and each Restricted Subsidiary is duly organized and existing
in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated.
The Company and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries have duly qualified or been
duly licensed, and are authorized to do business and are in good standing, in
each jurisdiction in which the ownership of their respective properties or the
nature of their respective businesses makes such qualification or licensing
necessary and in which the failure to be so qualified or licensed could be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Restricted Subsidiary
has any outstanding shares of any class of capital stock which has priority over
any other class of capital stock of such Subsidiary as to dividends or in
liquidation except as may be owned beneficially and of record by the Company or
a Wholly-Owned Restricted Subsidiary.
(ii)     Schedule 8A(1) (as it may be updated as of any Closing Day other than
the Effective Date) contains (except as noted therein) a complete and correct
list (a) of the Company’s Subsidiaries, showing, as to each Subsidiary, its
status (whether (1) a Restricted or Unrestricted Subsidiary and (2) a
Significant Subsidiary or not), the correct name thereof, the jurisdiction of
its organization, and the percentage of shares of each class of its capital
stock or similar equity interests outstanding owned by the Company and each
other Subsidiary, and (b) of the Company’s directors and senior officers.
(iii)    All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or similar equity
interests of each Restricted Subsidiary shown in Schedule 8A(1) as being owned
by the Company and its Subsidiaries have been validly issued, are fully paid and
nonassessable and are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free and clear
of any Lien (except as otherwise disclosed in Schedule 8A(1)).
(iv)    No Restricted Subsidiary is a party to, or otherwise subject to any
legal restriction or any Material agreement (other than this Agreement, the
agreements listed on Schedule 8A(1) and customary limitations imposed by
corporate law statutes) restricting the ability of such Restricted Subsidiary to
pay dividends out of profits or make any other similar distributions of profits
to the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that owns outstanding
shares of capital stock or similar equity interests of such Restricted
Subsidiary.
8A(2)    Power and Authority. The Company and each Restricted Subsidiary has all
requisite corporate power, limited liability company or partnership, as the case
may be, to own or


30

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





hold under lease and operate their respective properties which it purports to
own or hold under lease and to conduct its business as currently conducted and
as currently proposed to be conducted.
8A(3).    Execution and Delivery of Transaction Documents. The Company and each
Subsidiary has all requisite corporate, limited liability company or
partnership, as the case may be, power to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement, the Notes and the other Transaction Documents
to which it is a party. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, the Notes and the other Transaction Documents have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate, limited liability company or partnership,
as the case may be, action, and this Agreement, the Notes and the other
Transaction Documents have been duly executed and delivered by authorized
officers of the Company and each Subsidiary which is a party thereto and are
valid obligations of the Company and each such Subsidiary, legally binding upon
and enforceable against the Company and each such Subsidiary in accordance with
their terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).
8B.    Financial Statements. The Company has filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission annual reports on Form 10-K for each of the three fiscal
years of the Company most recently completed prior to the date as of which this
representation is made or repeated to such Purchaser (other than fiscal years
completed within 90 days prior to such date for which audited financial
statements have not been released), containing the following financial
statements: a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for each such year. Such financial statements
(including any related schedules and/or notes) present fairly in all material
respects the financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries
as of the dates shown and their results of operations and cash flows for the
periods shown, and such financial statements have been prepared in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The
balance sheets fairly present the condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as at the dates thereof, and the statements of income, stockholders’ equity and
cash flows fairly present the results of the operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their cash flows for the periods indicated. There has been no
material adverse change in the business, property or assets, condition
(financial or otherwise), operations or prospects of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole since July 31, 2019, or, in the case of the making
of this representation with respect to the issuance of a Series of Shelf Notes,
and except as otherwise disclosed in reports of the Company filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission since the end of the fiscal year referenced
below and provided to Prudential and the holders of the Notes pursuant to
paragraph 5A hereof, since the end of the most recent fiscal year for which
audited financial statements described in the first sentence of this
paragraph 8B have been filed prior to the time Prudential provided the interest
rate quote to the Company pursuant to paragraph 2B(4) with respect to such
Series of Shelf Notes.
8C.    Actions Pending. There is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any properties or rights of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, by or before any court, arbitrator


31

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





or administrative or governmental body which, individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to result in any Material Adverse Effect.
8D.    Outstanding Debt. Neither the Company nor any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries has outstanding any Debt except as permitted by paragraphs 6A(2)
and 6B. There exists no default under the provisions of any instrument
evidencing such Debt having an outstanding principal amount in excess of
$1,000,000 or of any agreement relating thereto.
8E.    Title to Properties. The Company has and each of its Restricted
Subsidiaries has good and indefeasible title to its respective real properties
(other than properties which it leases) and good title to all of its other
respective properties and assets, including the properties and assets reflected
in the most recent audited balance sheet referred to in paragraph 8B (other than
properties and assets disposed of in the ordinary course of business), subject
to no Lien of any kind except Liens permitted by paragraph 6C. All leases
necessary in any material respect for the conduct of the respective businesses
of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries are valid and subsisting and are
in full force and effect.
8F.    Taxes. The Company has and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries has filed
all federal, state and other income tax returns which, to the knowledge of the
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries, are required to be filed, and each
has paid all taxes as shown on such returns and on all assessments received by
it to the extent that such taxes have become due, except such taxes (a) the
amount of which is not individually or in the aggregate Material or (b) as are
being actively contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings for which
adequate reserves have been established in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles. The Company knows of no basis for any other tax or
assessment that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
The charges, accruals and reserves on the books of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of Federal, state or other taxes for all
fiscal periods are adequate. The U.S. federal income tax liabilities of the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries have been finally determined (whether by
reason of completed audits or the statute of limitations having run) for all
fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016, and the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries have satisfied all known U.S federal
income tax liabilities for all fiscal years up to and including the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2018.
8G.    Conflicting Agreements and Other Matters. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any contract or agreement or subject to any
charter or other corporate restriction which can reasonably be expected to
materially and adversely affects its ability to conduct its business or its
property or assets, condition (financial or otherwise) or operations. Neither
the execution nor delivery of this Agreement, the Notes or the other Transaction
Documents, nor the offering, issuance and sale of the Notes, nor fulfillment of
nor compliance with the terms and provisions hereof and of the Notes and the
other Transaction Documents will conflict with, or result in a breach of the
terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in
any violation of, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to, the
charter or by-laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any award of any
arbitrator or any agreement (including any agreement with stockholders),
instrument, order, judgment, decree, statute, law, rule or regulation to which
the Company or any


32

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





of its Subsidiaries is subject. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to, or otherwise subject to any provision contained in, any
instrument evidencing Indebtedness of the Company or such Subsidiary, any
agreement relating thereto or any other contract or agreement (including its
charter) which limits the amount of, or otherwise imposes restrictions on the
incurring of, Indebtedness of the Company of the type to be evidenced by the
Notes or Indebtedness of any Guarantor of the type to be evidenced by the
Guaranty Agreements except as set forth in the agreements listed in Schedule 8G
attached hereto.
8H.    Offering of Notes. Neither the Company nor any agent acting on its behalf
has, directly or indirectly, offered the Notes or any similar security of the
Company for sale to, or solicited any offers to buy the Notes or any similar
security of the Company from, or otherwise approached or negotiated with respect
thereto with, any Person other than Institutional Investors, and neither the
Company nor any agent acting on its behalf has taken or will take any action
which would require the issuance or sale of the Notes to be registered under
section 5 of the Securities Act or under the provisions of any securities or
Blue Sky law of any applicable jurisdiction.
8I.    Use of Proceeds. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owns or has any
present intention of acquiring any “margin stock” as defined in Regulation U (12
CFR Part 221) of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (herein
called “margin stock”). The proceeds of sale of the Notes will be used to fund
future principal payments of the Debt of the Company, acquisitions (provided
that none of the proceeds of the sale of the Notes will be used to finance a
Hostile Tender Offer), stock repurchases, capital expenditures and working
capital purposes; provided, that the proceeds of any Series of Shelf Notes will
be used as specified in the Request for Purchase with respect to such Series.
None of such proceeds will be used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose,
whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of purchasing or carrying any margin
stock or for the purpose of maintaining, reducing or retiring any Indebtedness
which was originally incurred to purchase or carry any stock that is currently a
margin stock or for any other purpose which might constitute the sale or
purchase of any Notes a “purpose credit” within the meaning of such Regulation
U. The Company is not engaged principally, or as one of its important
activities, in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or
carrying margin stock. Neither the Company nor any agent acting on its behalf
has taken or will take any action which might cause this Agreement, any of the
other Transaction Documents or any Note to violate Regulation T, Regulation U or
any other regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or
to violate the Exchange Act, in each case as in effect now or as the same may
hereafter be in effect.
8J.    ERISA. No contribution failure under Section 430 of the Code or
Section 303 of ERISA has occurred with respect to any applicable Plan, or under
an applicable contract with any Multiemployer Plan. No liability to the PBGC has
been or is expected by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate to be incurred with
respect to any Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) by the Company, any
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate which is or could reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to the business, property or assets, condition (financial or
otherwise) or operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.
Neither the Company, any Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred or
presently expects to incur any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA with
respect to any Multiemployer Plan which is or could reasonably be expected to be
materially adverse to the business, condition (financial or otherwise) or
operations of the


33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and the issuance and sale of
the Notes will be exempt from, or will not involve any transaction which is
subject to, the prohibitions of section 406 of ERISA and will not involve any
transaction in connection with which a penalty could be imposed under section
502(i) of ERISA or a tax could be imposed pursuant to section 4975 of the Code.
The representation by the Company in the next preceding sentence is made in
reliance upon and subject to the accuracy of each Purchaser’s representation in
paragraph 9C. All Non-U.S. Plans have been established, operated, administered
and maintained in compliance with all laws, regulations and orders applicable
thereto, except where failure so to comply could not be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. All premiums, contributions and any other
amounts required by applicable Non-U.S. Plan documents or applicable laws to be
paid or accrued by the Company and its Subsidiaries have been paid or accrued as
required, except where failure so to pay or accrue could not be reasonably
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
8K.    Governmental Consent. Neither the nature of the Company or of any
Subsidiary, nor any of their respective businesses or properties, nor any
relationship between the Company or any Subsidiary and any other Person, nor any
circumstance in connection with the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the
Notes is such as to require any authorization, consent, approval, exemption or
other action by or notice to or filing with any court or administrative or
governmental body (other than routine filings after the Closing Day for any
Notes with the Securities and Exchange Commission and/or state Blue Sky
authorities) in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents, the offering, issuance, sale or delivery of the
Notes or fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and provisions hereof or of
the Notes.
8L.    Compliance with Environmental and Other Laws. The Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries and all of their respective properties and facilities
have complied at all times and in all respects with all federal, state, local,
foreign and regional statutes, laws, ordinances and judicial or administrative
orders, judgments, rulings and regulations, including, without limitation, those
relating to protection of the environment except, in any such case, where
failure to comply, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
8M.    Regulatory Status. Neither the Company nor any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries is (i) an “investment company” or a company “controlled” by an
“investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended, or an “investment adviser” within the meaning of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, (ii) a “holding company” or a “subsidiary
company” or an “affiliate” of a “holding company” or of a “subsidiary company”
of a “holding company”, within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 2005, or (iii) a “public utility” within the meaning of the Federal Power
Act, as amended.
8N.    Permits and Other Operating Rights. The Company and each Restricted
Subsidiary has all such valid and sufficient certificates of convenience and
necessity, franchises, licenses, permits, operating rights and other
authorizations from federal, state, foreign, regional, municipal and other local
regulatory bodies or administrative agencies or other governmental bodies having
jurisdiction over the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any of its
properties, as are


34

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





necessary for the ownership, operation and maintenance of its businesses and
properties, as presently conducted and as proposed to be conducted while the
Notes are outstanding, subject to exceptions and deficiencies which,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and such certificates of convenience and necessity,
franchises, licenses, permits, operating rights and other authorizations from
federal, state, foreign, regional, municipal and other local regulatory bodies
or administrative agencies or other governmental bodies having jurisdiction over
the Company, any Restricted Subsidiary or any of its properties are free from
restrictions or conditions which, individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, and neither the
Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary is in violation of any thereof in any
material respect.
8O.    Rule 144A. The Notes are not of the same class as securities of the
Company, if any, listed on a national securities exchange, registered under
Section 6 of the Exchange Act or quoted in a U.S. automated inter-dealer
quotation system.
8P.    Absence of Financing Statements, etc. Except with respect to Liens
permitted by paragraph 6C hereof, there is no financing statement, security
agreement, chattel mortgage, real estate mortgage or other document filed or
recorded with any filing records, registry or other public office, that purports
to cover, affect or give notice of any present or possible future Lien on, or
security interest in, any assets or property of the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries or any rights relating thereto.
8Q.    Foreign Assets Control Regulations, Etc.
(i)    Neither the Company nor any Controlled Entity (a) is a Blocked Person,
(b) has been notified that its name appears or may in the future appear on a
State Sanctions List or (c) is a target of sanctions that have been imposed by
the United Nations or the European Union.

Authority for possible violation of any U.S. Economic Sanctions Laws, Anti-Money
Laundering Laws or Anti-Corruption Laws.
(iii)    No part of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes hereunder:
(a)    constitutes or will constitute funds obtained on behalf of any Blocked
Person or will otherwise be used by the Company or any Controlled Entity,
directly or indirectly, (1) in connection with any investment in, or any

would cause Prudential or any Purchaser to be in violation of any U.S. Economic
Sanctions Laws or (3) otherwise in violation of any U.S. Economic Sanctions
Laws;
(b)    will be used, directly or indirectly, in violation of, or cause
Prudential or any Purchaser to be in violation of, any applicable Anti-Money

improper payments, including bribes, to any Governmental Official or commercial

Prudential or any Purchaser to be in violation of, any applicable
Anti-Corruption Laws.
(iv)    The Company has established procedures and controls which it reasonably
believes are adequate (and otherwise comply with applicable law) to ensure that
the Company and each Controlled Entity is and will continue to be in compliance
with all applicable U.S. Economic Sanctions Laws, Anti-Money Laundering Laws and
Anti-Corruption Laws.
8R.    Disclosure. This Agreement, any other Transaction Document and the other
documents, certificates and other writings delivered to Prudential or any
Purchaser by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby taken as a whole do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained herein and therein not misleading. There
is no fact or facts peculiar to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which
materially adversely affects or in the future may (so far as the Company can now
reasonably foresee), individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
materially adversely affect the business, property or assets, or financial
condition of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries and which has not
been set forth in this Agreement, the Company’s Annual Report of Form 10-K for
the fiscal year immediately preceding the applicable Closing Day filed by the
Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or in the other documents,
certificates and statements furnished to Prudential and each Purchaser by or on
behalf of the Company prior to, in the case of the making of this representation
at the time of the execution of this Agreement and the issuance of the Series B
Notes, the date of this Agreement, or, in the case of the making of this
representation at the time of the issuance of a Series of Shelf Notes, prior to
the time Prudential provided the interest rate quote to the Company pursuant to
paragraph 2B(4) with respect to such Series of Shelf Notes. Any financial
projections delivered to Prudential or any Purchaser on or prior to the date
this representation is made or repeated are believed to be reasonable and are
based on the assumptions stated therein and the best information available to
the officers of the Company on the date such projections were delivered to
Prudential or such Purchaser. The Company has delivered to the Purchasers a
true, correct and complete copy of the Credit Agreement as is in effect as of
the Effective Date and all amendments thereto, in each case as in effect as of
the Effective Date.
8S.    Existing Indebtedness and Investments; Future Liens. (i) Except as
described therein and except as permitted by paragraphs 6A(2) and 6B, Schedule
8S sets forth a complete and correct list of all outstanding Debt of the Company
and its Restricted Subsidiaries secured by Liens as of the Effective Date, since
which date there has been no Material change in the amounts, interest rates,
sinking funds, installment payments or maturities of the Debt of the Company or
its Restricted Subsidiaries secured by Liens, as the case may be, other than as
set forth in any updated Schedule 8S delivered pursuant to a Request for
Purchase. Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary is in default and no
waiver of default is currently in effect, in the payment of any principal or
interest on any Debt of the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary having an
outstanding principal amount in excess of $1,000,000 and no event or condition
exists with respect to any such Debt of the


36

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that would permit (or that with notice or
the lapse of time, or both, would permit) one or more Persons to cause such Debt
to become due and payable before its stated maturity or before its regularly
scheduled dates of payment.
(ii)    Except as disclosed in Schedule 8S, neither the Company nor any
Restricted Subsidiary has agreed or consented to cause or permit in the future
(upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of its property, whether
now owned or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien not permitted by
paragraph 6C.
9.    REPRESENTATIONS OF EACH PURCHASER. Each Purchaser represents as follows:
9A.    Nature of Purchase. Such Purchaser is not acquiring the Notes purchased
by it hereunder with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution
thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act, provided that the disposition
of such Purchaser’s property shall at all times be and remain within its
control. Such Purchaser understands that the Notes have not been registered
under the Securities Act and may be resold only if registered pursuant to the
provisions of the Securities Act or if an exemption from registration is
available, except under circumstances where neither such registration nor such
an exemption is required by law, and that the Company is not required to
register the Notes.
9B.    Accredited Investor. Such Purchaser is an institutional “accredited
investor” as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3) or (a)(7) of Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act and an experienced and sophisticated
investor with such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as
is necessary to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment in the Notes.
9C.    Source of Funds. At least one of the following statements is an accurate
representation as to each source of funds (a “Source”) to be used by such
Purchaser to pay the purchase price of the Notes to be purchased by such
Purchaser hereunder:
(i)    the Source is an “insurance company general account” (as that term is
defined in the United States Department of Labor’s Prohibited Transaction
Exemption (“PTE”) 95-60) in respect of which the reserves and liabilities (as
defined by the annual statement for life insurance companies approved by the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC Annual Statement”))
for the general account contract(s) held by or on behalf of any employee benefit
plan together with the amount of the reserves and liabilities for the general
account contract(s) held by or on behalf of any other employee benefit plans
maintained by the same employer (or affiliate thereof as defined in PTE 95-60)
or by the same employee organization in the general account do not exceed 10% of
the total reserves and liabilities of the general account (exclusive of separate
account liabilities) plus surplus as set forth in the NAIC Annual Statement
filed with such Purchaser’s state of domicile; or
(ii)    the Source is a separate account that is maintained solely in connection
with such Purchaser’s fixed contractual obligations under which the amounts
payable, or credited, to any employee benefit plan (or its related trust) that
has any interest in such separate


37

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





account (or to any participant or beneficiary of such plan (including any
annuitant)) are not affected in any manner by the investment performance of the
separate account; or
(iii)    the Source is either (a) an insurance company pooled separate account,
within the meaning of PTE 90-1, or (b) a bank collective investment fund, within
the meaning of PTE 91-38 and, except as disclosed by such Purchaser to the
Company in writing pursuant to this clause (iii), no employee benefit plan or

workout, restructuring or renegotiation proceeding or bankruptcy case or in
connection with any prepayment of the Notes; and

instruction) for all fees and costs paid or payable by such Purchaser or holder
to the Securities Valuation Office of the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners in connection with the initial filing of this Agreement and all

The obligations of the Company under this paragraph 11B shall survive the
transfer of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein by any Purchaser or
Transferee and the payment of any Note.
11C.    Consent to Amendments. This Agreement may be amended, and the Company
may take any action herein prohibited, or omit to perform any act herein
required to be performed by it, if the Company shall obtain the written consent
to such amendment, action or omission to act, of the Required Holder(s) except
that, (i) with the written consent of the holders of all Notes of a particular
Series, and, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, of
the holders of all Notes of all Series at the time outstanding (and not without
such written consents), the Notes of such Series may be amended or the
provisions thereof waived to change the maturity thereof, to change or affect
the principal thereof, or to change or affect the rate, method of computation or
time of payment of interest on or any Yield‑Maintenance Amount payable with
respect to the Notes of such Series, in each case in any manner detrimental to,
or disproportionate with respect to, any holder of a Note, (ii) without the
written consent of the holder or holders of all


57

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Notes at the time outstanding, no amendment to or waiver of the provisions of
this Agreement shall change or affect the provisions of paragraph 7A or this
paragraph 11C insofar as such provisions relate to proportions of the principal
amount of the Notes of any Series, or the rights of any individual holder of
Notes, required with respect to any declaration of Notes to be due and payable
or with respect to any consent, amendment, waiver or declaration, (iii) with the
written consent of Prudential (and not without the written consent of
Prudential) the provisions of paragraph 2B may be amended or waived (except
insofar as any such amendment or waiver would affect any rights or obligations
with respect to the purchase and sale of Notes which shall have become Accepted
Notes prior to such amendment or waiver), and (iv) with the written consent of
all of the Purchasers which shall have become obligated to purchase Accepted
Notes of any Series (and not without the written consent of all such
Purchasers), any of the provisions of paragraphs 2B and 3 may be amended or
waived insofar as such amendment or waiver would affect only rights or
obligations with respect to the purchase and sale of the Accepted Notes of such
Series or the terms and provisions of such Accepted Notes. Each holder of any
Note at the time or thereafter outstanding shall be bound by any consent
authorized by this paragraph 11C, whether or not such Note shall have been
marked to indicate such consent, but any Notes issued thereafter may bear a
notation referring to any such consent. No course of dealing between the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries and Prudential or the holder of any Note nor any
delay in exercising any rights hereunder, under any Note or under any other
Transaction Document shall operate as a waiver of any rights of Prudential or
any holder of any Note. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no
negotiations or discussions in which Prudential or any holder of any Note may
engage regarding any possible amendments, consents or waivers with respect to
this Agreement, the Notes or any other Transaction Document shall constitute a
waiver of any Default or Event of Default, any term of this Agreement, any Note
or any other Transaction Document or any rights of Prudential or any such holder
under this Agreement, the Notes or any other Transaction Document. As used
herein and in the Notes, the term “this Agreement” and references thereto shall
mean this Agreement as it may from time to time be amended or supplemented.

Notes are issuable as registered notes without coupons in denominations of at
least $500,000, except as may be necessary to (i) reflect any principal amount
not evenly divisible by $500,000 or (ii) enable the registration of transfer by
a holder of its entire holding of any Series of Notes; provided, however, that
no such minimum denomination shall apply to Notes issued upon transfer by any
holder of the Notes to Prudential or any of Prudential’s Affiliates or to any
other entity or group of Affiliates with respect to which the Notes so issued or
transferred shall be managed by a single entity. The Company shall keep at its
principal office a register in which the Company shall provide for the
registration of Notes and of transfers of Notes. Upon surrender for registration
of transfer of any Note at the principal office of the Company, the Company
shall, at its expense, execute and deliver one or more new Notes of like tenor
and of a like aggregate principal amount, registered in the name of such
transferee or transferees. Each Transferee shall make the representations of
Purchasers set forth in paragraph 9 and shall agree to be bound by paragraph
11T. At the option of the holder of any Note, such Note may be exchanged for
other Notes of like tenor and of any authorized denominations, of a like
aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Note to be exchanged at the
principal office of the Company. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for
exchange, the Company shall, at its expense, execute and deliver the Notes which
the holder making the exchange is entitled to


58

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





receive, provided that, the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in respect of any such
transfer of Notes. Every Note surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer duly executed, by the holder of such Note or such holder’s attorney
duly authorized in writing. Any Note or Notes issued in exchange for any Note or
upon transfer thereof shall carry the rights to unpaid interest and interest to
accrue which were carried by the Note so exchanged or transferred, so that
neither gain nor loss of interest shall result from any such transfer or
exchange. Upon receipt of written notice from the holder of any Note of the
loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of such Note and, in the case of any such
loss, theft or destruction, upon receipt of such holder’s unsecured indemnity
agreement, or in the case of any such mutilation upon surrender and cancellation
of such Note, the Company will make and deliver a new Note, of like tenor, in
lieu of the lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note.
11E.    Persons Deemed Owners; Participations. Prior to due presentment for
registration of transfer, the Company may treat the Person in whose name any
Note is registered as the owner and holder of such Note for the purpose of
receiving payment of principal of, interest on and any Yield-Maintenance Amount
payable with respect to such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether
or not such Note shall be overdue, and the Company shall not be affected by
notice to the contrary. Subject to the preceding sentence, the holder of any
Note may from time to time grant participations in all or any part of such Note
to any Person on such terms and conditions as may be determined by such holder
in its sole and absolute discretion, provided that no additional obligation is
sought to be imposed on Company thereby.
11F.    Survival of Representations and Warranties; Entire Agreement. All
representations and warranties contained herein or in any other Transaction
Documents or made in writing by or on behalf of the Company or any Guarantor in
connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the Notes, the transfer by
any Purchaser of any Note or portion thereof or interest therein and the payment
of any Note, and may be relied upon by any Transferee, regardless of any
investigation made at any time by or on behalf of any Purchaser or any
Transferee. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement, the other
Transaction Documents and the Notes embody the entire agreement and
understanding between the Purchasers and the Company with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings relating to
such subject matter.
11G.    Successors and Assigns. All covenants and other agreements in this
Agreement contained by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto shall bind and
inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of the parties
hereto (including, without limitation, any Transferee) whether so expressed or
not.
11H.    Independence of Covenants; Beneficiaries of Covenants. All covenants
hereunder and in the other Transaction Documents shall be given independent
effect so that if a particular action or condition is prohibited by any one of
such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or
otherwise be in compliance within the limitations of, another covenant shall not
(i) avoid the occurrence of a Default or Event of Default if such action is
taken or such condition exists or (ii) in any way prejudice an attempt by
Prudential or the holder of any


59

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Note to prohibit through equitable action or otherwise the taking of any action
by the Company or any Subsidiary which would result in a Default or Event of
Default. The covenants of the Company contained in this Agreement are intended

THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.
11N.    Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction.
11O.    Descriptive Headings; Advice of Counsel; Interpretation. The descriptive
headings of the several paragraphs of this Agreement are inserted for
convenience only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement. Each party to
this Agreement represents to the other parties to this Agreement that such party
has been represented by counsel in connection with this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, that such party has discussed this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents with its counsel and that any and all issues with
respect to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents have been resolved
as set forth herein. No provision of this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document shall be construed against or interpreted to the disadvantage of any
party hereto by any court or other governmental or judicial authority by reason
of such party having or being deemed to have structured, drafted or dictated
such provision.
11P.    Counterparts; Facsimile or Electronic Signatures. This Agreement may be
executed in any number of counterparts (or counterpart signature pages), each of
which counterparts shall be an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature
page to this Agreement by facsimile or electronic transmission shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. The
words “executed,” “signature,” and words of like import herein shall be deemed
to include electronic signatures which shall be of the same legal effect,
validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature, to the extent and
as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the Illinois Electronic Commerce
Security Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic
Transactions Act.
11Q.    Severalty of Obligations. The sales of Notes to the Purchasers are to be
several sales, and the obligations of Prudential and the Purchasers under this
Agreement are several obligations. No failure by Prudential or any Purchaser to
perform its obligations under this Agreement shall relieve any other Purchaser
or the Company of any of its obligations hereunder,


62

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





and neither Prudential nor any Purchaser shall be responsible for the
obligations of, or any action taken or omitted by, any other such Person
hereunder.
11R.    Independent Investigation. Each Purchaser represents to and agrees with
each other Purchaser that it has made its own independent investigation of the
condition (financial and otherwise), prospects and affairs of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in connection with its purchase of the Notes hereunder and has
made and shall continue to make its own appraisal of the creditworthiness of the
Company. No holder of Notes shall have any duties or responsibility to any other
holder of Notes, either initially or on a continuing basis, to make any such
investigation or appraisal or to provide any credit or other information with
respect thereto. No holder of Notes is acting as agent or in any other fiduciary
capacity on behalf of any other holder of Notes.
11S.    Directly or Indirectly. Where any provision in this Agreement refers to
actions to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from
taking, such provision shall be applicable whether the action in question is
taken directly or indirectly by such Person.
11T.    Confidential Information. For the purposes of this paragraph 11T,
“Confidential Information” means information delivered to Prudential or any
Purchaser by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with
the transactions contemplated by or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement that is
clearly proprietary in nature or is marked or labeled or otherwise adequately
identified when received by Prudential or such Purchaser as being confidential
information of the Company or such Subsidiary, provided that such term does not
include information that (a) was publicly known or otherwise known to Prudential
or such Purchaser prior to the time of such disclosure, (b) subsequently becomes
publicly known through no act or omission by Prudential or such Purchaser or any
person acting on Prudential’s or such Purchaser’s behalf, (c) otherwise becomes
known to Prudential or such Purchaser other than through disclosure by or on
behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary or other person under obligation of
confidentiality to the Company or any Subsidiary or (d) constitutes financial
statements delivered to Prudential or such Purchaser under paragraph 5A that are
otherwise publicly available. Prudential and each Purchaser will maintain the
confidentiality of such Confidential Information in accordance with procedures
adopted by Prudential or such Purchaser in good faith to protect confidential
information of third parties delivered to Prudential or such Purchaser, provided
that Prudential or such Purchaser may deliver or disclose Confidential
Information together with notice of its confidentiality to (i) its directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys, trustees and affiliates (to the extent
such disclosure reasonably relates to the administration of this Agreement or
the investment represented by its Notes), (ii) its auditors, financial advisors
and other professional advisors who agree to hold confidential the Confidential
Information substantially in accordance with the terms of this paragraph 11T,
(iii) any other holder of any Note, (iv) any Institutional Investor to which it
sells or offers to sell such Note or any part thereof or any participation
therein (if such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such
Confidential Information to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph 11T),
(v) any Person from which it offers to purchase any security of the Company (if
such Person has agreed in writing prior to its receipt of such Confidential
Information to be bound by the provisions of this paragraph 11T), (vi) any
federal or state regulatory authority having jurisdiction over such Purchaser,
(vii) the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or any successor
thereto (the “NAIC”) or the Capital Markets & Investment Analysis Office of the
NAIC


63

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





or any successor to such Office or, in each case, any similar organization, or
any nationally recognized rating agency that requires access to information
about Prudential or such Purchaser’s investment portfolio, or (viii) any other
Person to which such delivery or disclosure may be necessary or appropriate (w)
to effect compliance with any law, rule, regulation or order applicable to
Prudential or such Purchaser, (x) in response to any subpoena or other legal
process, (y) in connection with any litigation to which Prudential or such
Purchaser is a party or (z) if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, to the extent Prudential or such Purchaser may reasonably determine
such delivery and disclosure to be necessary or appropriate in the enforcement
or for the protection of the rights and remedies under such Purchaser’s Notes,
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. Each holder of a Note, by its
acceptance of a Note, will be deemed to have agreed to be bound by and to be
entitled to the benefits of this paragraph 11T as though it were a party to this
Agreement. On reasonable request by the Company in connection with the delivery
to any holder of a Note of information required to be delivered to such holder
under this Agreement or requested by such holder (other than a holder that is a
party to this Agreement or its nominee), or in connection with a transfer
contemplated by paragraph 11D, such holder will enter into an agreement with the
Company embodying the provisions of this paragraph 11T.
In the event that as a condition to receiving access to information relating to
the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated
by or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, Prudential, any Purchaser or any
holder of a Note is required to agree to a confidentiality undertaking (whether
through IntraLinks, another secure website, a secure virtual workspace or
otherwise) which is different from this paragraph 11T, this paragraph 11T shall
not be amended thereby and, as between Prudential, such Purchaser or such holder
and the Company, this paragraph 11T shall supersede any such other
confidentiality undertaking.
11U.    Transaction References. The Company agrees that Prudential and
Prudential Private Capital (or an Affiliate thereof) may (a) refer to its role
in establishing the Facility, to the purchase of the Notes and the maximum
aggregate principal amount of the Notes and the date on which the Facility and
Notes were established, on its internet site, social media channels or in
marketing materials, press releases, published “tombstone” announcements or any
other print or electronic medium and (b) display the Company’s corporate logo in
conjunction with any such reference so long as prior to any such use or
reference the Company has approved such use or reference (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
11V.    Binding Agreement. When this Agreement is executed and delivered by the
Company, Prudential, the Existing Holders, and the Effective Date Purchasers it
shall become a binding agreement between the Company, Prudential, the Existing
Holders, and the Effective Date Purchasers. This Agreement shall also inure to
the benefit of each Purchaser which shall have executed and delivered a
Confirmation of Acceptance, and each such Purchaser shall be bound by this
Agreement to the extent provided in such Confirmation of Acceptance.

2A.    Guaranty of Payment. Each Guarantor, jointly and severally, absolutely,
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the full and prompt payment in United

earlier by reason of acceleration or otherwise) and at all times thereafter, of
all of the indebtedness, existing on the date hereof or arising from time to
time hereafter, whether direct or indirect, joint or several, actual, absolute
or contingent, matured or unmatured, liquidated or unliquidated, secured or
unsecured, arising by contract, operation of law or otherwise, of the Company to

Guaranty to be void, voidable or otherwise unenforceable under, any fraudulent
conveyance or fraudulent transfer law, including Section 548(a)(2) of the

Upon an Event of Default, any Guaranty Beneficiary may, at its sole election and
without notice, proceed directly and at once against any Guarantor to seek and
enforce payment of, and to collect and recover, the Guarantied Obligations, or
any portion thereof, without first proceeding against the Company, any other
Guarantor or any other Person or against any security for the Guarantied
Obligations or for the liability of any such other Person or the Guarantor
hereunder. Each Guaranty Beneficiary shall have the exclusive right to determine
the application of payments and credits, if any, to such Guaranty Beneficiary
from each Guarantor, the Company or from any other Person on account of the
Guarantied Obligations or otherwise. This Guaranty and all covenants and
agreements of each Guarantor contained herein shall continue in full force and
effect and shall not be discharged until such a time as all of the Guarantied
Obligations shall be indefeasibly paid in full in cash.
2B.    Obligations Unconditional. The obligations of each Guarantor under this
Guaranty shall be continuing, absolute and unconditional, irrespective of (i)
the invalidity or unenforceability of the Note Agreement, the Notes or any other
agreements, documents, certificates and instruments now or hereafter executed or
delivered by the Company or any other Guarantor or any other Person in
connection with the Note Agreement or any provision thereof; (ii) the absence of

any other Guarantor or any other Person or any or all of the Guarantied
Obligations; (iv) any defense arising by reason of any disability (other than a
defense of payment, unless the payment on which such defense is based was or is
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, otherwise
avoided and/or required to be repaid to the Company or a Guarantor, as the case
may be, or the estate of any such party, a trustee, receiver or any other Person
under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause,
in which case there shall be no defense of payment with respect to such payment)
of the Company or any other Person liable on the Guarantied Obligations or any
portion thereof; (v) any Guaranty Beneficiary's election, in any proceeding
instituted under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code (11
U.S.C. §101 et seq.) (the “Bankruptcy Code”), of the application of Section
1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (vi) any borrowing or grant of a security

Lien securing the Guarantied Obligations or the liability of any Guarantor
hereunder or of the Company or any other guarantor of all or any part of the
Guarantied Obligations; (viii) any amendment to, waiver or modification of, or
consent, extension, indulgence or other action or inaction under or in respect
of the Note Agreement, the Notes or any other agreements, documents,

limitation any agreement with stockholders), instrument or undertaking to which
any Guarantor or the Company is a party or which purports to be binding on or
affect any such Person or any of its assets; (xiii) any bankruptcy, insolvency,
readjustment, composition, liquidation or similar proceeding with respect to the
Company, any Guarantor or any other guarantor of all or any portion of any
Guarantied Obligations or any such Person's property and any failure by any
Guaranty Beneficiary to file or enforce a claim against the Company, any
Guarantor or any such other Person in any such proceeding; (xiv) any failure on
the part of the Company for any reason to comply with or perform any of the
terms of any other agreement with any Guarantor; or (xv) any other circumstance
which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge or defense of a
guarantor (other than a defense of payment, unless the payment on which such
defense is based was or is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent
or preferential, otherwise avoided and/or required to be repaid to the Company
or a Guarantor, as the case may be, or the estate of any such party, a trustee,
receiver or any other Person under any bankruptcy law, state or federal law,
common law or equitable cause, in which case there shall be no defense of
payment with respect to such payment).

terms relating to, the Guarantied Obligations or any portion thereof, or

G-6

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





No Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have acquired by way of

keeping itself informed of the financial condition of the Company and any other
Persons primarily or secondarily liable on the Guarantied Obligations or any
portion thereof, and of all other circumstances bearing upon the risk of
nonpayment of the Guarantied Obligations or any portion thereof, and each
Guarantor agrees that no Guaranty Beneficiary shall have any duty to advise such
Guarantor of information known to such Guaranty Beneficiary regarding such

each Guaranty Beneficiary and its successors, transferees and assigns; all

agreement. It shall not be necessary in making proof of this Guaranty to produce

independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is prohibited by
any one of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception
to, or otherwise be in compliance within the limitations of, another covenant
shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such
action is taken or such condition exists.
4K.    Severability. Any provision of this Guaranty which is prohibited or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any

EXHIBIT A
[FORM OF JOINDER AGREEMENT TO AMENDED AND RESTATED GUARANTY AGREEMENT]
JOINDER AGREEMENT NO.____TO AMENDED AND RESTATED GUARANTY AGREEMENT
Re: OIL-DRI CORPORATION OF AMERICA
This Joinder Agreement is made as of ______________, in favor of the Guaranty
Beneficiaries (as defined in the Oil-Dri Guaranty, as hereinafter defined).
A.    Reference is made to the Amended and Restated Guaranty Agreement made as
of May 15, 2020 (as may be supplemented, amended, restated or consolidated from
time to time, the “Oil-Dri Guaranty”) by certain Persons in favor of the
Guaranty Beneficiaries (as defined in the Oil-Dri Guaranty), under which such
Persons have guaranteed to the Guaranty Beneficiaries the due payment and
performance by Oil-Dri Corporation of America, a Delaware corporation
(“Oil-Dri”) of the Guarantied Obligations (as defined in the Oil-Dri Guaranty).
B.    Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined in this Joinder Agreement
have the respective meanings given to such terms in the Oil-Dri Guaranty,
including the definitions of terms incorporated in the Oil-Dri Guaranty by
reference to other agreements.
C.    Section 4B of the Oil-Dri Guaranty provides that additional Persons may
from time to time after the date of the Oil-Dri Guaranty become Guarantors under
the Oil-Dri Guaranty by executing and delivering to the Guaranty Beneficiary a
supplemental agreement to the Oil-Dri Guaranty in the form of this Joinder
Agreement.
For valuable consideration, each of the undersigned (each a “New Guarantor”)
severally (and not jointly, or jointly and severally) agrees as follows:
1.    Each of the New Guarantors has received a copy of, and has reviewed, the
Oil-Dri Guaranty and the Transaction Documents in existence on the date of this
Joinder Agreement and is executing and delivering this Joinder Agreement to the
Guaranty Beneficiaries pursuant to Section 4B of the Oil-Dri Guaranty.
2.    Effective from and after the date this Joinder Agreement is executed and
delivered to the Guaranty Beneficiaries by any one of the New Guarantors (and
irrespective of whether this Joinder Agreement has been executed and delivered
by any other Person), such New Guarantor is, and shall be deemed for all
purposes to be, a Guarantor under the Oil-Dri Guaranty with the same force and
effect, and subject to the same agreements, representations, guarantees,
indemnities, liabilities and obligations, as if such New Guarantor was,
effective as of the date of this Joinder Agreement, an original signatory to the
Oil-Dri Guaranty as a Guarantor. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the
New Guarantors jointly and severally guarantees to the Guaranty Beneficiaries in
accordance with the provisions of the Oil-Dri Guaranty the due and punctual
payment and


G-15

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





performance in full of each of the Guarantied Obligations as each such
Guarantied Obligation becomes due from time to time (whether because of
maturity, default, demand, acceleration or otherwise) and understands, agrees
and confirms that the Guaranty Beneficiaries may enforce the Oil-Dri Guaranty
and this Joinder Agreement against such New Guarantor for the benefit of the
Guaranty Beneficiaries up to the full amount of the Guarantied Obligations
without proceeding against any other Guarantor, Oil-Dri, any other Person or any
collateral securing the Guarantied Obligations. The terms and provisions of the
Oil-Dri Guaranty are incorporated by reference in this Joinder Agreement.
3.    Upon this Joinder Agreement bearing the signature of any Person having
authority to bind any New Guarantor being delivered to any Guaranty Beneficiary,
and irrespective of whether this Joinder Agreement has been executed by any
other Person, this Joinder Agreement will be deemed to be finally and
irrevocably executed and delivered by, and be effective and binding on, and
enforceable against, such New Guarantor free from any promise or condition
affecting or limiting the liabilities of such New Guarantor and such New
Guarantor shall be, and shall be deemed for all purposes to be, a Guarantor
under the Oil-Dri Guaranty. No statement, representation, agreement or promise
by any officer, employee or agent of any Guaranty Beneficiary forms any part of
this Joinder Agreement or the Oil-Dri Guaranty or has induced the making of this
Joinder Agreement or the Oil-Dri Guaranty by any of the New Guarantors or in any
way affects any of the obligations or liabilities of any of the New Guarantors
in respect of the Guarantied Obligations.
4.    This Joinder Agreement may be executed in counterparts. Each executed
counterpart shall be deemed to be an original and all counterparts taken
together shall constitute one and the same Joinder Agreement. Delivery of an
executed signature page to this Joinder Agreement by any New Guarantor by
electronic or facsimile transmission shall be as effective as delivery of a
manually executed copy of this Joinder Agreement by such New Guarantor.
5.    This Joinder Agreement is a contract made under, and will for all purposes
be governed by and interpreted and enforced according to, the internal laws of
the State of Illinois excluding any conflict of laws rule or principle which
might refer these matters to the laws of another jurisdiction.
6.    This Joinder Agreement and the Oil-Dri Guaranty shall be binding upon each
of the New Guarantors and the successors of each of the New Guarantors. None of
the New Guarantors may assign any of its obligations or liabilities in respect
of the Guarantied Obligations.
IN WITNESS OF WHICH this Joinder Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by each of the New Guarantors as of the date indicated on the first page of this
Joinder Agreement.
[NEW GUARANTOR]
