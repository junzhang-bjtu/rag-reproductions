connection with such purchases.  The Company shall not issue any fraction of a
share of Common Stock upon the Initial Purchase, any Regular Purchase,
Accelerated Purchase or Additional Accelerated Purchase.  If the issuance would

shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up or down to the nearest
whole share. All payments made under this Agreement shall be made in lawful
money of the United States of America or wire transfer of immediately available

Documents by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (including, without limitation, the reservation

not (i) result in a violation of the Certificate of Incorporation (including any

which it is a party or bound or to which its property is subject, or (iii) any
judgment, order or decree of any court, regulatory body, administrative agency,
governmental body, arbitrator or other authority having jurisdiction over the
Company or any of its properties, which, in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii),
would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as
specifically contemplated by this Agreement and as required under the Securities
Act or applicable state securities laws and the rules and regulations of the
Principal Market, the Company is not required to obtain any consent,
Authorization or order of, or make any filing or registration with, any court or
governmental agency or any regulatory or self-regulatory agency in order for it
to execute, deliver or perform any of its obligations under or contemplated by
the Transaction Documents in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof. Except
as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, all consents, Authorizations, orders,
filings and registrations which the Company is required to obtain pursuant to
the preceding sentence shall be obtained or effected on or prior to the
Commencement Date.
 
(f) SEC Documents; Financial Statements. Except as previously disclosed by the
Company to the Investor, the Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents required to be filed by the Company under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, including pursuant to Section 13(a) or
15(d) thereof, for the 24 months preceding the date hereof (or such shorter
period as the Company was required by law or regulation to file such material)
(the foregoing materials, including the exhibits thereto and documents
incorporated by reference therein, being collectively referred to herein as the
“SEC Documents”) on a timely basis or has received a valid extension of such
time of filing and has filed any such SEC Documents prior to the expiration of
any such extension. As of their respective dates, the SEC Documents complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as applicable. None of the SEC Documents, when filed, contained
any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The financial statements of the Company included in the SEC
Documents comply in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as in
effect at the time of filing. Such financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (“GAAP”), except as may be
otherwise specified in such financial statements or the notes thereto and except
that unaudited financial statements may not contain all footnotes required by
GAAP, and fairly present in all material respects the financial position of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of and for the dates thereof and
the results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended, subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal, immaterial, year-end audit
adjustments. Except as set forth in the SEC Documents, the Company has received
no notices or correspondence from the SEC for the one year preceding the date
hereof. The SEC has not commenced any enforcement proceedings against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
 
13

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(g) Absence of Certain Changes. Except as disclosed in the SEC Documents, since
December 31, 2018, there has been no material adverse change in the business,
properties, operations, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. The Company has not taken any steps, and does not
currently expect to take any steps, to seek protection pursuant to any
Bankruptcy Law nor does the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have any
knowledge or reason to believe that its creditors intend to initiate involuntary
bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. The Company is financially solvent and is
generally able to pay its debts as they become due.
 
(h) Absence of Litigation. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or
investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency,
self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting the Company, the
Common Stock or any of the Company’s or its Subsidiaries’ officers or directors
in their capacities as such, which could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.
 
(i) Acknowledgment Regarding Investor’s Status. The Company acknowledges and
agrees that the Investor is acting solely in the capacity of arm’s length
purchaser with respect to the Transaction Documents and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The Company further acknowledges that the
Investor is not acting as a financial advisor or fiduciary of the Company (or in
any similar capacity) with respect to the Transaction Documents and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and any advice given by the
Investor or any of its representatives or agents in connection with the
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby is
merely incidental to the Investor’s purchase of the Securities. The Company
further represents to the Investor that the Company’s decision to enter into the
Transaction Documents has been based solely on the independent evaluation by the
Company and its representatives and advisors.
 
(j) No General Solicitation; No Integrated Offering. Neither the Company, nor
any of its affiliates, nor any Person acting on its or their behalf, has engaged
in any form of general solicitation or general advertising (within the meaning
of Regulation D under the Securities Act) in connection with the offer or sale
of the Securities. Neither the Company, nor or any of its affiliates, nor any
Person acting on their behalf has, directly or indirectly, made any offers or
sales of any security or solicited any offers to buy any security, under
circumstances that would require registration of the offer and sale of any of
the Securities under the Securities Act, whether through integration with prior
offerings or otherwise, or cause this offering of the Securities to be
integrated with prior offerings by the Company in a manner that would require
stockholder approval pursuant to the rules of the Principal Market on which any
of the securities of the Company are listed or designated. The issuance and sale
of the Securities hereunder does not contravene the rules and regulations of the
Principal Market.
14

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 (k)  Intellectual Property Rights. The Company and its Subsidiaries own or
possess adequate rights or licenses to use all material trademarks, trade names,
service marks, service mark registrations, service names, patents, patent
rights, copyrights, inventions, licenses, approvals, governmental
authorizations, trade secrets and rights necessary to conduct their respective
businesses as now conducted. None of the Company’s material trademarks, trade
names, service marks, service mark registrations, service names, patents, patent
rights, copyrights, inventions, licenses, approvals, government authorizations,
trade secrets or other intellectual property rights have expired or terminated,
or, by the terms and conditions thereof, could expire or terminate within two
years from the date of this Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries do not
have any knowledge of any infringement by the Company or its Subsidiaries of any
material trademark, trade name rights, patents, patent rights, copyrights,
inventions, licenses, service names, service marks, service mark registrations,
trade secret or other similar rights of others, or of any such development of
similar or identical trade secrets or technical information by others, and there
is no claim, action or proceeding being made or brought against, or to the
Company’s knowledge, being threatened against, the Company or its Subsidiaries
regarding trademark, trade name, patents, patent rights, invention, copyright,
license, service names, service marks, service mark registrations, trade secret
or other infringement, which could reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.
 
(l) Environmental Laws. The Company and its Subsidiaries (i) are in compliance
with any and all applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws and
regulations relating to the protection of human health and safety, the
environment or hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, pollutants or
contaminants (“Environmental Laws”), (ii) have received all permits, licenses or
other approvals required of them under applicable Environmental Laws to conduct
their respective businesses and (iii) are in compliance with all terms and
conditions of any such permit, license or approval, except where, in each of the
three foregoing clauses, the failure to so comply could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(m) Title The Company and its Subsidiaries own no real property. Except as
disclosed in the SEC Documents, the Company and its Subsidiaries have good and
marketable title in fee simple to all real property owned by them and good and
marketable title in all personal property owned by them that is material to the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case free and clear of all
Liens and, except for Liens as do not materially affect the value of such
property and do not materially interfere with the use made and proposed to be
made of such property by the Company and its Subsidiaries and Liens for the
payment of federal, state or other taxes, the payment of which is neither
delinquent nor subject to penalties. Any real property and facilities held under
lease by the Company and its Subsidiaries are held by them under valid,
subsisting and enforceable leases with which the Company and its Subsidiaries
are in compliance with such exceptions as are not material and do not interfere
with the use made and proposed to be made of such property and buildings by the
Company and its Subsidiaries.
 
(n) Insurance. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are insured by insurers
of recognized financial responsibility against such losses and risks and in such
amounts as management of the Company believes to be prudent and customary in the
businesses in which the Company and its Subsidiaries are engaged. Neither the
Company nor any such Subsidiary has been refused any insurance coverage sought
or applied for and neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary has any reason to
believe that it will not be able to renew its existing insurance coverage as and
when such coverage expires or to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers
as may be necessary to continue its business at a cost that could not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(o) Regulatory Permits. The Company and its Subsidiaries possess all material
certificates, authorizations and permits issued by the appropriate federal,
state, local or foreign regulatory authorities necessary to conduct their
respective businesses, and neither the Company nor any such Subsidiary has
received any notice of proceedings relating to the revocation or modification of
any such certificate, authorization or permit.
15

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 (p) Tax Status. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has made or filed all
federal and state income and all other material tax returns, reports and
declarations required by any jurisdiction to which it is subject (unless and
only to the extent that the Company and each of its Subsidiaries has set aside
on its books provisions reasonably adequate for the payment of all unpaid and
unreported taxes) and has paid all taxes and other governmental assessments and
charges that are material in amount, shown or determined to be due on such
returns, reports and declarations, except those being contested in good faith
and has set aside on its books provision reasonably adequate for the payment of
all taxes for periods subsequent to the periods to which such returns, reports
or declarations apply. There are no unpaid taxes in any material amount claimed
to be due by the taxing authority of any jurisdiction, and the officers of the
Company know of no basis for any such claim.
 
(q) Transactions with Affiliates. Except as set forth in the SEC Documents, none
of the officers or directors of the Company and, to the knowledge of the
Company, none of the Company’s stockholders, the officers or directors of any
stockholder of the Company, or any family member or affiliate of any of the
foregoing, has either directly or indirectly any interest in, or is a party to,
any transaction that is required to be disclosed as a related party transaction
pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act.
 
(r) Application of Takeover Protections. The Company and its Board of Directors
have taken or will take prior to the Commencement Date all necessary action, if
any, in order to render inapplicable any control share acquisition, business
combination, poison pill (including any distribution under a rights agreement)
or other similar anti-takeover provision under the Certificate of Incorporation
or the laws of the state of its incorporation which is or could become
applicable to the Investor as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the Company’s issuance of the
Securities and the Investor’s ownership of the Securities.
 
(s) Disclosure. Except with respect to the material terms and conditions of the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents that will be timely
publicly disclosed by the Company, the Company confirms that neither it nor any
other Person acting on its behalf has provided the Investor or its agents or
counsel with any information that it believes constitutes or might constitute
material, non-public information which is not otherwise disclosed in the
Registration Statement or the SEC Documents. The Company understands and
confirms that the Investor will rely on the foregoing representation in
effecting purchases and sales of securities of the Company. All of the
disclosure furnished by or on behalf of the Company to the Investor regarding
the Company, its business and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the disclosure schedules to this Agreement, is true and correct and does not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The press releases
disseminated by the Company during the twelve (12) months preceding the date of
this Agreement taken as a whole do not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made and when made, not misleading. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that the Investor neither makes nor has made any
representations or warranties with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby other than those specifically set forth in Section 3 hereof.
 
(t) Foreign Corrupt Practices. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, agent, employee or
affiliate of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries is aware of or has taken any
action, directly or indirectly, that would result in a violation by such persons
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and the rules and
regulations thereunder (the “FCPA”), including, without limitation, making use
of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in
furtherance of an offer, payment, promise to pay or authorization of the payment
of any money, or other property, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the
giving of anything of value to any “foreign official” (as such term is defined
in the FCPA) or any foreign political party or official thereof or any candidate
for foreign political office, in contravention of the FCPA; and the Company, the
Subsidiaries and, to the knowledge of the Company, its affiliates have conducted
their businesses in compliance with the FCPA and have instituted and maintain
policies and procedures designed to ensure, and which are reasonably expected to
continue to ensure, continued compliance therewith. The operations of the
Company and the Subsidiaries are and have been conducted at all times in
compliance with applicable financial recordkeeping and reporting requirements
and the money laundering statutes and the rules and regulations thereunder and
any related or similar rules, regulations or guidelines, issued, administered or

designation the United States representative to the group or organization
continues to concur, all as amended, and any Executive order, directive or
regulation pursuant to the authority of any of the foregoing, or any orders or
licenses issued thereunder (collectively, the “Money Laundering Laws”), and no
action, suit or proceeding by or before any court or governmental agency,
authority or body or any arbitrator involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to the Money Laundering Laws is pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor to the knowledge of the Company any of the directors, officers

contemplated hereby in full compliance with applicable securities laws. Each
party hereto acknowledges that the Confidential Information shall remain the

the event of a breach of the foregoing covenant by the Company or any Person
acting on its behalf (as determined in the reasonable good faith judgment of the
Investor), in addition to any other remedy provided herein or in the other
Transaction Documents, the Investor shall have the right to make a public
disclosure, in the form of a press release, public advertisement or otherwise,
of such material, non-public information without the prior approval by the
Company; provided the Investor shall have first provided notice to the Company
that it believes it has received information that constitutes material,
non-public information, the Company shall have at least twenty-four (24) hours
to publicly disclose such material, non-public information prior to any such
disclosure by the Investor, and the Company shall have failed to publicly
disclose such material, non-public information within such time period. The
Investor shall not have any liability to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries,
or any of their respective directors, officers, employees, stockholders or
agents, for any such disclosure. The Company understands and confirms that the
Investor shall be relying on the foregoing covenants in effecting transactions
in securities of the Company.

INDEMNIFICATION.

In consideration of the Investor’s execution and delivery of the Transaction
Documents and acquiring the Securities hereunder and in addition to all of the
Company’s other obligations under the Transaction Documents, the Company shall
defend, protect, indemnify and hold harmless the Investor and all of its
affiliates, stockholders, officers, directors, members, managers, employees and
direct or indirect investors and any of the foregoing Person’s agents or other
representatives (including, without limitation, those retained in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (collectively, the
“Indemnitees”) from and against any and all actions, causes of action, suits,
claims, losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities and damages, and expenses in
connection therewith (irrespective of whether any such Indemnitee is a party to
the action for which indemnification hereunder is sought), and including
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements (the “Indemnified Liabilities”),
incurred by any Indemnitee as a result of, or arising out of or relating to: (a)
any misrepresentation or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in the Transaction Documents or any other certificate, instrument or
document contemplated hereby or thereby, (b) any breach of any covenant,
agreement or obligation of the Company contained in the Transaction Documents or
any other certificate, instrument or document contemplated hereby or thereby,
(c) any cause of action, suit or claim brought or made against such Indemnitee
and arising out of or resulting from the execution, delivery, performance or
enforcement of the Transaction Documents or any other certificate, instrument or
document contemplated hereby or thereby, (d) any violation of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act, state securities or “Blue Sky” laws, or the rules and
regulations of the Principal Market in connection with the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Documents by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors or employees, (e) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained, or
incorporated by reference, in the Registration Statement or any amendment
thereto or any omission or alleged omission to state therein, or in any document
incorporated by reference therein, a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (f) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained, or
incorporated by reference, in the Registration Statement, or any omission or
alleged omission to state therein, or in any document incorporated by reference
therein, a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; provided, however, that (I) the indemnity contained in clause
(c) of this Section 9 shall not apply to any Indemnified Liabilities which
directly and primarily result from the fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of an Indemnitee, (II) the indemnity contained in clauses (d), (e)
and (f) of this Section 9 shall not apply to any Indemnified Liabilities to the
extent, but only to the extent, arising out of or based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by or on behalf of the Investor expressly for use in any Registration
Statement and (III) the indemnity in this Section 9 shall not apply to amounts
paid in settlement of any claim if such settlement is effected without the prior
written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. To the extent that the foregoing undertaking
by the Company may be unenforceable for any reason, the Company shall make the
maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified
Liabilities which is permissible under applicable law, provided that no seller
of Securities guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any
seller of Securities who was not guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation. Payment
under this indemnification shall be made within thirty (30) days from the date
the Indemnitee makes written request for it. A certificate containing reasonable
detail as to the amount of such indemnification submitted to the Company by the
Indemnitee shall be conclusive evidence, absent manifest error, of the amount
due from the Company to the Indemnitee. If any action shall be brought against
any Indemnitee in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to this
Agreement, such Indemnitee shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the
Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its
own choosing reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee. Any Indemnitee shall have
the right to employ separate counsel in any such action and participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the
expense of such Indemnitee, except to the extent that (i) the employment thereof
has been specifically authorized by the Company in writing, (ii) the Company has
failed after a reasonable period of time to assume such defense and to employ
counsel or (iii) in such action there is, in the reasonable opinion of such
separate counsel, a material conflict on any material issue between the position
of the Company and the position of such Indemnitee, in which case the Company
shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of no more than one
such separate counsel.
27

statement);
28

the Investor within three (3) Business Days after the applicable Purchase Date,
Accelerated Purchase Date or Additional Accelerated Purchase Date (as
applicable) on which the Investor is entitled to receive such Purchase Shares;
 
(e) the Company breaches any representation, warranty, covenant or other term or

Material Adverse Effect and except, in the case of a breach of a covenant which

five (5) Business Days;
 
(f) if any Person commences a proceeding against the Company pursuant to or
within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law;

meaning of any Bankruptcy Law, (i) commences a voluntary case, (ii) consents to
the entry of an order for relief against it in an involuntary case, (iii)

Bankruptcy Law that (i) is for relief against the Company in an involuntary
case, (ii) appoints a Custodian of the Company or for all or substantially all
of its property, or (iii) orders the liquidation of the Company or any
Subsidiary; or
 
(i) if at any time the Company is not eligible to transfer its Common Stock
electronically as DWAC Shares.
 
In addition to any other rights and remedies under applicable law and this
Agreement, so long as an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, or if
any event which, after notice and/or lapse of time, would become an Event of
Default, has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall not deliver to the
Investor any Regular Purchase Notice or Accelerated Purchase Notice.
29

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
11.
TERMINATION

This Agreement may be terminated only as follows:
 
(a) If pursuant to or within the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law, the Company
commences a voluntary case or any Person commences a proceeding against the
Company, a Custodian is appointed for the Company or for all or substantially
all of its property, or the Company makes a general assignment for the benefit
of its creditors (any of which would be an Event of Default as described in
Sections 10(g), 10(h) and 10(i) hereof), this Agreement shall automatically
terminate without any liability or payment to the Company (except as set forth
below) without further action or notice by any Person.
 
(b) In the event that the Commencement shall not have occurred on or before
April 30, 2020, due to the failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in
Sections 7 and 8 above with respect to the Commencement, either the Company or
the Investor shall have the option to terminate this Agreement at the close of
business on such date or thereafter without liability of any party to any other
party (except as set forth below); provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 11(b) shall not be available to any
party if such party is then in breach of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement or any representation or warranty of such party contained in this
Agreement fails to be true and correct such that the conditions set forth in
Section 7(d) or Section 8(e), as applicable, could not then be satisfied.
 
(c) At any time after the Commencement Date, the Company shall have the option
to terminate this Agreement for any reason or for no reason by delivering notice
(a “Company Termination Notice”) to the Investor electing to terminate this
Agreement without any liability whatsoever of any party to any other party under
this Agreement (except as set forth below). The Company Termination Notice shall
not be effective until one (1) Business Day after it has been received by the
Investor.
 
(d) This Agreement shall automatically terminate on the date that the Company
sells and the Investor purchases the full Available Amount as provided herein,
without any action or notice on the part of any party and without any liability
whatsoever of any party to any other party under this Agreement (except as set
forth below).
 
(e) If, for any reason or for no reason, the full Available Amount has not been
purchased in accordance with Section 2 of this Agreement by the Maturity Date,
this Agreement shall automatically terminate on the Maturity Date, without any
action or notice on the part of any party and without any liability whatsoever
of any party to any other party under this Agreement (except as set forth
below).
 
Except as set forth in Sections 11(a) (in respect of an Event of Default under
Sections 10(g), 10(h) and 10(i)), 11(d) and 11(e), any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 11 shall be effected by written notice from
the Company to the Investor, or the Investor to the Company, as the case may be,
setting forth the basis for the termination hereof. The representations and
warranties and covenants of the Company and the Investor contained in Sections
3, 4, 5, and 6 hereof, the indemnification provisions set forth in Section 9
hereof and the agreements and covenants set forth in Sections 10, 11 and 12
shall survive the Commencement and any termination of this Agreement. No
termination of this Agreement shall (i) affect the Company’s or the Investor’s
rights or obligations under (A) this Agreement with respect to pending Regular
Purchases, Accelerated Purchases, and Additional Accelerated Purchases and the
Company and the Investor shall complete their respective obligations with
respect to any pending Regular Purchases, Accelerated Purchases and
Additional Accelerated Purchases under this Agreement and (B) the Registration
Rights Agreement, which shall survive any such termination, or (ii) be deemed to
release the Company or the Investor from any liability for intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach of any of the Transaction Documents.

and shall not form part of, or affect the interpretation of, this Agreement.
 
(d) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid or

issuance, filing or public disclosure thereof. The Investor must be provided
with a final version of any such press release, SEC filing or other public
disclosure at least 24 hours prior to any release, filing or use by the Company

with this provision constitutes a Material Adverse Effect.
 
(j) Further Assurances. Each party shall do and perform, or cause to be done and
performed, all such further acts and things, and shall execute and deliver all
such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents, as the other
party may reasonably request in order to consummate and make effective, as soon

shall limit the Investor’s right to pursue actual damages for any failure by the

that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to

remedies, to an injunction restraining any breach, without the necessity of
showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.

any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege.

assumptions and qualifications set forth herein, we are of the opinion that:
 
1. The Company is a corporation existing and in good standing under the laws of
the State of Delaware.
 
2. The Company has the corporate power to execute and deliver, and perform its
obligations under, each Transaction Document to which it is a party.  To our
knowledge, the Company has the corporate power to conduct its business as it is
now conducted, and to own and use the properties owned and used by it.
 
3. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of the Company.  The execution and delivery of the
Transaction Documents by the Company, the performance of the obligations of the
Company thereunder and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated
therein have been duly authorized and approved by the Company's Board of
Directors and no further consent, approval or authorization of the Company, its
Board of Directors or its stockholders is required.  The Transaction Documents
to which the Company is a party have been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and are the valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with their terms except as such enforceability
may be limited by general principles of equity or applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, liquidation or similar laws relating to,
or affecting creditor’s rights and remedies.
 
4. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of the Transaction
Documents, the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
thereby including the offering, sale and issuance of the Commitment Shares and
the Purchase Shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Purchase
Agreement, and fulfillment and compliance with terms of the Transaction
Documents, does not and shall not: (i) conflict with, constitute a breach of or
default (or an event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both,
constitutes or could constitute a breach or a default), under (a) the
Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company, (b) to our knowledge,
any material agreement, note, lease, mortgage, deed or other material instrument
to which the Company is a party or by which the Company or any of its assets are
bound (“Material Agreements”), (ii) result in any violation of any statute, law,
rule or regulation applicable to the Company, or (iii) to our knowledge, violate
any order, writ, injunction or decree applicable to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries.
 
5. The issuance of the Purchase Shares and the Commitment Shares pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Transaction Documents has been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company.  The Commitment
Shares are validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, and to our knowledge,
free of all taxes, liens, charges, restrictions, rights of first refusal and
preemptive rights. The Initial Purchase Shares are validly issued, fully paid
and non-assessable, and to our knowledge, free of all taxes, liens, charges,
restrictions, rights of first refusal and preemptive rights. 16,058,247 shares
of Common Stock have been properly reserved for issuance as Purchase Shares
under the Purchase Agreement. When issued and paid for in accordance with the
Purchase Agreement, the Purchase Shares shall be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable, and to our knowledge, free of all taxes, liens, charges,
restrictions, rights of first refusal and preemptive rights.  To our knowledge,
the execution and delivery of the Registration Rights Agreement do not, and the
performance by the Company of its obligations thereunder shall not, give rise to
any rights of any other Person for the registration under the Securities Act of
any shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company which have not
been waived.

 6. As of the date hereof, the authorized capital stock of the Company consists

described in the Registration Statement, will not be, an “investment company,”
as that term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

of the Company owned or to be owned by such person or to require the Company to
include such securities in the securities registered pursuant to the
Registration Statement or in any securities being registered pursuant to any
other registration statement filed by the Company under the Securities Act.
 
[THE FOLLOWING MAY BE MADE IN A SEPARATE NEGATIVE ASSURANCES LETTER]
 
As counsel to the Company, we reviewed the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus, and participated in discussions with your representatives and those
of the Company, at which the contents of the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus were discussed.  Between the date of the Transaction Documents and
the time of the delivery of this letter, we participated in further discussions
with your representatives and those of the Company, and we reviewed certain
certificates of officers of the Company and public officials delivered to you
today.
 
The purpose of our engagement was not to establish or to confirm factual matters
set forth in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and we have not
undertaken any obligation to verify independently any of the factual matters set
forth in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.  Moreover, many of the
determinations required to be made in the preparation of the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus involve matters of a non-legal nature.
39

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Subject to the foregoing, we confirm to you that, on the basis of the
information that we gained in the course of performing the services referred to
above, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that:  (a) the
Registration Statement, as of its effective date, contained an untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (b) the
Prospectus, as of its date and as of the date and time of delivery of this
letter, contained or contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
or omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided,
however, that we do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness
or fairness of the statements contained in the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus, and we do not express any belief as to the financial statements and
related notes, financial statement schedules or financial statistics or other
financial or accounting data and information contained in or omitted from the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus.
 
We inform you that the Registration Statement became effective under the
Securities Act on _______, 2020 and that no stop order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement has been issued under the Securities
Act.
 
We are not representing the Company in any pending litigation in which it is a
named defendant that challenges the validity or enforceability of, or seeks to
enjoin the performance of, the Transaction Documents.
 
Further, we confirm to you that the Registration Statement, as of its effective
date, and the Prospectus, as of its date, appeared to us on their face to
respond in all material respects to the requirements of Form S-1, except that
the foregoing statement does not address any requirement relating to financial
statements, notes or schedules and financial and accounting data or information
contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.
