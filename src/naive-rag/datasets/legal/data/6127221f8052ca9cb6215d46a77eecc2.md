standards and verifiable based on Curis’ sales reporting system. All such
discounts, allowances, credits, rebates, and other deductions shall be fairly
and equitably allocated to Product and other products of the Selling Party such
that Product does not bear a disproportionate portion of such deductions. Sales
or other commercial dispositions of Product between Selling Parties are not

Net Sales shall be the amount that would have been invoiced had the transaction
been conducted at arm’s length and for cash. Such amount that would have been
invoiced shall be determined, wherever possible, by reference to the average
selling price of the relevant Product in arm’s length transactions in the
relevant country. For clarity, such gross amounts shall be subject to the
deductions as set forth above in this Section 1.125.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, on a country-by-country basis, if a Product is
sold in a country as part of a Combination Product in a Calendar Quarter, Net
Sales of such Product in such country during such Calendar Quarter for the
purpose of determining royalties and commercialization milestone payments due
hereunder shall be calculated as follows:
(i)In the event that both (x) a Single-Agent Product is sold separately in
finished form in such country during such Calendar Quarter and (y) the Other
Active(s) in such Combination Product are sold separately in finished form in
such country during such Calendar Quarter, then Net Sales of such Product shall
be determined by multiplying the actual Net Sales of the Combination Product
calculated pursuant to the preceding provisions of this Section 1.125 (“Actual
Combination Product Net Sales”) in such country during such Calendar Quarter by
the fraction, A / (A+B) where A is the weighted average sale price of such
Single-Agent Product when sold separately in finished form in such country
during such Calendar Quarter, and B is the weighted average sale price of the
Other Active(s) in the Combination Product when sold separately in finished form
in such country during such Calendar Quarter.
(ii)In the event that a Single-Agent Product is sold separately in finished form
in such country during such Calendar Quarter, but the Other Active(s) in such
Combination Product are not sold separately in finished form in such country
during such Calendar Quarter, then Net Sales of such Product shall be calculated
by multiplying the Actual Combination Product Net Sales of the Combination
Product in such country during such


- 15 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







Calendar Quarter by the fraction A / C where A is the weighted average sale
price of such Single-Agent Product when sold separately in finished form in such
country during such Calendar Quarter and C is the weighted average sale price of
the Combination Product in such country during such Calendar Quarter.
(iii)In the event that no Single-Agent Product is sold separately in finished
form in such country during such Calendar Quarter, but the Other Active(s) in
such Combination Product are sold separately in finished form in such country
during such Calendar Quarter, Net Sales of such Product shall be calculated by
multiplying the Actual Combination Product Net Sales of the Combination Product
by the fraction (C‑B) / C, where B is the weighted average sale price of the
Other Active(s) in the Combination Product when sold separately in finished form
in such country during such Calendar Quarter, and C is the weighted average sale
price of the Combination Product in such country during such Calendar Quarter.
(iv)In the event that neither any Single-Agent Product is sold separately in
finished form in such country during such Calendar Quarter, nor the Other
Active(s) in such Combination Product are sold separately in finished form in
such country during such Calendar Quarter, then the methodology for determining
Net Sales of such Product in such country shall be mutually agreed in writing by
the parties in good faith based on the relative contributions of the Compound
and the Other Active(s) in such Combination Product to the total value of the
Combination Product.

negotiate in good faith and enter into a Safety Data Exchange Agreement defining
the pharmacovigilance responsibilities of the Parties, including procedures
governing the exchange of safety data and information affecting the class of
compounds or products that target VISTA. If ImmuNext enters into a collaboration
or license agreement with a Third Party to develop or commercialize one or more
Excluded Compounds, and such agreement includes obligations of such Third Party
for the benefit of Curis that are


- 32 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







substantially the same as those set forth above in this Section 6.4 (mutatis
mutandis), then Curis agrees to comply with reciprocal obligations to such Third
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party shall be obligated to enter
into any such agreement if it determines in good faith that such agreement would
cause a Party to violate applicable Laws.
7.Manufacture and Supply
7.1During the Option Period.

have Manufactured any Compound or Product during the Option Period. If the
quantity and/or quality of Existing Inventory is insufficient for the conduct
and completion of the Phase 1A/1B Study (and any additional Phase 1A/1B Study
that the Parties agree Curis may conduct pursuant to Section 3.2.2(c), or the
KOL Panel permits Curis to conduct in accordance with Section 17.2) and support
of the Research Plan, Curis shall have the right during the Option Period to
Manufacture or have Manufactured such additional quantity(ies) of Compound or
Product as are reasonably necessary for such purposes. For clarity, Curis shall
not be obligated to use in any Phase 1A/1B Study any Existing Inventory that

Payments in this Section 9.3.2 are additive, such that if more than one
Commercial Milestone Event specified above is achieved in the same Calendar
Year, then the corresponding Commercial Milestone Payment for each such
Commercial Milestone Event will be payable.
(c)Curis shall notify ImmuNext within [**] after the end of the Calendar Quarter
in which each Commercial Milestone Event is achieved of the occurrence of such
Commercial Milestone Event and shall pay to ImmuNext the corresponding payment
within [**] after the end of the relevant Calendar Quarter.

9.4Royalty Payments to ImmuNext.
9.4.1Royalties. Subject to Sections 9.4.2 through 9.4.8 hereof, as partial
consideration for the Curis Commercial License, Curis will pay ImmuNext
royalties on worldwide aggregate annual Net Sales of each Product by Curis, its
Affiliates and Sublicensees on a Product-by-Product basis in each Calendar Year
in which a Product is sold at the applicable incremental royalty rate(s) set
forth below:
Net Sales of a Product in a Calendar Year
Column A:
Royalty Rates for Net Sales occurring before the Royalty Reduction Date
Column B:
Royalty Rates for Net Sales occurring on after the Royalty Reduction Date
Portion less than or equal to $[**]
[**]%
[**]%
Portion greater than $[**] and less than or equal to $[**]
[**]%
[**]%
Portion greater than $[**] and less than or equal to $[**]
[**]%
[**]%
Portion greater than $[**] and less than or equal to $[**]
[**]%
[**]%
Portion greater than $[**]
[**]%
[**]%

Provided that, if any actions or omissions by or on behalf of Curis or any of
its Affiliates or Sublicensees cause the royalty rate payable pursuant to the
[**] Agreement to be greater than the lowest amount set forth therein on the
Effective Date, the royalty rate set forth above in this Section 9.4.1 shall be
increased by the increase in royalty rate payable pursuant to the [**]
Agreement.
Royalties under this Section 9.4.1 shall be calculated by reference to
increments of worldwide aggregate annual Net Sales of each Product in a Calendar
Year. By way of example, in the case of a Product to which the royalty rates in
Column A apply, if worldwide aggregate annual Net Sales of such Product in a
Calendar Year are $[**], the following royalty payment for such Calendar Year
would be payable under this Section 9.4.1: [**].
9.4.2Royalty Term. Royalties under Section 9.4.1 shall be payable on a
Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis, from the date of First
Commercial Sale of a Product in a country until the latest of: (a) the
expiration of the last to expire Valid Claim of any ImmuNext Patent or Jointly
Owned Patent Covering the manufacture, use or sale of such Product in such
country, (b) the expiration of all Regulatory Exclusivity for such Product in
such country, and (c) ten (10) years from the First Commercial Sale of such
Product in such country (the “Royalty Term”). On a Product-by-Product and
country-by-country basis, upon expiration of the Royalty Term with respect to a
Product in a country, the Curis Commercial License with respect to such Product
in such country shall automatically become royalty-free, fully paid-up,
irrevocable and perpetual.


- 43 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







9.4.3Reduction of Royalties Due to Patent Expiration. Subject to Section 9.4.7,
during any portion of the Royalty Term for a Product in a country when there is
no Valid Claim of the ImmuNext Patents or Jointly Owned Patents Covering the
manufacture, use or sale of such Product in such country, the royalties payable
by Curis with respect to Net Sales of such Product in such country shall be
reduced by [**] percent ([**]%) in accordance with Section 9.4.5.
9.4.4Biosimilar Competition. Subject to Section 9.4.7, on a Product-by-Product
and country-by-country basis, if, during the Royalty Term for a Product in a
country, unit sales of one or more Biosimilars of such Product in a country
account for more than [**] percent ([**]%) of combined unit sales of (a) such
Product and (b) such Biosimilar(s), in such country, as determined by reference
to applicable sales data obtained from IQVIA or from such other independent
source for such sales data as may be agreed upon by the Parties (provided that
such other source, if any, shall be generally recognized as a reliable source
for pharmaceutical sales data among major pharmaceutical companies), then for
the remainder of the Royalty Term for such Product in such country, the
royalties payable by Curis with respect to Net Sales of such Product in such
country shall be reduced by [**] percent ([**]%) in accordance with
Section 9.4.5.
9.4.5Calculation of Reductions to Royalties. Any reduction pursuant to
Section 9.4.3 or Section 9.4.4 of the royalties payable by Curis to ImmuNext
with respect to Net Sales of a particular Product in a particular country under
Section 9.4.1 will be calculated as follows:
(a)Determination of Effective Royalty Rate. First, the effective, or “blended,”
royalty rate applicable to worldwide aggregate annual Net Sales of such Product
(excluding Net Sales of such Product in any country that occur after expiration
of the Royalty Term for such Product in such country) in the applicable Calendar
Year will be determined by dividing: (x) the total amount of royalties that
would be payable under Section 9.4.1 with respect to worldwide aggregate annual
Net Sales of such Product in such Calendar Year (excluding Net Sales of such
Product in any country that occur after expiration of the Royalty Term for such
Product in such country), without giving effect to any royalty reduction or
adjustment that may be available under Section 9.4.3, Section 9.4.4 or
Section 9.4.6; by (y) the total amount of worldwide aggregate annual Net Sales
of such Product in such Calendar Year (excluding Net Sales of such Product in
any country that occur after expiration of the Royalty Term for such Product in
such country); expressed as a percentage (such percentage, the “Effective
Royalty Rate”). By way of illustration, the Effective Royalty Rate in the case
of the example given in the last paragraph of Section 9.4.1 would be
approximately [**].
(b)Application of Reductions. Any available royalty reduction under
Section 9.4.3 or Section 9.4.4 with respect to Net Sales of a particular Product
in a particular country would be calculated by applying the applicable
percentage reduction under such Section to the amount of royalties determined by
multiplying the Net Sales of such Product in such country by the applicable
Effective Royalty Rate.
9.4.6Third Party Licenses. Subject to Section 9.4.7, in the event that Curis (or
its Affiliate or Sublicensee, as applicable) is required to obtain one or more
licenses


- 44 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







under Patents of a Third Party (“Third Party Licenses”) that are reasonably
necessary for the manufacture, use or sale of a Product in a country, [**]% of
the royalties actually paid under such Third Party Licenses by Curis (or by such
Affiliate or Sublicensee, as applicable) for sales of such Product in such
country for a Calendar Quarter will be creditable against the royalty payments
payable by Curis to ImmuNext with respect to Net Sales of such Product in such
country; provided, however, that in no event will the royalties owed by Curis to
ImmuNext hereunder with respect to Net Sales of such Product for such Calendar
Quarter be reduced by more than [**]% as a result of any and all such credits in
the aggregate (the “Credit Cap”). In the event that [**]% of the royalty
payments paid under such Third Party Licenses in a Calendar Quarter with respect
to sales of such Product exceeds the amount by which Curis is permitted to
credit against royalty payments to ImmuNext in such Calendar Quarter by reason
of the Credit Cap, Curis shall be entitled to carry forward the excess to offset
royalty payments due to ImmuNext in the following [**], subject, in each case,
to the Credit Cap. For clarity, Curis will not be entitled to credit any portion
of royalties paid by Curis or its Affiliate or Sublicensee to Third Parties
under Third Party Licenses with respect to any Other Active in any Combination
Product.
9.4.7Royalty Floor. In no case shall all available reductions to royalties
payable with respect to a particular Product in a country under Sections 9.4.3,
9.4.4 and 9.4.6, in the aggregate, lower the amount of royalties payable under
this Section 9.4 with respect to such Product in such country to less than the
greater of (a) [**] percent ([**]%) of the royalty payment that would be payable
to ImmuNext with respect to such Product in such country in such Calendar
Quarter absent any such reductions or (b) the sum of ImmuNext’s royalty payment
obligations under the Upstream Agreements with respect to such Product in such
country in such Calendar Quarter plus [**] percent ([**]%).
9.4.8Only One Royalty. The obligation to pay royalties pursuant to Section 9.4.1
is imposed only once with respect to the same unit of a Product, regardless of
how many ImmuNext Patents or Jointly Owned Patents may cover or claim the
Product.
9.5Sublicensing Revenue.
9.5.1Curis shall pay to ImmuNext [**] percent ([**]%) of Sublicense Revenue
received by Curis or any of its Affiliates from a Sublicensee.
9.5.2Neither Curis nor any of its Affiliates will structure a transaction with a
Sublicensee that includes both a Sublicense and a (sub)license under other
technology in a manner designed to circumvent or minimize Curis’ obligations
under Section 9.5.1 by allocating disproportionate relative value to the other
technology being (sub)licensed.
9.5.3Each time Curis or any of its Affiliates grants a Sublicense that is
subject to Section 9.5.1, Curis will provide ImmuNext with a true and complete
copy of the Sublicense agreement, and if ImmuNext believes that Curis or its
Affiliate has structured such agreement in a manner designed to circumvent or
minimize Curis’ obligations under Section 9.5.1 (whether pursuant solely to such
agreement or a series of agreements or transactions), ImmuNext may refer such
dispute to baseball arbitration in accordance with Section 17.1.


- 45 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







9.6Third Party Agreements.
9.6.1Upstream Agreements. During the Term of this Agreement, except as otherwise
expressly set forth in Section 10.5, ImmuNext will be solely responsible for all
upfront, milestone, royalty and other payments to any Third Party under the
Upstream Agreements.
9.6.2Negotiation of Option Period New In-Licenses. During the Option Period, if
a Party identifies any Patents or Know-How of a Third Party to which a Party (or
its Affiliate) does not have rights and that may be necessary or reasonably
useful for the development, manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, import, or
export of Compounds or Products in the Field, such Party shall inform the other
Party thereof. ImmuNext shall have the first right to negotiate and enter into
an agreement pursuant to which ImmuNext or its Affiliate will obtain a license
or other rights to such Patents or Know-How (each such agreement, an “Option
Period New In-License”). Within [**] of a Party providing notice to the other
Party pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.6.2, ImmuNext shall
notify Curis in writing that ImmuNext shall exercise such first right to
negotiate and enter into such Option Period New In-License or that ImmuNext is
waiving such first right to negotiate and enter into such Option Period New
In-License. If ImmuNext notifies Curis that ImmuNext is waiving such first right
to negotiate and enter into such Option Period New In-License, or if ImmuNext
fails to deliver written notice to Curis within such [**] period indicating that
ImmuNext shall exercise such first right to negotiate and enter into such Option
Period New In-License, then Curis shall have the right to negotiate and enter
into such Option Period New In-License, provided that such Option Period New
In-License shall expressly permit assignment to ImmuNext without the consent of
the licensor in the event of termination or expiration of the Option Period
prior to exercise of the Option by Curis. If a Party exercises its right to
negotiate and enter into any Option Period New In-License during the Option
Period, such Party (the “Option Period Negotiating Party”) shall keep the other
Party reasonably informed regarding the progress of negotiating such Option
Period New In-License and the terms thereof. If ImmuNext is the Option Period
Negotiating Party, (a) the terms of such Option Period New In-License shall not
disadvantage any Compound or Product (including any activities under this
Agreement with respect to any Compound or Product) relative to any other
compound or product covered by such Option Period New In-License, (b) ImmuNext
shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to negotiate terms of such Option
Period New In-License that apply to Compounds or Products (including sublicense
rights, patent matters, confidentiality, reporting, audit rights,
indemnification and diligence) that are no less favorable to Curis than the
terms of this Agreement and (c) ImmuNext shall reasonably negotiate to include
in such Option Period New In-License a “standby license” such that if such
agreement is terminated by the licensor for any reason other than Curis’ breach
of this Agreement or such Option Period New In-License, Curis shall retain
access to the licenses granted under such Option Period New In-License. If the
Option Period Negotiating Party (or its Affiliate) enters into an Option Period
New In-License, the Option Period Negotiating Party will provide a true and
complete copy of such Option Period New In-License to the other Party within
[**] after execution of such Option Period New In-License.
9.6.3Election Under Option Period New In-Licenses. At such time (if ever) as
Curis exercises the Option, Curis shall notify ImmuNext in writing (either in
the Option Exercise Notice or by other written notice to ImmuNext delivered
prior to the Option


- 46 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







Exercise Date) of each Option Period New In-License entered into by ImmuNext or
its Affiliate under which Curis elects to obtain a sublicense under the Curis
Commercial License, including the specific Patents (if less than all) and/or
Know-How (if less than all) subject to such Option Period New In‑License that
Curis elects to include in the ImmuNext Patents and/or ImmuNext Know-How,
respectively. Any such Patents and/or Know-How under which Curis elects to
obtain a sublicense (“Option Period New In-License Patents” and “Option Period
New In-License Know-How,” respectively) shall be deemed included the ImmuNext
Patents and/or ImmuNext Know-How, respectively, effective as of the Option
Exercise Date (if any). During the License Period, Curis shall pay to ImmuNext
in a timely manner, and ImmuNext shall pay to the applicable Third Party
licensee in a timely manner, all milestone payments and royalties with respect
to any Compound or Product that become due under the applicable Option Period
New In-License as a result of the development, manufacture, use, sale, offer for
sale, import, or export of any Compound or Product by or on behalf of Curis, its
Affiliates and Sublicensees, on a pass-through basis (i.e., without mark-up), it
being understood that: (i) any such milestone payments or royalties payable with
respect to any Compound or Product under such Option Period New In-License are
in addition to the milestone payments and royalties due under Sections 9.3 and
9.4; and (ii) with respect to any Option Period New In-License Patents covered
by such Option Period New In-License that are included in the ImmuNext Patents,
such Option Period New In-License shall be deemed a Third Party License for
purposes of Section 9.4.6.
9.6.4Negotiation of License Period New In-Licenses.
(a)During the License Period, if a Party identifies any Patents or Know-How of a
Third Party to which a Party (or its Affiliate) does not have rights and that
may be necessary or reasonably useful for the development, manufacture, use,
sale, offer for sale, import, or export of Compounds or Products in the Field,
such Party shall inform the other Party thereof. Unless the Parties mutually
agree in their sole discretion that one of the Parties will negotiate, for the
benefit of both Parties, an agreement pursuant to which such Party obtains on
behalf of both Parties a license or other rights to such Patents or Know-How
(each such agreement, an “License Period New In-License”) as are necessary or
reasonably useful both for the development, manufacture, use, sale, offer for
sale import, or export of Compounds or Products in the Field and for the
development, manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale, import, or export Excluded
Compounds outside the Field, Curis shall have the sole right to negotiate and
enter into a License Period New In-License with such Third Party under the
applicable Patents and/or Know-How to develop, make, have made, use, sell, have
sold, offer for sale, import or export Compounds and Products in the Field and
ImmuNext shall have the sole right to negotiate and enter into a License Period
New In-License with such Third Party under the applicable Patents and/or
Know-How to develop, make, have made, use, sell, have sold, offer for sale,
import or export Excluded Compounds outside the Field. Each Party shall be
solely responsible for payment of all amounts that become due under any such
License Period New In-License entered into by such Party or its Affiliate, and,
to the extent applicable, any License Period New In-License entered into by
Curis shall be deemed a Third Party License for purposes of Section 9.4.6.
(b)Notwithstanding the definitions of ImmuNext Patents and ImmuNext Know-How,
during the License Period, if, notwithstanding Section 9.6.4(a), ImmuNext or its
Affiliate obtains any license from any Third Party (whether by in-license or by


- 47 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







assignment of a license agreement to ImmuNext or its Affiliate, but subject to
Section 18.4.1) under any Patents and/or Know-How of such Third Party that is
necessary or reasonably useful for the development, manufacture, use, sale,
offer for sale, import, or export of Compounds or Products in the Field,
ImmuNext shall provide written notice thereof to Curis no later than [**] after
ImmuNext or its Affiliate obtains such license and a copy of the applicable
license agreement. Curis, at its sole option exercisable by written notice to
ImmuNext within [**] of Curis’ receipt of a copy of such license agreement,
elect to include the Patents (or any of them) and/or Know-How (or any of it)
subject to such license agreement in the ImmuNext Patents and/or ImmuNext
Know-How, respectively. Thereafter during the License Period, Curis shall pay to
ImmuNext in a timely manner, and ImmuNext shall pay to the applicable Third
Party licensee in a timely manner, all milestone payments and royalties with
respect to any Compound or Product that become due under such license agreement
as a result of the development or commercialization of any Compound or Product
by or on behalf of Curis, its Affiliates and Sublicensees, on a pass-through
basis (i.e., without mark-up), it being understood that: (i) any such milestone
payments or royalties payable with respect to any Compound or Product under such
license agreement are in addition to the milestone payments and royalties due
under Sections 9.3 and 9.4; and (ii) with respect to any Patents licensed to
ImmuNext under such license agreement that are included in the ImmuNext Patents,
to the extent applicable, such license agreement shall be deemed a Third Party
License for purposes of Section 9.4.6. If, during the [**] period following
Curis’ receipt of a copy of such license agreement, Curis does not provide a
written notice to ImmuNext electing to include the Patents (or any of them)
and/or Know-How (or any of it) subject to such license agreement in the ImmuNext
Patents and/or ImmuNext Know-How, respectively, such Patents and Know-How will
not be included in the definition of ImmuNext Patents or ImmuNext Know-How, as
applicable.
9.6.5Confidentiality. Any copy of an Option Period New In-License or License
Period New In-License or other license agreement entered into by a Party that is
provided to the other Party pursuant to Section 9.6.2 or Section 9.6.3 shall be
deemed the Confidential Information of the Party providing such copy.
10.Payments; Records; Audits
10.1Royalty Payment Reports. Royalties under Section 9.4 and payments with
respect to Sublicense Revenues under Section 9.5 shall be calculated and
reported for each Calendar Quarter and shall be paid within [**] after the end
of each Calendar Quarter (or portion thereof if this Agreement terminates during
a Calendar Quarter). Each such payment shall be accompanied or preceded by a
written report of Net Sales and Sublicense Revenues in sufficient detail to
permit confirmation of the accuracy of the payment made, including, on a
country-by-country basis, the amount of gross sales and Net Sales of each
Product in each country during the applicable Calendar Quarter (including such
amounts expressed in local currency and as converted to Dollars), and a detailed
calculation of royalty payments due on such Net Sales for such Calendar Quarter
(including all deductions and reductions and tax withholding). Reporting for the
Calendar Quarter in which the rates in Column A of the table in Section 9.4.1
cease to apply and the royalty rates in Column B of the table in Section 9.4.1
begin to apply shall be sufficiently detailed for ImmuNext to pay the
appropriate royalty to Upstream Licensor 4. Further, upon request, Curis shall
meet with Upstream Licensor 4 to discuss the calculations of royalties for such
Calendar Quarter.


- 48 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







10.2Exchange Rate; Manner and Place of Payment. All payment amounts in this
Agreement are expressed in Dollars, and all payments hereunder shall be payable
in Dollars. When conversion of payments from any foreign currency is required,
such conversion shall be calculated at the rate of exchange for such currency
used throughout the applicable Selling Party’s accounting system for financial
reporting purposes for the Calendar Quarter for which payment is due. All
payments owed under this Agreement shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to such U.S. bank account as shall be designated by ImmuNext.
10.3Records Retention. Curis shall keep, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
and Sublicensees, if any, to keep, full and accurate books of accounting
pertaining to the sale or other disposition of Products and the receipt of
Sublicense Revenues in sufficient detail to permit ImmuNext to confirm the
accuracy of all Net Sales-based payments under Sections 9.3.2 and 9.4 and all
amounts payable to ImmuNext with respect to Sublicense Revenues under
Section 9.5, for a period of [**] after the Calendar Year to which such records
pertain. Records shall be kept at Curis’ principal place of business.
10.4Audits.
10.4.1By ImmuNext. During the Term and for a period of [**] thereafter, Curis
shall permit an independent, certified public accountant of nationally
recognized standing appointed by ImmuNext, and reasonably acceptable to Curis,
during normal business hours and upon [**] prior written notice, but in no case
more than [**], to examine such records, at the location(s) where such records
are maintained by or on behalf of Curis in the ordinary course of business, as
may be necessary for the sole purpose of verifying the calculation and reporting
of Net Sales and the correctness of any payment made under this Agreement for
any period within the preceding [**], provided that the records for a given
Calendar Year shall be subject to audit pursuant to this Section 10.4 [**],
except as otherwise permitted to be audited pursuant to the terms of an Upstream
Agreement. Results of any such examination shall be made available
simultaneously to both Curis and ImmuNext. The independent, certified public
accountant shall disclose to ImmuNext only the amounts that the independent
auditor believes to be due and payable hereunder to ImmuNext, details concerning
any discrepancy from the amount paid and the amount due, and shall disclose no
other information revealed in such audit. Any and all records examined by such
independent accountant shall be deemed Curis’ Confidential Information which may
not be disclosed by said independent, certified public accountant to any Third
Party, and Curis may require such accountant to enter into an appropriate
written agreement obligating it to be bound by obligations of confidentiality
and restrictions on use of such Confidential Information that are substantially
similar to the obligations and restrictions set forth in Section 13. If, as a
result of any inspection of the books and records of Curis, its Affiliates or
any Sublicensee, it is shown that payments under this Agreement were less than
the amount, which should have been paid, then Curis shall make all payments
required to be made to eliminate any discrepancy revealed by such inspection
within [**] of receipt of the applicable report from the independent auditor,
with interest from the date such amount was due (calculated in accordance with
Section 10.7). If, as a result of any inspection of the books and records of
Curis, its Affiliates or any Sublicensee pursuant to this Section 10.4, it is
shown that payments under this Agreement were more than the amount which should
have been paid, then ImmuNext shall credit such amounts to Curis against the
next payment due ImmuNext. If there are no future payments due ImmuNext, such
credit shall be paid to Curis within [**] after the date of


- 49 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







the audit report. ImmuNext shall pay for such audits, except that in the event
that the audited amounts were underpaid by Curis by more than [**] percent
([**]%) of the amounts that should have been paid during the period in question
as per the audit, Curis shall pay the reasonable out-of-pocket costs of the
audit. Except as set forth in Section 10.4.2, upon the expiration of [**]
following the end of any Calendar Year, the calculation of royalties payable
with respect to such year shall be binding and conclusive upon the Parties.
10.4.2By ImmuNext on Behalf of Upstream Licensor 4. During the Term and for a
period of [**] thereafter, Curis shall permit an independent, certified public
accountant of nationally recognized standing appointed by Upstream Licensor 4,
and reasonably acceptable to ImmuNext and Curis, during normal business hours
and upon [**] prior written notice to examine such records, at the location(s)
where such records are maintained, as may be necessary for the sole purpose of
verifying the calculation and reporting of Net Sales and the correctness of any
payment made under this Agreement for any period within the preceding [**]. Any
such audit shall be conducted on behalf of Upstream Licensor 4 and [**], whether
conducted by or on behalf of ImmuNext pursuant to Section 10.4.1 or conducted by
or on behalf of ImmuNext on behalf of Upstream Licensor 4 pursuant to this
Section 10.4.2, may be conducted in [**]; provided that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 10.4.1, ImmuNext shall be entitled to
conduct [**] on behalf of Upstream Licensor 4 following expiration or
termination of this Agreement and provided further that such [**] limitation
shall not apply in the event that Upstream Licensor 4 exercises its right to an
audit during a [**] in which ImmuNext has already exercised its own right to an
audit. The terms set forth in Section 10.4.1 regarding sharing of the report of
the independent public accountant, disclosure of the results of examination,
amounts due and payable, details of discrepancy from the amounts paid and the
amounts due, in each case, shall apply to any audit conducted under this
Section 10.4.2; provided, however, that ImmuNext may disclose such information
to Upstream Licensor 4, but no other Third Party. If, as a result of any
inspection of the books and records of Curis, its Affiliates or any Sublicensee
pursuant to this Section 10.4.2, it is shown that payments under this Agreement
were less than the amount which should have been paid, then Curis shall make all
payments required to be made to eliminate any discrepancy with respect to
payments owed by ImmuNext to Upstream Licensor 4 under Upstream Agreement 4
revealed by such inspection within [**]. Upon the expiration of [**] following
the end of any Calendar Year, the calculation of royalties payable with respect
to such year shall be binding and conclusive upon Upstream Licensor 4.
10.5Diligence Payments under Upstream Agreement 1.
10.5.1ImmuNext shall be solely responsible for the payment of any milestone
payment that becomes due under Section 5.01(e) of Upstream Agreement 1 as a
result of the achievement by ImmuNext, its Affiliate or any Third Party
sublicensee of any milestone event set forth in Section 5.01 of Upstream
Agreement 1, and Curis shall have no obligation to ImmuNext with respect to such
payment or with respect to the corresponding diligence obligation set forth in
Section 4.01 of Upstream Agreement 1.
10.5.2At least [**] prior to each of the diligence obligation dates set forth
Section 4.01 of Upstream Agreement 1 with respect to any diligence obligation
that has not been previously performed by ImmuNext, its Affiliate or a Third
Party sublicensee, ImmuNext shall


- 50 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







provide written notice to Curis of the number of Third Party sublicensees under
the license granted to ImmuNext pursuant to Upstream Agreement 1 as of such
date. Curis shall provide written notice to ImmuNext at least [**] prior to each
of the diligence obligation dates set forth Section 4.01 of Upstream Agreement 1
with respect to any diligence obligation that has not been performed by
ImmuNext, its Affiliate or a Third Party sublicensee as to whether or not Curis
elects to retain its sublicense under the license granted to ImmuNext pursuant
to Upstream Agreement 1 (each, a “Notification”). If (a) Curis elects to retain
such sublicense and (b) neither Curis nor ImmuNext nor any of its Affiliates or
Third Party sublicensees has performed such diligence obligation by the
applicable diligence obligation date, then Curis shall pay to ImmuNext that
portion of the milestone payment corresponding to such diligence obligation set
forth in Section 5.01(e) of Upstream Agreement 1 determined by [**] pursuant to
Upstream Agreement 1.
10.5.3During the License Period, and only if the First Commercial Sale of a
Product has occurred prior to the time a particular minimum annual royalty
payment is actually paid by ImmuNext to Upstream Licensor 1 under Section 4.02
of Upstream Agreement 1, Curis shall pay to ImmuNext that portion of the
applicable minimum annual royalty due to Upstream Licensor 1 determined by [**].
10.5.4[**] percent ([**]%) of any payment made by Curis to ImmuNext under this
Section 10.5 shall be credited towards the next milestone payment payable by
Curis to ImmuNext under Section 9.3.1, if any.
10.5.5ImmuNext shall submit to Curis a written invoice for any payment that
becomes due pursuant to this Section 10.5, which notice shall set forth the
number of Third Party sublicensees under the license granted to ImmuNext
pursuant to Upstream Agreement 1 as of the date the corresponding payment became
due to Upstream Licensor 1. Curis shall pay the undisputed amounts set forth in
each such invoice within [**] after receipt of such invoice. For clarity, should
there not be a next milestone payment payable by Curis to ImmuNext to offset the
credit, then Curis may apply the full amount of such credit against royalties
payable by Curis to ImmuNext hereunder.
10.5.6Should a Notification indicate that Curis elects not to retain its
sublicense under the license granted to ImmuNext pursuant to Upstream
Agreement 1, all ImmuNext Technology that is subject to ImmuNext’s Control
pursuant to Upstream Agreement 1 shall be automatically excluded from ImmuNext
Technology for purposes of this Agreement, and Curis will not be responsible for
any diligence milestone payment or annual minimum royalty (or any portion of
either of the foregoing) that becomes due after such Notification.

10.6Taxes.
10.6.1Curis will make all payments to ImmuNext under this Agreement without
deduction or withholding for taxes except to the extent that any such deduction
or withholding is required by Law in effect at the time of payment.
10.6.2Any tax required to be withheld on amounts payable under this Agreement
will promptly be paid by Curis on behalf of ImmuNext to the appropriate
governmental authority, and Curis will furnish ImmuNext with proof of payment of
such tax. Any such tax required to be withheld will be borne by ImmuNext.
10.6.3Curis and ImmuNext will cooperate with respect to all documentation
required by any taxing authority or reasonably requested by Curis to secure a
reduction in the rate of applicable withholding taxes. On the date of execution
of this Agreement, ImmuNext will deliver to Curis an accurate and complete
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9.
10.6.4If Curis had a duty to withhold taxes in connection with any payment it
made to ImmuNext under this Agreement but Curis failed to withhold, and such
taxes were assessed against and paid by Curis, then ImmuNext will reimburse
Curis for such taxes (including interest) actually paid by Curis. If Curis makes
a claim under this Section 10.6.4, it will comply with the obligations imposed
by Section 10.6.2 as if Curis had withheld taxes from a payment to ImmuNext,
except as set forth in this Section 10.6.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if,
as a result of a Withholding Action (as defined below) by Curis (including any
assignee or successor), withholding is required by Laws and the amount of such
withholding exceeds the amount of withholding that would have been required if
Curis had not committed the Withholding Action, then Curis shall pay an
additional amount to ImmuNext such that, after withholding from the amounts
payable and such additional amount, ImmuNext receives the same amount as it
would have received from Curis absent such Withholding Action by Curis. However,
if, as a result of a Withholding Action by ImmuNext (including any assignee or
successor), withholding is required by Laws and the amount of such withholding
exceeds the amount of withholding that would have been required if ImmuNext (or
its assignee or successor) had not committed the Withholding Action, no amount
due by Curis to ImmuNext pursuant to this Agreement shall be increased for such
excess withholding and, subject to the terms of this Agreement, the required
amount shall be withheld and submitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority
by Curis. For purposes of this Section 10.6.4, “Withholding Action” by a Party
means (i) a permitted assignment or sublicense of this Agreement (in whole or in
part) by such Party to an Affiliate or Third Party outside of the United States;
(ii) the exercise by such Party of its rights under this Agreement (in whole or
in part) through an Affiliate or Third Party outside of the United States (or
the direct exercise of such rights by an Affiliate of such Party outside of the
United States); (iii) a redomiciliation of such Party (or its assignee or
successor of this Agreement) to a jurisdiction outside the United States; and
(iv) any action by such Party that causes this Agreement or any payment made
under this Agreement to become subject to tax in a jurisdiction outside of the
United States or subject any payments made under this Agreement to withholding
in any jurisdiction that would not have been required absent such action.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







10.7Tax Treatment. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, Curis acknowledges that
ImmuNext intends to treat (a) the Upfront Fee as the payment of option premium
by Curis to ImmuNext in exchange for ImmuNext’s grant of the Option to obtain
the exclusive license set forth in Section 3.1, (b) the payment of the Option
Fee as the exercise of the Option and (c) the failure by Curis to deliver the
Option Fee prior to the expiration of the Option Period as gain on the lapse of
an option for ImmuNext within the meaning of Section 1234(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
10.8Interest Due. Without limiting any other rights or remedies available to
either Party, each Party shall pay the other interest on any payments that are
not paid on or before the date such payments are due under this Agreement at a
rate equal to the lesser of (a) [**] percent ([**]%) above the prime rate as
reported by Citibank, New York, New York on the date such payment was due to be
paid, or (b) the maximum applicable legal rate on such date, calculated on the
total number of days payment is delinquent.
10.9Blocked Currency. If by Law or fiscal policy of a particular country,
conversion into Dollars or transfer of funds of a convertible currency to the
United States is restricted or forbidden, royalties accrued in such country
shall be paid to ImmuNext in the country in local currency by deposit in a local
bank designated by ImmuNext for such deposit, unless the Parties otherwise
agree.

such Party shall have the right to transfer the responsibility for such
Prosecution of such Patent applications and Patents to patent counsel selected
by it.
12.2.7Cooperation of the Parties. Each Party agrees to reasonably cooperate in
the Prosecution of Patents under this Section 12.2 and in the obtaining and
maintenance of any patent extensions, supplementary protection certificates and
the like with respect thereto. Such cooperation includes, but is not limited to:
(a) executing papers and instruments, or requiring its employees, consultants or
contractors, to execute such papers and instruments, so as to effectuate the
ownership of Inventions set forth in Section 12.1.2, and Patents claiming or
disclosing such Inventions, and to enable the other Party to apply for and to
Prosecute patent applications in any country as permitted by this Agreement; and
(b) promptly informing the other Party of any matters coming to such Party’s
attention that may affect the preparation, filing, prosecution or maintenance of
any such patent applications.
12.3Enforcement of Patents Against Infringers. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Upstream Agreements, to the extent such agreements apply to
the ImmuNext Patents, the following provisions shall apply:
12.3.1Notice. Each Party shall exercise reasonable diligence in identifying
actual or potential Competitive Infringement of any ImmuNext Patent, Curis Owned
Patent or Jointly Owned Patent. Each Party shall notify the other party in
writing within [**] (except as expressly set forth below) of becoming aware of
any suspected or threatened Competitive Infringement of any ImmuNext Patent,
Curis Owned Patent or Jointly Owned Patent, and the remainder of this
Section 12.3 shall apply to such Competitive Infringement; provided, however,
that each Party shall notify the other Party of any Patent Certification
regarding any ImmuNext Patent, Curis Owned Patent or Jointly Owned Patent that
it receives, and provide the other Party with a copy of such Patent
Certification, within [**] of receipt. Notwithstanding the foregoing, ImmuNext
is not required to give Curis notice infringement of any Excluded ImmuNext
Patent.
12.3.2Enforcement of ImmuNext Patents during the Option Period. As between the
Parties, ImmuNext will have the sole right, but not an obligation, to bring (or
defend) and control any action or proceeding with respect to Competitive
Infringement of any ImmuNext Patent during the Option Period.


- 62 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







12.3.3Enforcement of ImmuNext Hybrid Patents during the License Period. As
between the Parties, during the License Period, ImmuNext will have the first
right, but not an obligation, to bring (or defend) and control any action or
proceeding with respect to Competitive Infringement of any ImmuNext Hybrid
Patent, and Curis shall have the right to be represented in any such action or
proceeding, at Curis’ expense and by counsel of its own choice. If ImmuNext
withdraws from any such action or proceeding with respect to Competitive
Infringement of any ImmuNext Hybrid Patent, or fails to bring any such action or
proceeding with respect to Competitive Infringement of any ImmuNext Hybrid
Patent within [**] following the notice of alleged Competitive Infringement,
then Curis shall have the right, but not the obligation, to continue, or to
bring (or defend) and control any such action at its own expense and by counsel
of its own choice, and ImmuNext shall have the right, at its own expense, to be
represented in any such action by counsel of its own choice, subject to
Section 12.3.6.
12.3.4Enforcement of ImmuNext Exclusive Patents, Curis Owned Patents and Jointly
Owned Patents during the License Period. As between the Parties, during the
License Period, Curis will have the (a) first right, but not an obligation, to
bring (or defend) and control any action or proceeding with respect to
Competitive Infringement of any ImmuNext Exclusive Patent or Jointly Owned
Patent and (b) the sole right, but not an obligation, to bring any (or defend)
and control any action or proceeding with respect to Competitive Infringement of
any Curis Owned Patent. If Curis withdraws from any such action or proceeding
with respect to Competitive Infringement of any ImmuNext Exclusive Patent or
Jointly Owned Patent, or fails to bring any such action or proceeding with
respect to Competitive Infringement of any ImmuNext Exclusive Patent or Jointly
Owned Patent within [**] following the notice of alleged Competitive
Infringement, then ImmuNext shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
continue, or to bring (or defend) and control any such action at its own expense
and by counsel of its own choice, and Curis shall have the right, at its own
expense, to be represented in any such action by counsel of its own choice,
subject to Section 12.3.6.
12.3.5Enforcement of Excluded ImmuNext Patents during the License Period. As
between the Parties, during the Term, ImmuNext will have the sole right, but not
an obligation, to bring (or defend) and control any action or proceeding with
respect to Infringement (each, an “Infringement Action”) of any Excluded
ImmuNext Patent, and Curis shall not have any rights with respect to any such
Infringement Action.
12.3.6Procedure for Enforcement.
(a)The non-enforcing Party pursuant to Section 12.3.3 or Section 12.3.4 (as
applicable) shall reasonably assist the enforcing Party (at the enforcing
Party’s expense) in any such action if so requested, and shall lend its name and
be joined as a party plaintiff to such actions if reasonably requested by such
enforcing Party or required by Laws. The non-enforcing Party shall have the
right to participate and be represented in any such action by its own counsel at
its own expense. The non-enforcing Party shall cooperate, at the enforcing
Party’s cost and expense, with the enforcing Party in investigating or
terminating any suspected infringement, whether through legal action,
negotiation or otherwise, including by producing all reasonably pertinent
records, papers, information, samples, specimens and similar items, and
directing its employees to testify and grant interviews, upon the request of the
enforcing Party. The enforcing Party will keep the non-enforcing Party
reasonably informed of the status of the


- 63 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







action. The enforcing Party will have an obligation to consult with the
non-enforcing Party and will take any comments from the non-enforcing Party into
good faith consideration with respect to the infringement, claim construction or
defense of the validity or enforceability of any claim in an ImmuNext Patent or
Jointly Owned Patent. The enforcing Party shall provide to the non-enforcing
Party copies of any papers relating to the infringement and/or validity
litigation of the involved Patent promptly upon their being filed or received.
(b)The enforcing Party may not enter into a settlement of any action pursuant to
Section 12.3.3 or Section 12.3.4 (as applicable) which restricts the scope, or
adversely affects the enforceability, of the rights of the other Party under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of such other Party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
12.3.7Damages. Except as otherwise agreed by the parties in connection with a
cost-sharing arrangement, any recovery as a result of any action or proceeding
pursuant to Section 12.3.3 or Section 12.3.4, whether by way of settlement or
otherwise, shall first be used first to reimburse the Party that brought (or
defended) and controlled such action or proceeding for its documented,
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including court, attorneys’ and professional
fees) incurred in connection with such action or proceeding, and then to
reimburse the other Party for its documented, out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including court, attorneys’ and professional fees) incurred in connection with
such action or proceeding (to the extent not previously reimbursed by the
enforcing Party). If, after such reimbursement of the Parties’ cost and
expenses, any funds shall remain from such damages or other sums recovered
(“Remainder”) and any of the Upstream Agreements requires ImmuNext to share such
Remainder with the licensor under such Upstream Agreement, such Remainder shall
be shared with the applicable licensor in accordance with the applicable
Upstream Agreement. After such sharing, any remaining portion of the Remainder,
or if the Remainder is not required to be shared with any licensor under an
Upstream Agreement, the Remainder, shall be retained by the enforcing Party;
provided, however, that:
(a)in the event that ImmuNext was the enforcing Party following exercise of its
first right under Section 12.3.3 with respect to any ImmuNext Hybrid Patent,
that part of the Remainder (or of the remaining portion thereof) that is
attributable to Competitive Infringement of such Patent shall be allocated as
follows: (i) to the extent it represents compensatory damages for Competitive
Infringement, [**]% to ImmuNext and [**]% to Curis; and (ii) to the extent it
represents special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages (including
treble damages) for Competitive Infringement, [**]% to ImmuNext and [**]% to
Curis. For clarity, Curis shall not be entitled to any portion of a recovery
realized by ImmuNext as a result of any action brought and controlled by
ImmuNext pursuant to Section 12.3.3 with respect to any ImmuNext Hybrid Patent
that is specifically attributable to Infringement, other than Competitive
Infringement, of such Patent; and
(b)in the event that Curis was the enforcing Party following exercise of its
first right under Section 12.3.4 with respect to any ImmuNext Exclusive Patent
or Jointly Owned Patent, that part of the Remainder (or of the remaining portion
thereof) that is attributable to Competitive Infringement of such Patent shall
be allocated as follows: (i) to the extent it represents compensatory damages
for Competitive Infringement, [**]% to Curis and


- 64 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







[**]% to ImmuNext; and (ii) to the extent it represents special, exemplary,
punitive or consequential damages (including treble damages) for Competitive
Infringement, [**]% to Curis and [**]% to ImmuNext.
12.4Patent Term Extension. Each Party shall each cooperate with the other Party
and shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts in obtaining patent term extension
and Regulatory Exclusivity (including, for example, any pediatric exclusivity
extensions as may be available) or supplemental protection certificates or their
equivalents in any country with respect to Patents Covering the Products, as
applicable and subject to any restrictions set forth in the Upstream Agreements.
If elections with respect to obtaining such patent term extensions, Regulatory
Exclusivity, or supplemental protection certificates are to be made, Curis shall
have the right to make the election to seek (a) patent term extension solely
with respect to ImmuNext Exclusive Patents, Curis Owned Patents and Jointly
Owned Patents, (b) Regulatory Exclusivity, or (c) supplemental protection. For
such purpose, for all Regulatory Approvals, Curis shall use reasonable efforts
to provide ImmuNext with notice of each expected Regulatory Approval of a
Product prior to the expected date of Regulatory Approval, as well as promptly
notifying ImmuNext after receiving each Regulatory Approval of a Product in each
territory confirming the date of such Regulatory Approval.
12.5Patent Certification. In the event a Third Party files a Patent
Certification (as defined in Section 1.27), upon request of a Party, the other
Party shall provide reasonable assistance and cooperation (including making
available to such first Party documents possessed by such other Party that are
reasonably required by such first Party and making available personnel for
interviews and testimony) in any actions reasonably undertaken by such first
Party in accordance with Section 12.3. The Parties shall cooperate to compile an
accurate list of all Patents required to be provided by Curis, its Affiliate
and/or Sublicensee pursuant to 35 U.S.C. Section 351(l)(1)(3)(A).
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Curis will retain final decision-making
authority as to such listing of all applicable Patents for such Product.
12.6Defense Against Claims of Infringement of Third Party Patents. If a Third
Party asserts that a Patent or other right owned by it is or has been infringed
by the manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale import, or export of a Compound or
Product, the Party first obtaining knowledge of such a claim shall immediately
provide the other Party written notice of such claim along with the related
facts in reasonable detail. In such event, unless the Parties otherwise agree,
[**] shall have the first right, but not the obligation, at its expense, to
control such defense with respect to such Compound or Product. Each Party shall
cooperate with the defending Party, at the defending Party’s reasonable request
and expense, and shall have the right to be represented separately by counsel of
its own choice, but at its own expense. The defending Party shall also control
settlement of such claim; provided, however, that no settlement shall be entered
into without the prior consent of the other Party if such settlement would
adversely affect the rights and benefits of, or impose or adversely affect any
obligations on, the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned).
13.Confidentiality
13.1Nondisclosure.


- 65 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







13.1.1Each Party agrees that, during the Term and for a period of [**]
thereafter, a Party (the “Receiving Party”) receiving Confidential Information
of the other Party (the “Disclosing Party”) (or that has received any such
Confidential Information from the other Party prior to the Effective Date) shall
(a) maintain in confidence such Confidential Information using not less than the
efforts such Receiving Party uses to maintain in confidence its own proprietary
information of similar kind and value but at least reasonable efforts, (b) not
disclose such Confidential Information to any Third Party without the prior
written consent of the Disclosing Party, except for disclosures expressly
permitted pursuant to this Agreement, and (c) not use such Confidential
Information for any purpose except those permitted by this Agreement (it being
understood that this clause (c) shall not create or imply any rights or licenses
not expressly granted under this Agreement). The Receiving Party shall use at
least the same standard of care as it uses to protect proprietary or
confidential information of its own, but no less than reasonable care, to ensure
that its, and its Affiliates’, directors, officers, employees, and consultants
(“Representatives”) do not disclose or make any unauthorized use of the
Confidential Information. The Receiving Party shall be responsible for any
failure by its Representatives which, if committed by Receiving Party, would be
a breach of this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall promptly notify the
Disclosing Party upon discovery of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the
Confidential Information.
13.1.2At all times during and after the Term, all ImmuNext Technology, Excluded
ImmuNext Technology, and, notwithstanding Section 13.2.2 and 13.2.5, Excluded
Compound Technology are the Confidential Information of ImmuNext.
13.1.3During the Option Period, all Curis Technology and Joint Technology (in
each case of Curis Technology and Joint Technology, excluding Excluded Compounds
and Excluded Compound Technology) Made during the Option Period, all Option
Period Results, Curis Option Period Records and ImmuNext Option Period Records
are the Confidential Information of both Parties with each Party being treated
as the Receiving Party.
13.1.4During the License Period and thereafter, notwithstanding Sections 13.2.2
and 13.2.5: (i) all Curis Option Period Records and Curis Owned Technology are
the Confidential Information of Curis; and (ii) all ImmuNext Option Period
Records, Option Period Results and Jointly Owned Technology are the Confidential
Information of both Parties with each Party being treated as the Receiving
Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of termination of this
Agreement in its entirety by ImmuNext pursuant to Section 15.2.1, 15.3, 15.4 or
15.6, or by Curis pursuant to Section 15.5, the Option Period Results and the
Curis Option Period Records shall become the Confidential Information of
ImmuNext.
13.2Exceptions. The obligations in Section 13.1 shall not apply with respect to
any portion of the Confidential Information that the Receiving Party can show by
competent written proof:
13.2.1was generally available to the public or otherwise part of the public
domain at the time of disclosure to the Receiving Party hereunder;


- 66 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







13.2.2was known to the Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates, without any
obligation to keep it confidential or any restriction on its use, prior to
disclosure by the Disclosing Party, as evidenced by contemporaneous written
records;
13.2.3is subsequently disclosed to the Receiving Party or any of its Affiliates
by a Third Party lawfully in possession thereof and without any obligation to
keep it confidential or any restriction on its use;
13.2.4is published by a Third Party or otherwise becomes publicly available or
enters the public domain, after it is disclosed to the Receiving Party other
than through any act or omission of the Receiving Party in breach of this
Agreement; or
13.2.5is independently developed by or for the Receiving Party or its
Affiliates, as evidenced by written records prepared contemporaneously with such
independent development, without reference to or reliance upon the Disclosing
Party’s Confidential Information.
13.3Authorized Disclosure. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential
Information belonging to the Disclosing Party, and Confidential Information
deemed to belong to both Parties under the terms of this Agreement, to the
extent (and only to the extent) such disclosure is reasonably necessary in the
following instances:
(a)to the extent such disclosure is to a governmental authority as reasonably
necessary in filing or prosecuting Patent, copyright or trademark applications
in accordance with this Agreement, prosecuting or defending litigation related
to this Agreement, complying with applicable governmental regulations with
respect to conduct under this Agreement, obtaining Regulatory Approval or
performing post‑approval regulatory obligations for the Compounds or Products,
or otherwise required by Law;
(b)subject to Sections 13.5 and 13.7, complying with Laws (including the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any national
securities exchange) and with any valid order of a court of competent
jurisdiction;
(c)disclosure, solely on a “need to know basis,” to (i) Affiliates, (ii) any
Third Party that is party to any Upstream Agreement, potential or actual
collaborators (including (sub)licensees), acquirers, merger partners, assignees,
Subcontractors, investment bankers, investors, lenders or other financial
partners, advisors, and each of the Parties’ respective Representatives, each of
whom prior to disclosure must be bound by written obligations of confidentiality
and non-use no less restrictive than the obligations set forth in this
Section 13 (but subject to a shorter period of confidentiality and non-use if
customary under the circumstances); provided, however, that, in each of the
foregoing situations, the Receiving Party shall remain responsible for any
failure by any Person who receives Confidential Information pursuant to this
Section 13.3(c) to treat such Confidential Information as required under this
Section 13; and
(d)With respect to pre-clinical data generated during the Option Period,
ImmuNext may disclose such data in connection with research grant applications


- 67 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







prepared (and grants received thereunder) by ImmuNext or Upstream Licensor 1;
provided, however, that ImmuNext and Upstream Licensor 1, as applicable,
identify any such data as proprietary and/or confidential.
If and whenever any Confidential Information is disclosed in accordance with
this Section 13, such disclosure shall not cause any such information to cease
to be Confidential Information, except to the extent that such disclosure
results in a public disclosure of such information (other than by breach of this
Agreement). Where reasonably possible and subject to Sections 13.5 and 13.7 and
other than pursuant to Section 13.3(c), the Receiving Party shall notify the
Disclosing Party of the Receiving Party’s intent to make such disclosure
pursuant to this Section 13.3 sufficiently prior to making such disclosure so as
to allow the Disclosing Party adequate time to take whatever action it may deem
appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the information, and the Receiving
Party will provide reasonable assistance to the Disclosing Party with respect
thereto; provided that, in any event, the Receiving Party will use reasonable
measures to ensure confidential treatment of such information.
13.4Terms of this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement and all
of the terms of this Agreement shall be treated as Confidential Information of
both Parties; provided, however, that ImmuNext shall be permitted to disclose
this Agreement to the extent required under any of the Upstream Agreements.
13.5Filing of this Agreement. The Parties shall coordinate in advance with each
other in connection with the filing of this Agreement (including redaction of
certain provisions of this Agreement) with any securities authority or with any
stock exchange on which securities issued by a Party or its Affiliate are
traded, and each Party will use reasonable efforts to seek and obtain
confidential treatment for the terms proposed to be redacted; provided that each
Party will ultimately retain control over what terms are disclosed to any
securities authority or stock exchange, as the case may be, to the extent such
Party determines, on the advice of legal counsel, that disclosure is reasonably
necessary to comply with applicable Laws, including disclosure requirements of
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or with the requirements of any
stock exchange on which securities issued by a Party or its Affiliates are
traded, and provided further that the Parties will use their reasonable efforts
to file redacted versions with any governing bodies which are consistent with
redacted versions previously filed with any other governing bodies.
13.6Publications.
13.6.1During the Option Period, each Party shall have the right to publish
information generated by or on behalf of such Party that is related to any
Compound or Product; such publications include oral presentations and abstracts.
Before any such paper is submitted for publication or an oral presentation is
made, the Party proposing to make such publication (the “Publishing Party”)
shall deliver to the other Party a then-current copy of the paper or materials
for presentation at least [**] prior to submitting the paper to a publisher or
making the presentation. The other Party shall review such materials and give
its comments to the Publishing Party within [**]. Failure to respond within the
time period set forth above shall be deemed approval to publish or present.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Publishing Party shall comply with the other
Party’s request to delete references to the other Party’s Confidential


- 68 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







Information in any such publication and, upon request, shall withhold
publication for an additional [**] in order to permit the applicable Party to
obtain Patent protection in accordance with this Agreement.
13.6.2During the License Period, Curis shall have the sole right to publish
information related to the Compounds or Products; such publications include oral
presentations and abstracts. Before any such paper is submitted for publication
or an oral presentation is made, Curis shall deliver to ImmuNext a then-current
copy of the paper or materials for presentation at least [**] prior to
submitting the paper to a publisher or making the presentation. ImmuNext shall
review such materials and give its comments to Curis within [**]. Failure to
respond within the time period set forth above shall be deemed approval to
publish or present. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Curis shall comply with
ImmuNext’s request to delete references to ImmuNext’s Confidential Information
in any such publication and, upon request, shall withhold publication for an
additional [**] in order to permit the applicable Party to obtain Patent
protection in accordance with this Agreement.
13.6.3Any publication shall include recognition of the respective contributions
of the Parties according to standard practice for assigning scientific credit,
either through authorship or acknowledgement, as may be appropriate.
13.7Press Release. Promptly following the Effective Date, Curis will issue a
press release mutually agreed upon by the Parties announcing the existence of
this Agreement. It is further acknowledged that each Party may desire or be
required to issue subsequent press releases relating to this Agreement or
activities conducted hereunder. The Parties agree to consult with each other
reasonably and in good faith with respect to the text and timing of subsequent
press releases prior to the issuance thereof, provided that, subject to the
remainder of this Section 13.7, consent of the non-issuing Party may not be
withheld in the case of releases that the other Party determines, based on
advice of counsel, are reasonably necessary to comply with applicable Laws,
including disclosure requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, or with the requirements of any stock exchange on which securities
issued by a Party or its Affiliates are traded. In the event of a required
public announcement, to the extent there is sufficient time while still being
able to comply with applicable Laws, including disclosure requirements of the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or with the requirements of any stock
exchange on which securities issued by a Party or its Affiliates are traded, the
Party making such announcement shall provide the other Party with a copy of the
proposed text of such announcement sufficiently in advance of the scheduled
release to afford such other Party a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon the proposed text. Each Party may make public statements regarding
this Agreement in response to questions by the press, analysts, investors or
those attending industry conferences or financial analyst calls, or issue press
releases, so long as the contents of any such public statement or press release
are contained in a prior public disclosure or public statement approved by the
other Party pursuant to this Section 13.7 or permitted by Section 13.3 and does
not reveal non‑public information about the other Party.


- 69 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







14.Indemnity and Insurance
14.1Curis Indemnity. Curis shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ImmuNext
and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
licensors, and their respective successors, heirs and assigns, and
representatives (the “ImmuNext Indemnitees”), from and against any and all
losses, damages, liabilities, expenses and costs, including reasonable legal
expense and attorneys’ fees (“Damages”), to which any ImmuNext Indemnitee may
become subject as a result of any claim, demand, action or other proceeding by
any Third Party (each, a “Third Party Claim”), to the extent such Damages arise
out of or relate to: (a) the gross negligence, recklessness, or willful
misconduct of any Curis Indemnitee (defined below) under this Agreement; (b) any
breach by Curis or any of its Affiliates or Sublicensees of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement made by Curis in this Agreement; or
(c) the Exploitation of Compounds or Products by or on behalf of Curis, its
Affiliates or Sublicensees; except, in each case, to the extent such Damages
result from the gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of any
ImmuNext Indemnitee or the breach by ImmuNext of any warranty, representation,
covenant or agreement made by ImmuNext in this Agreement.
14.2ImmuNext Indemnity. ImmuNext shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
Curis and its Affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, licensors, and their respective successors, heirs and assigns, and
representatives (the “Curis Indemnitees”), from and against any and all Damages
to which any Curis Indemnitee may become subject as a result of any Third Party
Claim, to the extent such Damages arise out of or relate to: (a) the gross
negligence, recklessness, or willful misconduct of any ImmuNext Indemnitee under
this Agreement; (b) any breach by ImmuNext or any of its Affiliates of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement made by ImmuNext in this
Agreement; (c) any breach by ImmuNext or any of its Affiliates of any Upstream
Agreement prior to the Effective Date; or (d) the Exploitation of any Excluded
Compound by or on behalf of ImmuNext, its Affiliates, licensees or sublicensees;
except, in each case, to the extent such Damages result from the gross
negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct of any Curis Indemnitee or the
breach by Curis of any warranty, representation, covenant or agreement made by
Curis in this Agreement.
14.3Indemnification Procedure.
14.3.1Promptly after receipt by a Party of notice, or such Party otherwise
becoming aware, of any actual or potential Third Party Claim which could give
rise to a right to indemnification pursuant to Section 14.1 or Section 14.2,
such Party shall promptly give the other Party written notice describing the
Third Party Claim in reasonable detail. The indemnified Party shall not take any
action that impairs the defense of any Third Party Claim by the indemnifying
Party. The failure or delay of a Party to give notice in the manner provided
herein shall not relieve the indemnifying Party of its obligations under this
Section 14, except to the extent that such failure or delay to give notice
actually prejudices the indemnifying Party’s ability to defend such Third Party
Claim.
14.3.2The indemnifying Party shall have the right, exercisable by written notice
to the indemnified Party within [**] of receipt of notice of the commencement of
or


- 70 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







assertion of any Third Party Claim, to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim. Following such notice, the indemnifying Party shall, at its sole cost and
expense, assume and conduct such defense, with counsel selected by the
indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the indemnified Party.
14.3.3If the indemnifying Party undertakes to defend any Third Party Claim as
provided in Section 14.3.1 the indemnified Party agrees to reasonably cooperate
with the indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense of such Third Party
Claim, including by furnishing such records, information and testimony and
attending such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals
as may reasonably be requested by the indemnifying Party. All reasonable costs
and expenses incurred in connection with such cooperation shall be borne by the
indemnifying Party. The indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in
(but not control) and be represented by its own counsel (at the indemnified
Party’s own expense) in connection with such Third Party Claim.
14.3.4If the indemnifying Party does not defend the Third Party Claim, or fails
to notify the indemnified Party of its election to defend as herein provided,
the indemnified Party shall have the right, at its option, to defend such Third
Party Claim by counsel of its choice and its reasonable costs and expenses for
such Third Party Claim shall be included as part of the indemnification
obligation of the indemnifying Party hereunder.
14.3.5Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party may settle or compromise any
Third Party Claim without the other Party’s prior written consent if such
settlement or compromise would: (a) commit the other Party to take, or to
forbear to take, any action; (b) subject the other Party to an injunction;
(c) constitute an admission of guilt or liability by the other Party; or
(d) impose any financial liability on the other Party.
14.3.6The Parties shall in all cases reasonably cooperate in the defense of any
Third Party Claims and each Party shall make reasonably available to the other
Party any books, records or other documents within its control that are
reasonably necessary or appropriate for such defense. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 14.3, the Party conducting the defense of a
Third Party Claim shall (a) keep the other party informed on a reasonable and
timely basis as to the status of the defense of such Third Party Claim, and
(b) conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim in a prudent manner.
14.4Insurance. During the Term, Curis will obtain and maintain, at its sole
expense, the following minimum required insurance: comprehensive general
liability insurance (including umbrella and excess liability insurance) and
products liability insurance each with minimum limits of [**] Dollars ($[**])
per occurrence and [**] Dollars ($[**]) annual aggregate. During the Option
Period, ImmuNext shall maintain, and during the Term, Curis shall maintain, any
mandatory insurance, including but not limited to workers compensation coverage,
in accordance with all applicable Laws. Commercial insurance shall be obtained
from reputable and financially secure insurance carriers having a minimum A.M.
Best rating (or equivalent) of A-. With respect to any such insurance policy
that is written on a claims-made basis (and not on an occurrence basis), Curis
shall ensure continuity of coverage for claims which may be presented during the
[**] period following the expiration or termination of this Agreement. Curis
will furnish to ImmuNext, on request, certificates of insurance evidencing the
minimum


- 71 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







required insurance. Curis shall provide ImmuNext with written notice at least
[**] prior to the cancellation, non-renewal or material change in such insurance
that would result in noncompliance of the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 14.4. Curis shall name ImmuNext as an additional insured on the

15.2Termination for Material Breach.
15.2.1Material Breach. Either Party (the “Non-Breaching Party”) may, without

this Agreement in its sole discretion in the event the other Party (the
“Breaching Party”) has materially breached this Agreement, and such breach has
continued for [**] (or [**] in the case of failure to make payment when due)
after written notice thereof is provided to the Breaching Party by the
Non-Breaching Party, such notice describing the alleged material breach in
sufficient detail to put the Breaching Party on notice; provided that, if such
breach is not susceptible to cure within the applicable cure period set forth

Section 15.2.1 shall be stayed and the cure period tolled in the event that,
during the applicable cure period for the alleged breach, the Party alleged to
have been in material breach shall have initiated dispute resolution in
accordance with Section 16 with respect to the alleged breach, which stay and
tolling shall continue until such dispute has been resolved in accordance with

patentable, ImmuNext may terminate this Agreement upon [**] prior written notice
to Curis with respect to the challenged Patent.
15.4Termination by ImmuNext for Cessation. In the event that Curis and its
Affiliates and Sublicensees conduct no research, Development, Manufacturing or

with Curis’ internal procedures consistently applied that additional time is
required to investigate, respond to and resolve (i) any patient safety issue or
(ii) any manufacturing issue; provided in all cases that Curis is using
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to resolve the cause of the delay. The

all of its assets, or (b) if the other Party is served with an involuntary
petition against it, filed in any insolvency proceeding, and such petition shall
not be dismissed within [**] after the filing thereof, or (c) if the other Party
shall propose or be a party to any dissolution or liquidation, or (d) if the
other Party shall make an assignment of substantially all of its assets for the

Parties (or the JSC, as applicable).


- 77 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

this Agreement, the construction hereof, or the rights, duties or liabilities of
either Party hereunder, the Parties shall first attempt in good faith to resolve

that such dispute is not resolved on an informal basis within [**] following the
commencement of such negotiation or consultation, either Party may, by written
notice to the other Party, refer the dispute to the executive officers
designated by the Parties for attempted resolution. Such officers, or their
designees, shall attempt in good faith to promptly resolve such dispute within
[**] after such referral. In the event that any matter is not resolved under the
foregoing provisions, each Party may, at its sole discretion, seek resolution of
such matter in accordance with Section 16.3.
16.3Arbitration. Subject to Section 16.4, any Dispute, shall be resolved by
binding arbitration before a panel of three (3) independent, neutral arbitrators
in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in
effect at the time the proceeding is initiated. In any such arbitration, the
following procedures shall apply:
16.3.1The arbitration shall be conducted pursuant to the then-current AAA rules
(in the case of disputes involving [**] Dollars ($[**]) or less, or JSC disputes
that are not finally resolved pursuant to Section 16.2, the accelerated rules
shall be used, and for all other disputes the comprehensive rules shall be
used), in effect on the date of the arbitration.
16.3.2The panel will be comprised of one arbitrator chosen by Curis, one by
ImmuNext and the third by the two so chosen. If either, or both, of Curis or
ImmuNext fails to choose an arbitrator or arbitrators within [**] after
receiving notice of commencement of arbitration or if the two arbitrators fail
to choose a third arbitrator within [**] after their appointment, then either or
both Parties shall immediately request that the AAA select the remaining number
of arbitrators to be selected, which arbitrator(s) shall have the requisite
scientific background, experience and expertise. The place of arbitration shall
be Boston, Massachusetts.
16.3.3Either Party may apply to the arbitrators for interim injunctive relief

damages not measured by a Party’s compensatory damages or that is otherwise
prohibited by this Agreement. Each Party shall bear its own costs and expenses
and attorneys’ fees in connection with any such arbitration.
16.3.4Except to the extent necessary to confirm or to enforce an award or
decision or as may be required by Laws, neither Party nor any arbitrator may
disclose the existence or results of any arbitration without the prior written
consent of both Parties. In no event shall any arbitration be initiated after
the date when commencement of a legal or equitable proceeding based on the
Dispute would be barred by the applicable New York statute of limitations.
16.3.5In the event of a Dispute involving the alleged breach of this Agreement
(including whether a Party has performed its diligence obligations hereunder),


- 78 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







(a) neither Party may terminate this Agreement under Section 15.2.1 until
resolution of the Dispute pursuant to this Section 16.3 and (b) if the
arbitrators render a decision that a breach of this Agreement has occurred, the
arbitrators shall have no authority to modify the right of the non-breaching
Party to terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 15.2.

of a Dispute that the arbitrators determine to be required to be performed by a
Party shall be completed within a reasonable time period following the final
decision of the arbitrators.
16.3.7The decision of the arbitrators with respect to any Disputes subject to
resolution pursuant to this Section 16 shall be final and binding upon the
Parties. In no event shall the arbitrators be permitted to reform or amend this
Agreement through their decision. Any monetary payment to be made by a Party
pursuant to a decision of the arbitrators shall be made in United States
dollars. Either Party may enforce the decision of the arbitrators in any court
of competent jurisdiction.
16.4Court Actions. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall deny either Party
the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court of competent
jurisdiction in the context of a bona fide emergency or prospective irreparable
harm, and such an action may be filed and maintained notwithstanding any ongoing
discussions between the Parties or any ongoing arbitration proceeding. In
addition, either Party may bring an action in any court of competent
jurisdiction to resolve disputes pertaining to the validity, construction,
scope, enforceability, infringement or other violations of Patents or other
intellectual property rights, and no such claim shall be subject to arbitration
pursuant to Section 16.3, Expedited Arbitration pursuant to Section 17.1, or
resolution by KOL Panel pursuant to Section 17.2.
17.Certain Disputes.
17.1Baseball Arbitration. If a Party exercises its rights under Section 9.5.3 to
refer a dispute to expedited arbitration (an “Expedited Dispute”), then the
Parties will follow the expedited dispute resolution process in this
Section 17.1 (“Expedited Arbitration”), and not the dispute resolution processes
in Section 16. The Expedited Dispute will be submitted to fast‑track, binding
arbitration in accordance with the following:
17.1.1The arbitration will be conducted in Boston, Massachusetts under the rules
of the AAA for the resolution of commercial disputes in the most expedited
manner permitted by such rules. The Parties will appoint a single, independent,
neutral arbitrator to be selected by mutual agreement. If the Parties are unable
to agree on an arbitrator, the Parties will request that the AAA select the
arbitrator. The arbitrator will be a professional with at least [**] of
experience in the biopharmaceutical and life sciences industries and with
expertise in the structuring of the financial terms of licenses of
biopharmaceutical products. The cost of the arbitration will be borne equally by
the Parties. Except in a proceeding to enforce the results of the arbitration or
as otherwise required by applicable Laws, neither Party nor the arbitrator may
disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration hereunder without
the prior written agreement of the Parties.


- 79 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







17.1.2Within [**] after such matter is referred to arbitration, each Party will
provide the arbitrator with a proposal (which will be a draft of such Party’s
proposed resolution) and written memorandum in support of its position regarding
the Expedited Dispute, as well as any documentary evidence it wishes to provide
in support thereof (each, a “Brief”) and the arbitrator will provide each
Party’s Brief to the other Party after it receives it from each Party.
17.1.3Within [**] after a Party submits its Brief, the other Party will have the
right to respond thereto. The response and any material in support thereof will
be provided to the arbitrator and the other Party.
17.1.4The arbitrator will have the right to meet with the Parties as necessary
to inform the arbitrator’s determination and to conduct independent research and
analysis (but shall not meet with a Party outside the presence of the other
Party). Within [**] after the receipt by the arbitrator of both Parties’
responses (or expiration of the [**] period if any Party fails to submit a
response), the arbitrator will deliver his/her decision regarding the Expedited
Dispute in writing. The sole decision-making authority of the arbitrator shall
be to select the proposed resolution of one of the Parties in its entirety
without modification.
17.2KOL Panel.
17.2.1If a Party exercises its right under Section 2.1.6(b)(i) or
Section 2.1.6(b)(ii) to refer the applicable disputed matter for resolution
pursuant to this Section 17.2, then the matter shall be shall be decided by a
panel of three (3) internationally-renowned key opinion leaders in the Field or
the relevant portion thereof, with each Party appointing one key opinion leader
and the Party-selected key opinion leaders collectively appointing a third key
opinion leader (such key opinion leaders, the “KOL Panel”). Promptly after
selection of the KOL Panel, the KOL Panel shall convene a meeting to consider
the Parties’ respective positions on the matter. The Parties shall mutually
agree on the medium by which each Party may present its position to the KOL
Panel (i.e., in writing and/or orally) and shall establish a reasonable limit on
the length (i.e., page limit and/or duration) of each Party’s presentation.
17.2.2In the case of a matter referred pursuant to Section 2.1.6(b)(i), the sole
questions to be posed to and answered by the KOL Panel are:
(i)Does the proposed continuation or resumption of the applicable Phase 1A/1B
Study or the conduct of the applicable proposed additional Phase 1 Trial pose an
Unacceptable Safety Risk?; and
(ii)If the proposed continuation or resumption of the applicable Phase 1A/1B
Study or the conduct of the applicable proposed additional Phase 1 Trial does
not pose an Unacceptable Safety Risk, does the KOL Panel nevertheless recommend
that any specific modifications to the protocol for the applicable trial be made
or other actions be taken in connection with such trial to reduce risks to
patient safety (“Risk-Minimizing Actions”)?


- 80 -

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------







If the KOL Panel determines that the continuation or resumption of the conduct
of the applicable Phase 1A/1B Study or the conduct of the applicable proposed
additional Phase 1 Trial poses an Unacceptable Safety Risk, then in no event may
Curis continue or resume such Phase 1A/1B Study or conduct such additional
Phase 1 Trial absent ImmuNext’s written agreement. If the KOL Panel determines
that the continuation or resumption of the conduct of the applicable Phase 1A/1B
Study or the conduct of the applicable proposed additional Phase 1 Trial does
not pose an Unacceptable Safety Risk but recommends that specific
Risk-Minimizing Actions be implemented, then Curis may proceed with the
applicable Phase 1A/1B Study or Phase 1 Trial, provided that it implements such
Risk-Minimizing Actions.
17.2.3In the case of a matter referred pursuant to Section 2.1.6(b)(ii), the
sole questions to be posed to and answered by the KOL Panel are:
(a)Did the applicable Phase 1A/1B Study meet any or all of its clinical
endpoints?; and
(b)If the answer to the preceding question is yes, which of the clinical
endpoint(s) of such Phase 1A/1B Study were met?
17.2.4The determination of the KOL Panel shall be final and binding upon the
Parties. The Parties shall share equally the fees and costs of the KOL Panel
members, regardless of the KOL Panel’s ultimate determination.
18.Miscellaneous
18.1Severability. If one or more of the provisions of this Agreement is held to
be invalid or unenforceable, the provision shall be considered severed from this
Agreement and shall not serve to invalidate any remaining provisions hereof. The
Parties shall make a good faith effort to replace any invalid or unenforceable
provision with a valid and enforceable one such that the objectives contemplated
by the Parties when entering this Agreement may be realized.
18.2Notices. Any notice required or permitted to be given by this Agreement
shall be in writing and shall be (a) delivered by hand or by overnight courier
with tracking capabilities or (b) mailed postage prepaid by first class,
registered or certified mail, in each case ((a) and (b)), addressed as set forth
below unless changed by notice so given:

delete or change the person or address to which notices should be sent at any
time upon written notice delivered to the Party’s notices in accordance with
this Section 18.2.
18.3Force Majeure. Neither Party shall be liable for delay or failure in the
performance of any of its obligations hereunder if such delay or failure is due
to causes beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, fires,
earthquakes, acts of war, terrorism, or civil unrest (“Force Majeure”);
provided, however, that the affected Party promptly notifies the other Party and
provided further that the affected Party shall use its Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to avoid or remove such causes of non-performance and to mitigate the
effect of such occurrence, and shall continue to perform its obligations with
the utmost dispatch whenever such causes are removed. When such circumstances
arise, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith any modifications of the terms
of this Agreement that may be necessary or appropriate in order to arrive at an
equitable solution.
18.4Assignment. Except as expressly provided hereunder, neither this Agreement
nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned or otherwise transferred

unreasonably withheld); provided, however, that either Party may assign this
Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder without the other Party’s
consent:
18.4.1in connection with the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of the
business of such Party to which this Agreement relates to a Third Party (“Third
Party Acquirer”), whether by merger, sale of stock, sale of assets,
reorganization, consolidation or otherwise (each, a “Sale Transaction”),
provided that in the event of a Sale Transaction (whether this Agreement is
actually assigned or is assumed by the Third Party Acquirer or the surviving
corporation resulting from such Sale Transaction by operation of law (e.g., in
the context of a reverse triangular merger)), intellectual property rights of
the Third Party Acquirer that existed prior to the Sale Transaction shall not be
included in the technology licensed hereunder or otherwise subject to this
Agreement; or
18.4.2to an Affiliate of such Party, provided that the assigning Party shall
remain liable and responsible to the non‑assigning Party hereto for the
performance and observance of all such duties and obligations by such Affiliate.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding on the Parties’ successors and assigns. Any assignment or transfer in
violation of the foregoing shall be null and void and wholly invalid, the
assignee or transferee in any such assignment or transfer shall acquire no
rights whatsoever, and the non-assigning, non-transferring Party shall not
recognize, or be required to recognize, such assignment or transfer.
18.5Waivers and Modifications. The failure of any Party to insist on the
performance of any obligation hereunder shall not be deemed to be a waiver of
such obligation. Waiver of any breach of any provision hereof shall not be
deemed to be a waiver of any other breach of such provision or any other
provision on such occasion or any succeeding occasion. No waiver, modification,
release or amendment of any obligation under or provision of this Agreement
shall be valid or effective unless in writing and signed by both Parties.
18.6Choice of Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, enforced and construed
in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York without regard to any
conflicts of law provision that would result in the application of the Laws of
any State other than the State of New York.
18.7Relationship of the Parties. Each Party is an independent contractor under
this Agreement. Nothing contained herein is intended or is to be construed so as
to constitute ImmuNext and Curis as partners, agents or joint venturers. Neither
Party shall have any express or implied right or authority to assume or create
any obligations on behalf of or in the name of the other Party or to bind the
other Party to any contract, agreement or undertaking with any Third Party.
Upstream Licensor 4 is a Third Party beneficiary of this Agreement. Except for
Upstream Licensor 4, there are no other express or implied Third Party
beneficiaries hereunder.

schedules, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties as to the
subject matter of

this Agreement, and supersedes and merges all prior and contemporaneous
negotiations, representations, agreements and understandings regarding the same.
18.9Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counter-parts with the same
effect as if both Parties had signed the same document. All such counterparts
shall be deemed an original, shall be construed together and shall constitute
one and the same instrument. Signatures to this Agreement transmitted by
facsimile, by email in “portable document format” (“.pdf”), or by any other
electronic means intended to preserve the original graphic and pictorial

the paper document bearing original signature.
18.10Further Assurances. Each Party agrees, at its own expense, to do, or
procure the doing of, all such further acts and things and shall execute and
deliver such other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents as are
reasonably necessary in order to give full effect to this Agreement.

negotiations each of them has been represented by competent counsel and that the
final agreement contained herein, including the language whereby it has been

this Agreement shall not be construed against any Party, irrespective of which

and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever the context may require, any
pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms.
The word “will” shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the
word “shall.” The word “any” shall mean “any and all” unless otherwise clearly
indicated by context. The word “including” will be construed as “including
without limitation.” The word “or” is disjunctive but not necessarily exclusive.
18.11.3Unless the context requires otherwise, (a) any definition of or reference
to any agreement, instrument or other document herein shall be construed as
referring to such agreement, instrument or other document as from time to time
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified (subject to any restrictions on such
amendments, supplements or modifications set forth herein or therein), (b) any
