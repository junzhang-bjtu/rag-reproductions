        13



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SECTION 1.7 Assignment of Leases and Rents. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, (a) each Grantor hereby presently and effectively grants, sells,
conveys, sets over, transfers and assigns to the Beneficiary and its successors
and assigns, all of its right title and interest in the Leases, together with
any and all extensions and renewals thereof to Deed of Trust Trustee for
purposes of securing and discharging the performance by the Grantors of the
Secured Obligations. No Grantor has assigned or executed any assignment of, and
will not assign or execute any assignment of, any Leases or the Rents payable
thereunder to anyone other than to Beneficiary.
(b) To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, and subject to Section
1.7(c), each Grantor has assigned and transferred to Beneficiary all of such
Grantor’s right, title and interest in and to the Rents now or hereafter arising
from each Lease heretofore or hereafter made or agreed to by such Grantor, it
being intended that this assignment shall constitute, subject to Section 1.7(c),
a collateral transfer and assignment of all Rents and all Leases to Beneficiary
and not an assignment for additional security only. To the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law, and subject to Section 1.7(c), so long as an Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Beneficiary may in any
Grantor’s name and stead (with or without first taking possession of any of the
Mortgage Estate personally or by receiver as provided herein) operate the
Mortgage Estate and rent, lease or let all or any portion of any of the Mortgage
Estate to any party or parties at such rental and upon such terms as Beneficiary
shall, in its sole and reasonable discretion, determine, and may collect and
have the benefit of all of said Rents arising from or accruing at any time
thereafter or that may thereafter become due under any Lease in accordance with
the Indenture or the Senior Loan Agreement;
(c) So long as an Event of Default shall not have occurred and be continuing,
Beneficiary will not exercise any of its rights under Section 1.7(b), and
Grantors shall receive and collect the Rents accruing under any Lease; but after
the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Beneficiary
may immediately, at its option, receive and collect all Rents and enter upon the
Premises and Improvements through its officers, agents, employees or attorneys
for such purpose and for the operation and maintenance thereof. Such failure by
Beneficiary to exercise its rights immediately shall not in any way waive the
Beneficiary’s rights to receive any Rents, or to make any such demand, or to
affect any such assignments as to any Rents not delivered directly to the
Beneficiary. In this regard, if any of the Rents are paid or delivered direct to
Beneficiary and then, at the request of the Beneficiary, the Rents are, for a
period or periods of time, paid or delivered directly to either Grantor,
Beneficiary shall nevertheless have the right, effective upon written notice, to
require that future Rents be again paid or delivered directly to it. Each
Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs each tenant, if any, and each
successor, if any, to the interest of any tenant under any Lease, respectively,
to rely upon any notice of a claimed Event of Default sent by Beneficiary to any
such tenant or any of such tenant’s successors in interest, and thereafter to
pay Rents to Beneficiary without any obligation or right to inquire as to
whether an Event of Default actually exists and even if some notice to the
contrary is received from the applicable Grantor, who shall have no right or
claim against any such tenant or successor in interest for any such Rents so
paid to Beneficiary. Each tenant or any of such tenant’s successors in interest
from whom Beneficiary or any officer, agent, attorney or employee of Beneficiary
shall have collected any Rents, shall
        14



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



be authorized to pay Rents to the applicable Grantor only after such tenant or
any of their successors in interest shall have received written notice from
Beneficiary that the Event of Default is no longer continuing, unless and until
a further notice of an Event of Default is given by Beneficiary to such tenant
or any of its successors in interest.
(d) Independently of the foregoing provisions and authorities herein granted, if
an Event of Default shall be continuing, the applicable Grantor shall execute
and deliver, any and all Rents that may be requested by the Beneficiary to
effect payment or delivery of the Rents directly to the Beneficiary in
accordance with this Section 1.7. If, pursuant to any existing contract, any
Rents are required to be paid or delivered by any tenant directly to a Grantor
so that under such existing contracts the Rents cannot be paid or delivered
directly to the Beneficiary in the absence of foreclosure, then, if the
Beneficiary has requested that the Rents be paid or delivered directly to it
under the assignment herein contained, the Rents that for any reason must be
paid or delivered to the applicable Grantor shall, when received by such
Grantor, constitute trust funds in such Grantor’s hands and shall be immediately
paid over by such Grantor to the Beneficiary.
(e) The Beneficiary is hereby absolved from all liability for failure to enforce
collection of the Rents assigned under Section 1.7 hereof and from all other
responsibility in connection therewith, except the responsibility to account (by
application upon the Secured Obligations or otherwise) for funds actually
received. If the Beneficiary receives monies in excess of the amount of the
Rents to which a Grantor is entitled, the Beneficiary will make a reasonable
effort to pay any such excess monies of which the Beneficiary is aware to the
other parties legally entitled thereto; provided that each Grantor agrees to
indemnify and hold Trustee and the Beneficiary harmless against any and all
liabilities, actions, claims, judgments, costs, charges and attorneys’ fees by
reason of the assertion that they or either of them have received, either before
or after payment and performance in full of the Secured Obligations or any other
Rents in which a Person claims an adverse interest.
(f) Neither Deed of Trust Trustee nor Beneficiary will become a party in
possession so long as it does not enter or take actual possession of the
Mortgage Estate. In addition, neither Deed of Trust Trustee nor Beneficiary
shall be responsible or liable for performing any of the obligations of the
landlord under any Lease, for any waste by any tenant, or others, for any
dangerous or defective conditions of any of the Mortgage Estate, for negligence
in the management, upkeep, repair or control of any of the Mortgage Estate or
any other act or omission by any other person. The rights of the Beneficiary
pursuant hereto shall be cumulative of all other security of any and every
character now or hereafter existing to secure the payment of the Secured
Obligations. Rents received under this Section 1.7 assignment shall be applied
as set forth in the Collateral Agency Agreement. The Beneficiary may, in its
sole discretion, permit the Rents its received by it to be returned to the
applicable Grantor (rather than applied to the Secured Obligations) for use in
such Grantor’s operations.
(g) TO THE EXTENT OF ANY INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE TERMS OF THIS DEED OF TRUST
AND THE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS ACT, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE ASSIGNMENT OF
RENTS ACT SHALL CONTROL

of Default, the Beneficiary shall be entitled with respect to the Personalty, to
exercise all remedies hereunder or available under the UCC with respect thereto
and all other remedies available under applicable law, and, without limiting the
foregoing, all or any portion of the Personalty, may, at the Beneficiary’s
option, (i) be sold hereunder together with any sale of any portion of the
Mortgage Estate or otherwise, (ii) be sold separately pursuant to the UCC, or
(iii) be dealt with by the Beneficiary in any other manner permitted under
applicable law. The Beneficiary may require the applicable Grantor to assemble
all or any portion of the Personalty, and make it available to the Beneficiary
at a place to be designated by the Beneficiary. Each Grantor acknowledges and
agrees that a disposition of such Personalty collateral in accordance with the
Beneficiary’s rights and remedies in respect to the Mortgage Estate as
heretofore provided is a commercially reasonable disposition thereof; provided,
however, that the Beneficiary shall give the applicable Grantor not less than
ten (10) days’ prior notice of the time and place of any intended disposition.

sale, either as a whole or in separate lots, parcels or items as Deed of Trust
Trustee or Beneficiary shall deem expedient, and in such order as it may
determine, at public auction to the highest bidder. Deed of Trust Trustee or
Beneficiary or an officer appointed by a judgment of foreclosure to sell the
Mortgage Estate may postpone any foreclosure or other sale of all or any portion
of the Mortgage Estate by public announcement at such time and place of sale,
and from time to time thereafter may postpone such sale by public announcement
or subsequently noticed sale. Without further notice, Deed of Trust Trustee or
Beneficiary or an officer appointed to sell the Mortgage Estate may make such
sale at the time fixed by the last postponement, or may, in its discretion, give
a new notice of sale. Any person, including Grantors, Deed of Trust Trustee or
Beneficiary or any designee or affiliate thereof, may purchase at such sale.
(b) The Mortgage Estate may be sold subject to unpaid taxes and Permitted
Encumbrances, and, after deducting all costs, fees and expenses of Deed of Trust
Trustee or Beneficiary (including costs of evidence of title in connection with
the sale), Deed of Trust Trustee or Beneficiary or an officer that makes any
sale shall apply the proceeds of sale in the manner set forth in Section 2.8.
(c) Any foreclosure or other sale of less than the whole of the Mortgage Estate
or any defective or irregular sale made hereunder shall not exhaust the power of
foreclosure or of sale provided for herein; and subsequent sales may be made
hereunder until the Secured Obligations have been satisfied, or the entirety of
the Mortgage Estate has been sold.
(d) If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, Beneficiary (or Deed
of Trust Trustee at the direction of Beneficiary as so required by applicable
law), may instead of, or in addition to, exercising the rights described in
Section 2.6(a) above and either with or without entry or taking possession as
herein permitted, proceed by a suit or suits in law or in equity or by any other
appropriate proceeding or remedy (i) to specifically enforce payment of some or
all of the Secured Obligations, or the performance of any term, covenant,
condition or
        21



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



agreement of this Deed of Trust or any other right, or (ii) to pursue any other
remedy available to Beneficiary, all as Beneficiary shall determine most
effectual for such purposes.
SECTION 2.7 Other Remedies.
(a) In case an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, Beneficiary (or
Deed of Trust Trustee at the direction of Beneficiary as so required by
applicable law) may also exercise, to the extent not prohibited by law, any or
all of the remedies available to a secured party under the UCC.
(b) In connection with a sale of the Mortgage Estate and the application of the
proceeds of sale as provided in Section 2.8, Beneficiary (or Deed of Trust
Trustee at the direction of Beneficiary as so required by applicable law) shall
be entitled to enforce payment of and to receive up to the principal amount of
the Secured Obligations, including, without limitation, all other charges,
payments and costs due under this Deed of Trust, and to recover a deficiency
judgment for any portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Secured
Obligations remaining unpaid, with interest in accordance with the Indenture.
SECTION 2.8 Application of Sale Proceeds and Rents. After any foreclosure sale
of all or any of the Mortgage Estate, Beneficiary (or the receiver, if one is
appointed) shall receive and apply the proceeds of the sale together with any
Rents that may have been collected and any other sums that then may be held by
Beneficiary under this Deed of Trust in the same manner as the proceeds of the
Collateral are to be applied pursuant to Section 9.08 of the Collateral Agency
Agreement. Each Grantor and any other party liable on the Secured Obligations
and the Secured Obligations shall be liable for any deficiency remaining in the
Secured Obligations and Secured Obligations subsequent to the sale referenced in
this Section 2.
Upon any sale of the Mortgage Estate by the Deed of Trust Trustee or Beneficiary
(including pursuant to a power of sale granted by statute or under a judicial
proceeding), the receipt of the purchase money by the Beneficiary (or Deed of
Trust Trustee at the direction of Beneficiary as so required by applicable law)
or of the officer making the sale shall be a sufficient discharge to the
purchaser or purchasers of the Mortgage Estate so sold and such purchaser or
purchasers shall not be obligated to see to the application of any part of the
purchase money paid over to the Beneficiary or such officer or be answerable in
any way for the misapplication thereof.
SECTION 2.9 Grantor as Tenant Holding Over. If a Grantor remains in possession
of any of the Mortgage Estate after any foreclosure sale by Deed of Trust
Trustee or Beneficiary, at Beneficiary’s election such Grantor shall be deemed a
tenant holding over and shall forthwith surrender possession to the purchaser or
purchasers at such sale or be summarily dispossessed or evicted according to
provisions of law applicable to tenants holding over.
SECTION 2.10 Waiver of Appraisement, Valuation, Stay, Extension and Redemption
Laws. Each Grantor waives, to the extent not prohibited by law, (i) the benefit
of all laws now existing or that hereafter may be enacted (x) providing for any
appraisement or valuation of any portion of the Mortgage Estate and/or (y) in
any way extending the time for the enforcement or the collection of amounts due
under any of the Secured Obligations or creating or
        22



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



extending a period of redemption from any sale made in collecting said debt or
any other amounts due to Deed of Trust Trustee or Beneficiary, (ii) any right to
at any time insist upon, plead, claim or take the benefit or advantage of any
law now or hereafter in force providing for any homestead exemption, stay,
statute of limitations, extension or redemption, or sale of the Mortgage Estate
as separate tracts, units or estates or as a single parcel in the event of
foreclosure or notice of deficiency, and (iii) all rights of redemption,
valuation, appraisement, stay of execution, notice of election to mature or
declare due the whole of or each of the Secured Obligations and marshaling in
the event of foreclosure of this Deed of Trust; provided that the appraisement
of any of the Mortgage Estate is hereby expressly waived or not waived at the
option of Deed of Trust Trustee or Beneficiary, such option to be exercised
prior to or at the time judgment is rendered in any foreclosure of this
instrument.
SECTION 2.11 Discontinuance of Proceedings. In case Deed of Trust Trustee or
Beneficiary shall proceed to enforce any right, power or remedy under this Deed
of Trust by foreclosure, entry or otherwise, and such proceedings shall be
discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall be determined adversely to
Deed of Trust Trustee or Beneficiary, then and in every such case each Grantor,
Deed of Trust Trustee and Beneficiary shall be restored to their former
positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, powers and remedies of each
Grantor, Deed of Trust Trustee and Beneficiary shall continue as if no such
proceeding had been taken.
SECTION 2.12 Suits To Protect the Mortgage Estate. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, Beneficiary (or Deed of Trust
Trustee at the direction of Beneficiary as so required by applicable law) shall
have power (a) to institute and maintain suits and proceedings to prevent any
impairment of the Mortgage Estate by any acts that may be unlawful or in
violation of this Deed of Trust, (b) to preserve or protect its interest in the
Mortgage Estate and in the Rents arising therefrom and (c) to restrain the
enforcement of or compliance with any legislation or other governmental
enactment, rule or order that may be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid if
the enforcement of or compliance with such enactment, rule or order would impair
the security or be prejudicial to the interest of Deed of Trust Trustee and/or
Beneficiary hereunder.
SECTION 2.13 Filing Proofs of Claim. In case of any receivership, insolvency,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
proceedings affecting a Grantor, Beneficiary (or Deed of Trust Trustee at the
direction of Beneficiary as so required by applicable law) shall, to the extent
permitted by law, be entitled to file such proofs of claim and other documents
as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of Beneficiary
allowed in such proceedings for the Secured Obligations secured by this Deed of
Trust at the date of the institution of such proceedings and for any interest
accrued, late charges and additional interest or other amounts due or that may
become due and payable hereunder after such date.
SECTION 2.14 Waiver.
(a) No delay or failure by Deed of Trust Trustee and/or Beneficiary to exercise
any right, power or remedy accruing upon any breach or Event of Default shall
exhaust or impair any such right, power or remedy or be construed to be a waiver
of any such breach or
        23



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Event of Default or acquiescence therein; and every right, power and remedy
given by this Deed of Trust to Deed of Trust Trustee or Beneficiary may be
exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient by Deed of
Trust Trustee or Beneficiary. No consent or waiver by Beneficiary to or of any
breach or Event of Default by any Grantor in the performance of the Secured
Obligations shall be deemed or construed to be a consent or waiver to or of any
other breach or Event of Default in the performance of the same or of any other
Secured Obligations by such Grantor hereunder. No failure on the part of Deed of
Trust Trustee or Beneficiary to complain of any act or failure to act or to
declare an Event of Default, irrespective of how long such failure continues,
shall constitute a waiver by Deed of Trust Trustee or Beneficiary of their
respective rights hereunder or impair any rights, powers or remedies consequent
on any future Event of Default by such Grantor.
(b) Even if Beneficiary (i) grants some forbearance or an extension of time for
the payment of any sums secured hereby, (ii) takes other or additional security
for the payment of any sums secured hereby, (iii) waives or does not exercise
some right granted herein, (iv) releases a part of the Mortgage Estate from this
Deed of Trust, (v) agrees to change some of the terms, covenants, conditions or
agreements of the Facilities Lease or the Ground Lease, (vi) consents to the
filing of a map, plat or replat affecting the Premises, (vii) consents to the
granting of an easement or other right affecting the Premises or (viii) makes or
consents to an agreement subordinating the lien hereof on the Mortgage Estate,
no such act or omission shall preclude Deed of Trust Trustee or Beneficiary from
exercising any other right, power or privilege herein granted or intended to be
granted in the event of any breach or Event of Default then made or of any
subsequent default; nor, except as otherwise expressly provided in an instrument
executed by Beneficiary, shall this Deed of Trust be altered thereby. In the
event of the sale or transfer by operation of law or otherwise of all or part of
the Mortgage Estate, Beneficiary (or Deed of Trust Trustee at the direction of
Beneficiary as so required by applicable law) is hereby authorized and empowered
to deal with any vendee or transferee with reference to the Mortgage Estate
secured hereby, or with reference to any of the terms, covenants, conditions or
agreements hereof, as fully and to the same extent as it might deal with the
original parties hereto and without in any way releasing or discharging any
liabilities, obligations or undertakings.
SECTION 2.15 Waiver of Trial by Jury. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS DEED OF TRUST. EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT
AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS DEED OF TRUST
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION
2.15.
SECTION 2.16 Remedies Cumulative. No right, power or remedy conferred upon or
reserved to Deed of Trust Trustee or Beneficiary by this Deed of Trust is
intended to be
        24



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



exclusive of any other right, power or remedy, and each and every such right,
power and remedy shall be cumulative and concurrent and in addition to any other
right, power and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or
in equity or by statute.

contained in this Deed of Trust shall for any reason be held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect or impair any other provision of this Deed of
Trust, and this Deed of Trust shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision had never been contained herein or therein, and the
parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provision with valid provisions the economic effect of

        25

of the Indenture, Section 24 of the Facilities Lease, Section 9.05 of the Senior
Loan Agreement or Article XII and Section 7.08 of the Collateral Agency

that is prohibited to Grantors hereunder is also prohibited to all lessees of
any of the Mortgage Estate. For the term of this Deed of Trust, each appointment
of Deed of Trust Trustee or Beneficiary as attorney-in-fact for the Grantors
under this Deed of Trust is irrevocable, with power of substitution and coupled
with an interest. Subject to the applicable provisions hereof, Beneficiary has
the right to refuse to grant its consent, approval or acceptance or to indicate
its satisfaction, in its sole discretion, whenever such consent, approval,
acceptance or satisfaction is required hereunder.

BENEFICIARY’S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT). The foregoing indemnity
shall not terminate upon release, foreclosure or other termination of this Deed
of Trust.
SECTION 3.8 Joint and Several Liability of Grantors. Anything to the contrary
notwithstanding all obligations of Grantors herein and, unless otherwise
specifically stated (and in such case, only to the extent so stated) under the

faithfully to perform and fulfill the trusts herein created, being liable,
however, only for gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, and hereby
waives any statutory fee and agrees to accept reasonable compensation, in lieu
thereof, for any services rendered by it in accordance with the terms thereof.
All authorities, powers and discretions given in this Deed of Trust to the Deed
of Trust Trustee and/or the Beneficiary may be exercised by either, without the
other, with the same effect as if exercised jointly.
SECTION 4.2 The Deed of Trust Trustee may resign at any time upon giving thirty
(30) days’ notice in writing to the Grantors and to the Beneficiary;
SECTION 4.3 The Beneficiary may remove the Deed of Trust Trustee at any time or

the death, removal, resignation, refusal to act, in-ability to act or absence of
the Deed of Trust Trustee from the state in which the Premises are located, or
in its sole discretion for any reason whatsoever. The Beneficiary may, upon
notice to the Grantors and without specifying the reason therefore and without
applying to any court, select and appoint a successor deed of trust trustee, and
all powers, rights, duties and authority of the former deed of trust trustee, as
aforesaid, shall thereupon become vested in such successor. Such substitute deed
of trust trustee shall not be required to give bond for the faithful performance
of his duties unless required by the Beneficiary. Such substitute deed of trust
trustee shall be appointed by written instrument duly recorded in the county
where the Land is located. Each Grantor hereby ratifies and confirms any and all
acts that the herein named Deed of Trust Trustee, or his successor or successors
in this trust, shall do lawfully by virtue hereof. Each Grantor hereby agrees,
on behalf of itself and its heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, that
the recitals contained in any deed or deeds
        27



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



executed in due form by any Deed of Trust Trustee or substitute deed of trust
trustee, acting under the provisions of this instrument, shall be prima facie
evidence of the facts recited, and that it shall not be necessary to prove in
any court, otherwise than by such recitals, the existence of the facts essential
to authorize the execution and delivery of such deed or deeds and the passing of
title thereby;
SECTION 4.4 The Deed of Trust Trustee shall not be required to see that this
Deed of Trust is recorded nor liable for its validity or its priority as a first
deed of trust, or otherwise, nor shall the Deed of Trust Trustee be answerable
or responsible for performance or observance of the covenants and agreements
imposed upon the Grantors or the Beneficiary by this Deed of Trust or any other
agreement. The Deed of Trust Trustee, as well as the Beneficiary, shall have
authority in their respective discretion to employ agents and attorneys in the
execution of this trust and to protect the interest of the Beneficiary
hereunder, and to the fullest extent permitted by law they shall be compensated
and all expenses relating to the employment of such agents and/or attorneys,
including expenses of litigation, shall be paid out of the proceeds of the sale
of the Mortgage Estate conveyed hereby should a sale be had, but if no such sale
be had, all stuns so paid out shall be recoverable to the fullest extent
permitted by law by all remedies at law or in equity; and
SECTION 4.5 At any time, or from time to time, without liability therefore and
with ten (10) days’ prior written notice to the Grantors, upon written request
of the Beneficiary and with-out affecting the effect of this Deed of Trust upon
the remainder of the Mortgage Estate, the Deed of Trust Trustee may (A) reconvey
any part of the Mortgage Estate, (B) consent in writing to the making of any map
or plat thereof, so long as each Grantor has consented thereto, (C) join in
granting any easement thereon, so long as each Grantor has consented thereto, or
(D) join in any extension agreement or any agreement subordinating the lien or
charge hereof.
ARTICLE V.
Mortgaged Leases and Easements
This Deed of Trust is subject to the following provisions relating to the
particular laws of the state wherein the Premises are located:
SECTION 5.1 Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Each Grantor represents
and warrants to the Beneficiary that (a) the Mortgaged Leases and the Easements
are unmodified and in full force and effect, (b) all rent and other charges
therein have been paid to the extent they are payable to the date hereof, (c)
such Grantor enjoys the quiet and peaceful possession of the property demised
thereby, (d) such Grantor is not in default under any of the terms thereof and
there are no circumstances which, with the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both, would constitute an event of default thereunder, and (e) the
Lessor thereunder is not in default in any material respect under any of the
terms or provisions thereof on the part of the Lessor to be observed or
performed (but this statement is made for the benefit of and may only be relied
upon by the Beneficiary and Secured Parties). Each Grantor shall promptly pay,
when due and payable, the rent and other charges payable pursuant to the
Mortgaged Leases and the Easements, and will timely perform and observe all of
the other terms, covenants and
        28



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



conditions required to be performed and observed by such Grantor as lessee under
the Mortgaged Leases or the Easements. Each Grantor shall notify the Beneficiary
in writing of any default by such Grantor in the performance or observance of
any terms, covenants or conditions on the part of such Grantor to be performed
or observed under the Mortgaged Leases or the Easements within ten (10) days
after such Grantor knows of such default. Each Grantor shall, promptly following
the receipt thereof, deliver a copy of any notice of default given to such
Grantor by the Lessor pursuant to the Mortgaged Leases or the Easements and
promptly notify the Beneficiary in writing of any default by the Lessor in the
performance or observance of any of the terms, covenants or conditions on the
part of the Lessor to be performed or observed thereunder. Unless required under
the terms of the Mortgaged Leases or the Easements, except as restricted by the
Indenture or the Senior Loan Agreement, no Grantor shall, without the prior
written consent of the Beneficiary (which may be granted or withheld in the
Beneficiary’s sole and absolute discretion) (i) terminate, or surrender the
Mortgaged Leases or the Easements, or (ii) enter into any modification of the
Mortgaged Leases or the Easements in violation of Article 10 of the Indenture,
Section 24 of the Facilities Lease, Section 9.05 of the Senior Loan Agreement or
Article XII and Section 7.08 of the Collateral Agency Agreement, and any such
attempted termination, modification or surrender without the Beneficiary’s
written consent shall be void. Each Grantor shall, within thirty (30) days after
written request from the Beneficiary, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain from the Lessor and deliver to the Beneficiary a certificate setting
forth the name of the Tenant thereunder and stating that the Mortgaged Leases
and the Easements are in full force and effect, is unmodified or, if the
Mortgaged Leases or the Easements have been modified, the date of each
modification (together with copies of each such modification), that no notice of
termination thereof has been served on such Grantor, stating that to the best of
Lessor’s knowledge, no default or event which with notice or lapse of time (or
both) would become a default is existing under the Mortgaged Leases or the
Easements, stating the date to which rent has been paid, and specifying the
nature of any defaults, if any, and containing such other statements and
representations as may be reasonably requested by the Beneficiary.
SECTION 5.2 No Merger; Acquisition; Power of Attorney. So long as any of the
Secured Obligations remain unpaid or unperformed, the fee title to and the
leasehold estate in the Premises subject to the Mortgaged Leases and the
Easements shall not merge but shall always be kept separate and distinct
notwithstanding the union of such estates in the Lessor or the Grantors, or in a
third party, by purchase or otherwise. If any Grantor acquires the fee title or
any other estate, title or interest in the property demised by the Mortgaged
Leases or the Easements, or any part thereof, or any part of the Leasehold Deed
of Trust, the lien of this Deed of Trust shall attach to, cover and be a lien
upon such acquired estate, title or interest and the same shall thereupon be and
become a part of the Mortgage Estate with the same force and effect as if
specifically encumbered herein. Each Grantor agrees to execute all instruments
and documents that the Beneficiary may reasonably require to ratify, confirm and
further evidence the lien of this Deed of Trust on the acquired estate, title or
interest. Furthermore, each Grantor hereby appoints the Beneficiary as its true
and lawful attorney-in-fact to execute and deliver, following the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, all such instruments and
documents in the name and on behalf of such Grantor. This power, being coupled
with an interest, shall be irrevocable as long as any portion of the Secured
Obligations remains unpaid.
        29



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SECTION 5.3 New Leases. If the Mortgaged Leases or any Easement shall be
terminated prior to the natural expiration of its term due to default by the
applicable Grantor or any Tenant thereunder, and if, pursuant to the provisions
of the Mortgaged Leases or any Easement, the Beneficiary or its designee shall
acquire from the Lessor a new lease of the Premises subject to the Mortgaged
Leases or the Easements, such Grantor shall have no right, title or interest in
or to such new lease or the leasehold estate created thereby, or renewal
privileges therein contained.
SECTION 5.4 No Assignment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, this Deed of Trust shall not constitute an assignment of the Mortgaged
Leases or the Easements within the meaning of any provision thereof prohibiting
its assignment and the Beneficiary shall have no liability or obligation
thereunder by reason of its acceptance of this Deed of Trust. The Beneficiary
shall be liable for the obligations of the Tenant arising out of the Mortgaged
Leases and the Easements for only that period of time for which the Beneficiary
is in possession of the Premises demised thereunder or has acquired, by
foreclosure or otherwise, and is holding all of the Grantor’s right, title and
interest therein.
SECTION 5.5 Treatment of Mortgaged Leases and Easements In Bankruptcy.
(i) If any Landlord or grantor under the Mortgaged Leases or the Easements
rejects or disaffirms, or seeks or purports to reject or disaffirm, such
Mortgaged Leases or such Easements pursuant to any Bankruptcy Law, then the
applicable Grantor shall not exercise the 365(h) Election except as otherwise
provided in this paragraph. To the extent permitted by law, the applicable
Grantor shall not suffer or permit the termination of the Mortgaged Leases or
the Easements by exercise of the 365(h) Election or otherwise without the
Beneficiary’s consent. The Grantors acknowledge that because the Mortgaged
Leases and the Easements are a primary element of the Beneficiary’s security for
the Secured Obligations, it is not anticipated that the Beneficiary would
consent to termination of the Mortgaged Leases or the Easements. If any Grantor
makes any 365(h) Election in violation of this Deed of Trust, then such 365(h)
Election shall be void and of no force or effect.
(ii) Each Grantor hereby assigns to the Beneficiary the 365(h) Election with
respect to the Mortgaged Leases and the Easements until the Secured Obligations
have been satisfied in full. Each Grantor acknowledges and agrees that the
foregoing assignment of the 365(h) Election and related rights is one of the
rights that the Beneficiary may use at any time to protect and preserve the
Beneficiary’s other rights and interests under this Mortgage. Each Grantor
further acknowledges that exercise of the 365(h) Election in favor of
terminating the Mortgaged Leases or the Easements would constitute waste
prohibited by this Deed of Trust.
(iii) Each Grantor acknowledges that if the 365(h) Election is exercised in
favor of such Grantor’s remaining in possession under the Mortgaged Leases or
the Easements, then such Grantor’s resulting occupancy rights, as adjusted by
the effect of Section 365 of Title II of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy
Code”), shall then be part of the Mortgage Estate and shall be subject to the
lien of this Deed of Trust.
        30



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SECTION 5.6 Rejection of Mortgaged Leases or Easements by Landlord. If a
Landlord under the Mortgaged Leases or the Easements rejects or disaffirms the
Mortgaged Leases or the Easements or purports or seeks to disaffirm such
Mortgaged Leases or the Easements pursuant to any Bankruptcy Law, then:
(i) The applicable Grantor shall remain in possession of the Premises demised
under such Mortgaged Leases or the Easements so rejected or disaffirmed and

jurisdiction and the laying of venue for any suit on this Deed of Trust in the
state where the Premises are located.
SECTION 6.2 Texas Law Provisions.
(a) Waiver of Appraisement. EACH GRANTOR HEREBY WAIVES APPRAISEMENT, OR DOES NOT
WAIVE APPRAISEMENT, AT THE OPTION OF THE BENEFICIARY, TO BE EXERCISED AT ANY
TIME PRIOR TO OR AT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT IN ANY ACTION TO FORECLOSE THIS DEED OF
TRUST. EACH GRANTOR EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT THE DEED OF TRUST TRUSTEE MAY OFFER
THE MORTGAGE ESTATE AS A WHOLE OR IN SUCH PARCELS OR LOTS AS THE BENEFICIARY, IN
ITS SOLE DISCRETION ELECTS, REGARDLESS OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE MORTGAGE
ESTATE MAY BE DESCRIBED. FURTHERMORE, IN THE EVENT AN INTEREST IN ANY OF THE
MORTGAGE ESTATE IS FORECLOSED UPON PURSUANT TO A JUDICIAL OR NON-JUDICIAL
FORECLOSURE SALE, SUCH GRANTOR AGREES AS FOLLOWS: NOTWITHSTANDING THE PROVISIONS
OF SECTIONS 51.003, 51.004, AND 51.005 OF THE TEXAS PROPERTY CODE (AS THE SAME
MAY BE AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME), AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SUCH
GRANTOR AGREES THAT BENEFICIARY OR DEED OF TRUST TRUSTEE, AS THE CASE MAY BE,
SHALL BE ENTITLED TO SEEK A DEFICIENCY JUDGMENT FROM SUCH GRANTOR AND ANY OTHER
PARTY OBLIGATED IN RESPECT OF THE SECURED OBLIGATIONS EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF THE SECURED OBLIGATIONS AND THE AMOUNT FOR WHICH THE
MORTGAGE ESTATE WAS SOLD PURSUANT TO JUDICIAL OR NON-JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE SALE.
EACH GRANTOR EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZES THAT THIS SECTION CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF THE
ABOVE-CITED PROVISIONS OF THE TEXAS PROPERTY CODE WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE PERMIT
SUCH GRANTOR AND OTHER PERSONS AGAINST WHOM RECOVERY OF DEFICIENCIES IS SOUGHT
(EVEN ABSENT THE INITIATION OF DEFICIENCY PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THEM) TO PRESENT
COMPETENT EVIDENCE OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE MORTGAGE ESTATE AS OF THE
DATE OF THE FORECLOSURE SALE AND OFFSET AGAINST ANY DEFICIENCY THE AMOUNT BY
WHICH THE FORECLOSURE SALE PRICE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN SUCH FAIR MARKET
VALUE. EACH GRANTOR FURTHER RECOGNIZES AND AGREES THAT THIS WAIVER CREATES AN
IRREBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION THAT THE FORECLOSURE SALE PRICE IS EQUAL TO THE FAIR
MARKET VALUE OF THE MORTGAGE ESTATE FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING DEFICIENCIES
OWED BY SUCH GRANTOR OR ANY OTHER PERSON AGAINST WHOM RECOVERY OF A DEFICIENCY
IS SOUGHT.
(b) Limitation on Interest. All agreements between the Grantors and Beneficiary,
whether now existing or hereafter arising and whether written or oral, are
hereby limited so that in no contingency, whether by reason of acceleration of
the maturity of any of the Secured Obligations or otherwise, shall the interest
contracted for, charged or received by
        32



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Beneficiary exceed the maximum amount permissible under applicable law. If from
any circumstance whatsoever, interest would otherwise be payable to Beneficiary
in excess of the maximum lawful amount, the interest payable to Beneficiary
shall be reduced to the maximum amount permitted under applicable law; and if
from any circumstance Beneficiary shall ever receive anything of value deemed
interest by applicable law in excess of the maximum lawful amount, an amount
equal to any excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the
principal balance of the Secured Obligations and not to the payment of interest
or, if such excessive interest exceeds the unpaid balance of principal of the
Secured Obligations, such excess shall be refunded to the applicable Grantor.
All interest paid or agreed to be paid to Beneficiary shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated, and spread
throughout the full period until payment in full of the principal of the Secured
Obligations (including the period of any renewal or extension thereof) so that
the interest thereon for such full period shall not exceed the maximum amount
permitted by applicable law. This paragraph shall control all agreements between
the Grantors and Beneficiary. To the extent that Chapter 303 of the Texas
Finance Code is relevant for the purpose of determining the maximum lawful
amount applicable to the Beneficiary, the Beneficiary elects to determine the
applicable rate ceiling under such Chapter by the “weekly ceiling” from time to
time in effect. Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance Code does not apply to the
Grantors’ obligations hereunder.
(c) Intentionally Deleted.
(d) Entire Agreement. THIS DEED OF TRUST AND THE FACILITIES LEASE, AND THE
GROUND LEASE EMBODY THE FINAL, ENTIRE AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO AND
SUPERCEDE ANY AND ALL PRIOR COMMITMENTS, AGREEMENTS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND
UNDERSTANDINGS, WHETHER WRITTEN OR ORAL, RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF
AND THEREOF AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED OR VARIED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS, OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OR DISCUSSIONS OF THE PARTIES
HERETO. THERE ARE NO ORAL AGREEMENTS AMONG THE PARTIES HERETO.
(e) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, then, without limitation to any
other rights or remedies of Beneficiary contained herein, Deed of Trust Trustee
shall be and is hereby authorized and empowered, and it is the Deed of Trust
Trustee’s special duty, when requested so to do by Beneficiary after such
default, to sell the Mortgage Estate covered hereby at public auction to the
highest bidder for cash between the hours of ten o’clock a.m. and four o’clock
p.m. on the first Tuesday, or if the first Tuesday of a month occurs on January
1 or July 4, on the first Wednesday of the month, in any month that is no later
than three (3) hours after the time stated in the notice described below, at the
county court house in the county in which the Mortgage Estate is situated (or,
if the Mortgage Estate is located in more than one county, the sale may be made
at the county courthouse in any county in which the Mortgage Estate is located),
after complying with the statutes and procedures of the State of Texas (the
“State”) governing such sales and after advertising the time, place, and terms
of said sale and the Mortgage Estate to be sold and by posting or causing to be

        33



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

located in more than one county, one notice shall be posted at the courthouse
door of each county in which the Mortgage Estate is located. In addition to such
posting of notice, Beneficiary shall at least twenty-one (21) days preceding the
date of sale file a copy of such notice with the clerk of each county in which
the Mortgage Estate is located and shall serve written notice of the proposed
sale by certified mail on the applicable Grantor and on each other debtor, if
any, obligated to pay the Secured Obligations. Service of such notice shall be
completed upon deposit of the notice enclosed in a postpaid wrapper, properly
addressed to the applicable Grantor and such. other debtors at their most recent
address or addresses as shown by the records of Beneficiary in a post office or
official depository under the care and custody of the United States Postal
Service. The affidavit of any person having knowledge of the facts to the effect
that such service was completed shall be prima facie evidence of the fact of
service. Each Grantor agrees that no notice of any sale other than as set out in
this paragraph need be given by Deed of Trust Trustee, Beneficiary or any other
person. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, notice of
such sale given in accordance with the applicable laws of the State in effect at
the time of such sale shall constitute sufficient notice of such sale. Each
Grantor does hereby authorize and empower said Deed of Trust Trustee and each
and all of his or its successors in this trust, to sell the Mortgage Estate,
together, or in lots or parcels, as Deed of Trust Trustee shall deem expedient.
If the proceeds of the sale of only part of the Mortgage Estate are less than
the sum of the then-outstanding Secured Obligations and all amounts owed under
this Deed of Trust, this Deed of Trust and the lien covering the Mortgage Estate
will remain in full force and effect as to the unsold portion of the Mortgage
Estate. After each sale, the Deed of Trust Trustee will execute and deliver to
the purchaser or purchasers of the Mortgage Estate good and sufficient deeds of
conveyance thereof in the name of the applicable Grantor by fee simple or
leasehold title, as applicable, with covenants of general warranty, and the
title of such purchaser or purchasers, when so made by Deed of Trust Trustee,
each Grantor binds themselves to warrant and forever defend; and to receive the
proceeds of said sale. A purchaser’s obligation is only to deliver the sales
price to the Deed of Trust Trustee, and no purchaser will be responsible for the
proper application of the sales proceeds. The proceeds of any sale held by Deed
of Trust Trustee or any receiver or public officer in foreclosure of the liens
evidenced hereby shall be applied pursuant to Article 7 of the Indenture. The
provisions hereof with respect to the sale of the Mortgage Estate are intended
to comply with the provisions of Section 51.002 of the Property Code of the
State, relating to the sale of collateral after default by a debtor, or by any
other present or subsequent articles or enactments relating to same, and in the
event the requirements, or any notice, under such Section 51.002 of the Property
Code of the State or Chapter 9 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code shall be
eliminated or the prescribed manner of giving such notices modified by future
amendment to, or adoption of any statute superseding, Section 51.002 of the
Property Code of the State, the requirement for such particular notices shall be
deemed stricken from or modified in this instrument in conformity with such
amendment or superseding statute, effective as of the effective date thereof. In
the event any sale of all or any portion of the Mortgage Estate hereunder is not
completed or is defective in the opinion of Beneficiary, such sale shall not
exhaust the power of sale hereunder and Beneficiary shall have the right to
cause a subsequent sale or sales of the Mortgage Estate to be made hereunder.
Any and all statements of fact or other recitals made in any deed or deeds given
by Deed of Trust Trustee or any successor or substitute appointed hereunder as
to nonpayment of the Secured Obligations, or as to the
        34



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



occurrence of any Event of Default, or as to Beneficiary having declared all of
such Secured Obligations to be due and payable, or as to the request to sell, or
as to notice of time, place and terms of sale and of the portions of the
Mortgage Estate to be sold having been duly given, or as to the refusal, failure
or inability to act of Deed of Trust Trustee or any substitute or successor, or
as to the appointment of any substitute or successor trustee, or as to any other
act or thing having been duly done by Beneficiary or by such Deed of Trust
Trustee, substitute or successor, shall be taken as conclusive (absent manifest
error) evidence of the truth of the facts so stated and recited. Deed of Trust
Trustee, his successor or substitute, may appoint or delegate any one or more
persons as agent to perform any act or acts necessary or incident to any sale
held by Deed of Trust Trustee, including the mailing and posting of notices, but
in the name and on behalf of Deed of Trust Trustee, his successor or substitute.
