the meanings specified below:
“ABR”, when used in reference to any Loan or Borrowing, refers to whether such
Loan, or Loans comprising such Borrowing, are bearing interest at a rate
determined by reference to the Alternate Base Rate.
“Adjusted LIBO Rate” means, with respect to any Eurodollar Borrowing for any
Interest Period, an interest rate per annum (rounded upwards, if necessary, to
the next 1/16 of 1%) equal to (a) the LIBO Rate for such Interest Period
multiplied by (b) the Statutory Reserve Rate.
“Administrative Agent” means Wells Fargo Bank, National Association in its
capacity as administrative agent for the Lenders hereunder.
“Administrative Questionnaire” means an Administrative Questionnaire in a form
supplied by the Administrative Agent.
“Affected Financial Institution” means (a) any EEA Financial Institution or (b)
any UK Financial Institution.
“Affiliate” means, with respect to a specified Person, another Person that
directly, or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, Controls or is
Controlled by or is under common Control with the Person specified.
“Agreement” means this 364-Day Credit Agreement, as the same may be amended,
modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time to time.
“Alternate Base Rate” means, for any day, a rate per annum equal to the greatest
of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Funds Effective
Rate in effect on such day plus ½ of 1%, or (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for a one
month Interest Period on such day (or if such day is not a Business Day, the
immediately preceding Business Day) plus 1%, provided that, for the avoidance of
doubt, the Adjusted LIBO Rate for any day shall be based on the rate appearing
on the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page (or on any successor or substitute page of
such service, or any successor to or substitute for such service, providing rate
quotations comparable to those currently provided on such page of such service,
as determined by the Administrative Agent from time to time for purposes of
providing quotations of interest rates applicable to dollar deposits in the
London interbank market) at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such day.
If the Alternate Base Rate as determined pursuant to the foregoing would be less
than 1.75%, such rate shall be deemed to be 1.75% for purposes of this
Agreement. Any change in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Prime
Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or the
1
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Adjusted LIBO Rate shall be effective from and including the effective date of
such change in the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or the Adjusted
LIBO Rate, respectively.
“Anti-Corruption Laws” means all state or federal laws, rules, and regulations
applicable to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries from time to time
concerning bribery, money laundering or corruption, including, without
limitation, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended,
and the rules and regulations thereunder.
“Applicable Margin” means, for any day, with respect to any ABR Loan or any
Eurodollar Loan, or with respect to the commitment fees payable hereunder, as
the case may be, the Applicable Margin per annum set forth below under the
caption “ABR Spread”, “Eurodollar Spread” or “Commitment Fee Rate”, as the case
may be, based upon the ratings by Moody’s and S&P, respectively, applicable on
such date to the Index Debt:
Index Debt Ratings
Commitment Fee RateEurodollar SpreadABR SpreadCategory 1
≥ Baa1/BBB+0.300%1.500%0.500%Category 2
Baa2/BBB0.375%1.750%0.750%
Category 3
< Baa3/BBB-
0.450%2.125%1.125%

For purposes of the foregoing, if both Moody’s and S&P shall not have in effect
a rating for the Index Debt (other than by reason of the circumstances referred
to in the last sentence of this definition), then such agencies shall be deemed
to have established a rating in Category 3. If the ratings established or deemed
to have been established by Moody’s and S&P for the Index Debt shall fall within
different Categories, the Applicable Margin shall be based on the higher of the
two ratings, unless one of the two ratings is two or more Categories lower than
the other, in which case the Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference
to the Category next above that of the lower of the two ratings; provided,
however, that if only one of Moody’s and S&P shall have established a rating,
then the Applicable Margin shall be determined by reference to such available
rating. If the ratings established or deemed to have been established by Moody’s
and S&P for the Index Debt shall be changed (other than as a result of a change
in the rating system of Moody’s and S&P), such change shall be effective as of
the date on which it is first announced by the applicable rating agency,
irrespective of when notice of such change shall have been furnished by the
Borrower to the Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Section 5.01 or otherwise.
Each change in the Applicable Margin shall apply during the period commencing on
the effective date of such change and ending on the date immediately preceding
the effective date of the next such change. If the rating system of Moody’s or
S&P shall change, or if either such rating agency shall cease to be in the
business of rating corporate debt obligations, the Borrower and the Lenders
shall negotiate in good faith to amend this definition to reflect such changed
rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating agency and,
pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the Applicable Margin shall be
determined by reference to the rating of such agency most recently in effect
prior to such change or cessation.
“Applicable Percentage” means, with respect to any Lender, the percentage of the
Commitments represented by such Lender’s Commitment. If the Commitments have
terminated or expired, the Applicable Percentages shall be determined based upon
the Commitments most recently in effect, giving effect to any assignments.

their affiliates (other than through liquidation, administration or other
insolvency proceedings).

(which may include Term SOFR) that has been selected by the Administrative Agent
and the Borrower giving due consideration to (i) any selection or recommendation
of a replacement rate or the mechanism for determining such a rate by the
Relevant Governmental Body or (ii) any evolving or then-prevailing market
convention for determining a rate of interest as a replacement to the LIBO Rate
for U.S. dollar-denominated syndicated credit facilities and (b) the Benchmark
Replacement Adjustment; provided that, if the Benchmark Replacement as so
determined would be less than 0.75%, the Benchmark Replacement will be deemed to
be 0.75% for the purposes of this Agreement.
“Benchmark Replacement Adjustment” means, with respect to any replacement of the
LIBO Rate with an Unadjusted Benchmark Replacement for each applicable Interest
Period, the spread adjustment, or method for calculating or determining such
spread adjustment, (which may be a positive or negative value or zero) that has

method for calculating or determining such spread adjustment, for the
replacement of the LIBO Rate with the applicable Unadjusted Benchmark
Replacement by the Relevant Governmental Body or (b) any evolving or

Period,” timing and frequency of determining rates and making payments of
interest and other administrative matters) that the Administrative Agent decides
may be appropriate to reflect the adoption and implementation of such Benchmark
Replacement and to permit the administration thereof by the Administrative Agent
in a manner substantially consistent with market practice (or, if the
Administrative Agent decides that adoption of any portion of such market
practice is not administratively feasible or if the Administrative Agent

this Agreement).

result of borrowings made after giving effect to the Commitment Increase on such
Commitment Increase Effective Date); (ii) “Reducing Percentage Lender” means

Effective Date and upon such effectiveness (i) the Administrative Agent shall

such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of
$5,000,000 and not less than $25,000,000. At the time that each ABR Borrowing is

expenses and/or losses in the manner set forth in Section 2.16 of this
Agreement) and (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 noon,

Section 2.07 Funding of Borrowings.
(a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed
date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 1:00 pm, New
York City time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently
designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders. The Administrative
Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the
amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by
the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request.
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender
prior to the proposed time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available
on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in
reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding
amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the
applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable
Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each
day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to
but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the
case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate
determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules
on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate
applicable to the applicable Borrowing. If such Lender pays such amount to the
Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan
included in such Borrowing.
Section 2.08 Interest Elections.
(a) Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable
Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an
initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the

such Borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest
Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section. The Borrower may elect
different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing,
in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders
holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such
portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing
Request would be required under Section 2.04 if the Borrower were requesting a
Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective
date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be
irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery, telecopy or
electronic mail to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election
Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the
Borrower.
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the
following information in compliance with Section 2.03:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if
different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof,
the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case
the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall
be specified for each resulting Borrowing);

Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar
Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period
to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a
period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does
not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have
selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the
Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such
Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with
respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at
the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR
Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of
the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of
Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or
continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar
Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest
Period applicable thereto.

Commitments.
(c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to
terminate or reduce the Commitments under paragraph (b) of this Section at least
three Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction
(or, in connection with the termination of the Commitments, such later date as
may be agreed to by the Administrative Agent), specifying such election and the
effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the
Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each
notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;
provided that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the
Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the occurrence of an
event or condition, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by
notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date)
if such condition is not satisfied.
(d) In the event the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary receives Net Cash
Proceeds from any Specified Debt Issuance or any Specified Equity Issuance, the
Commitments shall automatically and permanently be reduced on the date that is
two (2) Business Days following the date on

or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting

interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder.
(c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record
the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof and the Interest Period
applicable thereto, the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or
to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and the
amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account
of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.
(d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraph (b) or (c)
of this Section shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of
the obligations recorded therein; provided that the failure of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in
any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory
note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such
Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if requested by such
Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C. Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory
note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment

aggregate amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the Net Cash Proceeds
received in respect of such Specified Equity Issuance.
(iii) If, after giving effect to any termination or reduction of the Aggregate
Maximum Credit Amounts pursuant to Section 2.09 or Section 2.20, the total
Credit Exposures exceeds the total Commitments, then the Borrower shall prepay
the Borrowings on the date of such termination or reduction in an aggregate
principal amount equal to such excess.
(c) Notice of Prepayment. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent by
telephone (confirmed by telecopy or electronic mail) of any voluntary prepayment
hereunder in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than
12:00 noon, New York City time, three Business Days before the date of
prepayment, or in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than
12:00 noon, New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice
shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal
amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid; provided that, if a
notice of prepayment is conditioned upon the occurrence of any event or
condition, such notice of prepayment may be revoked by the Borrower by written
notice to the Administrative Agent (which may be by telecopy or electronic mail)
in the event such contingency is not met. Promptly following receipt of any such
notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the
Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial voluntary prepayment of any
Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an
advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.03.
(d) Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans
included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued
interest to the extent required by Section 2.13.
(e) Each prepayment of Borrowings pursuant to this Section 2.11 shall be
applied, first, ratably to any ABR Borrowings then outstanding, and, second, to
any Eurodollar Borrowings then outstanding, and if more than one Eurodollar
Borrowing is then outstanding, to each such Eurodollar Borrowing in order of
priority beginning with the Eurodollar Borrowing with the least number of days
remaining in the Interest Period applicable thereto and ending with the
Eurodollar Borrowing with the most number of days remaining in the Interest
Period applicable thereto.
Section 2.12 Fees.


(a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
each Lender (other than to the Defaulting Lenders, if any) a commitment fee,
which shall accrue at the Applicable Margin for commitment fees on the daily
amount of the unused Commitment of such Lender during the period from and
including the date hereof to but excluding the date on which such Commitment
terminates. Accrued Commitment fees shall be payable in arrears on the last day
of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the
Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date
hereof. All Commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days
(or 366 days in a leap year) and shall be payable for the actual number of days
elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). The Borrower
agrees to pay all fees required to be paid by it pursuant the Mandate Letter as
set forth therein. All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in
immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent
26

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



for distribution, in the case of commitment fees, to the Lenders. Fees paid
shall not be refundable under any circumstances.


Section 2.13 Interest.


(a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing shall bear interest at the Alternate
Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, but not to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.
(b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the
Adjusted LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the
Applicable Margin, but not to exceed the Highest Lawful Rate.
(c) [Reserved].
(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan
or any fee or other amount payable by the Borrower hereunder is not paid when
due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue
amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per
annum equal to in the case of overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate
otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided in the preceding paragraphs of
this Section or in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to
ABR Loans as provided in paragraph (a) of this Section, but not to exceed the
Highest Lawful Rate.
(e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest
Payment Date for such Loan and on the Maturity Date; provided that interest
accrued pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section shall be payable on demand, in
the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan, including a mandatory
prepayment made pursuant to Section 2.11(b), accrued interest on the principal
amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or
prepayment and in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to
the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan
shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
(f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days,
except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times
when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the
basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall
be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day). The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate
or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent and such
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Section 2.14 Alternate Rate of Interest.
(a) Circumstances Affecting LIBO Rate Availability. Subject to clause (b) below,
in connection with any request for a Eurodollar Borrowing or a conversion to or
continuation thereof or otherwise, if for any reason (i) the Administrative
Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding
absent manifest error) that dollar deposits are not being offered to banks in
the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest
Period of such Loan, (ii) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that
reasonable and adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO
Rate or LIBO Rate for such Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar
Borrowing or (iii) the Required Lenders shall determine (which determination
shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that the Adjusted LIBO
Rate or LIBO Rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans during such Interest Period, then
the Administrative
27
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Agent shall promptly give notice thereof to the Borrower. Thereafter, until the
Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that such circumstances no longer
exist, the obligation of the Lenders to make Eurodollar Loans and the right of
the Borrower to convert any Loan to or continue any Loan as a Eurodollar
Borrowing shall be suspended, and the Borrower shall either (A) repay in full
(or cause to be repaid in full) the then outstanding principal amount of each
such Eurodollar Borrowing together with accrued interest thereon, on the last
day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Eurodollar Borrowing;
or (B) convert the then outstanding principal amount of each such Eurodollar
Borrowing to an ABR Borrowing as of the last day of such Interest Period.
(b) Effect of Benchmark Transition Event.
(i) Benchmark Replacement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in
any other Loan Document, upon the occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event or
an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, the Administrative Agent and the
Borrower may amend this Agreement to replace the LIBO Rate with a Benchmark
Replacement. Any such amendment with respect to a Benchmark Transition Event
will become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the
Administrative Agent has posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and the
Borrower so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time,
written notice of objection to such amendment from Lenders comprising the
Required Lenders. Any such amendment with respect to an Early Opt-in Election
will become effective on the date that Lenders comprising the Required Lenders
have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required
Lenders accept such amendment. No replacement of the Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO
Rate with a Benchmark Replacement pursuant to this Section 2.14(b) will occur
prior to the applicable Benchmark Transition Start Date.
(ii) Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. In connection with the
implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative Agent will have
the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time
and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan
Document, any amendments implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming
Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other
party to this Agreement.
(iii) Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations. The Administrative
Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of (A) any occurrence of
a Benchmark Transition Event or an Early Opt-in Election, as applicable, and its
related Benchmark Replacement Date and Benchmark Transition Start Date, (B) the
implementation of any Benchmark Replacement, (C) the effectiveness of any
Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes and (D) the commencement or conclusion
of any Benchmark Unavailability Period. Any determination, decision or election
that may be made by the Administrative Agent or Lenders pursuant to this Section
2.14(b), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment
or of the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, circumstance or date and any
decision to take or refrain from taking any action, will be conclusive and
binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or their reasonable
discretion and without consent from any other party hereto, except, in each
case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.14(b).
(iv) Benchmark Unavailability Period. Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of
the commencement of a Benchmark Unavailability Period, the Borrower may revoke
any request for a Eurodollar Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
Eurodollar Borrowings to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark
Unavailability Period and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have
converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to
ABR Borrowings. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period, the component of the
Alternate Base Rate based upon the Adjusted LIBO Rate will not be used in any
determination of the Alternate Base Rate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Section 2.15 Increased Costs.
(a) If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory
loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with
or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such
reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate); or
(ii) impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition
affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made or held by such Lender;
(excluding, in each case, Taxes, as to which Section 2.17 shall govern) and the
result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of
making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan or to increase the cost to such Lender
or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender
hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the Borrower will
pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding liquidity or
capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if
any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by or held by, such
Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company
could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such
Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect
to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay
to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender
or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or
amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as the case
may be, as specified in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section shall be delivered
to the Borrower. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10
days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant
to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand
such compensation; provided that the Borrower shall not be required to
compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or
reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such Lender
notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions is retroactive, then the 270-day period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
Section 2.16 Break Funding Payments. In the event of the payment of any
principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest
Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), the
conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay
any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant
hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under Section 2.11(c)
and is revoked in accordance therewith), or the assignment of any Eurodollar
Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a
result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such
event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense
attributable to such event. In the case of a Eurodollar Loan, such
29
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount
determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of the amount of interest
which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not
occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such
Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then
current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow,
convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for
such Loan), over the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal
amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it
to bid, at the commencement of such period, for dollar deposits of a comparable
amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market. A certificate of
any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Section in reasonable detail shall be delivered to the
Borrower. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after
receipt thereto.
Section 2.17 Taxes.
(a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower
under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or
withholding for any Indemnified Taxes, except as required under applicable law;
provided that if any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion
of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any
Indemnified Taxes from any such payment, then (i) the applicable Withholding
Agent shall be entitled to deduct such Indemnified Taxes from such payments,
(ii) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all
required deductions or withholdings (including such deductions or withholdings
applicable to additional sums payable under this Section), the Administrative
Agent or any Lender (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made, and (iii)
the applicable Withholding Agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law or, at the option of
the Administrative Agent, timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other
Taxes.
(c) The Borrower shall indemnify each Recipient within 15 days after demand
therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified
Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or
deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were
correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.
A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the
Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the
Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by
such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return
reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory
to the Administrative Agent.
(e) (i) any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding Taxes with respect to payments under any Loan Document shall deliver
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed
and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or
30
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without
withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver
such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by
the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to
backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion,
execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation
set forth in Section 2.17(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be
required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or
submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or
expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such
Lender.
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
(A) any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a
Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies
of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup
withholding Taxes;
(B) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so,
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies
as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
(1) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax
treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of
interest under any Loan Document, executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form
W-8BEN-E (as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S.
federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty
and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document,
IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (as applicable) establishing an exemption
from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business
profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;
(2) executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for
portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate
substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 to the effect that such Foreign Lender
is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10
percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B)
of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section
881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate”) and (y) executed
copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E (as applicable); or
(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, executed copies
of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN, IRS Form
W-8BEN-E, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit
F-2 or Exhibit F-3, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from
31
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that if the Foreign Lender is a
partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender
are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a
U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-4 on
behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; and
(C) any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so,
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies
as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a
basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding
Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be
prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made.
(D) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to
U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to
comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those
contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender
shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times
prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower
or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law
(including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such
additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such
Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine
the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
Clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of
this Agreement.
Each Lender and the Administrative Agent agrees that if any form or
certification it previously delivered under this Section 2.17 expires or becomes
obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or
certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in
writing of its legal inability to do so.
(f) If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith,
that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified
pursuant to this Section 2.17 (including by the payment of additional amounts
pursuant to this Section 2.17), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount
equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under
this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all
out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without
interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund). Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such
indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over
pursuant to this paragraph (f) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges
imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such
indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental
Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this paragraph (f), in no
event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an
indemnifying party pursuant to this paragraph (h) the payment of which would
place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the
indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and
giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed
and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax
had never been paid. This paragraph shall not be construed to require any
indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or
32
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the
indemnifying party or any other Person.
(g) Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive the
resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of
rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments
and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan
Document.
Section 2.18 Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.
(a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder
(whether of principal, interest, or fees, or of amounts payable under Section
2.15, 2.16 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to 12:00 noon, New York City time, on
the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or
counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the
discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the
next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All
such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices specified
in Section 9.01, except that payments pursuant to Section 9.03 shall be made
directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall
distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person
to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment
hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any
payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of
such extension. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the
Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees
then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied first, towards payment of
interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto
in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties,
and second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to
such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or
otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of
its Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of
the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon than the
proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater
proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans
of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such
payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate
amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans; provided
that if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the
payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded
and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without
interest, and the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply
to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the
express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as
consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its
Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph
shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent
it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount
of such participation.
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the
33
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such
date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not
in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to
the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such
amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the
Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a
rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry
rules on interbank compensation.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it
pursuant to Section 2.07(b) or 2.18(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in
its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any
amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such
unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there exists a Defaulting Lender, each
payment by the Borrower to such Defaulting Lender hereunder shall be applied in
accordance with Section 2.21(b).
Section 2.19 Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower
is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or
any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section
2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different
lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its
rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment
would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as
the case may be, in the future and would not subject such Lender to any
unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such
Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if the Borrower
is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any
Lender is a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and
effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such
Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject
to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and
obligations under this Agreement, including all of its Loans, to an assignee
that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a
Lender accepts such assignment); provided that the Borrower shall have received
the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, such Lender shall have received payment of an amount
equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon,
accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee
(to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or
the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and in the case of any such
assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or
payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will
result in a reduction in such compensation or payments. A Lender shall not be
required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a
result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the
Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

Section 2.20 Extension of Maturity Date. The Borrower may, by delivery of a
Maturity Date Extension Request to the Administrative Agent (which shall
promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders) not less than 45 days prior to
April 2, 2021, request that the Lenders extend the Maturity Date for an
additional period of one year; provided that, only one such extension will be
granted during the tenure of the credit facility. Each Lender shall, by notice
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent given not later than the 20th day
after the date of the Agent’s receipt of the Borrower’s Maturity Date Extension
Request, advise the Borrower whether or not it agrees to the requested extension
(each Lender agreeing to a requested extension being called a “Consenting
Lender” and each Lender declining to agree to a requested extension being called
a “Declining Lender”). Any Lender that has not so advised the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent by such day shall be deemed to have declined to agree to
such extension and shall be a Declining Lender. If Lenders constituting the
Required Lenders shall have agreed to a Maturity Date Extension Request, then
the Maturity Date shall, as to the Consenting Lenders, be extended to the date
that is 364 days following the Maturity Date theretofore in effect. The decision
to agree or withhold agreement to any Maturity Date Extension Request shall be
at the sole discretion of each Lender. The Commitment of any Declining Lender
shall terminate on the Maturity Date in effect prior to giving effect to any
such extension (such Maturity Date being called the “Existing Maturity Date”).
The principal amount of any outstanding Loans made by Declining Lenders,
together with any accrued interest thereon and any accrued fees and other
amounts payable to or for the account of such Declining Lenders hereunder, shall
be due and payable on the Existing Maturity Date, and on the Existing Maturity
Date, the Borrower shall also make such other prepayments of its Loans pursuant
to Section 2.11 as shall be required in order that, after giving effect to the
termination of the Commitments of, and all payments to, Declining Lenders
pursuant to this sentence, the sum of the total Credit Exposures shall not
exceed the total Commitments. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph, the Borrower shall have the right, pursuant to Section 9.04, at any
time prior to the Existing Maturity Date, to replace a Declining Lender with a
Lender or other financial institution that will agree to a Maturity Date
Extension Request, and any such replacement Lender shall for all purposes
constitute a Consenting Lender. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no extension of
the Maturity Date pursuant to this paragraph shall become effective unless (i)
the Administrative Agent shall have received documents consistent with those
delivered with respect to the Borrower under Section 4.01(b) through Section
4.01(d), giving effect to such extension and (ii) on April 2, 2021, (A) the
conditions set forth in Section 4.02 shall be satisfied, (B) there has been no
change since December 31, 2019 that has resulted in a Material Adverse Effect
that is continuing and (C) the Administrative Agent shall have received a
certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by the President, a Vice
President or a Financial Officer of the Borrower.


Section 2.21 Defaulting Lenders.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any
Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no
longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law:
(a) Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or
disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall
be restricted as set forth in Section 9.02.
(b) Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other
amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting
Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, or otherwise, and including
any amounts made available to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.18), shall be applied at such time or
times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the
payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative
Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or
Event of Default exists), to the funding of
35
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its
portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the
Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account and released
in order to satisfy obligations of such Defaulting Lender under this Agreement;
fourth, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Administrative Agent or the
Lenders as a result of any then final and nonappealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction obtained by the Administrative Agent or any Lender
against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of
its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default or Event of
Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result
of any then final and nonappealable judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result
of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and
sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of
competent jurisdiction; provided that if (i) such payment is a payment of the
principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not
fully funded its appropriate share and (ii) such Loans were made at a time when
the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment
shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro
rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting
Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a
Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting
Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this Section 2.21 shall be deemed
paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably
consents hereto.
(c) [Reserved].
        (d) [Reserved].
        (e) [Reserved].
(f) Certain Fees. For any period during which such Lender is a Defaulting
Lender, such Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Commitment
Fee pursuant to Section 2.12 (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any
such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to such
Defaulting Lender).
(g) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree
in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be
deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the
parties hereto, whereupon as of the date specified in such notice and subject to
any conditions set forth therein, such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting
Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to
fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while such Lender
was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the extent
otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from
Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of
any party hereunder arising from such Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
Section 2.22 Illegality. If any Lender determines that any applicable law has
made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is
unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable lending office to make, maintain, or
fund Eurodollar Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
LIBO Rate, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on
the ability of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, dollars
in the London interbank market, then, upon notice thereof by such Lender to the
Borrower (through the Administrative Agent), (a) any obligation of such Lender
to make or continue Eurodollar Loans or to convert ABR Loans to Eurodollar Loans
shall be suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender
making or maintaining ABR Loans the interest rate on which is determined by
reference to the LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, the interest
rate applicable to ABR Loans shall, if necessary to
36
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without
reference to the LIBO Rate component of the Alternate Base Rate, in each case
until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the
circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of
such notice, the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Eurodollar
Loans of such Lender to ABR Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such
Eurodollar Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully
continue to maintain such Eurodollar Loans, and in any event, within the time
period required by law.

Except for such compliance certificates, the Administrative Agent shall have no
obligation to request the delivery or to maintain copies of the documents

securities. The Borrower hereby agrees that (w) all Borrower Materials that are
to be made available to Public Lenders shall be clearly and conspicuously marked
“PUBLIC” which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word “PUBLIC” shall appear

result in, a Material Adverse Effect;
(e) the occurrence of any Specified Debt Issuance; and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



force and effect its legal existence and the rights, licenses, permits,
privileges and franchises material to the conduct of its business except for any
failure to maintain, preserve or qualify that could not reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect; provided that the foregoing shall not
prohibit (i) any merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution permitted
under Section 6.03 or (ii) a termination of such existence, good standing,
rights licenses, permits, privileges and franchises of any Restricted Subsidiary
if the Borrower determines in good faith that such termination is in the best
interest of the Borrower and could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.
Section 5.04 Payment of Taxes. The Borrower will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, pay its Tax liabilities, that, if not paid, could reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect before the same shall become

contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, and the Borrower or such
Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves with respect thereto in
accordance with GAAP.
Section 5.05 Insurance. The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, maintain, with financially sound and reputable insurance
companies, insurance in such amounts and against such risks as are customarily
maintained by companies engaged in the same or similar businesses operating in

cause each of its Subsidiaries to, keep proper books of record and account in

reasonably requested.

not request any Borrowing, and the Borrower shall not use, and shall ensure that
its Subsidiaries and its or their respective directors, officers, employees and
agents shall not use, the proceeds of any Borrowing directly or, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, indirectly, (a) in furtherance of an offer, payment,
promise to pay, or authorization of the payment or giving of money, or anything
else of value, to any Person in violation of any Anti-Corruption Laws, (b) for
the purpose of funding, financing or facilitating any activities, business or
transaction of or with any Sanctioned Person, or in any Sanctioned Country, to
the extent such activities, business or transaction would be prohibited by
Sanctions if conducted by the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or a corporation
incorporated in the United States or in the European Union, or (c) in any manner
that would result in the violation of any Sanctions applicable to any party
hereto.
Section 5.09 Compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws and Sanctions. The Borrower

respective directors, officers, employees and agents with Anti-Corruption Laws
and applicable Sanctions

ARTICLE VIII
THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT


Section 8.01 Administrative Agent. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably
appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such
actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The bank serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same
rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank
and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate
thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those
expressly set forth herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied
duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or
exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to
exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 9.02), and except as expressly set forth herein, the
Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be
liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving
as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The
Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or
willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have
knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the
Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent
shall not be responsible

for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into any statement, warranty or
representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, the contents of any
certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection
herewith, the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or
other terms or conditions set forth herein, the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement,
instrument or document, or the satisfaction of any condition set forth in
Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly
required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any
liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent,
statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who
may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts
selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its
rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may
perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their
respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding
paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective
activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided
for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as
provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by
notifying the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon any such resignation, the Required
Lenders shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrower, to appoint a
successor. If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders
and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring
Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor
Administrative Agent. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative
Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become
vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a
successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its
predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.
After the Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this
Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such
retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related
Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it
will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time
to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not
taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any
document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

Co-Documentation Agents. The Lead Arrangers, the Joint Bookrunners, the

50
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in exercising
any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights
and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder are
cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would
otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any
departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be permitted by paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver
or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose
for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of
a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether
the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such
Default at the time.
(b) Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or
modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into
by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders; provided that no
such agreement shall increase or extend the Commitment of any Lender without the
written consent of such Lender, reduce the principal amount of any Loan or
reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder,
without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, postpone the
scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan, or any interest
thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse
any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any
Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, change
Section 2.09 or Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter the pro rata
treatment of Lenders or pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without
the written consent of each Lender, (v) directly or indirectly amend or modify
Section 2.11(b) or the definitions of “Indebtedness for Borrowed Money”, “Net
Cash Proceeds”, “Specified Debt Issuance” or “Specified Equity Issuance”, or
(vi) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of “Required
Lenders” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of
Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any
determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of
each Lender; provided further that no such agreement shall amend, modify or
otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have any right to
approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder, except that
the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended or amounts owed
to such Lenders reduced, or the final maturity thereof extended without the
consent of such Lender, and any amendment to further restrict the voting rights
of Defaulting Lenders shall require the consent of all Lenders. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, (x) the Borrower and the Administrative Agent may amend this
Agreement or any other Loan Document without the consent of the Lenders (I) in
order to correct, amend or cure any ambiguity, inconsistency or defect or
correct any typographical error or other manifest error in any Loan Document and
(II) to the extent necessary to integrate any Commitment Increase or extension
of the Maturity Date pursuant to Section 2.20 and (y) the Administrative Agent
may, without the consent of any Lender, enter into amendments or modifications
to this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or enter into additional
Loan Documents as the Administrative Agent reasonably deems appropriate in order

Changes or otherwise effectuate the terms of Section 2.14(b) in accordance with

including all such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any
workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans. Attorneys’ fees
reimbursed by the Borrower in connection with the matters under clause (ii)

otherwise prohibit the engagement of a single law firm) plus a single local
counsel in each jurisdiction where local counsel is reasonably required.
(b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each
Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
“Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee,
incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection
with, or as a result of the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties
hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the
Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, any Loan or the use
of the proceeds therefrom, any actual or alleged presence or release of
Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any actual or prospective claim,
litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing,
whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether
any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that SUCH INDEMNITY SHALL EXTEND TO
EACH INDEMNITEE NOTWITHSTANDING THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OF EVERY KIND
OR CHARACTER WHATSOEVER, WHETHER ACTIVE OR PASSIVE, WHETHER AN AFFIRMATIVE ACT
OR AN OMISSION, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL TYPES OF NEGLIGENT CONDUCT
IDENTIFIED IN THE RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS OF ONE OR MORE OF THE
INDEMNITEES OR BY REASON OF STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED WITHOUT FAULT ON ANY ONE OR
MORE OF THE INDEMNITEES; PROVIDED THAT SUCH INDEMNITY SHALL NOT, AS TO ANY
INDEMNITEE, BE AVAILABLE TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH LOSSES, CLAIMS, DAMAGES,
LIABILITIES OR RELATED EXPENSES ARE DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT

NEGLIGENCE, WILFUL MISCONDUCT OF SUCH INDEMNITEE OR BREACH OF CONTRACTUAL
UNDERAKING OF SUCH INDEMNITEE UNDER THE LOAN DOCUMENTS.
(c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid
by it to the Administrative Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section,
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s

unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage,
liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted
against the Administrative Agent in its capacity as such.

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert,
and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability,
for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct
or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this
Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions
or any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in
paragraph (b) above shall be liable for any damages arising from the use by
unintended recipients of any information or other materials distributed by it
through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems
in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual
damages resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction.
(e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than 30 days
after written demand therefor.
Section 9.04 Successors and Assigns.
(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower
without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or
otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with
this Section. Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be
construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, Participants (to the extent
provided in paragraph (c) of this Section) and, to the extent expressly
contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of
this Agreement.
(b)
(i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii) below, any Lender
may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment
and the Loans at the time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:
(A) the Borrower, provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be required for
an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an Approved Fund or, if an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, any other assignee and provided
further that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such
assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the
Administrative Agent within 5 Business Days after having received notice
thereof; and
(B) the Administrative Agent, provided that no consent of the Administrative
Agent shall be required for an assignment of any Commitment to an assignee that
is a Lender (or an affiliate of a Lender) with a Commitment immediately prior to
giving effect to such assignment.
(ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional conditions:
(A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender
or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s
Commitment or Loans, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning
Lender subject to each such assignment
53
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such
assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than
$20,000,000 unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise
consent, provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;
(B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate
part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement;
(C) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a processing
and recordation fee of $3,500; and
(D) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire and comply with the
requirements of Section 2.17(e).
(E) the assignee shall not be (I) a natural person (or a holding company,
investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit
of, a natural person) or (II) a Defaulting Lender or any Subsidiary of a
Defaulting Lender.
For the purposes of this Section 9.04(b), the term “Approved Fund” has the
following meaning:
“Approved Fund” means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged
in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions
of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered,
managed or underwritten by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an
entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.
(iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (b)(iv)
of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment
and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the
rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning
Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such
Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement
(and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all of the assigning
Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to
be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections
2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04
shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a
participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with paragraph (c) of
this Section.
(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent
of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent,
and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register
pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
54
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed by
an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative
Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the
processing and recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and
any written consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this
Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption
and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment
shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in
the Register as provided in this paragraph.
(c) (i)  Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities
(a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans
owing to it); provided that (A) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement
shall remain unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the
other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and the other Lenders shall continue to deal
solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which
a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain
the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement; provided that such
agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the
consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver
described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant.
Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.16 and 2.17 to
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section. Each Lender that sells a
participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of
the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of
each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan
Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any
obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including
the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's
interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations
under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure
is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other
obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States
Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be
conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose
name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation
for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as
Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant
Register.
(ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 2.15 or Section 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled
to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless
the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s
prior written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a
Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Borrower
is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant
agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with Section 2.17(e) as
though it were a Lender.
(d) Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such
Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure
obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any
such pledge or assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge
55
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its
obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender
as a party hereto.
(e) No assignment or participation shall be made to (i) the Borrower or any of
the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or (ii) any Defaulting Lender or any
Subsidiary of a Defaulting Lender.
Section 9.05 Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties
made by the Borrower herein and in the certificates or other instruments
delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered
to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the making of any Loans, regardless
of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and
notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice
or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time
any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as
long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any
other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long
as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections
2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full
force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
Section 9.06 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness; Electronic Execution.
(a) Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each
of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together
shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and any separate letter
agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute
the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written,
relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this
Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the
Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received
counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of
the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of
the actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually
executed counterpart of this Agreement. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents
and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the
Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating
to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof and thereof. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents represent the
final agreement among the parties hereto and thereto and may not be contradicted
by evidence of prior, contemporaneous or subsequent oral agreements of the
parties. There are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties.
(b) Electronic Execution of Assignments. The words “execution,” “signed,”
“signature,” “delivery,” and words of like import in any Assignment and
Assumption shall be deemed to include Electronic Signatures, deliveries or the
keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal
effect, validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical
delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case
may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the
Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, or any state
laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided that
56
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



nothing herein shall require the Administrative Agent to accept electronic
signatures in any form or format without its prior written consent.
Section 9.07 Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
Section 9.08 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.
(a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE NOTES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT UNITED
STATES FEDERAL LAW PERMITS ANY LENDER TO CONTRACT FOR, CHARGE, RECEIVE, RESERVE
OR TAKE INTEREST AT THE RATE ALLOWED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE WHERE SUCH LENDER
IS LOCATED. CHAPTER 346 OF THE TEXAS FINANCE CODE (WHICH REGULATES CERTAIN
REVOLVING CREDIT LOAN ACCOUNTS AND REVOLVING TRI-PARTY ACCOUNTS) SHALL NOT APPLY

(b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS SHALL BE
BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS OR OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS, AND, BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS
AGREEMENT, EACH PARTY HEREBY ACCEPTS FOR ITSELF AND (TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW) IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE JURISDICTION
OF THE AFORESAID COURTS. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY OBJECTION,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON
THE GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE
BRINGING OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS. THIS
SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION IS NON-EXCLUSIVE AND DOES NOT PRECLUDE A PARTY FROM
OBTAINING JURISDICTION OVER ANOTHER PARTY IN ANY COURT OTHERWISE HAVING
JURISDICTION.
(c) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OF ANY OF THE
AFOREMENTIONED COURTS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF COPIES
THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO IT AT THE ADDRESS
SPECIFIED IN Section 9.01 OR SUCH OTHER ADDRESS AS IS SPECIFIED PURSUANT TO
Section 9.01 (OR ITS ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION), SUCH SERVICE TO BECOME
EFFECTIVE THIRTY (30) DAYS AFTER SUCH MAILING. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE
RIGHT OF A PARTY OR ANY HOLDER OF A NOTE TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER
PERMITTED BY LAW OR TO COMMENCE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR OTHERWISE PROCEED AGAINST
ANOTHER PARTY IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.
Section 9.09 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND

ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER DOCUMENT
RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN; IRREVOCABLY WAIVES,

LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVERS, AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THE LOAN DOCUMENTS AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS CONTAINED IN THIS Section 9.09.
Section 9.10 Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents
used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.
Section 9.11 Confidentiality. Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below),
except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates’
directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants and legal
counsel (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made
will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed
to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any
regulatory authority or any self-regulatory body claiming to have authority, (c)
to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process or authority, (d) to any other party to this Agreement,
(e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit,
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights
hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the
same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any
prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations
under this Agreement, (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its
advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its
obligations, (iii) to its advisors (other than its accountants and legal
counsel), (iv) to an investor or prospective investor in an Approved Fund that
also agrees that Information shall be used solely for the purpose of evaluating
an investment in such Approved Fund, (v) to a trustee, collateral manager,
servicer, backup servicer, noteholder or secured party in an Approved Fund in
connection with the administration, servicing and reporting on the assets
serving as collateral for an Approved Fund, or (vi) to the CUSIP Bureau, market
data collectors, and nationally recognized rating agencies that require access
to information regarding the Borrower, the Loans and Loan Documents in
connection with ratings issued with respect to an Approved Fund, (g) with the
consent of the Borrower or (h) to the extent such Information becomes publicly
available other than as a result of a breach of this Section. For the purposes
of this Section, “Information” means all information received from the Borrower
relating to the Borrower or its business, other than any such information that
is available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential
basis prior to disclosure by the Borrower.
Section 9.12 Interest Rate Limitation. It is the intention of the parties hereto
that each Lender shall conform strictly to usury laws applicable to it.
Accordingly, if the transactions contemplated hereby would be usurious as to any
Lender under laws applicable to it (including the laws of the United States of
America and the State of Texas or any other jurisdiction whose laws may be
mandatorily applicable to such Lender notwithstanding the other provisions of
this Agreement), then, in that event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the Agreement, it is agreed as follows: the aggregate of all consideration
which constitutes interest under law applicable to any Lender that is contracted
for, taken, reserved, charged or received by such Lender under the Agreement or
the Subsidiary Guaranties shall under no circumstances exceed the maximum amount
allowed by such applicable law, and any excess shall be canceled automatically
and if theretofore paid shall be credited by such Lender on the principal amount
of the Indebtedness (or, to the extent that the principal amount of the
Indebtedness shall have been or would thereby be paid in full, refunded by such
Lender to the Borrower); and in the event of any required or permitted
prepayment, then such consideration that constitutes interest under law
applicable to
58
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



any Lender may never include more than the maximum amount allowed by such
applicable law, and excess interest, if any, provided for in this Agreement or
otherwise shall be canceled automatically by such Lender as of the date of such
acceleration or prepayment and, if theretofore paid, shall be credited by such
Lender on the principal amount of the Indebtedness (or, to the extent that the
principal amount of the Indebtedness shall have been or would thereby be paid in
full, refunded by such Lender to the Borrower). All sums paid or agreed to be
paid to any Lender for the use, forbearance or detention of sums due hereunder
shall, to the extent permitted by law applicable to such Lender, be amortized,
prorated, allocated and spread throughout the stated term of the Loans until
payment in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of any Loans
hereunder does not exceed the maximum amount allowed by such applicable law. If
at any time and from time to time the amount of interest payable to any Lender
on any date shall be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such
Lender pursuant to this Section 9.12 and in respect of any subsequent interest
computation period the amount of interest otherwise payable to such Lender would
be less than the amount of interest payable to such Lender computed at the
Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such Lender, then the amount of interest
payable to such Lender in respect of such subsequent interest computation period
shall continue to be computed at the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to such
Lender until the total amount of interest payable to such Lender shall equal the
total amount of interest which would have been payable to such Lender if the
total amount of interest had been computed without giving effect to this Section
9.12. To the extent that Chapter 303 of the Texas Finance Code is relevant for
the purpose of determining the Highest Lawful Rate applicable to a Lender, such
Lender elects to determine the applicable rate ceiling under such Chapter by the
weekly ceiling from time to time in effect. Chapter 346 of the Texas Finance
Code does not apply to the Borrower’s obligations hereunder.
Section 9.13 USA Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender hereby notifies the Borrower
that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L.
107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the “Act”), it is required to
obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower, which
information includes the name and address of the Borrower and other information
that will allow such Lender to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act.


Section 9.14 [Reserved].
Section 9.15 No Fiduciary Duty. Each Lender and its Affiliates (collectively,
solely for purposes of this paragraph, the “Lenders”), may have economic
interests that conflict with those of the Borrower. The Borrower agrees that
nothing in the Loan Documents will be deemed to create an advisory, fiduciary or
agency relationship or fiduciary or other implied duty between any Lender, on
the one hand, and the Borrower, on the other. The Borrower acknowledges and
agree that (i) the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents (including
the exercise of rights and remedies hereunder and thereunder) are arm’s-length
commercial transactions between the Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrower,
on the other, and (ii) in connection therewith and with the process leading
thereto, (x) no Lender has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in
favor of the Borrower with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby (or
the exercise of rights or remedies with respect thereto) or the process leading
thereto (irrespective of whether any Lender has advised, is currently advising
or will advise the Borrower on other matters) and (y) each Lender is acting
solely as principal and not as the agent or fiduciary of the Borrower. The
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that it has consulted its own legal and
financial advisors to the extent it deemed appropriate and that it is
responsible for making its own independent judgment with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and the process leading thereto.
Section 9.16 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial
Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or
in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties,
each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any
59
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent
such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion
Powers of an applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and
acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:


(a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an applicable
Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be
payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
(b) the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if
applicable:
(i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other
instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent
undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise
conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be
accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the
exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of any Resolution Authority.
Section 9.17 Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that
the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for Swap
Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support,
“QFC Credit Support” and, each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the parties
acknowledge and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the
FDIC under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations
promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in respect of
such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable
notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be
stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United
States or any other state of the United States):
(a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a
“Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution
Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit
Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such
QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or
such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same
extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution
Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest,
obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United
States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC
Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S.
Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might
otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be
exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater
extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special
Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by
the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without
limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and
remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event
affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any
QFC Credit Support.
(b) As used in this Section 9.17, the following terms have the following
meanings:
60
US 6975526 WEL554/58028

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



“BHC Act Affiliate” of a party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined
under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.
“Covered Entity” means any of the following:
(i) a “covered entity” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance
with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b);
(ii) a “covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance
with, 12 C.F.R. § 47.3(b); or
(iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance
with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b).
“Default Right” has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be
interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as
applicable.
“QFC” has the meaning assigned to the term “qualified financial contract” in,
and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).
Section 9.18 Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby
authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, to setoff and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and
other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any
such Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any
and all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or its Affiliates,
irrespective of whether or not such Lender or any such Affiliate shall have made
any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such
obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a
branch or office of such Lender or such Affiliate different from the branch,
office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness;
provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender or any Affiliate thereof
shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so setoff shall be paid
over immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.21 and, pending such payment, shall
be segregated by such Defaulting Lender or Affiliate of a Defaulting Lender from
its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender or its Affiliate shall
provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in
reasonable detail the Indebtedness owing to such Defaulting Lender or any of its
Affiliates as to which such right of setoff was exercised.  The rights of each
Lender and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to
other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or
its Affiliates may have.  Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application; provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such
setoff and application.
