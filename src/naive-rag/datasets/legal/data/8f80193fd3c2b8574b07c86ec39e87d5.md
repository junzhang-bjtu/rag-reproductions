July 2018

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 10 of 70



proprietary information in the white paper it shall be identified and marked in
accordance with the terms for protection of information under Article VIII.
Confidential Information.



Section 1.03   Scope



The Government in conjunction with the MCDC member entities shall perform a
coordinated research and development program designed to support the DoD’s
medical, pharmaceutical, and diagnostic requirements as related to enhancing the
mission effectiveness of military personnel. The mission of JPM-MCS is to
provide the U.S. military forces and the nation safe, effective, and innovative
medical solutions to counter Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN)
threats. Under the OTA and associated Project Agreements, the Government along
with the Consortium member entities, shall perform coordinated planning and
research and development prototype efforts in support of the JPM-MCS mission
through the development of products in three (3) major Medical Countermeasure
Systems (MCS) objective areas:



·

Detection: Systems and devices to identify CBRN agents and assist in making
medical decisions

·

Prevention: Prophylaxis, pretreatment, and post-exposure prophylaxis

·

Treatment: Therapeutics (post-exposure, post-symptomatic)



The Government will determine which endeavors to pursue and projects to fund. At
any time throughout the term of the OTA, the Government may address the needs
for the desired MCS objective areas or other related Government needs as they
arise. The MCDC and the Government agree that other organizations and agencies
within the U.S. Government may participate in the collaborative activities
through a Memorandum of Agreement or other such arrangement. It is anticipated
that these other organizations may include JPEO-CBD and DTRA.



Request for Prototype Proposal (RPP) Process:



Once the Government identifies a need under one of the MCS objective areas
above, the Government will issue a Request for Prototype Proposal (RPP). The RPP
will include a Request for White Papers (RWP) and/or a Request for Prototype
Proposal (RPP) to the Consortium Management Firm (CMF). Due dates will be
indicated for each. The CMF shall in turn issue a similar request to MCDC’s
member entities, for which the Government will review and evaluate all
responses. The Government will be solely responsible for evaluation of the white
papers and/or proposal submissions, as applicable. If the RPP includes a RWP,
only members submitting white papers will be permitted to submit full proposal
submissions. Based on the evaluation of the white papers, the Government will
make a recommendation on whether the member should or should not submit a full
proposal submission. Any member submitting a white paper, regardless of the
Government’s recommendation, may submit a proposal.



MCDC member white papers and proposals shall be submitted to the CMF in
accordance with the RPP instructions which will include evaluation criteria and
a Statement of Work (SOW) template on the due date indicated in the RPP. The CMF
will review white paper and proposal submissions for completeness and format
compliance. The CMF shall in turn prepare and transmit MCDC’s member’s white
papers and proposals to the Government for evaluation. The Government will be
responsible for technical evaluation and selection of the projects from the
proposals submitted. The CMF will assess the reasonableness and completeness of
the cost estimates and then provide a formal assessment to the Government. The
Government Agreement Officer will review this assessment and make the final
determination regarding whether the negotiated project cost is fair and
reasonable. All Project Agreements will be subject to discussions/negotiations
and proposal updates, as appropriate, prior to execution.



Once all steps are complete, the Government will issue a Technical Direction
Letter (TDL) to the CMF for the authorization and execution of the selected
project to be performed by the selected MCDC’s member entity(ies). Once the CMF
receives notification of selection of a project for funding via TDL, the CMF
will enter into a Project Agreement with the MCDC member.



A modification will be included with the TDL, which will include the funding for
the negotiated and agreed-upon project. After receipt of the TDL and review and
execution of the funding modification, the CMF shall enter into a Project
Agreement (PA) with MCDC member whose project was selected. MCDC CMF shall
administer the Government-funded Project Agreements. The Government's designated
Agreements Officer Representative (AOR) for the specific project will supervise
the technical work performed by MCDC’s member entity in execution of the





BASE AGREEMENT NO.: 2020-530

July 2018

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 11 of 70



PA. The Government reserves the right to revise the terms and conditions of
these projects in accordance with Article III, Section 3.04.



Placement in the Electronic “Basket File”:



Qualifying proposals, not eligible for current funding, may be entered into an
electronic basket and subject to award for up to thirty-six (36) months. The RPP
will contain the available ratings and their definitions to be assigned to
proposals as a result of the technical evaluation as well as which specific
ratings will qualify a proposal for inclusion in the Basket. The Government
reserves the right to determine which, if any, proposals are to be selected
according to the published criteria.



Once in the Basket, a proposal may be identified for award by the Government
based on Government need and availability of funding. The Government reserves
the right to 1.) request that the MCDC member who submitted the identified
proposal, scale or otherwise adjust the original proposal, and to 2.) fund all
or part of the identified proposal. The MCDC member will have an opportunity to
update their proposal, as applicable, if selected from the basket. The
Government will review any updated information provided by the MCDC member
and/or CMF. Upon the Government’s decision to fund such a proposal from the
Basket, the CMF will receive notification of the award decision through a TDL
whereupon the CMF will enter into a Project Agreement with the indicated MCDC
member as required.



A selected proposal will reside in the Basket for thirty-six (36) months from
the date the corresponding RPP is closed unless funded or the submitting MCDC
member requests in writing beforehand to have it removed.



SBIR Phase III Project Requests



It will be incumbent upon the MCDC member, on their own with some general
support and guidance from the CMF, to find a Government Technical POC with both
(1) available funding and (2) an interest in furthering technology developed
under a current or prior SBIR project. Upon doing so, the Government Technical
POC will coordinate the feasibility of placing the award under the OTA with the
Government AO and OTA Program Manager and the following areas will be considered
when making a determination for appropriateness of award under the OTA:



·How the proposed effort derives from, extends, or logically concludes efforts
performed under prior SBIR funding agreements;

·How the proposed effort fits within the definition of a prototype effort
related to medical, pharmaceutical, and diagnostic technologies to enhance
mission effectiveness of military personnel in accordance with the statutory
requirement;

·How the proposed effort fits within the overall scope of work and the goals and
objectives of the OTA.



Should the Government AO and the OTA Program Manager determine it is appropriate
to award the SBIR Phase III under the OTA, the Government AO will send a
proposal request to the MCDC member through the CMF, as is standard for any
Government request under the OTA. The CMF will provide a cost analysis summary
to the Government Agreements Officer (AO) for consideration in the Government’s
award determination. The Government will evaluate the proposal, conduct any
necessary negotiations through the CMF, and make an award determination. If the
Government makes the determination to award to the MCDC member, the Government
AO will issue a TDL letter to the CMF, resulting in the issuance of a Project
Agreement between the CMF and MCDC member.



SBIR Phase III awards under this Agreement shall include the Data Rights
provisions and Data Rights granted to the MCDC member contained within Article
XI of this Agreement. All administrative, reporting, and other aspects of awards
made for SBIR Phase III efforts under this Agreement will be in accordance with
the terms and conditions of the OTA. MCDC Members must have been awarded and
performed under a previous SBIR Phase I and/or Phase II contract in order to
qualify for SBIR Phase III award under this Agreement.



Section 1.04   Goals/Objectives





BASE AGREEMENT NO.: 2020-530

July 2018

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 12 of 70



The following goals/objectives will be pursued through the execution of the OTA:



·

Accelerate the development of mission critical technologies in the areas of
concern from applied research into advanced development.

·

Deliver therapeutic MCM prototypes targeting viral, bacterial, and biological
toxin targets of interest to the DOD. MCM prototypes are drug products that have
completed all or part of the activities required to support FDA licensure. This
may include meeting warfighter requirements of protection against an aerosolized
route of exposure.

·

Deliver enabling technologies that will support the development and regulatory
review of MCM prototypes. The enabling technologies can include animal models of
viral, bacterial or biological toxin disease and pathogenesis (multiple routes
of exposure), assays, diagnostic technologies or other platform technologies
applicable to development and regulatory review of MCM.

·

Develop prototype candidates for the prophylaxis, treatment and diagnosis of
Chemical threats. This will include diagnosis of, and prophylaxis and treatment
for, exposure to traditional and emerging chemical nerve agent threats, as well
as other emerging chemical threat agents other than nerve agents.

·

Develop prototype candidates for the prophylaxis, treatment and diagnosis of
Radiological and Nuclear threats. This will include prototype candidates for
diagnosis of, and prophylaxis and treatment for Acute Radiation Syndrome.

·

Develop soldier-carried autoinjector delivery devices for single drug
administration. Develop soldier- carried autoinjector delivery devices for
administration of two or more drugs.

·

[Develop vaccine-manufacturing platforms that offer early stage manufacturing
flexibility and diversity using a deep knowledge of protein(s) expression in a
biological system that is reproducible and scalable, and preferably with direct
FDA experience. The goal is to manufacture and test identified protective
molecule(s) and target molecule(s) (along with associated reagents and
standards) in multiple scalable, flexible manufacturing platforms encompassing a
diverse array of manufacturing systems (e.g., insect, mammalian, live viral,
plant, E.coli, yeast, etc.) for use in appropriate animal model(s) and in Phase
1 trials.]

·

Pharmaceutical development will address the FDA Animal Rule, as appropriate.

·

Utilize adjuvants and excipients supporting the ability to develop up to 300,000
equivalent doses within 60 days at clinical quality.

·

Support a family of systems diagnostic approach that increases the speed,
accuracy, and confidence of agent identification and disease diagnosis.
Diagnostic areas include those for organisms that circulate freely and at
relatively high numbers at or near the onset of symptoms, organisms that
circulate in low numbers early in infection but then integrate with host cells,
organisms that have significant genomic diversity from strain to strain, and
non-BW agents such as toxins/chemical agents/radiological agents that do not
replicate and require low quantities to cause illness.

·

Support the Defense Biological Products Assurance Office (formally the Critical
Reagents Program), the principal DoD resource of high quality, validated, and
standardized biological reference materials, reagents, and assays, as necessary.

·

projects throughout the period to determine if any changes to planning or budget
are required. If such a change is expected which will cause a need to modify the
OTA, the Technical Direction Letter or an individual Project Agreement may be
modified to incorporate such changes. The AO is the only authorized
representative of the Government who may make modifications to the OTA. PAHs
shall submit the following reports to the CMF who will review and provide one
cumulative report detailing status of all funded projects to the MCS Program
Office.



a.)   Project Agreement Quarterly Report. The report will have two major
sections:



(i)

Technical Status Report. The technical status report will detail technical
progress to date and report on all problems, technical issues or major
developments during the reporting period. Each of the topics described below
shall be addressed for the effort performed:



(1)A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives of the
project established for the period.



(2)Reasons why established goals and objectives were not met, if appropriate.



(3)Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and
explanation of cost variances.



(4)A cumulative chronological list of written publications in technical
journals. Include those in press as well as manuscripts in preparation and
planned for later submission. Indicate likely journals, authors, and titles.



(5)Papers presented at meetings, conferences, seminars, etc.



(ii)

Business Status Report. The business status report shall provide summarized
details of the resource status of the Project Agreement, including the status of
the contributions by all participants. This report will include a quarterly
accounting of current expenditures. Any major deviations from the agreed to
project plans shall be explained with discussion of proposed actions to address
the deviations. The report will also include an accounting of interest earned on
Government Funds, if any. It is not expected that any interest will accrue under
the Project Agreement(s), as milestone payments will be tracked and adjusted
accordingly. In any event, the Government reserves the right to require interest
amounts in excess of $250 per year to be remitted to the US Treasury.



b.)   Annual Technical Report. Annual technical reports are required for
projects whose periods of performance are greater than one year. The PAH’s
report will provide a concise and factual discussion of the significant
accomplishments and progress during the year covered by the report.



c.)   Final Technical Report.



(i)Final Technical Report (FTR). A Final Technical Report shall be submitted to
the CMF within thirty (30) calendar days of the completion of the Project
Agreement. This report will provide a comprehensive, cumulative, and substantive
summary of the progress and significant accomplishments achieved during the
total period of the effort. Each of the topics described above shall be
addressed as appropriate for the effort performed. Upon receipt, the AOR will
review and provide any comments within 30 days. If necessary, the PAH will
update the FTR within 30 days of receipt of AOR’s comments. Once the CMF has
informed PAH that the FTR has been approved by the AOR, the PAH shall forward a
copy of the FTR to the Defense Technical Information Center, Attn. DTIC-O, 8725
John J. Kingman Road, Suite 0944, Fort Belvoir, VA 22060-6218.

front page shall be marked in a conspicuous place with a distribution statement
to denote the extent of its availability for distribution, release, and
disclosure without additional approvals or authorizations.



d.)  Final Business Status Report. The final business status report shall
provide summarized details of the resource status of the Project Agreement,
including the status of the contributions by all participants. This report will
include a final accounting of cumulative expenditures. If a project is
terminated prior to the end of a quarter or a year and sufficient funding is
available, the PAH, through the CMF, must submit a final technical and business
status report in the same format as detailed herein.



Note: Deficiencies in regulatory reports must be adequately assessed by the
Government, MCDC and the individual performer, or consortium as a whole, to come
to resolution.



Article II.       TERM



Section 2.01   The Term of this Agreement



The period of performance for this Agreement is from the effective date, which
is the date of last signature, to April 7, 2036. If at any time funds expended
exceed the amount obligated on a Project Agreement prior to the expiration of
the term, the Parties have no obligation to continue performance and may elect
to cease their efforts at that point. Provisions of this Agreement, which, by
their express terms or by necessary implication, apply for periods of time other
than specified in Article II herein, shall be given effect, notwithstanding this
Article.



Section 2.02   Termination of this Agreement by Mutual Agreement



Except for the rights and obligations with respect to proprietary information
and/or specific intellectual property agreements between or amongst the
Government, the CMF and the MCDC member organizations, unless extended by mutual
written agreement of the Parties, this Agreement shall automatically terminate
by written agreement of  the Parties. Unless otherwise directed by the AO
through the CMF, individual Project Agreements pursuant to this Agreement shall
also terminate upon the termination of this Agreement.



Section 2.03   Termination Provisions



Subject to a reasonable determination that the program, or a project funded
under the program, will not produce beneficial results commensurate with the
expenditure of resources, the Government may terminate performance of work under
this OTA or a specific project, in whole or in part, if the AO determines that a
termination is in the Government’s interest. The AO shall terminate by
delivering to the MCDC through its CMF a Notice of Termination specifying the
extent of termination and the effective date.



After receipt of a Notice of Termination, and except as directed by the CMF, the
PAH shall immediately proceed with the following obligations, regardless of any
delay in determining or adjusting any amounts due:



(1)

Stop work and direct its subawardees to stop work as specified in the notice.



(2)Place no further subagreements or orders (referred to as orders in this
clause) for materials, services, or facilities, except as necessary to complete
the continued portion of the project.



(3)

Terminate all orders to the extent they relate to the work terminated.





BASE AGREEMENT NO.: 2020-530

July 2018

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 15 of 70



(4)Assign to the Government, as directed by the AO, all right, title, and
interest of the PAH under the orders terminated, in which case the Government
shall have the right to settle or to pay any termination settlement proposal
arising out of those terminations.



(5)With approval or ratification to the extent required by the AO, the CMF may
settle all outstanding liabilities and termination settlement proposals arising
from the termination of orders; the approval or ratification will be final for
purposes of this clause.



(6)Provide CMF, and/or obtain from the subawardees under the terminated portion
of the Agreement a transfer of title to the following where applicable and
deliver to the Government --



(i)The fabricated or unfabricated parts, work in process, completed work,
supplies, and other material produced or acquired for the work terminated; and



(ii)The completed or partially completed plans, drawings, information, and other
property that, if the order had been completed, would have been required to be
furnished to the Government.



(7)

Complete performance of any work not terminated, if applicable.



(8)Take any action that may be necessary, or that the AO may direct through the
CMF, for the protection and preservation of the property related to this project
that is in the possession of the PAH(s) or any subawardee and in which the
Government has or may acquire an interest.



(9)Use commercially reasonable efforts to sell, as directed or authorized by the
CMF, any property of the types referred to under Article II. Section 2.03
Termination Provisions, (6)(i) and (ii); provided, however, that the PAH:



(i)

is not required to extend credit to any purchaser and



(ii)may arrange for the subawardee who was performing the terminated work to
acquire the property under the conditions prescribed by, and at prices approved
by, the CMF.



(iii)will in no event be required to continue with such efforts for more than
three (3) months after notice by the CMF to sell or disposition such property.



(10)The PAH has no obligation to continue to cost share on the terminated
project or terminated portion of the project.



The requirement for at least 1/3 cost share of the total project cost by the PAH
is assessed prior to award. In the event that during the course of the
performance of the Project Agreement any of the parties to the Project Agreement
believe the cost sharing funds available will be insufficient, the PAH shall
notify the CMF within twenty-five (25) days of the event that gave rise to the
insufficient cost sharing funds. CMF will notify the Government within five (5)
days of receiving such notice from the PAH. The Government will determine
whether it is in its best interest to either renegotiate the scope and/or terms
of the Project Agreement to meet the cost share requirement or terminate the
Project Agreement in whole or in part.



The proceeds of any transfer or disposition of project property will be applied
to reduce any payments to be made by the Government under that particular
project, including credited to the price or cost of the work, or paid in any
other manner directed by the CMF.



In the event of a termination of the Project Agreement, the Government shall
have patent rights as described in Article X, Patent Rights, and rights in Data
as described in Article XI, Data Rights. Failure of the PAH and Government to
agree to an equitable adjustment shall be resolved pursuant to Article VII,

Section 2.04    Termination Cost



The CMF will negotiate with the Government and PAH in good faith equitable
reimbursement for work performed toward accomplishment of the task or tasks of
individual projects. The Government will allow full credit for the Government
share of the obligations properly incurred by a PAH prior to termination. Costs
incurred by a PAH during a suspension or after termination of a project are not
allowable unless the CMF expressly authorizes them in either the notices of
suspension, termination, or subsequently. Other PAH’s costs incurred during a
suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable
are allowable if:



(a)

The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the PAH before
the effective date of the suspension or termination, are not in anticipation of
it, and in the case of a termination, are non-cancellable; and



(b)

The costs would be allowable if the project was not suspended or the award
expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes
effect.



Section 2.05    Close-out Procedure.



If the Government funds an individual Project Agreement and then subsequently
terminates the agreement or the requirements of the agreement are met, the
following closeout procedures apply:



(a)

Definitions.



(i)     “Closeout” – the process by which the Government and CMF determine that
all applicable administrative actions and all required work have been completed
by the PAH.



(ii)    “Date of Completion” – the date on which all work is completed or the
date on an amendment thereto on which the period of performance ends.



(iii)   “Disallowed costs” – those charges that the Government or its
representative determines to be unallowable, in accordance with the terms and
conditions stated in this Agreement.



(b)

Upon request, the Government shall make prompt payments to the PAH through the
CMF for allowable reimbursable costs under the MCS Project Agreement being
closed out.



(c)

The PAH shall immediately refund any balance of unobligated (unencumbered) cash
that the CMF has paid and that is not authorized to be retained by the PAH for
use in the performance of the Project Agreement.



(d)

The CMF shall obtain from the PAH within 90 calendar days after the date of
completion of an MCS Project Agreement all financial, performance, and other
reports required as a condition of the MCS Project Agreement. The CMF may grant
extensions when requested by the PAH.



(e)

When authorized, the CMF shall make a settlement for any upward or downward
adjustments to the Government’s share of costs after these reports are received
based on final, actual expenditures in accordance with the Termination Costs
provision of the Agreement.



(f)

Quick close-out procedures similar to FAR 42.708 shall be followed.



(g)

The PAH shall account for any property received from the Government.



Section 2.06    Stop Work



As directed by the AO, the CMF may, at any time, by written order to the PAH,
require the PAH to stop all, or any part, of the work called for under this
Agreement or any Project Agreement for a period of 90 days after the written
order is delivered to the PAH, and for any further period to which the parties
may agree. The order shall be specifically identified as a stop-work order
issued under this section. Upon receipt of the order, the PAH shall





BASE AGREEMENT NO.: 2020-530

July 2018

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 17 of 70



immediately comply with its terms and take all reasonable steps to minimize the
incurrence of costs allocable to the work covered by the order during the period
of work stoppage. Within a period of 90 days after a stop-work is delivered to
the PAH, or within any extension of that period to which the parties shall have
agreed, the CMF shall either:

(a)

Cancel the stop-work order; or

(b)

Terminate the work covered by the Project Agreement as provided in Article II,
Term and Termination.



If a stop work order issued under this clause is canceled, the PAH shall resume
work. The CMF shall make an equitable adjustment in the delivery schedule or
Project Agreement estimated cost/price, or both, and the Government’s share of
the Project Agreement shall be modified, in writing, accordingly, if—



(1)The stop-work order results in an increase in the time required for, or in
the PAH’s cost properly allocable to, the performance of any part of the Project
Agreement; and



(2)The PAH asserts its right to the adjustment within 30 days after the end of
the period of work stoppage; provided, that, if the Government decides the facts
justify the action, the Government through the MCDC CMF may receive and act upon
a proposal submitted at any time before final payment under the Project
Agreement.



If a stop work order is not canceled and the work covered by the Project
Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article II, the MCDC CMF shall work
with the PAH to negotiate an equitable reimbursement in accordance with Article
II. Section 2.03, Termination Provisions.

identifies any associated technical milestones and the progress toward
completion of each milestone;



(iii)

includes a report of the cost share expended towards the accomplishment of the
SOW tasks and/or milestones. This cost share report may be attached to the
invoice if contractor practices make inclusion of such information on the
invoice itself impractical. If the cost share report is separate from the
invoice, it must be signed by an authorized representative. This cost share
report must contain a breakout of the cost share by cost element similar to the
level of detail required on the invoice and any in-kind contributions. The
preferred method of reporting cost share is to provide an invoice for actual
cost incurred with a value for the cost shared amount and the value to be

acceptable invoice is one that meets the conditions described in Article V
Section 5.04a. Payment Method Types.



Section 5.05    Advance Payments:



On a per project basis, advance payments may be approved by the AO. If the AO
has approved advance payments, there will be a requirement to establish a
separate interest bearing account. The PAH sets up and maintains funds in a
separate interest bearing account unless one of the following applies:



(1)

The PAH receives less than $120,000 in Federal awards per year;



(2)

The best reasonably available interest bearing account would not expect to earn
interest in excess of

$250 per year on such cash advances;



(3)

The depository would require an average or minimum balance so high that it would
not be feasible within the expected cash resources for the project; or



(4)

The advance payments are made one time to reduce financing costs for large

AGREEMENT



Article VI.       NONTRADITIONAL DEFENSE/COST SHARING



In accordance with provisions of 10 USC 2371b, Section 815 of the 2016 National
Defense Authorization Act, P.L. 114-92, which provides the Department of Defense
(DoD) authority to enter into transactions other than contracts, grants, or
cooperative agreements, the Department of Defense (DoD) has the authority to
make awards that are directly relevant to enhancing the mission effectiveness of
military personnel and the supporting platforms, systems, components, or
materials proposed to be acquired or developed by the Department of Defense, or
the improvement of platforms, systems, components, or materials in use by the
armed forces. Section 815 revised the definition for  the term ‘nontraditional
defense contractor’ as defined in Article I. Section 1.01, Definitions.



Each MCDC Member Organization must meet the definition of a Nontraditional
Defense Contractor or have at least one Nontraditional Defense Contractor
participating to a significant extent in the performance of an awarded Project
Agreement. Examples of what might be considered a significant extent or
significant contribution include, but may not be limited to supplying new key
technologies or products, accomplishing a significant amount of the effort, or
in some other way causing a material reduction in the cost or schedule or
increase in the performance.



If significant Nontraditional Defense Contractor participation cannot be
fulfilled, the Member Organization must provide at least one third cost share of
the value of the Project Agreement awarded to the Member Organization. Proposals
that fail to comply with this requirement will not be awarded under the OTA.



Cost Sharing is not required under this Other Transaction Agreement for projects
that contain significant nontraditional defense contractor participation. Where
both Parties agree, cost sharing may be considered on a per project basis under
terms and conditions to be agreed to by the Parties and in accordance with the
“Other Transactions” (OT) Guide For Prototype Projects dated January 2001. For
traditional Government contractors without a significant nontraditional defense
contractor teaming partner, a one third cost share of the project costs is
required as described in the “Other Transaction” (OT) Guide For Prototype
Projects dated January 2001. For traditional Government contractors with
significant nontraditional defense contractor participation, cost sharing is not
required for Projects under this OTA.



Throughout the period of performance of any Project Agreement, the Government AO
and AOR will actively monitor Nontraditional Defense Contractor participation
and/or cost sharing to ensure compliance with this provision in accordance with
implementation guidance from HQDA and/or OSD. The PAH will be given the
opportunity to become compliant with the guidance should they be found
non-compliant. Failure to comply may result in termination.

Any disagreement, claim or dispute among the Parties concerning questions of
fact or law arising from or in connection with this Agreement and whether or not
involving an alleged breach of this Agreement, may be raised only under this
Article.



Whenever disputes, disagreements, or misunderstandings arise, the Parties shall
attempt to resolve the issue(s) involved by discussion and mutual agreement as
soon as practicable. In no event shall a dispute, disagreement or
misunderstanding which arose more than three (3) months prior to the
notification made under this article constitute the basis for relief under this
article unless the ACC-NJ, Center Director for Emerging Technologies, in the
interest of justice, waives this requirement.



Failing resolution by mutual agreement, the aggrieved Party shall document the
dispute, disagreement, or misunderstanding by notifying the other Party in
writing documenting the relevant facts, identifying unresolved issues,
specifying the clarification or remedy sought, and documenting the rationale as
to why the clarification/remedy is appropriate. Within ten (10) working days
after providing notice to the other Party, the aggrieved Party may, in writing,
request a decision by the ACC-NJ, Center Director for Emerging Technologies. The
other Party shall submit a written position on the matter(s) in dispute within
thirty (30) calendar days after being notified that a decision has been
requested. The ACC-NJ, Center Director for Emerging Technologies, will conduct a
review of the matter(s) in dispute and render a decision in writing within
thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of such position. Any such decision is
final and binding, unless a Party shall, within thirty (30) calendar days
request further review as provided by this article.



If requested within thirty (30) calendar days of the ACC-NJ, Center Director for
Emerging Technologies’ decision, further review will be conducted by the Chair
of the MCDC Executive Committee and the ACC-NJ Associate Director. In the event
of a decision, or in absence of a decision within sixty (60) calendar days of
referral to the Chair of the MCDC Executive Committee and the ACC-NJ, Associate
Director (or such other period as agreed to by the parties), either party may

research activities under a Project Agreement exceed the funding such entity has
received for their performance of the specific Project Agreement under which the
dispute arises.



No Party shall be liable to any other Party for [***], whether arising in
contract (including warranty), tort (whether or not arising from the negligence
of a Party) or otherwise, except to the extent such damages are caused by a
Party's [***]; Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims for contribution toward
third-party injury, damage, or loss are not limited, waived, released, or
disclaimed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 29 of 70



(2)If the PAH determines that it does not intend to retain title to any such
invention, the PAH shall notify the CMF, in writing, within nine (9) months of
disclosure. However, in any case where publication, sale or public use has
initiated the one (1) year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can
still be obtained in the United States, the period for such notice may be
shortened by the ACC-NJ through CMF to a date that is no more than six (6)
months prior to the end of the project.



(3)The PAH shall file its initial patent application on a Subject Invention to
which it elects to retain title within one (1) year after election of title or,

Upon written request to the CMF, the PAH shall convey to the Government title to
any Subject Invention under any of the following conditions:



(1)If the PAH fails to disclose or elects not to retain title to the Subject
Invention within the times specified in Section 10.03 of this Article X, Patent
Rights; provided, that the Government may only request title within sixty (60)
days after learning of the failure of the PAH to disclose or elect within the
specified times.



(2)In those countries in which the PAH fails to file patent applications within
the times specified in Section 10.03 of this Article X, Patent Rights; provided,
that if the PAH has filed a patent application in a country after times
specified in Section 10.03 of this Article X, Patent Rights, but prior to its
receipt of the written request by the Government through the CMF, the PAH shall
continue to retain title in that country; or



(3)In any country in which the PAH decides not to continue the prosecution of
any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination
or opposition proceedings on, a patent on a Subject Invention.



Section 10.05   Minimum Rights to the MCDC PAH and Protection of the MCDC PAH’s
Right to File



The Parties agree that:



(1)The PAH shall retain a non-exclusive, royalty-free license throughout the
world in each Subject Invention to which the Government obtains title, except if
the PAH fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in Section
10.03 of this Article X, Patent Rights. PAH's license extends to the domestic
(including Canada) subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, of the PAH within the
corporate structure of which the PAH is a party and includes the right to grant
licenses of the same scope to the extent that PAH was legally obligated to do so
at the time the Project Agreement was funded. The license is transferable only
with the approval of the Government, except when transferred to the successor of

application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonably
accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or
modified at the discretion of the Government to the extent the PAH, its
licensees, or the subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical
application in that foreign country.



(3)Before revocation or modification of the license, the Government shall
furnish the CMF, and the CMF shall forward to the PAH, a written notice of the
Government's intention to revoke or modify the license, and the PAH shall be
allowed thirty (30) calendar days (or such other time as may be authorized for

instruments necessary to (i) establish or confirm the rights the Government has
throughout the world in those Subject Inventions to which the PAH elects to
retain title, and (ii) convey title to the Government when requested under
Section

10.04 of this Article X, Patent Rights, and to enable the Government to obtain
patent protection throughout the world in that Subject Invention.



(2)The PAH agrees to require, by written agreement, that its employees working
on Project Agreements, other than clerical and non-technical employees, agree to
disclose promptly in writing, to personnel identified as responsible for the
administration of patent matters and in a format acceptable to the CMF, each
Subject Invention made under this Agreement in order that the CMF on behalf of
the PAH can comply with disclosure provisions of Section 10.03 of the Article X,
Patent Rights, and to execute all papers necessary to file the patent
applications on the Subject Invention and to establish the Government’s rights
in the Subject Invention. The PAH acknowledges and shall instruct its employees,
through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the
importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of
patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.



(3)The PAH shall notify the CMF of any decision not to continue the prosecution
of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or
opposition proceedings on a patent, in any country, not less than thirty (30)
days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant
patent office.



(4)The PAH shall include, within the specification of any United States patent
application and any patent issuing thereon covering a Subject Invention, the
following statement: “This invention was made with U.S. Government support under
Agreement No. W15QKN-16-9-1002 awarded by the ACC-NJ to the MCDC. The Government
has certain rights in the invention.”



Section 10.07   Lower Tier Agreements



The PAH shall include the Article X, Patent Rights, suitably modified to
identify the parties, in all lower tier agreements, regardless of tier, for
experimental, development, or research work.

made by the PAH or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include
information regarding the status of development date of first commercial sale or
use, gross royalties received by the PAH, and such other data and information as
the agency may reasonably specify. The PAH also agrees to provide additional
reports as may be requested by the Government, through CMF, in connection with
any march-in proceedings undertaken by the Government in accordance with Section
10.10 of this Article X, Patent Rights. Consistent with 35 U.S.C. § 205, the
Government agrees it shall not disclose such information to persons outside the
Government without permission of the MCDC on behalf of the PAHs.

Section 10.09   Preference for American Industry



Notwithstanding any other provision of the Article X, Patent Rights, the PAH is
not to grant to any person the exclusive right to use or sell any Subject
Invention in the United States or Canada unless such person agrees that any
product embodying the Subject Invention or produced through the use of the
Subject Invention shall be manufactured substantially in the United States or
Canada. However, in individual cases, the requirements for such an agreement may
be waived by the Government upon a showing by the PAH that reasonable but
unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to
potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the
United States or that, under the circumstances, domestic manufacture is not
commercially feasible.



Section 10.10   March-in Rights



The PAH agrees that, with respect to any Subject Invention in which its PAH has
retained title, the Government, through CMF, has the right to require the PAH to
obtain and grant a non-exclusive license to a responsible applicant or
applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the
PAH refuses such a request, the Government has the right to grant such a
licensee itself if the Government determines that:



(1)Such action is necessary because the PAH or assignee has not taken effective
steps, consistent with the intent of this Agreement, to achieve practical
application of the Subject Invention;



(2)Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not
reasonably satisfied by the PAH, assignee, or their licensees;



(3)Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use and such
requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the PAH, assignee, or licensees; or



(4)Such action is necessary because the Agreement required by Section 10.09 of
this Article X, Patent Rights, has not been obtained or waived or because a
licensee who has the exclusive right to use or sell any Subject Invention in the
United States is in the breach of such Agreement.



Section 10.11   Opportunity to Cure



Certain provisions of this Article X, Patent Rights, provide that the Government
may gain title or license to a Subject Invention by reason of the PAH’s action,
or failure to act, within the times required by this Article X, Patent Rights.
Prior to claiming such rights (including any rights under Article X, Section
10.10 March-In Rights), the Government will give written notice to MCDC, through
its CMF, and CMF will convey such written notice to PAH, of the Government's
intent, and afford the PAH a reasonable time to cure such action or failure to
act. The length of the cure period will depend on the circumstances, but in no
event will be more than 60 days. PAH may also use the cure period to show good
cause why the claiming of such title or right would be inconsistent with the
intent of this Agreement in light of the appropriate timing for introduction of
the technology in question, the relative funding and participation of the
parties in the development, and other factors.



Section 10.12   Background Information



In no event shall the provisions set forth in this Article X apply to any
Background Inventions or Patents. The PAHs or their subcontractors shall retain
the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each such
Inventions and Patents that each party has brought through MCDC to the project
issued under this Agreement and the Government shall not have any rights under
this Agreement. Projects to be funded under this Agreement will list Background

Statement of Work

For

Rapid (WF10) Advanced Research & Development to Large Scale Manufacturing of
NVX-CoV-2373 as a Vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus



RPP #: 20-11

Project Identifier: MCDC2011-001

Consortium Member: Novavax, Inc.

Title of Proposal: Rapid (WF10) Advanced Research & Development to Large Scale
Manufacturing of NVX-CoV-2373 as a Vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus

Requiring Activity: Joint Mission between the Department of Health and Human
Services and Department of Defense to Combat COVID-19



1.0INTRODUCTION, SCOPE, AND OBJECTIVES



1.1Introduction



To meet the needs of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the
United States Government (USG) is identifying and will support development and
at-scale manufacturing of selected vaccine candidates, to ensure timely
availability to the US population when needed. This is the primary focus of the
mission being executed by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and
Department of Defense (DoD), in support of Operation Warp Speed (OWS).



The USG is interested in pursuing prototype vaccines that are in an advanced
stage of development, and will support companies that can, in parallel with
nonclinical, clinical and regulatory development, rapidly establish the
manufacturing capacity required to meet the USG’s objective of supplying a safe
and effective Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
vaccine to the entire US population.  The USG is tasked with marshaling the
efforts of the US biotechnology industry to achieve this goal.



1.2Definition of the Prototype Project



Consistent with USG objectives, the “prototype project” under this agreement is
defined as the manufacture and delivery of 100M doses of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,
NVX-CoV2373, which is suitable for use in humans under a sufficiently informed
deployment strategy, and the advanced positioning of a stockpile of critical
long lead raw materials for the Matrix-M adjuvant.  As such, the “prototype
project” will effectively demonstrate Novavax’s ability to rapidly stand up
large scale manufacturing and seamlessly transition into ongoing production.



The NVX-CoV-2373 vaccine is comprised of the Matrix-M™ adjuvant, and antigen
(SARS-CoV-2 spike protein). The vaccine is filled into a multi-dose vial ([***])
and is stored at refrigerated temperature (2-8oC).



Successful development of the prototype will demonstrate Novavax’s ability to
rapidly stand up large scale manufacturing and seamlessly transition into
ongoing production capability, in order to rapidly manufacture to meet surge
requirements with little advance notification, and demonstrate capability to
stockpile and distribute large quantities of the vaccine to respond when needed,
including in order to supply use in clinical studies, under an Emergency Use
Authorization (EUA), or pursuant to other clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA).





BASE AGREEMENT NO.: 2020-530

July 2018

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 53 of 70



Successful completion of the prototype will require three coordinated and
integrated lines of effort:



a)

Large scale manufacturing, compliant with 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211, and the Drug
Supply Chain Security Act (DSCA), to the extent applicable at the time of
manufacturing by statute and FDA interpretive guidance thereof.

b)

Parallel nonclinical and clinical studies required to determine if the vaccine
is safe and effective.

c)

Compliance with all applicable U.S. regulatory requirements.



It is important to note that while results of nonclinical and clinical studies
are critical to develop use case scenarios and, in turn, inform the USG’s
deployment strategy as it relates to product manufactured under this agreement,
successful development of the prototype is dependent only on the validity of
data from these studies.  The degree to which the data are “positive” or
“negative” is not a factor in demonstration of the prototype.



1.3Follow-on Activity



This prototype project includes unpriced options for follow-on
production/procurement.  During the performance of the prototype, the USG and
Novavax will negotiate the scope and price of production/procurement.  If the
prototype project is successful, the USG may then enter into follow-on
production/procurement by executing these options through a separate stand-alone
production/procurement agreement, to be negotiated in terms of scope and price
as described in the following paragraph.



In accordance with 10.U.S.C. 2371b(f), and upon demonstration of the prototype,
or at the accomplishment of particularly favorable or unexpected results that
would justify transitioning to production/procurement, EUA, or Biologics License
Application (BLA) approved by the FDA, the USG and Novavax may enter into a
non-competitive production/procurement follow-on agreement or contract for
additional production/procurement, to partially or completely meet the USG
objective of supplying a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to vaccinate up
to 300M people in the targeted population (≈560M additional doses).



1.4Scope



Novavax has defined a scope of activities in order to successfully develop the
prototype, as defined above. The scope is based on the following assumptions
regarding manufacturing and clinical dose:



o

Manufacturing Assumptions and Clinical Dose

·

The NVX-CoV-2373 vaccine is comprised of the Matrix-M™ adjuvant, and antigen
(SARS-CoV-2 spike protein).

·

A dose range of 5-25 µg of antigen is under clinical study. The anticipated dose
based on clinical data obtained to date is [***]µg of antigen with [***]µg of
Matrix-M adjuvant.

·

For planning purposes, the [***] ([***]µg antigen/dose) has been used and the
calculations in this scope of work have been based on this dose.

·

The antigen production is the rate-limiting step in vaccine production. The
Matrix-M adjuvant will be available prior to antigen production. Dose production
has been calculated based on the availability of



BASE AGREEMENT NO.: 2020-530

July 2018

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 54 of 70



antigen.  Novavax is planning on a batch-by-batch rapid fill/finish once antigen
is manufactured and available.

·

The estimated production schedule based on the [***]µg antigen/dose (base case)
and [***] µg antigen /dose (anticipated case) is in the table below:

6.0SHIPPING PROVISIONS



The shipment of physical deliverables shall be coordinated with the AOR. Data
deliverables shall be provided in accordance with the agreement, and in
coordination with the AOR.



7.0INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, DATA RIGHTS, AND COPYRIGHTS



7.1BACKGROUND IP



(a)Ownership.  Prior to June 8, 2020, Novavax had funded the development of
NVX-CoV2373, and other antecedent vaccine programs relevant to Novavax’
proprietary position in the development of NVX-CoV2373, as well as its
sf9/baculovirus manufacturing platform, (all “Background IP”) through private
funding or in collaboration with a funding partner other than the U.S.
Government. Such private and non-governmental funding has continued since June
8, 2020 and is expected to continue during the performance of the Project
Agreement. A list of all patents and patent applications included in the
Background IP is provided below as Enclosure 4.  Background IP also consists of
(a) manufacturing know-how, including, without limitation, the NVAX-Cov2373
manufacturing process

pre-clinical and clinical research studies, analytical and process development
research, and data related to, or generated using, the Background Know-How
(collectively, “Background Data”), and (c) proprietary manufacturing materials,
including, without limitation, sf9 cell banks (master and working), baculovirus
virus stock (master and working), product standards, reference standards, and
critical reagents (“Background Materials”). On June 8, 2020, Novavax and the
U.S. Department of Defense entered into a Letter Contract for specified
U.S.-based clinical and manufacturing development of NVX-CoV2373 which
acknowledged Background IP and made no explicit U.S. Government claims to
Background IP or subsequent data arising therefrom. The U.S. Government hereby
acknowledges such Background IP in full and further acknowledges that it has no
ownership rights to Novavax Background IP under this Project Agreement.



(b) Background IP Limited License to Government.  Subject to the terms of the
Project Agreement, Novavax grants the U.S. Government a nonexclusive, worldwide,
nontransferable, non-sublicenseable license to use the Background IP to the
limited extent necessary for the U.S. Government to review and use the
Deliverables tendered by Novavax under this Agreement identified in Section 4.0
above, and for no other purpose; provided that the U.S. Government agrees that
it may not disclose the Background IP to third parties, or allow third parties
to have access to, use, practice or have practiced the Background IP, without
Novavax’s prior written consent.  To the extent that a Deliverable with
Foreground IP incorporates or uses Background IP, the Deliverable shall be
deemed and considered to comprise Background IP and shall be used by the U.S.
Government in accordance with this Background IP Limited License.



(c) Background IP License to Novavax.  Subject to the terms of the Project
Agreement, the U.S. Government grants to Novavax a nonexclusive, worldwide,
nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to any intellectual property
(including patents and patent applications) to which the U.S. Government has
rights thereto, provided that such license is limited to such intellectual
property rights necessary to perform Novavax’s obligations under the Project
Agreement.



7.2FOREGROUND IP



(a)Ownership.Notwithstanding anything in the Base Agreement to the contrary,
Novavax owns all rights, title and interest in and to any development,
modification, discovery, invention or improvement, whether or not patentable,
conceived, made, reduced to practice, or created in connection with activities
funded under the Project Agreement, including, without limitation, all data and
inventions, and intellectual property rights in any of the foregoing
(“Foreground IP”).



(b)Foreground IP Special License.  Subject to the terms of the Project
Agreement, Novavax grants the U.S. Government a nonexclusive, worldwide,
nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced the
Foreground IP for or on behalf of the U.S. Government (“Foreground IP Special
License”).



8.0 DATA RIGHTS



Article XI, §11.03 of the Base Agreement is hereby amended, consistent with the
“Specifically Negotiated License Rights” capability at Article XI, §§11.01(12)
and 11.03(4), as follows:



8.1 Data Ownership.



BASE AGREEMENT NO.: 2020-530

July 2018

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 65 of 70



Novavax owns all rights, title and interest to all Data (as defined in Article
XI, Section 11.01(7) of the Base Agreement) generated as a result of the work
performed under this Project Agreement, including Subject Data.



8.2 Rights to Data.



(a)Subject Data.  Subject to the terms of the Project Agreement, Novavax grants
to the U.S. Government a Government purpose rights license to Subject Data that
will convert to an unlimited rights license (as the term is defined in Article
XI, Section 11.01(14) of the Base Agreement)1 after three (3) years from the
date of delivery.  As used herein, “Subject Data” shall mean Technical Data
under Article XI, §11.01(13) of the Base Agreement  Deliverables that are
considered Subject Data are identified in the Deliverable Table set forth in
Section 4.0 above.



(b)Transfer of Data.  Each party, upon written request to the other party, shall
have the right to review and to request delivery of Subject Data, and delivery
of such Data shall be made to the requesting party within two weeks of the
request, except to the extent that such Data are subject to a claim of
confidentiality or privilege by a third party.



(c)Background IP Limited License.  To the extent that Subject Data incorporates
or uses Background IP, the data shall be deemed and considered to comprise
Background IP and shall be used by the U.S. Government in accordance with the
Background IP Limited License set forth in Section 7.3 above.



8.3 Background Technical Data Rights Assertions.



Novavax asserts background technical data rights as follows:



The Background Data, as defined in Section 7.1 above, was developed through
private funding or in collaboration with a funding partner other than the U.S.
Government.  Such funding is expected to continue; accordingly, Novavax asserts
Background Data as Category A Data pursuant to section 11.02(1) of the Base
Agreement and the U.S. Government shall have no rights therein.



9.0 REGULATORY RIGHTS



This agreement includes research with an investigational drug, biologic or
medical device that is regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
and requires FDA pre-market approval or clearance before commercial marketing
may begin.  It is expected that this agreement will result in the FDA
authorization, clearance and commercialization of NVX-CoV-2373 as a Vaccine for
SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus (the “Technology”).  Novavax is the Sponsor of the
Regulatory Application (an investigational new drug application (IND),
investigational device exemption (IDE), emergency use authorization (EUA), new
drug application (NDA), biologics license application (BLA), premarket approval
application (PMA), or 510(k) pre-market notification filing (510(k)) or another
regulatory filing submitted to the FDA) that controls research under this
contract.  As the Sponsor of the Regulatory Application to the FDA (as the terms
“sponsor” and “applicant” are defined or used in at 21 CFR §§3.2(c), 312.5,
600.3(t), 812.2(b), 812 Subpart C, or 814.20), Novavax has certain standing
before the FDA that entitles it to exclusive communications related to the
Regulatory Application.  This clause protects the return on research and
development investment made by the U.S. Government in the event of certain
regulatory product development failures related to the Technology.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Application submitted in support of the statement of work for the Project
Agreement. When it desires to exercise this right, the U.S. Government agrees to
notify Novavax in writing describing the request along with sufficient details
for Novavax to generate a letter of cross-reference for the U.S. Government to
file with the appropriate FDA office.  The U.S. Government agrees that such
letters of cross-reference may contain reporting requirements to enable Novavax
to comply with its own pharmacovigilance reporting obligations to the FDA and
other regulatory agencies. Nothing in this paragraph reduces the U.S.
Government’s data rights as articulated in other provisions of the Project
Agreement.



c. DoD Medical Product Priority. PL-115-92 allows the DoD to request, and FDA to
provide, assistance to expedite development and the FDA’s review of products to
