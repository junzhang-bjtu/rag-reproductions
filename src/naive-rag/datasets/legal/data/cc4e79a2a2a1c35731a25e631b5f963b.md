Re: Initial Public Offering

 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

This letter (the “Letter Agreement”) is being delivered to you in accordance
with the Underwriting Agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) entered into by
and between Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation 2, a Cayman Islands
exempted company (the “Company”) and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (the
“Representative”), relating to an underwritten initial public offering (the
“IPO”) of the Company’s ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the
“Ordinary Shares”). Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in
paragraph 13 hereof.

 

In order to induce the Company and the Representative to enter into the
Underwriting Agreement and to proceed with the IPO, and in recognition of the
benefit that such IPO will confer upon the undersigned, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the undersigned hereby agrees with the Company as follows:

 

1. If the Company solicits approval of its shareholders of a Business
Combination, the undersigned will vote all shares beneficially owned by him or
her, whether acquired before, in or after the IPO, in favor of such Business
Combination.

 

2. In the event that the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination
within the time period set forth in the Company’s Amended and Restated
Memorandum and Articles of Association, as the same may be further amended from
time to time (the “Charter”), the undersigned will, as promptly as possible,
take all necessary actions to cause the Company to (i) cease all operations
except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible,
but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the IPO Shares, at a
per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit
in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the Trust Account not
previously released to the Company (less taxes payable), divided by the number
of then outstanding IPO Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive
further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s
remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and
liquidate, subject in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii) to the Company’s
obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and
other requirements of applicable law. The undersigned hereby waives any and all
right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any distribution of the
Trust Account and any remaining net assets of the Company as a result of such
liquidation with respect to the Insider Shares owned by the undersigned.
However, if any of the undersigned have acquired IPO Shares in or after the IPO,
they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with
respect to such IPO Shares in the event that the Company fails to consummate a
Business Combination within the time period set forth in the Charter.

 





 

 

3. The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that prior to entering into a
definitive agreement for a Business Combination with a target business that is
affiliated with the undersigned or any other Insiders of the Company or their
affiliates, such transaction must be approved by a majority of the Company’s
disinterested independent directors and the Company must obtain an opinion from
an independent investment banking firm, which is a member of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, or an independent accounting firm that such
Business Combination is fair to the Company’s unaffiliated shareholders from a
financial point of view.

 

4. None of the undersigned, any member of the family of any of the undersigned,
or any affiliate of the undersigned will be entitled to receive and will not
accept any compensation or other cash payment prior to, or for services rendered
in order to effectuate, the consummation of the Business Combination; provided
that the Company shall be allowed to make the payments set forth in the
Registration Statement adjacent to the caption “Prospectus Summary—The
Offering—Limited payments to insiders.”

 

5.  

 

  (a) The undersigned agrees that the Insider Shares may not be transferred,
assigned or sold (except to certain permitted transferees as described in the
Registration Statement or herein) (the “Lockup”) until, with respect to 50% of
the Insider Shares, the earlier to occur of: (1) six (6) months after the
completion of a Business Combination and (2) the date on which the closing price
of the Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for share
splits, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like)
for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period following the
consummation of  the Company’s initial Business Combination and, with respect to
the remaining 50% of the Insider Shares, six months after the date of the
consummation of the Company’s initial Business Combination, or earlier in each
case if, subsequent to the Company’s initial Business Combination, the Company
completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction
which results in all of the Company’s shareholders having the right to exchange
their Ordinary Shares for cash, securities or other property.

 

  (b) The undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of the
Representative pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, offer, sell, contract to
sell, pledge, hedge or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction that
is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition
(whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash
settlement or otherwise) by the undersigned or any affiliate of the undersigned
or any person in privity with the undersigned or any affiliate of the
undersigned), directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in
the filing) of a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or
liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section
16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder
with respect to, any other Ordinary Shares of the Company or any securities
convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, Ordinary Shares or
publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, for a period of
180 days after the date of the Underwriting Agreement.

Purchase Agreement relating to the undersigned’s Private Placement Warrants.

 

  (d) Notwithstanding the provisions set forth in paragraphs 6(a) and (c),
transfers, assignments and sales (a “Transfer”) by the undersigned of the
Insider Shares, Private Placement Shares, Private Placement Warrants and
Ordinary Shares issued or issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement
Warrants or conversion of the Insider Shares are permitted if the Transfer (i)
is among the insiders, to the Company’s officers, directors, advisors or
employees; (ii) is to an Insider’s affiliates or its members upon liquidation;
(iii) is to relatives and trusts for estate planning purposes; (iv) is by virtue
of the law of descent and distribution upon death; (v) is pursuant to a
qualified domestic relations order; (vi) involves a private sale made at a price
no greater than the price at which the Insider Shares, Private Placement Shares,
Private Placement Warrants or Ordinary Shares were originally purchased; or
(vii) is to the Company for cancellation in connection with the consummation of
the Business Combination, in each case (except for clause (vii)) where the
transferee agrees to the terms of the escrow agreement and forfeiture, as the
case may be, as well as the other applicable restrictions and agreements of the
holders of the Insider Shares.

 

  (e) The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that if, in order to consummate
any Business Combination, the holders of Insider Shares, Private Placement
Shares or Private Placement Warrants are required to contribute back to the
capital of the Company a portion of any such securities to be cancelled by the
Company or transfer any such securities to third parties, the undersigned will
contribute back to the capital of the Company or transfer to such third parties,
at no cost, a proportionate number of Insider Shares, Private Placement Shares
or Private Placement Warrants, as applicable, pro rata with the other holders of
Insider Shares, Private Placement Shares or Private Placement Warrants, as
applicable.

 

6.  

 

  (a) In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest that may arise from
multiple corporate affiliations, the undersigned hereby agrees that until the
earliest of the Company’s initial Business Combination or liquidation, the
undersigned shall present to the Company for its consideration, prior to
presentation to any other entity, any target business that has a fair market
value of at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the
amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in trust and taxes payable on the
interest earned on the trust account), subject to any existing or future
fiduciary or contractual obligations the undersigned might have.

 

  (b) The undersigned hereby agrees and acknowledges that (i) the Representative
and the Company would be irreparably injured in the event of a breach of the
obligations under paragraph 6(a) above, (ii) monetary damages may not be an
adequate remedy for such breach and (iii) the non-breaching party shall be
entitled to injunctive relief, in addition to any other remedy that such party
may have in law or in equity, in the event of such breach.

and between Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation 2, a Cayman Islands
exempted company (the “Company”) and Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (the
“Representative”), relating to an underwritten initial public offering (the
“IPO”) of the Company’s ordinary shares, par value $0.0001 per share (the
“Ordinary Shares”). Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in
paragraph 13 hereof.

 

In order to induce the Company and the Representative to enter into the
Underwriting Agreement and to proceed with the IPO, and in recognition of the
benefit that such IPO will confer upon the undersigned, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the undersigned hereby agrees with the Company as follows:

 

1.If the Company solicits approval of its shareholders of a Business
Combination, the undersigned will vote all shares beneficially owned by him or
her, whether acquired before, in or after the IPO, in favor of such Business
Combination.

 

2.In the event that the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination
within the time period set forth in the Company’s Amended and Restated
Memorandum and Articles of Association, as the same may be further amended from
time to time (the “Charter”), the undersigned will, as promptly as possible,
take all necessary actions to cause the Company to (i) cease all operations
except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible,
but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the IPO Shares, at a
per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit
in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the Trust Account not
previously released to the Company (less taxes payable), divided by the number
of then outstanding IPO Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive
further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s
remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and
liquidate, subject in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii) to the Company’s
obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and
other requirements of applicable law. The undersigned hereby waives any and all
right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any distribution of the
Trust Account and any remaining net assets of the Company as a result of such
liquidation with respect to the Insider Shares owned by the undersigned.
However, if any of the undersigned have acquired IPO Shares in or after the IPO,
they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with
respect to such IPO Shares in the event that the Company fails to consummate a
Business Combination within the time period set forth in the Charter.

 

 

 

 

3.The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that prior to entering into a
definitive agreement for a Business Combination with a target business that is
affiliated with the undersigned or any other Insiders of the Company or their
affiliates, such transaction must be approved by a majority of the Company’s
disinterested independent directors and the Company must obtain an opinion from
an independent investment banking firm, which is a member of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, or an independent accounting firm that such
Business Combination is fair to the Company’s unaffiliated shareholders from a
financial point of view.

 

4.None of the undersigned, any member of the family of any of the undersigned,
or any affiliate of the undersigned will be entitled to receive and will not
accept any compensation or other cash payment prior to, or for services rendered
in order to effectuate, the consummation of the Business Combination; provided

In order to induce the Company and the Representative to enter into the
Underwriting Agreement and to proceed with the IPO, and in recognition of the
benefit that such IPO will confer upon the undersigned, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the undersigned hereby agrees with the Company as follows:

 

1.If the Company solicits approval of its shareholders of a Business
Combination, the undersigned will vote all shares beneficially owned by him or
her, whether acquired before, in or after the IPO, in favor of such Business
Combination.

 

2.In the event that the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination
within the time period set forth in the Company’s Amended and Restated
Memorandum and Articles of Association, as the same may be further amended from
time to time (the “Charter”), the undersigned will, as promptly as possible,
take all necessary actions to cause the Company to (i) cease all operations
except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible,
but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the IPO Shares, at a
per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit
in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the Trust Account not
previously released to the Company (less taxes payable), divided by the number
of then outstanding IPO Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive
further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s
remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and
liquidate, subject in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii) to the Company’s
obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and
other requirements of applicable law. The undersigned hereby waives any and all
right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any distribution of the
Trust Account and any remaining net assets of the Company as a result of such
liquidation with respect to the Insider Shares owned by the undersigned.
However, if any of the undersigned have acquired IPO Shares in or after the IPO,
they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with
respect to such IPO Shares in the event that the Company fails to consummate a
Business Combination within the time period set forth in the Charter.

definitive agreement for a Business Combination with a target business that is
affiliated with the undersigned or any other Insiders of the Company or their
affiliates, such transaction must be approved by a majority of the Company’s
disinterested independent directors and the Company must obtain an opinion from
an independent investment banking firm, which is a member of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, or an independent accounting firm that such
Business Combination is fair to the Company’s unaffiliated shareholders from a
financial point of view.

 

4.None of the undersigned, any member of the family of any of the undersigned,
or any affiliate of the undersigned will be entitled to receive and will not

her, whether acquired before, in or after the IPO, in favor of such Business
Combination.

 

2.In the event that the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination
within the time period set forth in the Company’s Amended and Restated
Memorandum and Articles of Association, as the same may be further amended from
time to time (the “Charter”), the undersigned will, as promptly as possible,
take all necessary actions to cause the Company to (i) cease all operations
except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible,

per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit
in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the Trust Account not
previously released to the Company (less taxes payable), divided by the number
of then outstanding IPO Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive
further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s
remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and
liquidate, subject in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii) to the Company’s
obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and
other requirements of applicable law. The undersigned hereby waives any and all
right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any distribution of the
Trust Account and any remaining net assets of the Company as a result of such
liquidation with respect to the Insider Shares owned by the undersigned.
However, if any of the undersigned have acquired IPO Shares in or after the IPO,
they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with
respect to such IPO Shares in the event that the Company fails to consummate a
Business Combination within the time period set forth in the Charter.

definitive agreement for a Business Combination with a target business that is

an independent investment banking firm, which is a member of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, or an independent accounting firm that such
Business Combination is fair to the Company’s unaffiliated shareholders from a
financial point of view.

 

4.None of the undersigned, any member of the family of any of the undersigned,
or any affiliate of the undersigned will be entitled to receive and will not

In order to induce the Company and the Representative to enter into the

take all necessary actions to cause the Company to (i) cease all operations
except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible,
but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the IPO Shares, at a
per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit
in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the Trust Account not
previously released to the Company (less taxes payable), divided by the number
of then outstanding IPO Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive
further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s
remaining shareholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and
liquidate, subject in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii) to the Company’s
obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and
other requirements of applicable law. The undersigned hereby waives any and all
right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any distribution of the
Trust Account and any remaining net assets of the Company as a result of such
liquidation with respect to the Insider Shares owned by the undersigned.
However, if any of the undersigned have acquired IPO Shares in or after the IPO,
they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with
respect to such IPO Shares in the event that the Company fails to consummate a
Business Combination within the time period set forth in the Charter.

 



 

 

3. The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that prior to entering into a
definitive agreement for a Business Combination with a target business that is
affiliated with the undersigned or any other Insiders of the Company or their
affiliates, such transaction must be approved by a majority of the Company’s
disinterested independent directors and the Company must obtain an opinion from
an independent investment banking firm, which is a member of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority, or an independent accounting firm that such
Business Combination is fair to the Company’s unaffiliated shareholders from a
financial point of view.

 

4. None of the undersigned, any member of the family of any of the undersigned,
or any affiliate of the undersigned will be entitled to receive and will not
accept any compensation or other cash payment prior to, or for services rendered
in order to effectuate, the consummation of the Business Combination; provided
that the Company shall be allowed to make the payments set forth in the
Registration Statement adjacent to the caption “Prospectus Summary—The
Offering—Limited payments to insiders.”

 

5. In the event of the liquidation of the Trust Fund, the undersigned agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company against any and all loss, liability,
claims, damage and expense whatsoever (including, but not limited to, any and
all legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending against any litigation, whether pending or threatened, or any claim
whatsoever) which the Company may become subject as a result of any claim by any
target business or vendor or other person who is owed money by the Company for
services rendered or products sold or contracted for, but only to the extent
necessary to ensure that such loss, liability, claim, damage or expense does not
reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Fund; provided that such indemnity shall
not apply if such target business, vendor or other person has executed an
agreement waiving any claims against the Trust Fund.

 

  (a) The undersigned agrees that the Insider Shares may not be transferred,
assigned or sold (except to certain permitted transferees as described in the
Registration Statement or herein) (the “Lockup”) until, with respect to 50% of
the Insider Shares, the earlier to occur of: (1) six (6) months after the
completion of a Business Combination and (2) the date on which the closing price
of the Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for share
splits, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like)
for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period following the
consummation of  the Company’s initial Business Combination and, with respect to
the remaining 50% of the Insider Shares, six months after the date of the
consummation of the Company’s initial Business Combination, or earlier in each
case if, subsequent to the Company’s initial Business Combination, the Company
completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction
which results in all of the Company’s shareholders having the right to exchange
their Ordinary Shares for cash, securities or other property.

 

  (b) The undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of the
Representative pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, offer, sell, contract to
sell, pledge, hedge or otherwise dispose of (or enter into any transaction that
is designed to, or might reasonably be expected to, result in the disposition
(whether by actual disposition or effective economic disposition due to cash
settlement or otherwise) by the undersigned or any affiliate of the undersigned
or any person in privity with the undersigned or any affiliate of the
undersigned), directly or indirectly, including the filing (or participation in
the filing) of a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in respect of, or establish or increase a put equivalent position or
liquidate or decrease a call equivalent position within the meaning of Section
16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated thereunder
with respect to, any other Ordinary Shares of the Company or any securities
convertible into, or exercisable, or exchangeable for, Ordinary Shares or
publicly announce an intention to effect any such transaction, for a period of
180 days after the date of the Underwriting Agreement.

transferee agrees to the terms of the escrow agreement and forfeiture, as the
case may be, as well as the other applicable restrictions and agreements of the
holders of the Insider Shares.

 

  (e) The undersigned acknowledges and agrees that if, in order to consummate
any Business Combination, the holders of Insider Shares, Private Placement
Shares or Private Placement Warrants are required to contribute back to the
capital of the Company a portion of any such securities to be cancelled by the
Company or transfer any such securities to third parties, the undersigned will
contribute back to the capital of the Company or transfer to such third parties,
at no cost, a proportionate number of Insider Shares, Private Placement Shares
or Private Placement Warrants, as applicable, pro rata with the other holders of
Insider Shares, Private Placement Shares or Private Placement Warrants, as
applicable.
