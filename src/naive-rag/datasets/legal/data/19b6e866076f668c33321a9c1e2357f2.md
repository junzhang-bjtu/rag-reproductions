purchase all or any portion of the Remaining New Common Shares and Remaining

aggregate number of Remaining New Common Shares and Remaining First Lien Term
Loans that have not been purchased as a result of such Funding Default (such

any Replacing Backstop Party in connection with a Replacement Purchase shall be

delivery of written notice of a Funding Default, electing Backstop Parties will
fund the Subscription Account with the additional Purchase Price with respect to
the Replacement Purchase.

If a Backstop Party is a Defaulting Backstop Party, it shall not be entitled to
any Backstop Commitment Premium hereunder and the aggregate Backstop Commitment
Premium shall be reduced ratably upon a Funding Default based on the Defaulting

sufficient to cure all or a portion of the Funding Default occurs, the Backstop
Commitment Premium shall only be ratably reduced to the extent of the uncured
Funding Default, and such amount that would have otherwise been reduced shall be
paid to the Replacing Backstop Parties, as applicable.

 

  2.4.3

each Backstop Party and its Affiliates, equity holders, members, partners,
general partners, managers and its and their respective representatives,
attorneys, and controlling Persons (each, an “Indemnified Person”) from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and costs and expenses
(other than taxes of the Backstop Parties except to the extent otherwise
provided for in this Agreement) (collectively, “Indemnified Losses”) that any
such Indemnified Person may incur or to which any such Indemnified Person may
become subject arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, or any
claim, challenge, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the
foregoing, regardless of whether any Indemnified Person is a party thereto,
whether or not such proceedings are brought by the

 

35



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Company, the other Company Parties, their respective equity holders,
Affiliates, creditors or any other Person, and reimburse each Indemnified Person
upon demand for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket legal or other
third-party expenses of counsel (which, so long as there are no actual conflicts
of interests among such Indemnified Persons, shall be limited to one law firm
serving as counsel for the Indemnified Persons (in addition to one local counsel
in each applicable jurisdiction) incurred in connection with investigating,
preparing to defend or defending, or providing evidence in or preparing to serve
or serving as a witness with respect to, any lawsuit, investigation, claim or
other proceeding relating to any of the foregoing (including in connection with
the enforcement of the indemnification obligations set forth herein),
irrespective of whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Plan are consummated or whether or not this Agreement is terminated;
provided, that the foregoing indemnity will not, as to any Indemnified Person,
apply to Indemnified Losses (a) as to a Defaulting Backstop Party, its
Affiliates or any Indemnified Person related thereto, caused by a default or
breach of this Agreement by such Defaulting Backstop Party (or Indemnified
Persons related thereto), or (b) to the extent they are found by a final,
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to arise from the
bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnified Person.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Parties will not be liable for, and no Indemnified Person shall claim or seek to
recover, any punitive, special, indirect or consequential damages or damages for
lost profits.

 

7.2

Indemnification Procedure

Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Person of notice of the commencement of
any indemnified claim, challenge, litigation, investigation or proceeding (an
“Indemnified Claim”), such Indemnified Person will, if a claim is to be made
hereunder against an Indemnifying Party in respect thereof, notify such
Indemnifying Party in writing of the commencement thereof; provided, that
(a) the omission to so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have hereunder except to the
extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and (b) the omission to
so notify the Indemnifying Party will not relieve the Indemnifying Party from
any liability that it may have to such Indemnified Person other than on account
of this Section 7.2 or otherwise under this Agreement. In case any such
Indemnified Claims are brought against any Indemnified Person and it notifies
the Indemnifying Party of the commencement thereof, the Indemnifying Party will
be entitled to participate therein, and, at its election by providing written
notice to such Indemnified Person, the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to
assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably acceptable to such
Indemnified Person; provided, that if the parties (including any impleaded
parties) to any such Indemnified Claims include both such Indemnified Person and
the Indemnifying Party and based on advice of such Indemnified Person’s counsel
there are legal defenses available to such Indemnified Person that are different
from or additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, such
Indemnified Person shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert
such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such
Indemnified Claims. Upon receipt of notice from the Indemnifying Party to such
Indemnified Person of its election to so assume the defense of such Indemnified
Claims with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Person, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such

 

36



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Indemnified Person for expenses incurred by such Indemnified Person in
connection with the defense thereof or participation therein (other than
reasonable and documented costs of investigation) unless (a) such Indemnified
Person shall have employed separate counsel (in addition to any local counsel)
in connection with the assertion of legal defenses in accordance with the
proviso to the immediately preceding sentence (it being understood, however,
that the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for the expenses of more than
one separate counsel representing the Indemnified Persons who are parties to
such Indemnified Claims (in addition to one local counsel in each applicable
jurisdiction)), (b) after the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the
Indemnified Claims, the Indemnified Person determines in good faith that the
Indemnifying Party has failed or is failing to defend such claim and provides
written notice of such determination and the basis for such determination, and
such failure is not reasonably cured within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of
such notice, or (d) the Indemnifying Party shall have authorized in writing the
employment of counsel for such Indemnified Person. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have sole control
over any tax controversy or tax audit and shall be permitted to settle any
liability for taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

 

7.3

Settlement of Indemnified Claims. In connection with any Indemnified Claim for
which an Indemnified Person is assuming the defense in accordance with this
Section 7.3, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement,
compromise, or consent to the entry of any judgment of any Indemnified Claims
effected by such Indemnified Person without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If any settlement compromise, or consent to the entry
of any judgment of any Indemnified Claims is consummated with the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party or if there is a final judgment for the
plaintiff in any such Indemnified Claims, the Indemnifying Party agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnified Person from and against any and all
Indemnified Losses by reason of such settlement, compromise, consent to the
entry of any judgment or judgment to the extent such Indemnified Losses are
otherwise subject to indemnification by the Indemnifying Party hereunder in
accordance with, and subject to the limitations of, this Section 7.3. The
Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written consent of an
Indemnified Person (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement compromise, consent to the entry
of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened Indemnified Claims in
respect of which indemnity or contribution has been sought hereunder by such
Indemnified Person unless (a) such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on the
claims that are the subject matter of such Indemnified Claims and (b) such
settlement, compromise or consent does not include any statement as to or any
admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Person.

 

7.4

Contribution. If for any reason the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to
any Indemnified Person or insufficient to hold it harmless from Indemnified
Losses that are subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 7.1, then the
Indemnifying Party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Person as a result of such loss in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect not only the relative benefits received by

 

37



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and such Indemnified Person, on the
other hand, but also the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party, on the one
hand, and such Indemnified Person, on the other hand, as well as any relevant
equitable considerations. It is hereby agreed that the relative benefits to the
Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and all Indemnified Persons, on the other
hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as (a) the total value
received or proposed to be received by the Company pursuant to the issuance and
sale of the unsubscribed New Common Shares and First Lien Exit Facility in the
Rights Offering contemplated by this Agreement and the Plan bears to (b) the
Backstop Commitment Premium paid or proposed to be paid to the Backstop Parties.
The Indemnifying Parties also agree that no Indemnified Person shall have any
liability based on their comparative or contributory negligence or otherwise to
the Indemnifying Parties, any Person asserting claims on behalf of or in right
of any of the Indemnifying Parties, or any other Person in connection with an
Indemnified Claim.

 

7.5

Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All amounts paid by an Indemnifying Party
to an Indemnified Person under this Article 7 shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all tax
purposes. The provisions of this Article 7 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without these provisions the
Backstop Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. The Approval Order
shall provide that the obligations of the Company under this Article 7 shall
constitute allowed administrative expenses of the Debtors’ estate under sections
503(b) and 507 of the Bankruptcy Code and are payable without further order of
the Bankruptcy Court, and that the Company may comply with the requirements of
this Article 7 without further order of the Bankruptcy Court.

under this Agreement in the event that such

not a party to this Agreement, such assignee shall be required, by delivery of
an executed agreement in substantially the form attached as Exhibit C hereto (a
“Joinder Agreement”), to be bound by the obligations of such assignee’s
assigning Backstop Party hereunder and under the RSA. Upon the effectiveness of
any assignment pursuant to this Section 8.2, the Company shall update Schedule 1
hereto to reflect such assignment.

 

8.3

forth in Section 2.3.1 and the covenants set forth in Section 5.3, shall survive

with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements and representations, written or oral, with respect thereto.
To the extent there is an inconsistency between the provisions in this Agreement

this Agreement shall control. To the extent there is an inconsistency between
the provisions in this Agreement and the Plan, the Plan shall control; provided,
that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan (including any
amendments, supplements or modifications thereto) or the Confirmation Order (and
any amendments, supplements or modifications thereto) or an affirmative vote to
accept the Plan submitted by any Backstop Party, nothing contained in the Plan
(including any amendments, supplements or modifications thereto) or Confirmation
Order (including any amendments, supplements or modifications thereto) shall
alter, amend or modify the rights of the Backstop Parties under this Agreement
unless such alteration, amendment or modification has been made in accordance
with Section 8.5.

 

8.5

Waivers and Amendments. This Agreement may be amended, modified or superseded,
and the terms and conditions of this Agreement may be waived, only by a written
instrument signed by the Company and the Backstop Parties representing a
majority of the aggregate Backstop Commitment of all Backstop Parties (the
“Required Backstop Parties”). No delay on the part of any Party in exercising
any right, power or privilege pursuant to this Agreement will operate as a
waiver thereof. No waiver on the part of any Party of any right, power or
privilege pursuant to this Agreement, nor any single or partial exercise of any
right, power or privilege pursuant to this Agreement, shall preclude any other
or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege pursuant to this Agreement. The rights and remedies provided pursuant
to this Agreement

 

40



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which any Party
otherwise may have at law or in equity. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

Purchase Obligation or any other funding or financial obligation of any Backstop
Party, shall be effective against any Backstop Party without such Backstop
Party’s prior written consent.

contract, in tort, or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of, or relate
to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the
State of New York, without giving effect to any conflict of laws principles that
would require the application of the Law of any other jurisdiction. Each Party
hereby irrevocably submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York located in the Borough of
Manhattan, for purposes of all legal proceedings arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each Party irrevocably

or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such proceeding brought in such
a court and any claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the
pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, all proceedings contemplated by this
Section 8.6 shall be brought in the Bankruptcy Court.

 

8.7

Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each

not seek to terminate this Agreement based upon a material breach arising out of

  8.10.4

the Company provides written notice of such determination to the Backstop
Parties within one (1) Business Day after the date of such determination; or

dismissed, vacated, reconsidered, or modified or amended without the consent of
the Required Backstop Parties, (iii) of a breach in any material respect by any
Company Party of any representation or warranty in this Agreement, or of any
such representation or warranty becoming inaccurate in any material respect, in
each case if such breach or inaccuracy would, individually or in the aggregate
for all such breaches or inaccuracies, prevent the satisfaction of any condition
to the effectiveness of the Plan, or the Company’s or any Backstop Party’s
performance of any of its obligations hereunder or under the RSA, if such breach
or inaccuracy has not been waived by the Required Backstop Parties or cured
within five (5) Business Days after the delivery of written notice thereof by
the Backstop Parties, (iv) any of the Milestones is not satisfied, other than
solely due to the actions of the Required Backstop Parties in violation of this
Agreement, or (v) the Effective Date shall not have occurred within 80 days
after the Petition Dateas of 11:59 p.m. prevailing Central Time on December 31,
2020; provided, however, that no Backstop Party may seek to terminate this

Agreement).

Section 3.8 - No Violation; Compliance with Laws

On October 8, 2020, the SEC filed a complaint against the Company and Jeffrey
Hastings, Brent Whiteley, Brian Beatty, and Michael Scott (the “SEC Defendants”)
in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York captioned U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, v. SAExploration Holdings, Inc. et al. Civil
Action No. 1:20-CV-8423 (the “SEC Lawsuit”). The SEC Lawsuit charges the SEC
Defendants with violating Section 17(a)(1) and (3) of the Securities Act and
Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) thereunder. It
further charges the Company with violating Securities Act Section 17(a)(2) and
Exchange Act Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(A), and 13(b)(2)(B), and Rules 10b-5(b),
12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-11, 13a-13 thereunder, and that Messrs. Hastings, Whiteley,
Beatty, and Scott aided and abetted those violations. Additionally, the SEC
Lawsuit charges Messrs. Hastings, Whiteley, Beatty, and Scott with violating
Exchange Act Section 13(b)(5) and Rule 13b2-1 thereunder, and Messrs. Hastings,
Whiteley, and Beatty with also violating Exchange Act Rules 10b-5(b), 13a-14,
and 13b2-2. The SEC seeks a permanent injunction against the Company and
permanent injunctions, civil penalties, disgorgement of allegedly ill-gotten
gains with prejudgment interest, and officer-and-director bars against Messrs.
Hastings, Whiteley, Beatty, and Scott. Additionally, the SEC seeks to have
Messrs. Hastings, Whiteley, and Beatty reimburse the Company for incentive-based
compensation pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

On September 11, 2020, in a parallel action to the SEC Lawsuit, the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York filed a complaint
against Jeffrey Hastings charging him, with among other claims, securities
fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracies to commit the same.

On October 27, 2020, the State of Alaska, Department of Revenue (the “DOR”)
filed a notice with the Bankruptcy Court [Docket No. 263] (the “DOR Notice”)
notifying the debtor, creditors, court, and others that the tax credits held by
the Debtors in the Chapter 11 Cases may be valueless based on allegations of
criminal fraud in obtaining the credits. In the DOR Notice, the DOR stated that
“[i]t is highly likely that the State will determine those tax credits held by
debtor are valueless” and that “[p]rospective bidders in this bankruptcy should
anticipate accordingly.”
