lawfully paid under the laws of the state of organization of the Company, and

corresponding distribution to be made to all holders of OP Units, the Conversion
Factor shall be adjusted so that the same shall equal the ratio determined by

receive such distribution by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the
daily market price per REIT Share on the date fixed for such determination, and

the Company has an equity or other interests and such Persons may borrow funds
from, and lend or contribute funds or assets to, the Partnership, on terms and
conditions established by the General Partner, following the direction and
approval of the Board of Directors.  The foregoing authority shall not create
any right or benefit in favor of any Subsidiary or any other Person.

B.Except as provided in Section 7.5, the Partnership may transfer assets to
joint ventures, other partnerships, limited liability companies, real estate
investment trusts, corporations or other business entities in which it is or

Section 7.7.  Indemnification

A.To the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, the Partnership shall
indemnify each Indemnitee from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys’ fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines,
settlements, and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands,
actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
that relate to the operations of the Partnership or the Company as set forth in
this Agreement, in which such Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be
involved, as a party or otherwise, except to the extent such Indemnitee acted in
bad faith, or with gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Without limitation,
the foregoing indemnity shall extend to any liability of any Indemnitee,
pursuant to a loan guaranty or otherwise for any indebtedness of the Partnership
or any Subsidiary of the Partnership (including without limitation, any
indebtedness which the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership has
assumed or taken subject to), and the General Partner is hereby authorized and
empowered, on behalf of the Partnership, to enter into one or more indemnity
agreements consistent with the provisions of this Section 7.7 in favor of any
Indemnitee having or potentially having liability for any such
indebtedness.  Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be made
only out of the assets of the Partnership, and neither the General Partner nor
any Limited Partner shall have any obligation to contribute to the capital of
the Partnership, or otherwise provide funds, to enable the Partnership to fund
its obligations under this Section 7.7.

27

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

B.Reasonable expenses incurred by an Indemnitee who is a party to a proceeding
shall be paid or reimbursed by the Partnership in advance of the final
disposition of the proceeding, upon receipt by the Partnership of an undertaking
by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be determined
that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in Section
7.7(A).

C.The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 shall be in addition to any
other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person may be entitled under
any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as a matter of law or
otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in
such capacity unless otherwise provided in a written agreement pursuant to which
such Indemnitees are indemnified.

D.The Partnership may purchase and maintain insurance, on behalf of the
Indemnitees and such other Persons as the General Partner shall determine,
against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses that may be
incurred by such Person in connection with the Partnership’s activities,
regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such
Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.

E.For purposes of this Section 7.7, the Partnership shall be deemed to have
requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants or
beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect
to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute fines
within the meaning of this Section 7.7; and actions taken or omitted by the
Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan in the performance of its
duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose
which is not opposed to the best interests of the Partnership.

F.In no event may an Indemnitee subject any of the Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

G.An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under
this Section 7.7 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with
respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise
permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

H.The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees,
their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to
create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.  Any amendment,
modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 or any provision hereof shall be
prospective only and shall not in any way affect the Partnership’s liability to
any Indemnitee under this Section 7.7, as in effect immediately prior to such
amendment, modification, or repeal with respect to claims arising from or
relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment,
modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.

“Covered Persons”) shall be liable for monetary damages to the Partnership, any
Partners or any Assignees for losses sustained or liabilities incurred as a
result of errors in judgment or of any act or omission if the Covered Person’s
conduct did not constitute bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct.

on behalf of the Partnership, the Limited Partners and the Company collectively,
that the General Partner is under no obligation to consider the separate
interests of the Limited Partners (except as otherwise provided herein) in

actions.  In the event of a conflict between the interests of the Company on the
one hand and the Limited Partners on the other, the General Partner shall,
consult with the Board of Directors, endeavor in good faith to resolve the
conflict in a manner not adverse to either the Company or the Limited Partners;
provided, however, that any such conflict that the General Partner in good faith
determines cannot be resolved in a manner not adverse to either the Company or
the Limited Partners shall be resolved in favor of the Company.  The General
Partner shall not be liable for monetary damages for losses sustained,
liabilities incurred, or benefits not derived by Limited Partners in connection
with such decisions; provided, that the General Partner has acted in good faith.

C.Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in Section
7.1(A) hereof, the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to it
by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either
directly or by or through its employees and agents.

D.Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any provision
hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations
on the Covered Person’s liability to the Partnership and the Limited Partners
under this Section 7.8 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment,
modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to
matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or
repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.

E.To the extent that, at law or in equity, a Covered Person has duties
(including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Partnership
or to the Partners, any Covered Person acting under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any Partner for its good faith
reliance on the provisions of this Agreement.  The provisions of this Agreement,
to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of a Covered Person
otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners to replace
such other duties and liabilities of such Covered Person.

obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers and

authority to do and perform each and every act and duty which is permitted or
required to be done by the General Partner hereunder.

D.Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or the Act, any action
of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or any decision of the

REIT; (ii) for the Company to otherwise satisfy the REIT Requirements; or (iii)
to avoid the Company incurring any taxes under Section 337(d), 857, 1374 or 4981

with any such dealing.  In no event shall any Person dealing with the General
Partner or its representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of this

of any act or action of the General Partner or its representatives.  Each and
every certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of the

that (i) at the time of the execution and delivery of such certificate, document
or instrument, this Agreement was in full force and effect; (ii) the Person
executing and delivering such certificate, document or instrument was duly

No Limited Partner or Assignee (other than the General Partner, any of its
Affiliates or any officer, trustee, director, member, employee or agent of the
General Partner, the Partnership or any of their Affiliates, in their capacity
as such) shall take part in the operation, management or control (within the
meaning of the Act) of the Partnership’s business, transact any business in the
Partnership’s name or have the power to sign documents for or otherwise bind the
Partnership. The transaction of any such business by the General Partner, any of
its Affiliates or any officer, trustee, director, member, employee or agent of
the General Partner, the Partnership or any of their Affiliates, in their
capacity as such, shall not affect, impair or eliminate the limitations on the
liability of the Limited Partners or Assignees under this Agreement.

Section 8.3.  Outside Activities of Limited Partners

Subject to any agreements entered into by a Limited Partner or its Affiliates
with the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries, any Limited Partner (other than
the Company) and any officer, trustee, director, member, employee, agent,

to and may have business interests and engage in business activities in addition
to those relating to the Partnership, including business interests and
activities that are in direct competition with the Partnership or that are
enhanced by the activities of the Partnership.  Neither the Partnership nor any
Partners shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement in any business
ventures of any Limited Partner or Assignee. None of the Limited Partners (other
than the Company) nor any other Person shall have any rights by virtue of this
Agreement or the Partnership relationship established hereby in any business
ventures of any other Person and such Person shall have no obligation pursuant
to this Agreement to offer any interest in any such business ventures to the
Partnership, any Limited Partner or any such other Person, even if such
opportunity is of a character which, if presented to the Partnership, any
Limited Partner or such other Person, could be taken by such Person.

Section 8.4.  Return of Capital

Except pursuant to the right of redemption set forth in Section 8.6, no Limited
Partner shall be entitled to the withdrawal or return of its Capital
Contribution, except to the extent of distributions made pursuant to this

the extent provided by Exhibit C hereof or as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, no Limited Partner or Assignee shall have priority over any
other Limited Partner or Assignee, either as to the return of Capital
Contributions or as to profits, losses or distributions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Section 8.5.  Rights of Limited Partners Relating to the Partnership

A.In addition to the other rights provided by this Agreement or by the Act, and
except as limited by Section 8.5(C), each Limited Partner shall have the right,
for a purpose reasonably related to such Limited Partner’s interest as a limited
partner in the Partnership, upon written demand with a statement of the purpose
of such demand and at such Limited Partner’s own expense (including such copying
and administrative charges as the General Partner may establish from time to
time):

(1)to obtain a copy of the Partnership’s federal, state and local income tax
returns for each Partnership Year;

(2)to obtain a copy of this Agreement and the Certificate and all amendments
thereto, together with executed copies of all powers of attorney pursuant to
which this Agreement, the Certificate and all amendments thereto have been
executed; and

(3)to obtain true and full information regarding the amount of cash and a
description and statement of any other property or services contributed by each
Partner and which each Partner has agreed to contribute in the future, and the
date on which each became a Partner.

B.The Partnership shall notify each Limited Partner, upon request, of the then
current Conversion Factor.

C.Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8.5, the General Partner
may keep confidential from the Limited Partners for such period of time as the
General Partner determines, following the direction and approval of the Board of
Directors to be reasonable, any information that (i) the General Partner
reasonably believes to be in the nature of trade secrets or other information,
the disclosure of which the General Partner in good faith believes is not in the
best interests of the Partnership or could damage the Partnership or its
business; or (ii) the Partnership is required by law or by agreements with an
unaffiliated third party to keep confidential.

Upon written request by any Limited Partner, the General Partner shall cause the
ownership of Partnership Interests by such Limited Partner to be evidenced by a
certificate in such form as the General Partner may determine with respect to
any class of Partnership Interests issued from time to time under this
Agreement. The General Partner may direct a new certificate or certificates to
be issued in place of any certificate or certificates theretofore issued by the
Partnership alleged to have been lost, destroyed, stolen or mutilated, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate to be
lost, destroyed, stolen or mutilated. Unless otherwise determined by the General
Partner, the owner of such lost, destroyed, stolen or mutilated certificate or
certificates, or his or her legal representative, shall be required, as a
condition precedent to the issuance of a new certificate or certificates, to
give the Partnership a bond in such sum as the General Partner may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against the Partnership.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Section 8.6.  Redemption Right

A.Subject to Sections 8.6(B) and 8.6(C) hereof and at any time on or after such
date as expressly provided for in any agreement entered into between the
Partnership and any Limited Partner, each holder of a Common Unit (if other than
the General Partner) shall have the right (the “Redemption Right”) to require
the Partnership to redeem on a Specified Redemption Date all or a portion of the
Partnership Units (provided that such Partnership Units constitute Common Units)
held by such holder at a redemption price equal to and in the form of the Cash
Amount to be paid by the Partnership; provided that the Partnership Units shall
have been outstanding for at least one year; provided, further, that the General
Partner, following the direction and approval of the Board of Directors, may
allow a holder to exercise its Redemption Right prior to the Common Units being
outstanding for one year in its discretion.  The Redemption Right shall be
exercised pursuant to a Notice of Redemption delivered to the Partnership (with
a copy to the General Partner) by the holder who is exercising the redemption
right (the “Redeeming Partner”); provided, however, that the Partnership shall
not be obligated to satisfy such Redemption Right if the Operating Partnership
elects to purchase the Partnership Units subject to the Notice of Redemption
pursuant to Section 8.6(B).  A holder under this Section 8.6(A) may not exercise
the Redemption Right for less than 1,000 Partnership Units at any one time or,
if such holder holds less than 1,000 Partnership Units, all of the Partnership
Units held by such Partner.  The Redeeming Partner shall have no right, with
respect to any Partnership Units so redeemed, to receive any distributions paid
on or after the Specified Redemption Date.  The Assignee of any holder herein
may exercise the rights of such Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 8.6(A),
and such Limited Partner shall be deemed to have assigned such rights to such
Assignee and shall be bound by the exercise of such rights by such Assignee.  In
connection with any exercise of such rights by an Assignee on behalf of a holder
in this Section 8.6(A), the Cash Amount shall be paid by the Partnership
directly to such Assignee and not to such holder.  Any Partnership Units
redeemed by the Partnership pursuant to this Section 8.6(A) shall be cancelled
upon such redemption.

34

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

B.Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.6(A), a Limited Partner that
exercises the Redemption Right shall be deemed to have offered to sell the
Partnership Units described in the Notice of Redemption to the Operating
Partnership, and the Operating Partnership may, in its sole and absolute
discretion, elect to purchase directly and acquire such Partnership Units by
paying to the Redeeming Partner either the Cash Amount or the OP Unit Amount, as
elected by the Operating Partnership in its sole and absolute discretion, on the
Specified Redemption Date, whereupon the Operating Partnership shall acquire the
Partnership Units offered for redemption by the Redeeming Partner and shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the owner of such Partnership
Units.  If the Operating Partnership shall elect to exercise its right to
purchase Partnership Units under this Section 8.6(B) with respect to a Notice of
Redemption, it shall so notify the Redeeming Partner within five Business Days
after the receipt by it of such Notice of Redemption.  Unless the Operating
Partnership (in its sole and absolute discretion) shall exercise its right to
purchase Partnership Units from the Redeeming Partner pursuant to this Section
8.6(B), the Operating Partnership shall not have any obligation to the Redeeming
Partner or the Partnership with respect to the Redeeming Partner’s exercise of
the Redemption Right.  In the event the Operating Partnership shall exercise its
right to purchase Partnership Units with respect to the exercise of a Redemption
Right in the manner described in the first sentence of this Section 8.6(B), the
Partnership shall have no obligation to pay any amount to the Redeeming Partner
with respect to such Redeeming Partner’s exercise of such Redemption Right, and
each of the Redeeming Partner, the Partnership and the Operating Partnership
shall treat the transaction between the Operating Partnership and the Redeeming
Partner, for federal income tax purposes, as a sale of the Redeeming Partner’s
Partnership Units to the Operating Partnership.  Each Redeeming Partner agrees
to execute such documents as the Operating Partnership may reasonably require in
connection with the issuance of OP Units upon exercise of the Redemption
Right.  In case of any reclassification of OP Units (including, but not limited
to, any reclassification upon a consolidation or merger in which the Operating
Partnership is the surviving entity) into securities other than OP Units, for
purposes of this Section 8.6(B), the Operating Partnership (or its successor)
may thereafter exercise its right to purchase Partnership Units for the kind and
amount of shares of such securities receivable upon such reclassification by a
holder of the number of OP Units for which such Partnership Units could be
purchased pursuant to this Section immediately prior to such reclassification.

C.Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.6(A) and Section 8.6(B), a Partner
shall not be entitled to exercise the Redemption Right pursuant to Section
8.6(A) to the extent that the delivery of OP Units to such Partner on the
Specified Redemption Date by the Operating Partnership pursuant to Section
8.6(B) (regardless of whether or not the Operating Partnership would in fact
exercise its rights under Section 8.6(B)) would (i) be prohibited, as determined
in the sole discretion of the Operating Partnership, by law or any other
agreement applicable to the Operating Partnership or (ii) cause the acquisition
of OP Units by such Partner to be “integrated” with any other distribution of OP
Units for purposes of complying with the Securities Act.

35

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

D.Each Partner covenants and agrees that all Partnership Units delivered for
redemption shall be delivered to the Partnership free and clear of all liens;
and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Partnership
shall be under no obligation to acquire Partnership Units which are or may be
subject to any liens. Each Partner further agrees that, if any state or local
property transfer tax is payable as a result of the transfer of its Partnership
Units to the Partnership, such Partner shall assume and pay such transfer tax.

ARTICLE 9.

BOOKS, RECORDS, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTS

Section 9.1.  Records and Accounting

The General Partner shall keep or cause to be kept at the principal office of
the Partnership those records and documents required to be maintained by the Act

respect to the Partnership’s business, including, without limitation, all books
and records necessary to provide to the Limited Partners any information, lists
and copies of documents required to be provided pursuant to Section 9.3
hereof.  The books of the Partnership shall be maintained, for financial and tax
reporting purposes, on an accrual basis in accordance with GAAP, or such other
basis as the General Partner determines to be necessary or appropriate following
the direction and approval of the Board of Directors.

Section 9.2.  Fiscal Year

The fiscal year of the Partnership shall be the calendar year.

Section 9.3.  Reports

A.As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 105 days after the close of
each Partnership Year, the General Partner shall cause to be mailed to each
Limited Partner as of the close of the Partnership Year, an annual report
containing financial statements of the Partnership, or of the Company if such
statements are prepared solely on a consolidated basis with the Company, for
such Partnership Year, presented in accordance with GAAP, such statements to be
audited by a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants
selected by the Company; provided, that if such financial statements of the
Company are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website, then
this obligation shall be satisfied.

36

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

B.As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 105 days after the close of
each calendar quarter (except the last calendar quarter of each year), the
General Partner shall cause to be mailed to each Limited Partner as of the last
day of the calendar quarter, a report containing unaudited financial statements
of the Partnership, or of the Company, if such statements are prepared solely on
a consolidated basis with the Company, and such other information as may be
required by applicable law or regulation, or as the General Partner determines
to be appropriate; provided that if such financial statements of the Company are
available on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website, then this
obligation shall be satisfied.

C.The Partnership shall also cause to be promptly prepared such reports and/or
information as are necessary for the Company to determine its qualification as a
REIT and its compliance with the requirements for REITs pursuant to the Code and
Regulations.

ARTICLE 10.

TAX MATTERS

Section 10.1.  Preparation of Tax Returns

The General Partner, following the direction and approval of the Board of
Directors, shall arrange for the preparation and timely filing of all returns of
Partnership income, gains, deductions, losses and other items required of the
Partnership for federal and state income tax purposes and shall furnish by July
31 of the year immediately following each taxable year, or as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter, the tax information reasonably required by Limited
Partners for federal and state income tax reporting purposes.

Section 10.2.  Tax Elections

Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner, following the
direction and approval of the Board of Directors, shall determine whether to
make any available election pursuant to the Code.  Notwithstanding the above, in
making any such tax election the General Partner and the Board of Directors may,
but shall be under no obligation to, take into account the tax consequences to
the Limited Partners resulting from any such election.

The General Partner can, following the direction and approval of the Board of
Directors, elect to use any method permitted by Section 704(c) of the Code and
the Regulations thereunder to take into account any variation between the
adjusted basis of any property contributed (or deemed contributed) to the
Partnership by any Partner after the date hereof and such property’s initial
Carrying Value.  The General Partner shall have the right, following the
direction and approval of the Board of Directors, regarding the exercise of that
right, to seek to revoke any tax election it makes (including, without
limitation, an election under Section 754 of the Code) upon the General
Partner’s determination, following the direction and approval of the Board of
Directors, that such revocation is in the best interests of the Partners.

Section 10.3.  Partnership Representative

A.The General Partner, or such Person as may alternatively be designated by the
General Partner, following the direction and approval of the Board of Directors,
shall be the “partnership representative” (within the meaning of Section 6223 of
the Code) (the “Partnership Representative”).  The taking of any action and the
incurring of any expense by the Partnership Representative in connection with
any such proceeding, except to the extent required by law, is a matter of the
Partnership Representative, following the direction and approval of the Board of
Directors, and the provisions relating to indemnification provisions set forth
in Section 7.7 of this Agreement shall be fully applicable to the Partnership
Representative in its capacity as such.  Each Partner hereby agrees to cooperate
with, and to take all reasonable actions requested by the Partnership
Representative and the Partnership, to avoid or reduce any tax imposed under
Section 6225 of the Code, including (i) taking such actions as may be required
to effect the General Partner’s designation as the Partnership Representative,
and on behalf of the Partnership, the General Partner’s (or its designee’s)
appointment of any “designated individual,” (ii) providing any information or
taking such other actions as may be reasonably requested by the Partnership
Representative in order to determine whether any “imputed underpayment” (within
the meaning of Section 6225 of the Code) may be modified pursuant to Section
6225(c) of the Code, (iii) providing any information or taking such other
actions as may be reasonably requested by the Partnership Representative in
connection with any election made by the Partnership Representative pursuant to
Section 6226 of the Code, and (iv) upon the request of the Partnership
Representative, filing any amended U.S. federal income tax return or comply with
the alternative procedure described in Section 6225(c)(2)(B) of the Code, and
paying any tax due in connection with such tax return in accordance with Section
6225(c)(2) of the Code or any corresponding provision of applicable state or
local law. The provisions of this Section 10.3 and a Partner’s obligation to
comply with this Section 10.3 shall survive any liquidation and dissolution of
the Partnership and the transfer, assignment or liquidation of such Partner’s
Partnership Interest (including for the avoidance of doubt through exercise of
the Redemption Right).

B.The Partnership Representative shall receive no compensation for its
services.  All third party costs and expenses incurred by the Partnership
Representative in performing its duties as such (including legal and accounting
fees and expenses) shall be borne by the Partnership.  Nothing herein shall be
construed to restrict the Partnership from engaging an accounting and/or law
firm to assist the Partnership Representative in discharging its duties
hereunder, so long as the compensation paid by the Partnership for such services
is reasonable.

AmericasActive:14392849.4

Section 10.4.  Withholding

Each Limited Partner hereby authorizes the Partnership to withhold from, or pay
on behalf of or with respect to, such Limited Partner any amount of federal,
state, local, or foreign taxes that the General Partner, following the direction
and approval of the Board of Directors determines that the Partnership is
required to withhold or pay with respect to any amount distributable or
allocable to such Limited Partner pursuant to this Agreement, including, without
limitation, any taxes required to be withheld or paid by the Partnership
pursuant to Section 1441, 1442, 1445, or 1446 of the Code, and any taxes paid by
the Partnership with respect to an imputed underpayment.  Any amount paid on
behalf of or with respect to a Limited Partner shall constitute a loan by the
Partnership to such Limited Partner, which loan shall be repaid by such Limited
Partner within 15 days after notice from the General Partner that such payment
must be made unless (i) the Partnership withholds such payment from a
distribution which would otherwise be made to the Limited Partner, or (ii) the
General Partner determines, following the direction and approval of the Board of
Directors, that such payment may be satisfied out of the available funds of the
Partnership which would, but for such payment, be distributed to the Limited
Partner.  Any amounts withheld pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) or (ii)
shall be treated as having been distributed (or paid) to such Limited
Partner.  In the event that a Limited Partner fails to pay any amounts owed to
the Partnership pursuant to this Section 10.4 when due, the General Partner may,
following the direction and approval of the Board of Directors, elect to make
the payment to the Partnership on behalf of such defaulting Limited Partner, and
in such event shall be deemed to have loaned such amount to such defaulting
Limited Partner and shall succeed to all rights and remedies of the Partnership
as against such defaulting Limited Partner.  Without limitation, in such event
the General Partner shall have the right to receive distributions that would
otherwise be distributable to such defaulting Limited Partner until such time as
such loan, together with all interest thereon, has been paid in full, and any
such distributions so received by the General Partner shall be treated as having
been distributed to the defaulting Limited Partner and immediately paid by the
defaulting Limited Partner to the General Partner in repayment of such
loan.  Any amounts payable by a Limited Partner hereunder shall bear interest at
the lesser of (A) the base rate on corporate loans at large United States money
center commercial banks, as published from time to time in The Wall Street
Journal, plus four percentage points, or (B) the maximum lawful rate of interest
on such obligation, such interest to accrue from the date such amount is due
(i.e., 15 days after demand) until such amount is paid in full.  Each Limited
Partner shall take such actions as the Partnership or the General Partner shall
request in order to perfect or enforce the security interest created
hereunder.  Upon a Limited Partner’s complete withdrawal from the Partnership,
such Limited Partner shall be required to restore funds to the Partnership to
the extent that the cumulative amount of taxes withheld from or paid on behalf
of, or with respect to, such Limited Partner exceeds the sum of such amounts (i)
repaid to the Partnership by such Limited Partner, (ii) withheld from
distributions to such Limited Partner and (iii) paid by the General Partner on
behalf of such Limited Partner.

ARTICLE 11.

TRANSFERS AND WITHDRAWALS

Section 11.1.  Transfer

A.The term “transfer,” when used in this Article 11 with respect to a
Partnership Unit, shall be deemed to refer to a transaction by which the General
Partner purports to assign all or any part of its General Partner Interest to
another Person or by which a Limited Partner purports to assign all or any part
of its Limited Partner Interest to another Person, and includes a sale,
assignment, gift, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or any
other disposition by law or otherwise.  The term “transfer” when used in this
Article 11 does not include (i) any redemption of Partnership Interests by the
Partnership from a Limited Partner, (ii) any acquisition of Partnership Units
from a Limited Partner by the Operating Partnership pursuant to Section 8.6, or
(iii) any distribution of Partnership Units by a Limited Partner to its
beneficial owners.

B.No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Article 11.  Any
transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in accordance
with this Article 11 shall be null and void.

C.Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article 11, the Partnership
Interests of the Company may be transferred, in whole or in part, at any time or
from time to time, to any Person that is, at the time of such transfer, a
Qualified REIT Subsidiary.  Upon any transfer permitted by this Section 11.1(C),
the Company shall be relieved of all its obligations under this Agreement.  The
provisions of Sections 11.2(B), 11.3, 11.4(A) and 11.5 hereof shall not apply to
any transfer permitted by this Section 11.1(C).

Section 11.2.  Transfer of General Partner Interest

withdraw as General Partner, or transfer any of its Limited Partner Interest,
except as provided in Section 11.2(B) or Section 11.2(C) hereof.

40

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

B.Except as set forth in Section 11.2(C), the General Partner shall not withdraw
from the Partnership and shall not transfer all or any portion of its Partner
Interests in the Partnership (whether by sale, disposition, statutory merger or
consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) unless approved by the Board of
Directors.  Upon any transfer of the General Partner’s Partnership Interest in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.2(B), the transferee shall
become a successor General Partner for all purposes herein, and shall be vested
with the powers and rights of the transferor General Partner, and shall be
liable for all obligations and responsible for all duties of the General
Partner, once such transferee has executed such instruments as may be necessary
to effectuate such admission and to confirm the agreement of such transferee to
be bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement with respect to the
Partnership Interest so acquired.  It is a condition to any transfer by the
General Partner otherwise permitted hereunder that the transferee assumes, by
operation of law or express agreement, all of the obligations of the transferor
General Partner under this Agreement with respect to such transferred
Partnership Interest; provided, such transfer shall not relieve the transferor
General Partner of its obligations under this Agreement without the approval of
the Board of Directors.  In the event that the General Partner withdraws from
the Partnership, in violation of this Agreement or otherwise, the remaining
Partners may agree in writing to continue the business of the Partnership by
selecting a successor General Partner in accordance with the Act.

C.In the event a Bankruptcy Event occurs with respect to the General Partner,
the General Partner shall automatically withdraw from the Partnership, in its
role as the General Partner, without any action on the part of the General
Partner or any other Person, and shall transfer all of its General Partner
Interest in the Partnership to the successor general partner selected by the
Board of Directors.

Section 11.3.  Limited Partners’ Rights to Transfer

A.Except as provided in Section 11.3(B), no Limited Partner shall transfer all
or any portion of its Partnership Interest to any transferee without the
approval of the Board of Directors; provided, however, that if a Limited Partner
is subject to Incapacity, such Incapacitated Limited Partner may transfer all or
any portion of its Partnership Interest.

B.Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 11, a Limited Partner may
transfer all or any portion of its Partnership Interest to any of its Affiliates
and such transferee shall be admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner, all
without obtaining the approval of the Board of Directors, unless such Affiliate
does not qualify as an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in Rule
501(a) of Regulation D.

C.If a Limited Partner is subject to Incapacity, the executor, administrator,
trustee, committee, guardian, conservator or receiver of such Limited Partner’s
estate shall have all of the rights of a Limited Partner, but not more rights
than those enjoyed by other Limited Partners, for the purpose of settling or
managing the estate and such power as the Incapacitated Limited Partner
possessed to transfer all or any part of his or its interest in the
Partnership.  The Incapacity of a Limited Partner, in and of itself, shall not
dissolve or terminate the Partnership.

41

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

D.Without limiting the generality of Section 11.3(B) hereof, the Board of
Directors may prohibit any transfer by a Limited Partner of its Partnership
Interest if, in the opinion of legal counsel to the Partnership or the Company,
such transfer would require filing of a registration statement under the
Securities Act or would otherwise violate any federal or state securities laws
or regulations applicable to the Partnership or the Partnership Units.

E.No transfer by a Limited Partner of its Partnership Units may be made to any
Person if (i) in the opinion of legal counsel for the Partnership or the Company
it could result in the Partnership being treated as an association taxable as a
corporation or a publicly traded partnership within the meaning of either
Section 469(k)(2) or Section 7704(b) of the Code; (ii) such transfer could be
treated as effectuated through an “established securities market” or a
“secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)” within the meaning of
Section 7704 of the Code; (iii) such transfer could cause the Partnership to
become, with respect to any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA or
to Section 4975 of the Code, a “party-in-interest” (as defined in Section 3(14)
of ERISA) or a “disqualified person” (as defined in Section 4975(c) of the
Code); (iv) such transfer could, in the opinion of legal counsel for the
Partnership or the Company, cause any portion of the assets of the Partnership
to constitute assets of any employee benefit plan pursuant to Department of
Labor Regulations Section 2510.3-101; or (v) such transfer could subject the
Partnership to be regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the fiduciary
responsibility provisions of ERISA.

F.No transfer of any Partnership Units may be made to a lender to the
Partnership or any Person who is related (within the meaning of Section
1.752-4(b) of the Regulations) to any lender to the Partnership whose loan
constitutes a Nonrecourse Liability, without the approval of the Board of
Directors.

G.The General Partner shall keep a register for the Partnership on which the
transfer, pledge or release of Partnership Units shall be shown and pursuant to
which entries shall be made to effect all transfers, pledges or releases as
required by the applicable sections of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code,
as amended, in effect in the State of Delaware.  The General Partner shall (i)
place proper entries in such register clearly showing each transfer and each
pledge and grant of security interest and the transfer and assignment pursuant
thereto, such entries to be endorsed by the General Partner, and (ii) maintain
the register and make the register available for inspection by all of the
Partners and their pledgees at all times during the term of this
Agreement.  Nothing herein shall be deemed a consent to any pledge or transfer
otherwise prohibited under this Agreement.

Section 11.4.  Substituted Limited Partners

A.No Limited Partner shall have the right to substitute a transferee as a
Limited Partner in his or its place except upon approval of the Board of
Directors.  Following such approval of the Board of Directors, the transferee of
the interest of such Limited Partner shall be admitted pursuant to this Section
11.4 as a Substituted Limited Partner.  The Board of Directors’ failure or
refusal to permit a transferee of any such interests to become a Substituted
Limited Partner shall not give rise to any cause of action against the
Partnership, any Partner, or the Board of Directors.  A Person shall be admitted
to the Partnership as a Substituted Limited Partner only upon the aforementioned
consent of the Board of Directors and the furnishing to the Partnership of (i)
evidence of acceptance in form satisfactory to the General Partner of all of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the power
of attorney granted in Section 2.4 hereof and (ii) such other documents to
effect such Person’s admission as a Substituted Limited Partner.  The admission
of any Person as a Substituted Limited Partner shall become effective on the
date upon which the name of such Person is recorded on the books and records of
the Partnership, following the consent of the Board of Directors to such
admission.

B.A transferee who has been admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner in
accordance with this Article 11 shall have all the rights and powers and be
subject to all the restrictions and liabilities of a Limited Partner under this
Agreement.

C.Upon the admission of a Substituted Limited Partner, the General Partner shall
amend Exhibit A to reflect the name, address, number of Partnership Units and
Percentage Interest (as applicable) of such Substituted Limited Partner and to
eliminate or adjust, if necessary, the name, address and interest of the
predecessor of such Substituted Limited Partner.

Section 11.5.  Assignees

If the Board of Directors does not consent to the admission of any permitted
transferee as a Substituted Limited Partner, as described in Section 11.4, such
transferee shall be considered an Assignee for purposes of this Agreement.  An
Assignee shall be deemed to have had assigned to it, and shall be entitled to
receive distributions from the Partnership and the share of Net Income, Net
Losses, Recapture Income, and any other items, gain, loss, deduction and credit
of the Partnership attributable to the Partnership Interest assigned to such
transferee, but shall not be deemed to be a holder of a Partnership Interest for
any other purpose under this Agreement, and shall not be entitled to vote such
Partnership Interest in any matter presented to the Limited Partners for a vote
(such Partnership Interest being deemed to have been voted on such matter in the
same proportion as all other Partnership Interest held by Limited Partners are
voted).  In the event any such transferee desires to make a further assignment
of any such Partnership Interest, such transferee shall be subject to all of the
provisions of this Article 11 to the same extent and in the same manner as any
Limited Partner desiring to make an assignment of his or its Partnership
Interest.

Section 11.6.  Drag-Along Rights

A.In the event of an Approved Sale, the Partners who approved the Approved Sale
(the “Approving Partners”) have the right to require each other Partner (the
“Non-Approving Partners”) to transfer all Partnership Units then held by such
Non-Approving Partner, free and clear of all liens, security interests or other
restrictions of any kind, in accordance with this Section 11.6.

B.In the event of an Approved Sale, the General Partner shall notify each
Non-Approving Partner no more than 10 Business Days after the execution and
delivery by all of the parties thereto of the definitive agreement entered into
with respect to the Approved Sale and, in any event, no later than 20 Business
Days prior to the closing date of such Approved Sale, and each Non-Approving
Partner will, subject to satisfaction of the conditions in Section 11.6(C), (i)
if such transaction requires approval by the Partners, with respect to all
Partnership Units that such Partner owns or over which such Partner otherwise
exercises voting power, to vote (in person, by proxy or by action by written
consent, as applicable) all such Partnership Units in favor of, and adopt, such
Approved Sale, and to vote in opposition to any and all other proposals that
could reasonably be expected to delay or impair the ability of the Partnership
to consummate such Sale of the Partnership, (ii) refrain from exercising any
dissenter’s rights or rights of appraisal under applicable law at any time with
respect to such Approved Sale, and (iii) if the Approved Sale is structured as a
sale of Partnership Units, each Non-Approving Partner will agree to sell the
same proportion of Partnership Units beneficially held by such Partner as is
being sold by the Approving Partners to the Person(s) to whom the Approving
Partners propose to sell their Partnership Units, on the same terms and
conditions as the Approving Partners.  

C.The obligations of the Partners pursuant to this Section 11.6 with respect to
an Approved Sale are subject to the following conditions: (i) the aggregate
consideration payable upon consummation of such Approved Sale to all of the
Partners (the “Aggregate Consideration”) shall be allocated among the Partners
as set forth in Section 5.3, (ii) upon the consummation of the Approved Sale,
all of the Partners shall receive the same form of consideration per Partnership
Unit of the same class or other equity interest, as allocated pursuant to
subsection (i) hereof (except that a member of management may, with such
Partner’s consent, receive securities pursuant to a management “rollover” which
are not offered to all Partners), and (iii) that any indemnification, escrow,
holdback and adjustment obligations undertaken by any Partner shall be pro rata
among the Partners in proportion to the consideration to be received by the
Partners in such Approved Sale; provided that indemnification obligations that
relate solely to a particular Partner, such as indemnification with respect to
representations and warranties made by a Partner with respect to such Partner
(or such Partner’s ownership of Partnership Units) or covenants made by such
Partner, shall be borne only by such Partner and shall not be deemed to reduce
the Aggregate Consideration.

D.Subject to the foregoing, each Partner hereby agrees to execute and deliver
all related documentation and take such other action in support of the Sale of
the Partnership as shall reasonably be requested by the General Partner or the
Approving Partners in order to carry out the terms and provision of
this Section 11.6, including without limitation executing and delivering
instruments of conveyance and transfer, and any purchase agreement, merger
agreement, indemnity agreement, escrow agreement, consent, waiver, governmental
filing, share certificates duly endorsed for transfer (free and clear of
impermissible liens, claims and encumbrances) and any similar or related
documents.  Subject to the satisfaction of the conditions in Section 11.6(C),
for purposes each Partner (and their respective spouses, if residing in a
community property state) hereby appoint the General Partner as their agent and
attorney-in-fact to execute any and all documents related in connection with an
Approved Sale (including documents granting customary indemnities to a buyer of
assets or securities consistent with this Agreement) on their behalf and
expressly bind themselves to such document by the General Partner’s execution of
such document without further action on their part.

Section 11.7. General Provisions

A.No Limited Partner may withdraw from the Partnership other than as a result of
a permitted transfer of all of such Limited Partner’s Partnership Interest in
accordance with this Article 11, pursuant to redemption of all of its
Partnership Units, or the acquisition thereof by the Company, under Section 8.6.

B.Any Limited Partner who shall transfer all of its Partnership Interest in a
transfer permitted pursuant to this Article 11 shall cease to be a Limited
Partner upon the admission of all Assignees of such Partnership Interest as
Substituted Limited Partners.  Similarly, any Limited Partner who shall transfer
all of its Partnership Units pursuant to a redemption of all of its Partnership
Units, or the acquisition thereof by the Company under Section 8.6 shall cease
to be a Limited Partner.

C.Transfers pursuant to this Article 11 may only be made on the first day of a
fiscal quarter of the Partnership, unless the General Partner and the Board of
Directors otherwise agrees.

D.If any Partnership Interest is transferred or assigned during any quarterly
segment of the Partnership’s fiscal year in compliance with the provisions of
this Article 11 or redeemed or transferred pursuant to Section 8.6 on any day
other than the first day of a Partnership Year, then Net Income, Net Losses,
each item thereof and all other items attributable to such interest for such
Partnership Year shall be divided and allocated between the transferor Partner
and the transferee Partner by taking into account their varying interests during
the Partnership Year in accordance with Section 706(d) of the Code, using the

Code, using the interim closing of the books method.  All distributions of
Available Cash with respect to which the Partnership Record Date is before the

ARTICLE 13.

DISSOLUTION, LIQUIDATION AND TERMINATION

Section 13.1.  Dissolution

General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Upon the

47

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Section 13.2.  Winding Up

A.Upon the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, the Partnership shall continue
solely for the purposes of winding up its affairs in an orderly manner,
liquidating its assets, and satisfying the claims of its creditors and
Partners.  No Partner shall take any action that is inconsistent with, or not
necessary to or appropriate for, the winding up of the Partnership’s business
and affairs.  The General Partner, or, in the event there is no remaining
General Partner, any Person elected by a majority of the Percentage Interests of
the Limited Partners (the General Partner or such other Person being referred to
herein as the “Liquidator”), shall be responsible for overseeing the winding up
and dissolution of the Partnership and shall take full account of the
Partnership’s liabilities and property and the Partnership property shall be
liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair value thereof,
and the proceeds therefrom (which may, to the extent determined by the
Liquidator and approved by the Board of Directors, include OP Units of the
Operating Partnership) shall be applied and distributed in the following order:

(1)First, in satisfaction of all of the Partnership’s Debts and liabilities to
creditors other than the Partners (whether by payment or the making of
reasonable provision for payment thereof);

(2)Second, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnership’s Debts and
liabilities to the General Partner (whether by payment or the making of
reasonable provision for payment thereof), including, but not limited to,
amounts due as reimbursements under Section 7.4;

(3)Third, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnership’s Debts and
liabilities to the other Partners; and

(4)The balance, if any, to the Partners in accordance with their Capital
Accounts, after giving effect to all contributions, distributions, and
allocations for all periods.

The General Partner shall not receive any additional compensation for any
services performed pursuant to this Article 13.

B.Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.2(A) hereof which require
liquidation of the assets of the Partnership, but subject to the order of
priorities set forth therein, if prior to or upon dissolution of the Partnership
the Liquidator, following the direction and approval of the Board of Directors,
determines that an immediate sale of part or all of the Partnership’s assets
would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners, the Liquidator
may defer for a reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those
necessary to satisfy liabilities of the Partnership (including to those Partners
as creditors) and/or distribute to the Partners, in lieu of cash, as tenants in
common and in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.2(A) hereof,
undivided interests in such Partnership assets as the Liquidator deems not
suitable for liquidation.  Any such distributions in kind shall be made only if,
in the good faith judgment of the Liquidator, following the direction and
approval of the Board of Directors, such distributions in kind are in the best
interest of the Partners, and shall be subject to such conditions relating to
the disposition and management of such properties as the Liquidator deems
reasonable and equitable and to any agreements governing the operation of such
properties at such time.  The Liquidator shall determine the fair market value
of any property distributed in kind using such reasonable method of valuation as
it may adopt.

48

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

C.In the discretion of the Liquidator, following the direction and approval of
the Board of Directors, a pro rata portion of the distributions that would
otherwise be made to the Partners pursuant to this Article 13 may be:

(1)distributed to a trust established for the benefit of the General Partner and
Limited Partners for the purposes of liquidating Partnership assets, collecting
amounts owed to the Partnership, and paying any contingent or unforeseen
liabilities or obligations of the Partnership or the General Partner arising out
of or in connection with the Partnership. The assets of any such trust shall be
distributed to the General Partner and Limited Partners from time to time, in
the reasonable discretion of the Liquidator, following the direction and
approval of the Board of Directors, in the same proportions as the amount
distributed to such trust by the Partnership would otherwise have been
distributed to the General Partner and Limited Partners pursuant to this
Agreement; or

(2)withheld or escrowed to provide a reasonable reserve for Partnership
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) and to reflect the unrealized portion of
any installment obligations owed to the Partnership; provided, that such
withheld or escrowed amounts shall be distributed to the General Partner and
Limited Partners in the manner and order of priority set forth in Section
13.2(A) as soon as practicable.

Section 13.3. Deficit Capital Account Restoration Obligation

In the event the Partnership or the General Partner’s interest therein
(including its interest if any as a Limited Partner) is “liquidated” within the
meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), distributions shall be made
pursuant to this Article 13 to the General Partner and Limited Partners who have
positive Capital Accounts in compliance with Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(3).  If any Partner has a deficit balance in its Capital
Account (after giving effect to all contributions, distributions and allocations
for all taxable years, including the year during which such liquidation occurs),
such Partner, if such Partner is a Limited Partner, shall have no obligation to
make any contribution to the capital of the Partnership with respect to such
deficit, and such deficit shall not be considered a Debt owed to the Partnership
or to any other Person for any purpose whatsoever, except to the extent
otherwise expressly agreed to by such Limited Partner and the Partnership;
provided, however, that such Partner, if such Partner is the General Partner,
shall contribute to the capital of the Partnership the amount necessary to
restore such deficit balance to zero in compliance with Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(3).

49

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Section 13.4.  Deemed Contribution and Distribution

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 13, in the event the
Partnership is “liquidated” within the meaning of Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), but no Liquidating Event has occurred, the Partnership’s
property shall not be liquidated, the Partnership’s liabilities shall not be
paid or discharged, and the Partnership’s affairs shall not be wound
up.  Instead, for federal income tax purposes and for purposes of maintaining
Capital Accounts pursuant to Exhibit B hereto, the Partnership shall be deemed
to have contributed all Partnership property and liabilities to a new limited
partnership in exchange for an interest in such new limited partnership and,
immediately thereafter, the Partnership will be deemed to liquidate by
distributing interests in the new limited partnership to the Partners.

Section 13.5.  Rights of Limited Partners

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Limited Partner shall look
solely to the assets of the Partnership for the return of its Capital
Contributions and shall have no right or power to demand or receive property
other than cash from the Partnership.  Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, no Limited Partner shall have priority over any other Partner as to
the return of its Capital Contributions, distributions, or allocations.

Section 13.6.  Notice of Dissolution

In the event a Liquidating Event occurs, or an event occurs that would result in
a dissolution of the Partnership, the General Partner shall, within 30 days
thereafter, provide written notice thereof to each of the Partners.

Section 13.7.  Termination of Partnership and Cancellation of Certificate of
Limited Partnership

Upon the completion of the winding up of the Partnership and liquidation of its
assets, as provided in Section 13.2 hereof, the Partnership shall be terminated
by filing a certificate of cancellation with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware, canceling all qualifications of the Partnership as a foreign
limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware and taking
such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the Partnership.

Section 13.8.  Reasonable Time for Winding Up

A reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly winding-up of the business
and affairs of the Partnership and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to
Section 13.2 hereof, in order to minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon
such winding up, and the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect
among the Partners during the period of liquidation.

50

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Section 13.9.  Waiver of Partition

No Partner nor any successor-in-interest to a Partner shall have the right while
this Agreement remains in effect to have any property of the Partnership
partitioned, or to file a complaint or institute any proceeding at law or in
equity to have such property of the Partnership partitioned, and each Partner,
on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns hereby waives any such right.
It is the intention of the Partners that the rights of the parties hereto and
their successors-in-interest to Partnership property, as among themselves, shall
be governed by the terms of this Agreement, and that the rights of the Partners
and their respective successors-in-interest shall be subject to the limitations
and restrictions as set forth in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 14.

AMENDMENT OF PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT; MEETINGS

Section 14.1.  Amendment of Partnership Agreement

A.A proposed amendment shall be adopted and be effective as an amendment hereto
if it is approved by the General Partner following the direction and approval of
the Board of Directors.

B.Notwithstanding Section 14.1(A) hereof, this Agreement shall not be amended
without the consent of each Partner materially adversely affected if such
amendment would (i) convert a Limited Partner Interest in the Partnership into a
General Partner Interest; (ii) modify the limited liability of a Limited Partner
in a manner materially adverse to such Limited Partner; (iii) alter rights of
such Partner to receive distributions pursuant to Article 5 or Article 13, or
the allocations specified in Article 6 (except as permitted pursuant to Section
4.2 hereof) in a manner materially adverse to such Partner; or (vi) amend this
Section 14.1(B); provided, however, that the consent of each Partner materially
adversely affected shall not be required for any amendment or action that
affects all Partners holding the same class or series of Partnership Units on a
uniform or pro rata basis.  Any amendment consented to by any Partner shall be
effective as to that Partner, notwithstanding the absence of such consent by any
other Partner.

Section 14.2.  Meetings of the Partners

A.Meetings of the Partners may be called by the General Partner and shall be
called upon the receipt by the General Partner of a written request either by
the Limited Partners holding 20% or more of the Partnership Interests or by the
Board of Directors.  The request shall state the nature of the business to be
transacted.  Notice of any such meeting shall be given to all Partners not less
than seven days nor more than 30 days prior to the date of such
meeting.  Partners may vote in person or by proxy at such meeting.  Except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the consent of holders of a
majority of the Percentage Interests held by Limited Partners shall control.

51

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

B.Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Partners may
be taken without a meeting if a written consent setting forth the action so
taken is signed by a majority of the Percentage Interests of the Partners (or
such other percentage as is expressly required by this Agreement).  Such consent
may be in one instrument or in several instruments, and shall have the same
force and effect as a vote of a majority of the Percentage Interests of the
Partners (or such other percentage as is expressly required by this
Agreement).  Such consent shall be filed with the General Partner.  An action so
taken shall be deemed to have been taken at a meeting held on the effective date
so certified.

C.Each Limited Partner may authorize any Person or Persons to act for him by
proxy on all matters in which a Limited Partner is entitled to participate,
including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or participating at a
meeting.  Every proxy must be signed by the Limited Partner or his or its
attorney-in-fact.  No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months
from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy.  Every proxy shall
be revocable at the pleasure of the Limited Partner executing it, such
revocation to be effective upon the Partnership’s receipt of written notice of
such revocation from the Limited Partner executing such proxy.

D.Each meeting of the Partners shall be conducted by the General Partner or such
other Person as the General Partner may appoint pursuant to such rules for the
conduct of the meeting as the General Partner or such other Person deems
appropriate.  Without limitation, meetings of Partners may be conducted in the
same manner as meetings of the shareholders of the Company and may be held at
the same time, and as part of, meetings of the shareholders of the Company.

EXHIBIT B

CAPITAL ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE

1.

Capital Accounts of the Partners

A.The Partnership shall maintain for each Partner a separate Capital Account in
accordance with the rules of Regulations Section 1.704-l(b)(2)(iv).  Such
Capital Account shall be increased by (i) the amount of all Capital
Contributions and any other deemed contributions made by such Partner to the
Partnership pursuant to the Agreement; and (ii) all items of Partnership income
and gain (including income and gain exempt from tax) computed in accordance with
Section 1.B hereof and allocated to such Partner pursuant to Section 6.1(A) of
the Agreement and Exhibit C of the Agreement, and decreased by (x) the amount of
cash or Agreed Value of all actual and deemed distributions of cash or property
made to such Partner pursuant to the Agreement, and (y) all items of Partnership
deduction and loss computed in accordance with Section 1.B hereof and allocated
to such Partner pursuant to Section 6.1.B of the Agreement and Exhibit C hereof.

B.For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, deduction or
loss (including “Net Income” or “Net Loss”) to be reflected in the Partners’
Capital Accounts, unless otherwise specified in the Agreement, the
determination, recognition and classification of any such item shall be the same
as its determination, recognition and classification for federal income tax
purposes determined in accordance with Section 703(a) of the Code (for this
purpose all items of income, gain, loss or deduction required to be stated
separately pursuant to Section 703(a)(1) of the Code shall be included in
taxable income or loss), with the following adjustments:

(1)Except as otherwise provided in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the
computation of all items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be made
without regard to any election under Section 754 of the Code which may be made
by the Partnership; provided, that the amounts of any adjustments to the
adjusted bases of the assets of the Partnership made pursuant to Section 734 of
the Code as a result of the distribution of property by the Partnership to a
Partner (to the extent that such adjustments have not previously been reflected
in the Partners’ Capital Accounts) shall be reflected in the Capital Accounts of
the Partners in the manner and subject to the limitations prescribed in
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4).

(2)The computation of all items of income, gain, and deduction shall be made
without regard to the fact that items described in Sections 705(a)(1)(B) or
705(a)(2)(B) of the Code are not includable in gross income or are neither
currently deductible nor capitalized for federal income tax purposes.

B-1

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

(3)Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of any
Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the
Partnership’s Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.

(4)In lieu of the depreciation, amortization, and other cost recovery deductions
taken into account in computing such taxable income or loss, there shall be
taken into account Depreciation for such fiscal year.

(5)In the event the Carrying Value of any Partnership asset is adjusted pursuant
to Section 1.D hereof, the amount of any such adjustment shall be taken into
account as gain or loss from the disposition of such asset.

(6)Any income of the Partnership that is exempt from federal income tax and not
otherwise taken into account in computing Net Income or Net Loss pursuant to
this definition shall be added to such taxable income or loss.

(7)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 1.B, any items that are
specially allocated pursuant to Exhibit C of the Agreement shall not be taken
into account for purposes of computing Net Income or Net Loss.

The amounts of the items of Partnership income, gain, loss or deduction
available to be specially allocated pursuant to Exhibit C of the Agreement shall
be determined by applying rules analogous to those set forth in Sections 1.B(1)
through 1.B(5) above.

C.Generally, a transferee (including an Assignee) of a Partnership Unit shall
succeed to a pro rata portion of the Capital Account of the transferor.

D.(1) Consistent with the provisions of Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), and as provided in Section 1.D(2), the Carrying Value of
all Partnership assets shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as
of the times of the adjustments provided in Section 1.D(2) hereof, as if such
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual sale of each
such property and allocated pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Agreement.

(2)Such adjustments shall be made as of the following times: (a) immediately
prior to the acquisition of an additional interest in the Partnership by any new
or existing Partner in exchange for more than a de minimis Capital Contribution;
(b) immediately prior to the distribution by the Partnership to a Partner of
more than a de minimis amount of property as consideration for an interest in
the Partnership; (c) in connection with the grant of an interest in the
Partnership (other than a de minimis interest), as consideration for the
provision of services to or for the benefit of the Partnership by an existing
Partner acting in a partner capacity or by a new partner acting in a partner
capacity or in anticipation of being a partner; and (d) immediately prior to the
liquidation of the Partnership within the meaning of Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g); provided, however, that adjustments pursuant to clauses
(a), (b) and (c) above shall be made only if the General Partner determines that
such adjustments are necessary or appropriate to reflect the relative economic
interests of the Partners in the Partnership.

B-2

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

(3)In accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(e), the Carrying
Value of Partnership assets distributed in kind shall be adjusted upward or
downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such
Partnership property, as of the time any such asset is distributed.

(4)The Carrying Value of Partnership assets shall be increased (or decreased) to
reflect any adjustments to the adjusted basis of such assets pursuant to Section
734(b) or Section 743(b) of the Code, but only to the extent that such
adjustments are taken into account in determining Capital Accounts pursuant to
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m) and Section 1.B(1) hereof or Section
1.F of Exhibit C of the Agreement; provided, however, that Carrying Values shall
not be adjusted pursuant to this Section 1.D(4) to the extent that an adjustment
pursuant to Section 1.D(2) hereof is required in connection with a transaction
that would otherwise result in an adjustment pursuant to this Section 1.D(4).

(5)In determining Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss for purposes of this
Exhibit B, the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership
assets (including cash or cash equivalents) shall be determined by the General
Partner using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt, or in the
case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to Article 13 of the Agreement,
shall be determined and allocated by the Liquidator using such reasonable method
of valuation as it may adopt.  The General Partner, or the Liquidator, as the
case may be, shall allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the
Partnership (in such manner as it determines following the direction and
approval of the Board of Directors to arrive at a fair market value for
individual properties).

If the Carrying Value of an asset has been determined or adjusted pursuant to
Section 1.B(2) or Section 1.B(4) of this Exhibit B, such Carrying Value shall
thereafter be adjusted by the Depreciation taken into account with respect to
such asset, for purposes of computing Net Income and Net Loss.

B-3

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

E.The provisions of the Agreement (including this Exhibit B and other Exhibits
to the Agreement) relating to the maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended
to comply with Regulations Section 1.704-l(b), and shall be interpreted and
applied in a manner consistent with such Regulations.  In the event the General
Partner shall determine that it is prudent to modify (i) the manner in which the
Capital Accounts, or any debits or credits thereto (including, without
limitation, debits or credits relating to liabilities which are secured by
contributed or distributed property or which are assumed by the Partnership, the
General Partner, or the Limited Partners) are computed; or (ii) the manner in
which items are allocated among the Partners for federal income tax purposes, in
order to comply with such Regulations or to comply with Section 704(c) of the
Code, the General Partner may make such modification without regard to Article
14 of the Agreement; provided, that it is not likely to have a material effect
on the amounts distributable to any Person pursuant to Article 13 of the
Agreement upon the dissolution of the Partnership.  The General Partner also
shall (i) make any adjustments that are necessary or appropriate to maintain
equality between the Capital Accounts of the Partners and the amount of
Partnership capital reflected on the Partnership’s balance sheet, as computed
for book purposes, in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(q);
and (ii) make any appropriate modifications in the event unanticipated events
might otherwise cause the Agreement not to comply with Regulations Section
1.704-1(b).  In addition, the General Partner may adopt and employ such methods
and procedures for (i) the maintenance of book and tax capital accounts; (ii)
the determination and allocation of adjustments under Sections 704(c), 734 and
743 of the Code; (iii) the determination of Net Income, Net Loss, taxable
income, taxable loss and items thereof under the Agreement and pursuant to the
Code; (iv) the adoption of reasonable conventions and methods for the valuation
of assets and the determination of tax basis; (v) the allocation of asset value
and tax basis; and (vi) conventions for the determination of cost recovery,
depreciation and amortization deductions, as it determines in its sole
discretion are necessary or appropriate to execute the provisions of the
Agreement, to comply with federal and state tax laws, and are in the best
interest of the Partners.

2.

No Interest

No interest shall be paid by the Partnership on Capital Contributions or on
balances in Partners’ Capital Accounts.

3.

No Withdrawal

No Partner shall be entitled to withdraw any part of his or its Capital
Contribution or his or its Capital Account or to receive any distribution from
the Partnership, except as provided in Articles 4, 5, 7 and 13 of the Agreement.

B-4

AmericasActive:14392849.4

4.

Special Allocations in Connection with a Liquidating Event

Partners intend that the allocation of Net Income, Net Loss and other items of
income, gain, loss, deduction and credit required to be allocated to the Capital
Accounts of the Partners pursuant to the Agreement will result in final Capital
Account balances that will permit the amount each Partner is entitled to receive
upon “liquidation” of the Partnership (within the meaning of Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) of the Treasury Regulations) to equal the amount such
Partner would have received if such amount was distributable pro rata in
accordance with the Partners’ respective Percentage Interests. Accordingly,
notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.1(a) and Section 6.1(b) of the
Agreement, in the taxable year of the event precipitating a Liquidating Event
and thereafter, appropriate adjustments to allocations of Net Income and Net
Losses (and items thereof) to the Partners shall be made to achieve such result
to the maximum extent possible.

EXHIBIT C

SPECIAL ALLOCATION RULES; OTHER TAX MATTERS

1.

Special Allocation Rules

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement or this Exhibit C, the
following special allocations shall be made:

A.Minimum Gain Chargeback.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.1 of the
Agreement or any other provisions of this Exhibit C, if there is a net decrease
in Partnership Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable year, then, subject
to the exceptions set forth in Regulations Sections 1.704-2(f)(2)-(5), each
Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for
such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to such
Partner’s share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain, as determined
under Regulations Section 1.704-2(g).  Allocations pursuant to the previous
sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be
allocated to each Partner pursuant thereto.  The items to be so allocated shall
be determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(f)(6).  This
Section 1.A is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirements
in Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.  Solely for purposes of this Section 1.A, each Partner’s Adjusted
Capital Account Deficit shall be determined prior to any other allocations
pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Agreement with respect to such Partnership
taxable year and without regard to any decrease of Partner Minimum Gain during
such Partnership taxable year.

B.Partner Minimum Gain Chargeback.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
Section 6.1 of the Agreement or any other provisions of this Exhibit C (except
Section 1.A hereof), if there is a net decrease in Partner Minimum Gain
attributable to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt during any Partnership taxable year,
then, subject to the exceptions referred to in Regulations Section
1.704-2(i)(4), each Partner who has a share of the Partner Minimum Gain
attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with
Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially allocated items of
Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years)
in an amount equal to such Partner’s share of the net decrease in Partner
Minimum Gain attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in
accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(5).  Allocations pursuant to the
previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required
to be allocated to each Partner pursuant thereto.  The items to be so allocated
shall be determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4).  This
Section 1.B is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement
in such section of the Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.  Solely for purposes of this Section 1.B, each Partner’s Adjusted
Capital Account Deficit shall be determined prior to any other allocations
pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Agreement or this Exhibit with respect to such
Partnership taxable year, other than allocations pursuant to Section 1.A hereof.

C-1

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

C.Qualified Income Offset.  In the event any Partner unexpectedly receives any
adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Regulations Sections
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6),
and after giving effect to the allocations required under Sections 1.A and 1.B
hereof such Partner has an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, items of
Partnership income and gain (consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of
Partnership income, including gross income and gain for the Partnership taxable
year) shall be specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and manner
sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Regulations, its Adjusted
Capital Account Deficit created by such adjustments, allocations or
distributions as quickly as possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant to
this Section 1.C shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would
have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided
for in Section 6.1 of the Agreement or any other provisions of this Exhibit C
have been tentatively made as if this Section 1.C were not in this Agreement.
This Section 1.C is intended to constitute a qualified income offset under
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.

D.Nonrecourse Deductions.  Nonrecourse Deductions for any Partnership taxable
year shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests.  If the General Partner determines in its good faith
discretion that the Partnership’s Nonrecourse Deductions must be allocated in a
different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Regulations
promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner is authorized,
upon notice to the Limited Partners, to revise the prescribed ratio to the
numerically closest ratio for such Partnership taxable year which would satisfy
such requirements.

E.Partner Nonrecourse Deductions.  Any Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
Partnership taxable year shall be specially allocated to the Partner who bears
the economic risk of loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which
such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with
Regulations Section 1.704-2(i).

F.Code Section 754 Adjustments.  To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax
basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code
is required, pursuant to Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken
into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to
the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment
increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such
basis), and such item of gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the
Partners in a manner consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts
are required to be adjusted pursuant to such section of the Regulations.

C-2

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

G.Curative Allocations.  The allocations set forth in Section 1.A through 1.F of
this Exhibit C (the “Regulatory Allocations”) are intended to comply with
certain requirements of the Regulations under Section 704(b) of the Code.  The
Regulatory Allocations may not be consistent with the manner in which the
Partners intend to divide Partnership distributions.  Accordingly, the General
Partner is hereby authorized to divide other allocations of income, gain,
deduction and loss among the Partners so as to prevent the Regulatory
Allocations from distorting the manner in which Partnership distributions will
be divided among the Partners.  In general, the Partners anticipate that, if
necessary, this will be accomplished by specially allocating other items of
income, gain, loss and deduction among the Partners so that the net amount of
the Regulatory Allocations and such special allocations to each person is
zero.  However, the General Partner will have discretion to accomplish this
result in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that no allocation pursuant
to this Section 1.G shall cause the Partnership to fail to comply with the
requirements of Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), -2(e) or -2(i).

H.Forfeiture Allocations

(1)If any holder forfeits (or has repurchased at less than fair market value)
all or a portion of such holder’s Partnership Units, the Partnership shall make
forfeiture allocations to such holder in the manner and to the extent required
by proposed Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(xii) (as such proposed Regulations
may be amended or modified, including upon the issuance of temporary or final
Treasury Regulations).

2.

Allocations for Tax Purposes

A.Except as otherwise provided in this Section 2, for federal income tax
purposes, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be allocated among
the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of “book” income, gain,
loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Agreement and
Section 1 of this Exhibit C.

B.In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a Contributed
Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss, and deduction shall
be allocated for federal income tax purposes among the Partners as follows:

(1)(a)In the case of a Contributed Property, such items attributable thereto
shall be allocated among the Partners, consistent with the principles of Section
704(c) of the Code and the Regulations thereunder, and with the procedures and
methods described in Section 10.2 of the Agreement, to take into account the
variation between the 704(c) Value of such property and its adjusted basis at
the time of contribution; and

 

(b)

any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to a Contributed
Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its
correlative item of “book” gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1 of
the Agreement and Section 1 of this Exhibit C.

C-3

AmericasActive:14392849.4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

(2)(a)In the case of an Adjusted Property, such items shall

(1)first, be allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with the
principles of Section 704(c) of the Code and the Regulations thereunder to take
into account the Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such
property and the allocations thereof pursuant to this Exhibit B; and

(2)second, in the event such property was originally a Contributed Property, be
allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with Section 2.B(1) of this
Exhibit C; and

 

(b)

any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to an Adjusted Property
shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item
of “book” gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Agreement and
Section 1 of this Exhibit C.

C.To the extent that the Treasury Regulations promulgated pursuant to Section
704(c) of the Code permit the Partnership to utilize alternative methods to
eliminate the disparities between the Carrying Value of property and its
adjusted basis, the General Partner shall have the authority to elect the method
to be used by the Partnership and such election shall be binding on all
Partners.

3.

No Withdrawal

No Partner shall be entitled to withdraw any part of its Capital Contribution or
its Capital Account or to receive any distribution from the Partnership, except
as provided in Articles 4, 5, 8 and 13 of the Agreement.
