8.02. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the terms of Section 8.01, each Company Party and their respective directors,
officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, consultants,
and other advisors or representatives shall have the rights to: (a) consider,
respond to, and facilitate Alternative Restructuring Proposals; (b) provide
access to non-public information concerning any Company Party to any Entity or
enter into Confidentiality Agreements or nondisclosure agreements with any
Entity; (c) maintain or continue discussions or negotiations with respect to
Alternative Restructuring Proposals; (d) otherwise cooperate with, assist,
participate in, or facilitate any inquiries, proposals, discussions, or

discussions or negotiations with holders of Company Claims (including any
Consenting Creditor), any other party in interest in the Chapter 11 Cases
(including any official committee and the United States Trustee), or any other
Entity regarding the Restructuring Transactions or Alternative Restructuring
Proposals. If any Company Party receives a written or oral proposal or
expression of interest regarding any Alternative Restructuring Proposal that
that a majority of the Company’s applicable Board of Directors, Board of
Managers, or similar governing body determines in good faith and following
consultation with counsel is a bona fide committed proposal that represents
higher or otherwise better economic recovery to the Company’s stakeholders than
the Restructuring Transactions taken as a whole, within two (2) Business Days,
the Company Party shall notify (with email being sufficient) counsel to the
Senior Notes of any such proposal or expression of interest, with such notice to
include a copy of such proposal, if it is in writing, or otherwise a summary of
the material terms thereof. If the board of directors of the Company Parties
decides to exercise a Fiduciary Out (as defined herein), the Company Parties
shall notify counsel to the Consenting Creditors within two (2) Business Days of
such decision. Upon any determination by any Company Party to exercise a
Fiduciary Out, the other Parties to this Agreement shall be immediately and
automatically relieved of any obligation to comply with their respective
covenants and agreements herein in accordance with Section 13.05 hereof.

8.03. Nothing in this Agreement shall: (a) impair or waive the rights of any
Company Party to assert or raise any objection permitted under this Agreement in
connection with the Restructuring Transactions; or (b) prevent any Company Party
from enforcing this Agreement or contesting whether any matter, fact, or thing
is a breach of, or is inconsistent with, this Agreement.

8.04. The Company Parties, to the extent enforceable, waive any right to assert
that the exercise of termination rights under this Agreement is subject to the
automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and expressly stipulate and
consent hereunder to the prospective modification of the automatic stay
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code for purposes of exercising termination rights
under this Agreement, to the extent the Bankruptcy Court determines that such
relief is required.

Section 9. Transfer of Securities.

9.01. During the Agreement Effective Period, no Consenting Creditor shall
Transfer any ownership in any Company Claims to any affiliated or unaffiliated
party, including any party in which it may hold a direct or indirect beneficial
interest, unless:

(a) either (i) the transferee executes and delivers to counsel to the Company
Parties, at or before the time of the proposed Transfer, a Transfer Agreement or
(ii) the transferee is a Consenting Creditor or an affiliate thereof and the
transferee provides notice of such Transfer (including the amount and type of

TABLE OF CONTENTS

9.02. Upon compliance with the requirements of Section 9.01, the transferor
shall be deemed to relinquish its rights (and be released from its obligations)
under this Agreement to the extent of the rights and obligations in respect of
such transferred Company Claims. Any Transfer in violation of Section 9.01 shall
be void ab initio.

9.03. This Agreement shall in no way be construed to preclude the Consenting
Creditors from acquiring additional Company Claims. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (a) such additional Company Claims shall automatically and
immediately upon acquisition by a Consenting Creditor be deemed subject to the
terms of this Agreement (regardless of when or whether notice of such
acquisition is given to counsel to the Company Parties or counsel to the
Consenting Creditors) and (b) such Consenting Creditor must provide notice of
such acquisition (including the amount and type of Company Claim acquired) to
counsel to the Company Parties within five (5) Business Days of such acquisition
(email shall suffice).

9.04. This Section 9 shall not impose any obligation on any Company Party to
issue any “cleansing letter” or otherwise publicly disclose information for the
purpose of enabling a Consenting Creditor to Transfer any of its Company Claims.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to the extent a
Company Party and another Party have entered into a Confidentiality Agreement,
the terms of such Confidentiality Agreement shall continue to apply and remain
in full force and effect according to its terms, and this Agreement does not
supersede any rights or obligations otherwise arising under such Confidentiality
Agreements.

9.05. Notwithstanding Section 9.01, a Qualified Marketmaker that acquires any
Company Claims with the purpose and intent of acting as a Qualified Marketmaker
for such Company Claims shall not be required to execute and deliver a Transfer
Agreement in respect of such Company Claims if (i) such Qualified Marketmaker
subsequently transfers such Company Claims (by purchase, sale assignment,
participation, or otherwise) within five (5) Business Days of its acquisition to
a transferee that is an entity that is not an affiliate, affiliated fund, or
affiliated entity with a common investment advisor; (ii) the transferee
otherwise is a Permitted Transferee under Section 9.01; and (iii) the Transfer
otherwise is a Permitted Transfer under Section 9.01. To the extent that a
Consenting Creditor is acting in its capacity as a Qualified Marketmaker, it may
Transfer (by purchase, sale, assignment, participation, or otherwise) any right,
title, or interests in Company Claims that the Qualified Marketmaker acquires
from a holder of the Company Claims who is not a Consenting Creditor without the
requirement that the transferee be a Permitted Transferee.

9.06. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 9, the restrictions on
Transfer set forth in this Section 9 shall not apply to the grant of any liens
or encumbrances on any claims and interests in favor of a bank or broker-dealer
holding custody of such claims and interests in the ordinary course of business
and which lien or encumbrance is released upon the Transfer of such claims and
interests.

under this Agreement is subject to the automatic stay provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code, and expressly stipulates and consents hereunder to the
prospective modification of the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code
for purposes of exercising termination rights under this Agreement, to the
extent the Bankruptcy Court determines that such relief is required.

16.13. Waiver. If the Restructuring Transactions are not consummated, or if this
Agreement is terminated for any reason, the Parties fully reserve any and all of
their rights and nothing herein shall constitute or be deemed to constitute such
Party’s consent or approval of any chapter 11 plan of reorganization for the
Debtors or any waiver of any rights such Party may have under any subordination
agreement. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 408 and any other applicable
rules of evidence, this Agreement and all negotiations relating to this
Agreement shall not be admissible into evidence in any proceeding other than a
proceeding to enforce its terms or the payment of damages to which a Party may
be entitled under this Agreement.

16.14. Specific Performance. It is understood and agreed by the Parties that
money damages would be an insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement
by any Party, and each non-breaching Party shall be entitled to specific
performance and injunctive or other equitable relief (without the posting of any
bond and without proof of actual damages) as a remedy of any such breach,
including an order of the Bankruptcy Court or other court of competent
jurisdiction requiring any Party to comply promptly with any of its obligations
hereunder.

16.15. Several, Not Joint, Claims. Except where otherwise specified, the
agreements, representations, warranties, duties and obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement are, in all respects, several and not joint.

16.16. Severability and Construction. If any provision of this Agreement shall
be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid, or
unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect if
essential terms and conditions of this Agreement for each Party remain valid,
binding, and enforceable.

16.17. Relationship Among Consenting Creditors.

(a) None of the Consenting Creditors shall have any fiduciary duty, any duty of
trust or confidence in any form, or other duties or responsibilities to each
other, the Company Parties or their affiliates, or any of the Company Parties’
or their affiliates’ creditors or other stakeholders, including, without
limitation, any holders of Senior Notes Claims, Company Claims, and, other than
as expressly set forth in this Agreement, there are no commitments among or
between the Consenting Creditors. It is understood and agreed that any
Consenting Creditor may trade in any debt or equity securities of the Company
without the consent of the Company or any other Consenting Creditor, subject to
applicable securities laws and, solely in the case of Company Claims, this
Agreement (including Section 9 of this Agreement). No prior history, pattern or
practice of sharing confidences among or between any of the Consenting Creditors
and/or the Company shall in any way affect or negate this understanding and
agreement.

group(s) of the Consenting Creditors that principally manage and/or supervise

“group” (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5 or Section 14(d)(2) under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended or any successor provision). For the
avoidance of doubt, neither the existence of this Agreement, nor any action that
may be taken by a Consenting Creditors pursuant to this Agreement, shall be

approval, or waiver, it is conveyed in writing (including electronic mail)
between each such counsel without representations or warranties of any kind on
behalf of such counsel.

of matters that could otherwise be the subject of litigation among the Parties.

plan of reorganization pursuant to chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States

ARTICLE II.

ADMINISTRATIVE AND PRIORITY CLAIMS

In accordance with section 1123(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, Administrative
Claims, Professional Fee Claims, Priority Tax Claims, and Other Priority Claims
have not been classified and thus are excluded from the Classes of Claims and
Interests set forth in Article III of the Plan.

 

A.

Administrative Claims

Except with respect to the Professional Fee Claims and Claims for fees and
expenses pursuant to section 1930 of chapter 123 of title 28 of the United
States Code, and except to the extent that a Holder of an Allowed Administrative
Claim and the Debtors against which such Allowed Administrative Claim is
asserted agree to less favorable treatment for such Holder, or such Holder has
been paid by any Debtor on account of such Allowed Administrative Claim prior to
the Effective Date, each Holder of such an Allowed Administrative Claim will
receive in full and final satisfaction of its Allowed Administrative Claim an
amount of Cash equal to the amount of such Allowed Administrative Claim in
accordance with the following: (1) if an Administrative Claim is Allowed on or
prior to the Effective Date, on the Effective Date or as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter (or, if not then due, when such Allowed Administrative
Claim is due or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter); (2) if such
Administrative Claim is not Allowed as of the Effective Date, no later than 30
days after the date on which the Reorganized Debtors Allow such Allowed
Administrative Claim or the date on which an order Allowing such Administrative
Claim becomes a Final Order, or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, as
applicable; (3) if such Allowed Administrative Claim is based on liabilities
incurred by the Debtors in the ordinary course of their business after the
Petition Date, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the particular
transaction giving rise to such Allowed Administrative Claim without any further
action by the Holder of such Allowed Administrative Claim; (4) at such time and
upon such terms as may be agreed upon by such Holder and the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors, as applicable; or (5) at such time and upon such terms as
set forth in an order of the Bankruptcy Court.

Holders of Administrative Claims that are required to File and serve a request
for payment of such Administrative Claims by the Administrative Claims Bar Date
that do not File and serve such a request by the Administrative Claims Bar Date
shall be forever barred, stopped, and enjoined from asserting such
Administrative Claims against the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, and such
Administrative Claims shall be deemed compromised, settled, and released as of
the Effective Date. For the avoidance of doubt, Holders of Transaction Expenses
Claims shall not be required to File or serve any request for payment of such
Transaction Expenses Claim.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any unpaid Claim
payable to the Consenting Creditors or the RBL Agent on account of Transaction
Expenses shall constitute Allowed Administrative Claims and shall be paid on a
current basis in full in Cash on the Effective Date, or to the extent accrued
after the Effective Date, on a current basis in full in Cash as invoiced;
provided that upon the payment of all fees and expenses due to the RBL Agent as

diminution of value under the Final Cash Collateral Order shall be irrevocably
released, waived and discharged on the Effective Date unless the RBL Claims are
not paid in full under the Plan. Nothing herein shall require the Consenting
Creditors or the RBL Agent or their respective professionals to file

the Plan.

Professional Fee Escrow Amount.

As soon as possible after Confirmation and not later than the Effective Date,
the Debtors shall establish and fund the Professional Fee Escrow Account with

Account shall be maintained in trust for the Professionals. Such funds shall not
be considered property of the Debtors’ Estates. The amount of Professional Fee
Claims owing to the Professionals shall be paid in Cash to such Professionals

practicable after such Claims are Allowed by a Final Order. When all such
Allowed amounts owing to Professionals have been paid in full, any remaining

the Reorganized Debtors, subject to the Liens of the Exit Facility and such
other Liens or other encumbrances as may be permitted thereby.

Business Days after the Confirmation Date and (b) two Business Days prior to the
Effective Date; provided that such estimate shall not be considered an admission

expenses of such Professional.

Confirmation Date, the Debtors will, in the ordinary course of business and
without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy

fees and expenses incurred by the Debtors. Upon the Confirmation Date, any
requirement that Professionals and Ordinary Course Professionals comply with
sections 327 through 331 and 1103 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Interim
Compensation Order, or the Ordinary Course Professionals Order, in seeking
retention or compensation for services rendered after such date shall terminate,
and the Debtors may employ and pay any Professional or Ordinary Course
Professional in the ordinary course of business without any further notice to or
action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

 

F.

Priority Tax Claims

Except to the extent that a Holder of an Allowed Priority Tax Claim and the
Debtors against which such Allowed Priority Tax Claim is asserted agree to a
less favorable treatment for such Holder, in full and final satisfaction,
settlement, release, and discharge of and in exchange for each Allowed Priority
Tax Claim, each Holder of such Allowed Priority Tax Claim shall be treated in
accordance with the terms set forth in section 1129(a)(9)(C) of the Bankruptcy
Code and, for the avoidance of doubt, Holders of Allowed Priority Tax Claims
will receive interest on such Allowed Priority Tax Claims after the Effective
Date in accordance with sections 511 and 1129(a)(9)(C) of the Bankruptcy Code.

all such fees when due and payable, and shall File with the Bankruptcy Court
quarterly reports in a form reasonably acceptable to the U.S. Trustee. Each

ARTICLE III.

CLASSIFICATION, TREATMENT, AND VOTING OF CLAIMS AND INTERESTS

 

A.

Classification of Claims and Interests

The Plan constitutes a separate plan proposed by each Debtor within the meaning
of section 1121 of the Bankruptcy Code; provided that the Debtors and the
Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, shall consolidate Allowed Claims into one
Estate for purposes of distributions for Class 5. Except for the Claims
addressed in Article II of the Plan, all Claims and Interests are classified in
the Classes set forth below for all purposes, including voting, Confirmation,
and distribution pursuant to the Plan, all in accordance with sections 1122 and
1123(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. A Claim or an Interest is classified in a
particular Class only to the extent that the Claim or Interest qualifies within
the description of that Class and is classified in other Classes to the extent
that any portion of the Claim or Interest qualifies within the description of
such other Classes. A Claim or an Interest also is classified in a particular
Class for the purpose of receiving distributions under the Plan only to the
extent that such Claim or Interest is an Allowed Claim or Existing Interest in
that Class and has not been paid, released, or otherwise satisfied or disallowed
by Final Order prior to the Effective Date.

Unless otherwise indicated, except to the extent that the Debtors and a Holder
of such Allowed Claim or Interest, as applicable, agree to a less favorable
treatment (subject to the consent of the Requisite Creditors, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld), each Holder of an Allowed Claim or Interest, as
applicable, shall receive such treatment on the Effective Date (or, if payment
is not then due, in accordance with its terms in the ordinary course of
business) or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter. For all purposes
under the Plan, each Class will contain sub-Classes for each of the Debtors, as
applicable; provided, that any Class that does not contain any Allowed Claims or
Existing Interests with respect to a particular Debtor will be treated in
accordance with Article III.D below.

Below is a chart assigning each Class a number for purposes of identifying each
separate Class.

R.

Preservation of Causes of Action

Unless any Causes of Action against an Entity are expressly waived,
relinquished, exculpated, released, compromised, or settled in the Plan,
including pursuant to Article VIII of the Plan or a Final Order, in accordance
with section 1123(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, such Causes of Action shall be
Retained Causes of Action, whether arising before or after the Petition Date,
including any actions specifically enumerated in the Plan Supplement, and the
Reorganized Debtors’ rights to commence, prosecute, or settle such Retained
Causes of Action shall be preserved notwithstanding the occurrence of the
Effective Date. No Entity may rely on the absence of a specific reference in the
Plan, the Plan Supplement, or the Disclosure Statement to any Cause of Action
against them as any indication that the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors will
not pursue any and all available Causes of Action against them. The Debtors and
the Reorganized Debtors expressly reserve all rights to prosecute any and all
Causes of Action against any Entity, except as otherwise expressly provided
herein. Unless any Causes of Action against an Entity are expressly waived,
relinquished, exculpated, released, compromised, or settled in the Plan,
including pursuant to Article VIII of the Plan or a Final Order, the Reorganized
Debtors expressly reserve all Causes of Action, for later adjudication, and,
therefore, no preclusion doctrine, including the doctrines of res judicata,
collateral estoppel, issue preclusion, claim preclusion, estoppel (judicial,
equitable, or otherwise), or laches, shall apply to such Causes of Action upon,
after, or as a consequence of the Confirmation or Consummation. For the
avoidance of doubt, in no instance will any Cause of Action preserved pursuant
to this Article IV.R include any claim or Cause of Action with respect to, or
against, a Released Party that is released under Article VIII of the Plan.

In accordance with section 1123(b)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code, any Causes of
Action preserved pursuant to the first paragraph of this Article IV.R that a
Debtor may hold against any Entity shall vest in the Reorganized Debtors. The
applicable Reorganized Debtor, through its authorized agents or representatives,
shall retain and may exclusively enforce any and all such Causes of Action. The
Reorganized Debtors shall have the exclusive right, authority, and discretion to
determine and to initiate, file, prosecute, enforce, abandon, settle,
compromise, release, withdraw, or litigate to judgment any such Causes of
Action, or to decline to do any of the foregoing, without the consent or
approval of any third party or any further notice to or action, order, or
approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

 

S.

Indenture Trustee Expenses

On the Effective Date, and without any further notice to or action, order or
approval of the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors shall
distribute Cash to the Indenture Trustee in an amount equal to the Indenture
Trustee Expenses without a reduction to recoveries to Holders of the Senior
Notes Claims; provided that the Indenture Trustee shall provide the Debtors with
the invoices (subject to redaction to preserve attorney-client privilege) for
which they seek payment no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the Effective
Date. If the Debtors dispute any Indenture Trustee Expenses, the Debtors shall
(i) pay the undisputed portion of the Indenture Trustee Expenses, (ii) notify
the Indenture Trustee with respect to any disputed portion of the Indenture
Trustee Expenses within ten (10) days after presentation of the invoices by the
Indenture Trustee, and (iii) escrow the amount of any disputed portion of the
Indenture Trustee Expenses pending any resolution. Upon such notification, the
Indenture Trustee may submit such dispute for resolution by the Bankruptcy
Court. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein affects the Indenture
Trustee’s rights to exercise its respective charging liens pursuant to the terms
of the applicable Indentures.

To the extent the Indenture Trustee provides services or incurs costs or
expenses, including professional fees, related to or in connection with the
Plan, the Confirmation Order or the Indentures after the Effective Date, the
Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to receive from the Reorganized Debtors,
without further Bankruptcy Court approval, reasonable compensation for such
services and reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred with
such services. The payment of such compensation and expenses will be made
promptly or as otherwise agreed to by the Indenture Trustee and the Reorganized
Debtors, subject to the consent of the Requisite Creditors (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The payment of the Indenture Trustee as set forth in the applicable Indenture
shall be considered a distribution on account of Senior Notes Claims.

 

T.

Transaction Expenses

The Debtors and Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, will, on the Effective Date
(or, to the extent not known or submitted to the Debtors for payment as of the
Effective Date, promptly following receipt of an invoice therefor, whether
incurred before or after the Effective Date) and to the extent invoiced in
accordance with the terms of the applicable engagement letter (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, no invoices shall be required to include itemized time
detail), pay the Transaction Expenses (whether accrued prepetition or
postpetition and to the extent not otherwise paid during the Chapter 11 Cases),
without the need for application by any such parties to the Bankruptcy Court,
and without notice and a hearing pursuant to section 1129(a)(4) of the
Bankruptcy Code or otherwise. For the avoidance of doubt, all fees and expenses
set forth in any engagement letter of any of the foregoing professionals
executed by Whiting Parent or any of its subsidiaries prior to or during the
Chapter 11 Cases shall be deemed reasonable by the Debtors and the Consenting
Creditors for purposes of determining what constitutes Transaction Expenses.

 

U.

Closing the Chapter 11 Cases

On and after the Effective Date, the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors shall be
permitted to close all of the Chapter 11 Cases of the Debtors except for the
Chapter 11 Case of Whiting Parent and any other Debtor identified in the
Restructuring Transactions Exhibit as having its Chapter 11 Case remain open
following the Effective Date, and all contested matters relating to any of the
Debtors, including objections to Claims, shall be administered and heard in the
Chapter 11 Case of Whiting Parent, irrespective of whether such Claim(s) were
Filed against a Debtor whose Chapter 11 Case was closed.

When all Disputed Claims have become Allowed or disallowed and all distributions
have been made in accordance with the Plan, the Reorganized Debtors shall seek
authority to close any remaining Chapter 11 Cases in accordance with the
Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy Rules.

ARTICLE V.

TREATMENT OF EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES

 

A.

Assumption or Rejection of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases

Unless an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease: (i) was previously assumed or
rejected by the Debtors, pursuant to a Final Order of the Bankruptcy Court
entered prior to the Effective Date; (ii) previously expired or terminated
pursuant to its own terms or by agreement of the parties thereto; (iii) is the
subject of a motion to reject filed by the Debtors on or before the Confirmation
Date, (iv) contains a change of control or similar provision that would be
triggered by the Chapter 11 Cases (unless such provision has been irrevocably
waived); or (v) is specifically designated as a contract or lease to be rejected
on the Schedule of Rejected Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, on the
Effective Date, each Executory Contract and Unexpired Lease shall be deemed
assumed pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, without the need for any
further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court, unless
such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease is listed on the Schedule of Rejected
Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, if any; provided that notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, no Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease shall
be assumed, assumed and assigned, or rejected without the written consent of the
Requisite Creditors (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). The
assumption of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases hereunder may include the
assignment of certain of such contracts to Affiliates. The Confirmation Order
will constitute an order of the Bankruptcy Court approving the above-described
assumptions, rejections, and assumptions and assignments.

Except as otherwise provided herein or agreed to by the Debtors and the
applicable counterparty, each assumed Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease
shall include all modifications, amendments, supplements, restatements, or other
agreements related thereto, and all rights related thereto, if any, including
all easements, licenses, permits, rights, privileges, immunities, options,
rights of first refusal, and any other interests. Modifications, amendments,
supplements, and restatements to prepetition Executory Contracts and Unexpired
Leases that have been

 

31



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

executed by the Debtors during the Chapter 11 Cases shall not be deemed to alter
the prepetition nature of the Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease or the
validity, priority, or amount of any Claims that may arise in connection
therewith. To the extent applicable, no change of control (or similar provision)
will be deemed to occur under any such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease.

If certain, but not all, of a contract counterparty’s Executory Contracts and/or
Unexpired Leases are assumed pursuant to the Plan, the Confirmation Order shall
be a determination that such counterparty’s Executory Contracts and/or Unexpired
Leases that are being rejected pursuant to the Plan are severable agreements
that are not integrated with those Executory Contracts and/or Unexpired Leases
that are being assumed pursuant to the Plan. Parties seeking to contest this
finding with respect to their Executory Contracts and/or Unexpired Leases must
file a timely objection to the Plan on the grounds that their agreements are
integrated and not severable, and any such dispute shall be resolved by the
Bankruptcy Court at the Confirmation Hearing (to the extent not resolved by the
parties prior to the Confirmation Hearing).

 

B.

Claims Based on Rejection of Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases

Counterparties to Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases listed on the Schedule
of Rejected Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, if any, shall be served
with a notice of rejection of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases with the
Plan Supplement. Proofs of Claim with respect to Claims arising from the
rejection of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, if any, must be Filed
with the Bankruptcy Court within 30 days after the date of the order of the
Bankruptcy Court approving such rejection. Any Claims arising from the rejection
of an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease that are not Filed within such time
will be automatically disallowed, forever barred from assertion, and shall not
be enforceable against, as applicable, the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, the
Estates, or property of the foregoing parties, without the need for any
objection by the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, or further
notice to, or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court or any other
Entity, and any Claim arising out of the rejection of the Executory Contract or
Unexpired Lease shall be deemed fully satisfied, released, and discharged,
notwithstanding anything in a Proof of Claim to the contrary. Claims arising
from the rejection of the Debtors’ Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases
shall be classified as General Unsecured Claims and shall be treated in
accordance with Article III of the Plan.

 

C.

Cure of Defaults for Assumed Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases

On the Effective Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter, the
Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, shall pay all Cure Costs
relating to Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases that are being assumed
under the Plan. Unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by the parties to the
applicable Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease, all requests for payment of
Cure Costs that differ from the amounts paid or proposed to be paid by the
Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors to a counterparty must be Filed with the
Solicitation Agent on or before 14 days after receiving the applicable Cure
Notice. Any such request that is not timely Filed shall be disallowed and
forever barred, estopped, and enjoined from assertion, and shall not be
enforceable against any Debtor or Reorganized Debtor, without the need for any
objection by the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors or any other party in interest
or any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court.
Any Cure Costs shall be deemed fully satisfied, released, and discharged upon
payment by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors of the applicable Cure Costs;
provided, however, that nothing herein shall prevent the Reorganized Debtors
from paying any Cure Costs despite the failure of the relevant counterparty to
file such request for payment of such Cure Costs. The Reorganized Debtors also
may settle any Cure Costs without any further notice to or action, order, or
approval of the Bankruptcy Court. In addition, any objection to the assumption
of an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease under the Plan must be Filed with
the Bankruptcy Court on or before the Confirmation Hearing. Any such objection
will be scheduled to be heard by the Bankruptcy Court at the Confirmation
Hearing or at the Debtors’ or Reorganized Debtors’, as applicable, first
scheduled omnibus hearing for which such objection is timely Filed. Any
counterparty to an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease that fails to timely
object to the proposed assumption of any Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease
will be deemed to have consented to such assumption.

 

32



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

If there is any dispute regarding any Cure Costs, the ability of the Reorganized
Debtors or any assignee to provide “adequate assurance of future performance”
within the meaning of section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any other matter
pertaining to assumption, then payment of any Cure Costs shall occur as soon as
reasonably practicable after entry of a Final Order resolving such dispute,
approving such assumption (and, if applicable, assignment), or as may be agreed
upon by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, and the
counterparty to the Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease. The Debtors and
Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, reserve the right at any time to move to
reject any Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease based upon the existence of any
such unresolved dispute. If the Bankruptcy Court determines that the Allowed
Cure Cost with respect to any Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease is greater
than the amount set forth in the applicable Cure Notice, the Debtors shall have
the right to add such Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease to the Schedule of
Rejected Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases, in which case such Executory
Contract or Unexpired Lease will be deemed rejected as of the Effective Date
subject to the applicable counterparty’s right to object to such rejection.

Assumption of any Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease pursuant to the Plan or
otherwise and full payment of any applicable Cure Costs pursuant to this Article
V.C shall result in the full release and satisfaction of any Cures, Claims, or
defaults, whether monetary or nonmonetary, including defaults of provisions
restricting the change in control or ownership interest composition or other
bankruptcy-related defaults, arising under any assumed Executory Contract or
Unexpired Lease at any time prior to the effective date of assumption. Any and
all Proofs of Claim based upon Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases that have
been assumed in the Chapter 11 Cases, including pursuant to the Confirmation
Order, and for which any Cure Costs have been fully paid pursuant to this
Article V.C, shall be deemed disallowed and expunged as of the Effective Date
without the need for any objection thereto or any further notice to or action,
order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

 

D.

Indemnification

On and as of the Effective Date, the Indemnification Obligations will be
assumed, irrevocable with respect to any claims relating to acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Date, and will survive the effectiveness
of the Plan, and the New Organizational Documents will provide for the
indemnification, defense, reimbursement, exculpation, and/or limitation of
liability of, and advancement of fees and expenses to the Debtors’ and the
Reorganized Debtors’ directors, officers, employees, or agents that were
employed by, or serving on the board of directors (or similar governing body)
of, any of the Debtors as of the Petition Date and/or at any time in the period
between the Petition Date and the Effective Date, to the fullest extent
permitted by law and at least to the same extent as the organizational documents
of each of the respective Debtors on the Petition Date or the applicable period
between the Petition Date and the Effective Date, against any Claims or Causes
of Action whether direct or derivative, liquidated or unliquidated, fixed or
contingent, disputed or undisputed, matured or unmatured, known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, asserted or unasserted, and, notwithstanding anything in
the Plan to the contrary, none of the Reorganized Debtors will amend and/or
restate the New Organizational Documents before or after the Effective Date to
terminate or adversely affect any of the Reorganized Debtors’ obligations to
provide such indemnification rights or such directors’, officers’, employees’,
or agents’ indemnification rights with respect to any claims relating to acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Date.

 

E.

Insurance Policies

Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, all of the Debtors’
insurance policies and any agreements, documents, or instruments relating
thereto, are treated as and deemed to be Executory Contracts under the Plan. On
the Effective Date, pursuant to section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, the
Debtors shall be deemed to have assumed all insurance policies and any
agreements, documents, and instruments related thereto, including all D&O
Liability Insurance Policies (including tail coverage liability insurance).
Entry of the Confirmation Order will constitute the Bankruptcy Court’s approval
of the Reorganized Debtors’ assumption of all such insurance policies, including
the D&O Liability Insurance Policies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in the Plan, Confirmation of the Plan shall not discharge, impair, or
otherwise modify any indemnity obligations assumed by the foregoing assumption
of insurance policies, including the D&O Liability Insurance Policies, and each
such indemnity obligation will be deemed and treated as an Executory Contract
that has been assumed by the Reorganized Debtors under the Plan as to which no
Proof of Claim or Claim for Cure Costs need be Filed, and shall survive the
Effective Date.

F.

Employee Compensation and Benefits

 

  1.

Compensation and Benefits Programs

Subject to the provisions of the Plan, all Compensation and Benefits Programs
shall be treated as Executory Contracts under the Plan and deemed assumed on the
Effective Date pursuant to the provisions of sections 365 and 1123 of the
Bankruptcy Code, except for:

 

  (a)

all employee equity or equity-based incentive plans, and any provisions set
forth in the Compensation and Benefits Programs that provide for rights to
acquire Interests in any of the Debtors;

 

  (b)

any Compensation and Benefits Programs that, as of the entry of the Confirmation
Order, have been specifically waived by the beneficiaries of any employee
benefit plan or contract; and

 

  (e)

Compensation and Benefits Programs that have been rejected pursuant to an order
of the Bankruptcy Court or is listed on the Schedule of Rejected Executory
Contracts and Unexpired Leases.

Any assumption of Compensation and Benefits Programs pursuant to the terms
herein shall not be deemed to trigger any applicable change of control,
immediate vesting, termination, or similar provisions therein. No counterparty
shall have rights under a Compensation and Benefits Programs assumed pursuant to
the Plan other than those applicable immediately prior to such assumption.

 

2.

Workers’ Compensation Programs.

As of the Effective Date, except as set forth in the Plan Supplement, the
Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors shall continue to honor their obligations
under: (a) all applicable workers’ compensation laws in states in which the
Reorganized Debtors operate; and (b) the Debtors’ written contracts, agreements,
agreements of indemnity, self-insured workers’ compensation bonds, policies,
programs, and plans for workers’ compensation and workers’ compensation
insurance. All Proofs of Claim on account of workers’ compensation shall be
deemed withdrawn automatically and without any further notice to or action,
order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court; provided that nothing in the Plan
shall limit, diminish, or otherwise alter the Debtors’ or Reorganized Debtors’
defenses, Causes of Action, or other rights under applicable non-bankruptcy law
with respect to any such contracts, agreements, policies, programs, and plans;
provided further that nothing herein shall be deemed to impose any obligations
on the Debtors in addition to what is provided for under applicable state law.

 

G.

Contracts and Leases After the Petition Date

Contracts and leases entered into after the Petition Date by any Debtor,
including any Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases assumed under section 365
of the Bankruptcy Code, will be performed by the applicable Debtor or
Reorganized Debtor liable thereunder in the ordinary course of its business.
Such contracts and leases that are not rejected under the Plan shall survive and
remain unaffected by entry of the Confirmation Order.

 

H.

Reservation of Rights

Nothing contained in the Plan or the Plan Supplement shall constitute an
admission by the Debtors or any other party that any contract or lease is in
fact an Executory Contract or Unexpired Lease or that any Debtor or Reorganized
Debtor has any liability thereunder. If there is a dispute regarding whether a
contract or lease is or was executory or unexpired at the time of assumption,
the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, shall have 45 days
following entry of a Final Order resolving such dispute to alter their treatment
of such contract or lease.

I.

Nonoccurrence of Effective Date

In the event that the Effective Date does not occur, the Bankruptcy Court shall
retain jurisdiction with respect to any request to extend the deadline for
assuming or rejecting Unexpired Leases pursuant to section  365(d)(4) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

ARTICLE VI.

PROVISIONS GOVERNING DISTRIBUTIONS

 

A.

Distributions on Account of Claims and Interests Allowed as of the Effective
Date

Except as otherwise provided herein, in a Final Order, or as otherwise agreed to
by the Debtors (or the Reorganized Debtors) and the Holder of the applicable
Claim or Interest, on the first Distribution Date, the Distribution Agent shall
make initial distributions under the Plan on account of Claims and Interests
Allowed on or before the Effective Date; provided, however, that (1) Allowed
Administrative Claims with respect to liabilities incurred by the Debtors in the
ordinary course of business shall be paid or performed in the ordinary course of
business in accordance with the terms and conditions of any controlling
agreements, course of dealing, course of business, or industry practice, and
(2) Allowed Priority Tax Claims shall be paid in accordance with Article II.C.
To the extent any Allowed Priority Tax Claim is not due and owing on the
Effective Date, such Claim shall be paid in full in Cash in accordance with the
terms of any agreement between the Debtors and the Holder of such Claim or as
may be due and payable under applicable non-bankruptcy law or in the ordinary
course of business. A Distribution Date shall occur no more frequently than once
in every 90-day period after the Effective Date, as necessary, in the
Reorganized Debtors’ sole discretion.

 

B.

Rights and Powers of the Distribution Agent

 

  1.

Powers of Distribution Agent

The Distribution Agent shall be empowered to: (a) effect all actions and execute
all agreements, instruments, and other documents necessary to perform its duties
under the Plan; (b) make all distributions contemplated hereby; (c) employ
professionals to represent it with respect to its responsibilities; and
(d) exercise such other powers as may be vested in the Distribution Agent by
order of the Bankruptcy Court, pursuant to the Plan, or as deemed by the
Distribution Agent to be necessary and proper to implement the provisions
hereof.

 

  2.

Expenses Incurred On or After the Effective Date

Except as otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, the amount of any
reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Distribution Agent on or after the
Effective Date (including taxes) and any reasonable compensation and expense
reimbursement claims (including reasonable attorney fees and expenses) made by
the Distribution Agent shall be paid in Cash by the Reorganized Debtors.

 

C.

Special Rules for Distributions to Holders of Disputed Claims

Except as otherwise agreed by the relevant parties: no partial payments and no
partial distributions shall be made with respect to a Disputed Claim until all
such disputes in connection with such Disputed Claim have been resolved by
settlement or Final Order. Any dividends or other distributions arising from
property distributed to Holders of Allowed Claims in a Class and paid to such
Holders under the Plan shall also be paid, in the applicable amounts, to any
Holder of a Disputed Claim in such Class that becomes an Allowed Claim after the
date or dates that such dividends or other distributions were earlier paid to
Holders of Allowed Claims in such Class.

Any fund established to hold consideration to be received under the Plan pending
resolution of Disputed Claims shall be treated as a “disputed ownership fund”
pursuant to Treasury Regulation section 1.468B-9. Any such fund shall,
therefore, be subject to entity-level taxation. For the avoidance of doubt, any
New Common Stock shall not be issued to such fund; rather, Reorganized Whiting
Parent shall retain sufficient authorized, but unissued, New Common Stock and
issue them directly to Holders of Claims following the resolution of Disputed
Claims.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

D.

Delivery of Distributions

 

  1.

Record Date for Distributions

Except as provided herein, on the Distribution Record Date, the Claims Register
shall be closed and the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or any other party
responsible for making distributions under the Plan shall be authorized and
entitled to recognize only those record Holders listed on the Claims Register or
any other transfer register for each Class of Claims as maintained by the
Debtors or their agents, each of which shall be deemed closed as of the close of
business on the Distribution Record Date, and there shall be no further changes
in the record Holders of the applicable Claims. In addition, with respect to
payment of any Cure Costs or disputes over any Cure Costs, neither the Debtors
nor the Distribution Agent shall have any obligation to recognize or deal with
any party other than the non-Debtor party to the applicable Executory Contract
or Unexpired Lease as of the Effective Date, even if such non-Debtor party has
thereafter sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred its Claim for Cure Costs.
The Distribution Record Date shall not apply to Senior Notes deposited with DTC,
the Holders of which shall receive distributions in accordance with the
customary procedures of DTC.

 

  2.

Distribution Process

The Distribution Agent shall make all distributions required under the Plan,
except that with respect to distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims governed
by a separate agreement, shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
implement appropriate mechanics governing such distributions in accordance with
the Plan and the terms of the relevant governing agreement. Except as otherwise
provided herein, and notwithstanding any authority to the contrary,
distributions to Holders of Allowed Claims and Allowed Interests, including
Claims and Interests that become Allowed after the Effective Date, shall be made
to Holders of record or their respective designees as of the Distribution Record
Date: (a) to the address of such Holder or designee as set forth in the
applicable register (or if the appropriate notice has been provided pursuant to
the governing agreement in writing, on or before the date that is 10 calendar
days before the Effective Date, of a change of address or an identification of
designee, to the changed address or to such designee, as applicable); or (b) in
accordance with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4, as modified and made
applicable by Bankruptcy Rule 7004, if no address exists in the applicable
register, no Proof of Claim has been Filed, and the Distribution Agent has not
received a written notice of a change of address on or before the date that is
10 calendar days before the Effective Date. The Debtors, the Reorganized
Debtors, and the Distribution Agent, as applicable, shall not incur any
liability whatsoever on account of any distributions under the Plan. Except as
otherwise provided in the Plan, Holders of Claims and Holders of Interests shall
not be entitled to interest, dividends, or accruals on the distributions
provided for in the Plan, regardless of whether such distributions are delivered
on or at any time after the Effective Date.

 

  3.

Delivery of Distributions to Holders of Senior Notes Claims

Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or reasonably requested by the
Indenture Trustee, all distributions to Holders of Senior Notes Claims shall be
made to and deemed completed when received by the Indenture Trustee.

 

  4.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate

Except as otherwise provided in a Bankruptcy Court order, as of the Effective
Date, any Claim asserted in currency other than U.S. dollars shall be
automatically deemed converted to the equivalent U.S. dollar value using the
exchange rate for the applicable currency as published in The Wall Street
Journal, National Edition, on the Effective Date.

 

  5.

Fractional, Undeliverable, and Unclaimed Distributions

 

  a.

Fractional Distributions. Whenever any distribution of fractional shares of New
Common Stock or Cash would otherwise be required pursuant to the Plan, the
actual distribution shall reflect a rounding of such fraction to the nearest
interest or share or dollar, as applicable, with half interests of shares, or
any amount equal to $0.50, or less being rounded down. The total number of
authorized shares of New Common Stock to be distributed pursuant to the Plan
shall be adjusted as necessary to account for the foregoing rounding.

 

36



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

  b.

Undeliverable Distributions. If any distribution to a Holder of an Allowed Claim
is returned to the Distribution Agent as undeliverable, no further distributions
shall be made to such Holder unless and until the Distribution Agent is notified
in writing of such Holder’s then-current address or other necessary information
for delivery, at which time all currently due missed distributions shall be made
to such Holder on the next Distribution Date. Undeliverable distributions shall
remain in the possession of the Reorganized Debtors until such time as a
distribution becomes deliverable, or such distribution reverts to the
Reorganized Debtors or is canceled pursuant to Article VI.D.5.c of the Plan, and
shall not be supplemented with any interest, dividends, or other accruals of any
kind.

 

  c.

Reversion. Any distribution under the Plan that is an Unclaimed Distribution for
a period of 6 months after distribution shall be deemed unclaimed property under
section 347(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and such Unclaimed Distribution shall
revest in the applicable Reorganized Debtor and, to the extent such Unclaimed
Distribution is comprised of New Common Stock, such New Common Stock shall be
canceled. Upon such revesting, the Claim of the Holder or its successors with
respect to such property shall be canceled, discharged, and forever barred
notwithstanding any applicable federal or state escheat, abandoned, or unclaimed
property laws, or any provisions in any document governing the distribution that
is an Unclaimed Distribution, to the contrary.

 

  6.

Minimum; De Minimis Distributions

No Cash payment of less than $250 shall be made to a Holder of an Allowed Claim
on account of such Allowed Claim.

 

  7.

Surrender of Canceled Instruments or Securities

On the Effective Date, each Holder of a Certificate shall be deemed to have
surrendered such Certificate to the Distribution Agent or a Servicer (to the
extent the relevant Claim is governed by an agreement and administered by a
Servicer). Such Certificate shall be canceled solely with respect to the
Debtors, and such cancelation shall not alter the obligations or rights of any
non-Debtor third parties vis-à-vis one another with respect to such Certificate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, this Article VI.D.6 shall not apply to
any Claims and Interests that are Reinstated pursuant to the terms of the Plan.

 

E.

Compliance with Tax Requirements/Allocations

In connection with the Plan, to the extent applicable, the Distribution Agent
shall request distributees to provide appropriate documentation that may be
required for an exemption from withholding or reporting, and shall comply with
all tax withholding and reporting requirements imposed on it by any Governmental
Unit, and all distributions pursuant to the Plan shall be subject to such
withholding and reporting requirements unless an exception applies.
Notwithstanding any provision in the Plan to the contrary, the Distribution
Agent shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to comply with such
withholding and reporting requirements, including liquidating a portion of the
distribution to be made under the Plan to generate sufficient funds to pay
applicable withholding taxes, or withholding distributions pending receipt of
information necessary to facilitate such distributions. The Reorganized Debtors
and the Distribution Agent reserves the right to allocate all distributions made
under the Plan in compliance with all applicable wage garnishments, alimony,
child support, and other spousal awards, liens, and encumbrances. All Persons
holding Claims shall be required to provide any information necessary to effect
information reporting and the withholding of such taxes. Notwithstanding any
other provision of the Plan to the contrary, each Holder of an Allowed Claim
shall have the sole and exclusive responsibility for the satisfaction and
payment of any tax obligations imposed by any Governmental Unit, including
income, withholding, and other tax obligations, on account of such distribution.

Claims Paid or Payable by Third Parties

 

  1.

Claims Paid by Third Parties

Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, to the extent a Holder of a
Claim receives a distribution on account of such Claim and receives payment from
a party that is not a Debtor or a Reorganized Debtor on account of such Claim,
such Holder shall, within 14 calendar days of receipt thereof, repay or return
the distribution to the Reorganized Debtors to the extent the Holder’s total
recovery on account of such Claim from the third party and under the Plan
exceeds the amount of such Claim as of the date of any such distribution under
the Plan. The failure of such Holder to timely repay or return such distribution
shall result in the Holder owing the Reorganized Debtors annualized interest at
the Federal Judgment Rate on such amount owed for each Business Day after the
14-day grace period specified above until the amount is repaid.

 

  2.

Claims Payable by Insurance Carriers

No distributions under the Plan shall be made on account of an Allowed Claim
that is payable pursuant to one of the Debtors’ insurance policies until the
Holder of such Allowed Claim has exhausted all remedies with respect to such
insurance policy. To the extent that one or more of the Debtors’ insurers agrees
to satisfy in full or in part a Claim (if and to the extent adjudicated by a
court of competent jurisdiction), then immediately upon such insurers’
agreement, the applicable portion of such Claim may be expunged without a Claim
objection having to be Filed and without any further notice to or action, order,
or approval of the Bankruptcy Court; provided that the Debtors shall provide 21
calendar days’ notice to the Holder of such Claim prior to any disallowance of
such Claim during which period the Holder may object to such disallowance, and
if the parties cannot reach an agreed resolution, the matter shall be decided by
the Bankruptcy Court.

 

  3.

Applicability of Insurance Policies

Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, distributions to Holders of Allowed
Claims shall be in accordance with the provisions of any applicable insurance
policy. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein (including
Article VIII of the Plan), nothing contained in the Plan shall constitute or be
deemed a release, settlement, satisfaction, compromise, or waiver of any Cause
of Action that the Debtors or any other Entity may hold against any other
Entity, including insurers, under any policies of insurance or applicable
indemnity, nor shall anything contained herein constitute or be deemed a waiver
by such insurers of any defenses, including coverage defenses, held by such
insurers.

 

G.

Setoffs

Except as otherwise expressly provided for herein, each Reorganized Debtor,
pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code (including section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code),
applicable non-bankruptcy law, or as may be agreed to by the Holder of a Claim,
may (but shall not be required to) set off against any Allowed Claim and the
distributions to be made pursuant to the Plan on account of such Allowed Claim
(before any distribution is made on account of such Allowed Claim), any claims,
rights, and Causes of Action of any nature that such Debtor or Reorganized
Debtor, as applicable, may hold against the Holder of such Allowed Claim, to the
extent such claims, rights, or Causes of Action against such Holder have not
been otherwise compromised or settled on or prior to the Effective Date (whether
pursuant to the Plan or otherwise); provided, however, that neither the failure
to effect such a setoff nor the allowance of any Claim pursuant to the Plan
shall constitute a waiver or release by such Reorganized Debtor of any such
claims, rights, and Causes of Action that such Reorganized Debtor may possess
against such Holder. Other than as permitted under the Bankruptcy Code, in no
event shall any Holder of Claims be entitled to set off any such Claim against
any claim, right, or Cause of Action of the Debtor or Reorganized Debtor (as
applicable), unless such Holder has Filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court
requesting the authority to perform such setoff on or before the Confirmation
Date, and notwithstanding any indication in any Proof of Claim or otherwise that
such Holder asserts, has, or intends to preserve any right of setoff pursuant to
section 553 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise.

H.

Indefeasible Distributions

Any and all distributions made under the Plan shall be indefeasible and not
subject to clawback.

 

I.

Allocation Between Principal and Accrued Interest

Distributions in respect of Allowed Claims shall be allocated first to the
principal amount of such Claims (as determined for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) and then, to the extent the consideration exceeds the principal amount
of the Allowed Claims, to any portion of such Claims for accrued but unpaid
interest.

ARTICLE VII.

PROCEDURES FOR RESOLVING DISPUTED CLAIMS

 

A.

Allowance of Claims

After the Effective Date, each of the Reorganized Debtors shall have and retain
any and all rights and defenses the applicable Debtor had with respect to any
Claim immediately before the Effective Date. Except as expressly provided in the
Plan or in any order entered in the Chapter 11 Cases before the Effective Date
(including the Confirmation Order), no Claim shall become an Allowed Claim
unless and until such Claim is deemed Allowed under the Plan or the Bankruptcy
Code, or the Bankruptcy Court has entered a Final Order, including the
Confirmation Order (when it becomes a Final Order), in the Chapter 11 Cases
allowing such Claim.

 

B.

Claims Administration Responsibilities

Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan and notwithstanding any
requirements that may be imposed pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9019, after the
Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall have the sole authority to:
(1) File and prosecute objections to Claims; (2) settle, compromise, withdraw,
litigate to judgment, or otherwise resolve objections to any and all Claims,
regardless of whether such Claims are in a Class or otherwise; (3) settle,
compromise, or resolve any Disputed Claim without any further notice to or
action, order, or approval by the Bankruptcy Court; and (4) administer and
adjust the Claims Register to reflect any such settlements or compromises
without any further notice to or action, order, or approval by the Bankruptcy
Court. After the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall resolve Disputed
Claims in accordance with their fiduciary duties and pursuant to the terms of
the Plan.

 

C.

Estimation of Claims

Before, on, or after the Effective Date, the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors,
as applicable, may (but are not required to) at any time request that the
Bankruptcy Court estimate any Claim pursuant to applicable law, including
pursuant to section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code and/or Bankruptcy Rule 3012
for any reason, regardless of whether any party previously has objected to such
Claim or whether the Bankruptcy Court has ruled on any such objection, and the
Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction to estimate any such Claim, including
during the litigation of any objection to any Claim or during the pendency of
any appeal relating to such objection. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in the Plan, a Claim that has been expunged from the Claims Register,
but that either is subject to appeal or has not been the subject of a Final
Order, shall be deemed to be estimated at zero dollars, unless otherwise ordered
by the Bankruptcy Court. In the event that the Bankruptcy Court estimates any
Claim and does not provide otherwise, such estimated amount shall constitute a
maximum limitation on such Claim for all purposes under the Plan (including for
purposes of distributions and discharge) and may be used as evidence in any
supplemental proceedings, and the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors may elect to
pursue any supplemental proceedings to object to any ultimate distribution on
such Claim. Notwithstanding section 502(j) of the Bankruptcy Code, in no event
shall any Holder of a Claim that has been estimated pursuant to section 502(c)
of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise be entitled to seek reconsideration of such
estimation unless such Holder has Filed a motion requesting the right to seek
such reconsideration on or before seven (7) days after the date on which such
Claim is estimated. Each of the foregoing Claims and objection, estimation, and
resolution procedures are cumulative and not exclusive of one another. Claims
may be estimated and subsequently compromised, settled, withdrawn, or resolved
by any mechanism approved by the Bankruptcy Court.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

D.

Disputed Claims Reserve

On or before the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall establish one or
more reserves of New Common Stock for those General Unsecured Claims that are
Disputed Claims as of the Distribution Record Date (for the avoidance of doubt,
deducting such amounts from the Claims Equity Pool), which reserves shall be
administered by the Reorganized Debtors or the Distribution Agent, as
applicable. After the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors or the
Distribution Agent shall hold such New Common Stock in such reserve(s) in trust
for the benefit of the Holders of General Unsecured Claims that are Disputed
Claims as of the Distribution Record Date, that are ultimately determined to be
Allowed after the Distribution Record Date. The Reorganized Debtors or the
Distribution Agent shall distribute such amounts (net of any expenses, including
any taxes relating thereto), as provided herein, as such Claims are resolved by
a Final Order or agreed to by settlement, and such amounts will be distributable
on account of such Claims as such amounts would have been distributable had such
Claims been Allowed Claims as of the Effective Date under Article III of the
Plan solely to the extent of the amounts available in the applicable reserve(s).

Upon a Disputed Claim becoming disallowed by a Final Order, the applicable
amount of New Common Stock that was in the disputed claims reserve on account of
such Disputed Claim shall be canceled by the Reorganized Debtors.

Any assets held in a disputed claims reserve shall be subject to the tax rules
that apply to “disputed ownership funds” under 26 C.F.R. 1.468B–9. As such, such
assets will be subject to entity-level taxation, and the Reorganized Debtors
shall be required to comply with the relevant rules.

 

E.

Adjustment to Claims Without Objection

Any Claim that has been paid or satisfied, or any Claim that has been amended or
superseded, may be adjusted or expunged on the Claims Register by the Debtors or
the Reorganized Debtors without an objection having to be Filed and without any
further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

 

F.

Time to File Objections to Claims

Any objections to Claims shall be Filed on or before the later of (1) 180 days
after the Effective Date and (2) such other period of limitation as may be
specifically fixed by the Bankruptcy Court upon a motion by the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors.

 

G.

Disallowance of Claims

Any Claims held by Entities from which property is recoverable under sections
542, 543, 550, or 553 of the Bankruptcy Code or that is a transferee of a
transfer avoidable under sections 522(f), 522(h), 544, 545, 547, 548, 549, or
724(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, shall not be Allowed or deemed Allowed, and
Holders of such Claims may not receive any distributions on account of such
Claims until such time as such Causes of Action against that Entity have been
settled or a Bankruptcy Court order with respect thereto has been entered and
all sums due, if any, to the Debtors by that Entity have been turned over or
paid to the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors. All Proofs of Claim Filed on
account of an Indemnification Obligation shall be deemed satisfied and expunged
from the Claims Register as of the Effective Date to the extent such
Indemnification Obligation is assumed (or honored or reaffirmed, as the case may
be) pursuant to the Plan, without any further notice to or action, order, or
approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Plan, any Holder of an Allowed Claim under section 502(h) of the Bankruptcy
Code arising from an Avoidance Action shall, in lieu of any distribution to
Holders of Allowed General Unsecured Claims, solely receive Cash from the
proceeds of such Avoidance Action in an amount reasonably equivalent to the
percentage recovery received by Holders of General Unsecured Claims based on the
enterprise value of the Debtors for purposes of Confirmation; provided that the
Reorganized Debtors may elect in their sole discretion (and without any further
approval from the Court) to instead have such amount of Cash set off against the
recovery from the applicable Avoidance Action.

 

40



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Except as otherwise provided herein or as agreed to by the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors, any and all Proofs of Claim Filed after the Claims Bar Date
shall be deemed disallowed and expunged as of the Effective Date without any
further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy Court, and
Holders of such Claims may not receive any distributions on account of such
Claims, unless such late Proof of Claim has been deemed timely Filed by a Final
Order.

 

H.

Amendments to Claims

On or after the Effective Date, a Claim may not be Filed or amended without the
prior authorization of the Bankruptcy Court or the Reorganized Debtors, and any
such new or amended Claim Filed shall be deemed disallowed in full and expunged
without any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the Bankruptcy
Court to the maximum extent provided by applicable law.

 

I.

No Distributions Pending Allowance

If an objection to a Claim or portion thereof is Filed, no payment or
distribution provided under the Plan shall be made on account of such Claim or
portion thereof unless and until such Disputed Claim becomes an Allowed Claim,
unless otherwise determined by the Reorganized Debtors.

 

J.

Distributions After Allowance

To the extent that a Disputed Claim ultimately becomes an Allowed Claim,
distributions shall be made to the Holder of such Allowed Claim in accordance
with the provisions of the Plan. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
date that the order or judgment of the Bankruptcy Court allowing any Disputed
Claim becomes a Final Order, the Reorganized Debtors shall provide to the Holder
of such Claim the distribution to which such Holder is entitled under the Plan
as of the Effective Date, less any previous distribution (if any) that was made
on account of the undisputed portion of such Claim, without any interest,
dividends, or accruals to be paid on account of such Claim unless required under
applicable bankruptcy law or as otherwise provided herein.

 

K.

Single Satisfaction of Claims

Holders of Allowed Claims may assert such Claims against the Debtors obligated
with respect to such Claims, and such Claims shall be entitled to share in the
recovery provided for the applicable Class of Claims against the Debtors based
upon the full Allowed amount of such Claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
no case shall the aggregate value of all property received or retained under the
Plan on account of any Allowed Claim exceed 100 percent of the underlying
Allowed Claim (including applicable interest, if any such interest is Allowed).

ARTICLE VIII.

DISCHARGE, RELEASE, INJUNCTION AND RELATED PROVISIONS

 

A.

Discharge of Claims and Termination of Interests

Pursuant to section 1141(d) of the Bankruptcy Code, and except as otherwise
specifically provided in the Plan or in any contract, instrument, or other

discharge, and release, effective as of the Effective Date, of Claims (including
any Intercompany Claims resolved or compromised after the Effective Date by the
Reorganized Debtors), Interests, and Causes of Action of any nature whatsoever,
including any interest accrued on Claims or Interests from and after the
Petition Date, whether known or unknown, against, liabilities of, Liens on,

Interests, including demands, liabilities, and Causes of Action that arose
before the Effective Date, any liability (including withdrawal liability) to the
extent such Claims or Interests relate to services performed by employees of the

Bankruptcy Code; (2) a

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Claim or Interest based upon such debt, right, or Interest is Allowed pursuant
to section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code; or (3) the Holder of such a Claim or
Interest has accepted the Plan. Any default or “event of default” by the Debtors
or Affiliates with respect to any Claim or Interest that existed immediately
before or on account of the Filing of the Chapter 11 Cases shall be deemed cured
(and no longer continuing) as of the Effective Date. The Confirmation Order
shall be a judicial determination of the discharge of all Claims and Interests
subject to the Effective Date occurring.

Protection Against Discriminatory Treatment

In accordance with section 525 of the Bankruptcy Code, and consistent with
Article VI of the United States Constitution, no Governmental Unit shall
discriminate against any Reorganized Debtor, or any Entity with which a
Reorganized Debtor has been or is associated, solely because such Reorganized
Debtor was a Debtor under chapter 11, may have been insolvent before the
commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases (or during the Chapter 11 Cases but before
such Debtor was granted or denied a discharge), or has not paid a debt that is
dischargeable in the Chapter 11 Cases.

 

G.

Release of Liens

Except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan, the Exit Facility Credit
Agreement, or in any contract, instrument, release, or other agreement or
document created pursuant to the Plan, on the Effective Date and concurrently
with the applicable distributions made pursuant to the Plan and, in the case of
a Secured Claim, satisfaction in full of the portion of the Secured Claim that
is Allowed as of the Effective Date, all mortgages, deeds of trust, Liens,
pledges, or other security interests against any property of the Estates shall
be fully released and discharged, and all of the right, title, and interest of
any holder of such mortgages, deeds of trust, Liens, pledges, or other security
interests shall revert to the Reorganized Debtors and their successors and
assigns, in each case, without any further approval or order of the Bankruptcy
Court and without any action or Filing being required to be made by the Debtors
or the Reorganized Debtors, or any other Holder of a Secured Claim. In addition,
at the sole expense of the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, the Holders of
Secured Claims (and the applicable agent for such Holders) shall be authorized
and directed to release any collateral or other property of the Debtors
(including any cash collateral and possessory collateral) held by such Holders
(and the applicable agent for such Holders), and to take such actions as may be
reasonably requested by the Reorganized Debtors to evidence the release of such
Liens and/or security interests, including the execution and delivery of all
documents reasonably requested by the Debtors, Reorganized Debtors, or the Exit
Facility Agent to evidence the release of such mortgages, deeds of trust, Liens,
pledges, and other security interests. The presentation or filing of the
Confirmation Order to or with any federal, state, provincial, or local agency,
records office, or department shall constitute good and sufficient evidence of,
but shall not be required to effect, the termination of such Liens and/or
security interests.

To the extent that any Holder of a Secured Claim that has been satisfied or
discharged in full pursuant to the Plan, or any agent for such Holder has filed
or recorded publicly any Liens and/or security interests to secure such Holder’s
Secured Claim, then as soon as practicable on or after the Effective Date, such
Holder (or the agent for such Holder) shall take any and all steps requested by
the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or Exit Facility Agent that are necessary
or desirable to record or effectuate the cancellation and/or extinguishment of
such Liens and/or security interests, including the making of any applicable
filings or recordings, and the Reorganized Debtors shall be entitled to make any
such filings or recordings on such Holder’s behalf. Notwithstanding the
foregoing paragraph, this Article VIII.G shall not apply to any Secured Claims
that are Reinstated pursuant to the terms of this Plan.

 

H.

Reimbursement or Contribution

If the Bankruptcy Court disallows a Claim for reimbursement or contribution of
an Entity pursuant to section 502(e)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code, then to the
extent that such Claim is contingent as of the Effective Date, such Claim shall
be forever disallowed notwithstanding section 502(j) of the Bankruptcy Code,
unless prior to the Effective Date (1) such Claim has been adjudicated as
non-contingent, or (2) the relevant Holder of a Claim has Filed a non-contingent
Proof of Claim on account of such Claim and a Final Order has been entered
determining such Claim as no longer contingent.

 

I.

Recoupment

In no event shall any Holder of a Claim be entitled to recoup such Claim against
any claim, right, or Cause of Action of the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors,
as applicable, unless such Holder actually has performed such recoupment and
provided notice thereof in writing to the Debtors on or before the Confirmation
Date, notwithstanding any indication in any Proof of Claim or otherwise that
such Holder asserts, has, or intends to preserve any right of recoupment.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

J.

Subordination Rights

Any distributions under the Plan to Holders of Allowed Claims shall be received
and retained free from any obligations to hold or transfer the same to any other
Holder and shall not be subject to levy, garnishment, attachment, or other legal
process by any Holder by reason of claimed contractual subordination rights. On
the Effective Date, any such subordination rights shall be deemed waived, and
the Confirmation Order shall constitute an injunction enjoining any Entity from
enforcing or attempting to enforce any contractual, legal, or equitable
subordination rights to property distributed under the Plan, in each case other
than as provided in the Plan; provided, that any such subordination rights shall
be preserved in the event the Confirmation Order is vacated, the Effective Date
does not occur in accordance with the terms hereunder or the Plan is revoked or
withdrawn.

 

K.

Reservation of Rights of the United States

As to the United States of America, its agencies, departments, or agents
(collectively, the “United States”), nothing in the Plan, the Plan Supplement,
or the Confirmation Order shall expand the scope of discharge, release, or
injunction to which the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors are entitled under the
Bankruptcy Code, if any. The discharge, release, and injunction provisions
contained in the Plan, the Plan Supplement, and the Confirmation Order are not
intended and shall not be construed to bar the United States from, subsequent to
the Confirmation Order, pursuing any actions, including but not limited to any
police or regulatory action, against anyone.

Notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan or the Plan Supplement to the
contrary, nothing in the Plan or the Plan Supplement shall discharge, release,
impair, or otherwise preclude: (a) any liability to the United States that is
not a “claim” within the meaning of section 101(5) of the Bankruptcy Code;
(b) any valid right of setoff or recoupment of the United States against any of
the Debtors or Reorganized Debtors; or (c) the exercise of the United States’
police and regulatory powers against the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or
any non-Debtor. Nor shall anything in the Confirmation Order, the Plan, or the
Plan Supplement: (a) enjoin or otherwise bar the United States and/or any
Governmental Unit from asserting or enforcing, outside the Bankruptcy Court, any
liability described in this paragraph, (b) divest any court, commission, or
tribunal of jurisdiction from resolving any matters relating to the liabilities
and/or claims set forth in this paragraph, or (c) confer in the Bankruptcy Court
jurisdiction over any matter as to which it would not have jurisdiction under
the Bankruptcy Code.

Moreover, nothing in the Confirmation Order, the Plan, or the Plan Supplement
shall release or exculpate any non-Debtor, including any Released Parties and/or
Exculpated Parties, from any liability to the United States, including but not
limited to any liabilities arising under the Internal Revenue Code, the
environmental laws, or the criminal laws against the Released Parties and/or
Exculpated Parties, nor shall anything in the Confirmation Order, the Plan, or
the Plan Supplement enjoin the United States from bringing any claim, suit,
action, or other proceeding against the Released Parties and/or Exculpated
Parties for any liability whatsoever; provided that nothing in this paragraph
shall affect in any way any release by the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors,
their Estates, any person exercising the rights of the Estates, or any successor
to the Estates of the Released Parties provided for in Article VIII.B of the
Plan.

Nothing contained in the Plan, the Plan Supplement, or the Confirmation Order
shall be deemed to determine the tax liability of any person or entity,
including but not limited to the Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors, nor shall
the Plan, the Plan Supplement, or the Confirmation Order be deemed to have
determined the federal tax treatment of any item, distribution, or entity,
including the federal tax consequences of the Plan, nor shall anything in the
Plan, the Plan Supplement, or the Confirmation Order be deemed to have conferred
jurisdiction upon the Bankruptcy Court to make determinations as to federal tax
liability and federal tax treatment except as provided under 11 U.S.C. § 505.

ARTICLE IX.

EFFECT OF CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAN

Upon entry of the Confirmation Order, the Bankruptcy Court shall be deemed to

conclusions of law in the Plan shall constitute conclusions of law even if they
are stated as findings of fact.

Burden of Proof

The Debtors, as proponents of the Plan, have satisfied their burden of proving
the elements of sections 1129(a) and 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code by a
preponderance of the evidence, which is the applicable evidentiary standard. The
Debtors have satisfied the elements of section 1129(a) and 1129(b) of the
Bankruptcy Code by clear and convincing evidence.

 

H.

Bankruptcy Rule 3016(a) Compliance

The Plan is dated and identifies the proponents thereof, thereby satisfying
Bankruptcy Rule 3016(a).

 

I.

Compliance with the Requirements of Section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code

The plan complies with all requirements of section 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code
as follows:

 

  1.

Section 1129(a)(1)–Compliance of the Plan with Applicable Provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code

The Plan complies with all applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code as
required by section 1129(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, including sections 1121,
1122, 1123, and 1125 of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

  a.

Standing

Each of the Debtors has standing to file a plan and the Debtors, therefore, have
satisfied section 1121 of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

  b.

Proper Classification

Pursuant to sections 1122(a) and 1123(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, Article III
of the Plan designates Classes of Claims and Interests, other than
Administrative Claims, Professional Fee Claims, and Priority Tax Claims, which
are not required to be classified. As required by section 1122(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code, each Class of Claims and Interests contains only Claims or
Interests that are substantially similar to the other Claims or Interests within
that Class.

 

  c.

Specification of Unimpaired Classes

Pursuant to section 1123(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, Article III of the Plan
specifies all Classes of Claims and Interests that are not Impaired.

 

  d.

Specification of Treatment of Impaired Classes

Pursuant to section 1123(a)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code, Article III of the Plan
specifies the treatment of all Classes of Claims and Interests that are
Impaired.

 

47



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

  e.

No Discrimination

Pursuant to section 1123(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, Article III of the Plan
provides the same treatment for each Claim or Interest within a particular
Class, as the case may be, unless the Holder of a particular Claim or Interest
has agreed to less favorable treatment with respect to such Claim or Interest,
as applicable.

 

  f.

Plan Implementation

Pursuant to section 1123(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Plan provides
adequate and proper means for the Plan’s implementation. Immediately upon the
Effective Date, sufficient Cash and other consideration provided under the Plan
will be available to make all payments required to be made on the Effective Date
pursuant to the terms of the Plan. Moreover, Article IV and various other
provisions of the Plan specifically provide adequate means for the Plan’s
implementation.

 

  g.

Voting Power of Equity Securities; Selection of Officer, Director, or Trustee
under the Plan

The New Organizational Documents comply with sections 1123(a)(6) and 1123(a)(7)
of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

  h.

Impairment/Unimpairment of Classes of Claims and Equity Interests

Pursuant to section 1123(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, (i) Class 1 (Other
Secured Claims), Class 2 (Other Priority Claims), Class 3 (RBL Claims), and
Class 4 (Trade Claims) are Unimpaired under the Plan, (ii) Class 5 (General
Unsecured Claims), Class 8 (Existing Interests), and Class 9 (Section 510(b)
Claims) are Impaired under the Plan, and (iii) Class 6 (Intercompany Claims) and
Class 7 (Intercompany Interests) are either Unimpaired or Impaired under the
Plan as agreed by the Debtors and the Requisite Creditors.

 

  i.

Assumption and Rejection of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases

In accordance with section 1123(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to
Article V of the Plan, on the Effective Date, each Executory Contract and
Unexpired Lease shall be deemed assumed unless such Executory Contract or
Unexpired Lease is listed on the Schedule of Rejected Executory Contracts and
Unexpired Leases, if any. The assumption of Executory Contracts and Unexpired
Leases hereunder may include the assignment of certain of such contracts to
Affiliates. The Debtors’ assumption and assignment of the Executory Contracts
and Unexpired Leases listed on the Schedule of Assumed Executory Contracts and
Unexpired Leases pursuant to Article V of the Plan governing assumption and
rejection of executory contracts and unexpired leases satisfies the requirements
of section 365(b) of the Bankruptcy Code and, accordingly, the requirements of
section 1123(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

The Debtors have exercised reasonable business judgment in determining whether
to reject, assume, or assume and assign each of their Executory Contracts and
Unexpired Leases under the terms of the Plan. Each pre- or post-Confirmation
rejection, assumption, or assumption and assignment of an Executory Contract or
Unexpired Lease pursuant to Article V of the Plan will be legal, valid and
binding upon the applicable Debtor and all other parties to such Executory
Contract or Unexpired Lease, as applicable, all to the same extent as if such
rejection, assumption, or assumption and assignment had been effectuated
pursuant to an appropriate order of the Court entered before the Confirmation
Date under section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code. Each of the Executory Contracts
and Unexpired Leases to be rejected, assumed, or assumed and assigned is deemed
to be an executory contract or an unexpired lease, as applicable.

 

  j.

Settlement of Claims and Causes of Action

All of the settlements and compromises pursuant to and in connection with the
Plan or incorporated by reference into the Plan comply with the requirements of
section 1123(b)(3) of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rule 9019.

 

48



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9019 and section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code and in
consideration for the distributions and other benefits provided under the Plan,
any and all compromise and settlement provisions of the Plan constitute
good-faith compromises, are in the best interests of the Debtors, the Estates,
and all Holders of Claims and Interests, and are fair, equitable, and
reasonable.

Specifically, the settlements and compromises pursuant to and in connection with
the Plan are substantively fair based on the following factors: (a) the balance
between the litigation’s possibility of success and the settlement’s future
benefits; (b) the likelihood of complex and protracted litigation and risk and
difficulty of collecting on the judgment; (c) the proportion of creditors and
parties in interest that support the settlement; (d) the competency of counsel
reviewing the settlement; the nature and breadth of releases to be obtained by
officers and directors; and (e) the extent to which the settlement is the
product of arm’s-length bargaining.

 

  k.

Cure of Defaults

Article V of the Plan provides for the satisfaction of default claims associated
with each Executory Contract and Unexpired Lease to be assumed in accordance
with section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Cure Costs identified in the
Schedule of Assumed Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases and any amendments
thereto, as applicable, represent the amount, if any, that the Debtors propose
to pay in full and complete satisfaction of such default claims. Any disputed
cure amounts will be determined in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Article V of the Plan, and applicable bankruptcy and nonbankruptcy law. As such,
the Plan provides that the Debtors will cure, or provide adequate assurance that
the Debtors will promptly cure, defaults with Executory Contracts and Unexpired
Leases in compliance with section 365(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. Thus, the
Plan complies with section 1123(d) of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

  l.

Other Appropriate Provisions

The Plan’s other provisions are appropriate and consistent with the applicable
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including provisions for (i) distributions to
holders of Claims and Interests, (ii) objections to Claims, (iii) procedures for
resolving disputed, contingent, and unliquidated claims, (iv) cure amounts,
procedures governing cure disputes, and (v) indemnification obligations.

 

  2.

Section 1129(a)(2)–Compliance of Plan Proponents with Applicable Provisions of
the Bankruptcy Code

The Debtors, as proponents of the Plan, have complied with all applicable
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code as required by section 1129(a)(2) of the
Bankruptcy Code, including sections 1125 and 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code and
Bankruptcy Rules 3017, 3018, and 3019. In particular, the Debtors are proper
debtors under section 109 of the Bankruptcy Code and proper proponents of the
Plan under section 1121(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. Furthermore, the solicitation
of acceptances or rejections of the Plan was (i) pursuant to the Conditional
Disclosure Statement Order; (ii) in compliance with all applicable laws, rules,
and regulations governing the adequacy of disclosure in connection with such
solicitation; and (iii) solicited after disclosure to Holders of Claims or
Interests of adequate information as defined in section 1125(a) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, the Debtors and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, affiliates, and Professionals have acted in “good
faith” within the meaning of section 1125(e) of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

  3.

Section 1129(a)(3)–Proposal of Plan in Good Faith

The Debtors have proposed the Plan in good faith and not by any means forbidden
by law based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the filing of the
Chapter 11 Cases, the Plan itself, and the process leading to its formulation.
The Chapter 11 Cases were filed, and the Plan was proposed, with the legitimate
purpose of allowing the Debtors to reorganize.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

  4.

Section 1129(a)(4)–Bankruptcy Court Approval of Certain Payments as Reasonable

Pursuant to section 1129(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, the payments to be made
for services or for costs in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases or the Plan
are approved. The fees and expenses incurred by Professionals retained by the
Debtors or the Creditors’ Committee shall be payable according to the orders
approving such Professionals’ retentions, the Interim Compensation Order, other
applicable Bankruptcy Court orders, or as otherwise provided in the Plan.

 

  5.

Section 1129(a)(5)–Disclosure of Identity of Proposed Management, Compensation
of Insiders, and Consistency of Management Proposals with the Interests of
Creditors and Public Policy

Pursuant to section 1129(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code, information concerning
the individuals proposed to serve on the Reorganized Whiting Parent Board and
each such individual’s compensation upon Consummation of the Plan has been fully
disclosed (in the Plan Supplement) to the extent available, and the appointment
to, or continuance in, such office of such person is consistent with the
interests of Holders of Claims and Interests and with public policy.

 

  6.

Section 1129(a)(6)–Approval of Rate Changes

Section 1129(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code is not applicable because the Plan
does not provide for rate changes by any of the Debtors.

 

  7.

Section 1129(a)(7)–Best Interests of Creditors and Interest Holders

The liquidation analysis included in the Disclosure Statement, and the other
evidence related thereto that was proffered or adduced at or prior to, or in
affidavits in connection with, the Confirmation Hearing, is reasonable. The
methodology used and assumptions made in such liquidation analysis, as
supplemented by the evidence proffered or adduced at or prior to, or in
affidavits filed in connection with, the Confirmation Hearing, are reasonable.
With respect to each Impaired Class, each Holder of an Allowed Claim or Interest
in such Class has accepted the Plan or will receive under the Plan on account of
such Claim or Interest property of a value, as of the Effective Date, that is
not less than the amount such Holder would receive if the Debtors were
liquidated under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

  8.

Section 1129(a)(8)–Conclusive Presumption of Acceptance by Unimpaired Classes;
Acceptance of the Plan by Each Impaired Class

Certain Classes of Claims and Interests are Unimpaired and are deemed
conclusively to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the
Bankruptcy Code. In addition, at least one Impaired Class that was entitled to
vote has voted to accept the Plan. Because the Plan provides that the certain
Classes of Claims and Interests will be Impaired and because no distributions
shall be made to Holders in such Classes, such Holders are deemed conclusively
to have rejected the Plan pursuant to section 1126(g) of the Bankruptcy Code
and, therefore, are not entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

 

  9.

Section 1129(a)(9)–Treatment of Claims Entitled to Priority Pursuant to
Section 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code

The treatment of Administrative Claims, Professional Fee Claims, Other Priority
Claims, and Priority Tax Claims under Article II of the Plan satisfies the
requirements of section 1129(a)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

  10.

Section 1129(a)(10)–Acceptance by at Least One Impaired Class

At least one Impaired Class has voted to accept the Plan. Accordingly, section
1129(a)(10) of the Bankruptcy Code is satisfied.

 

50



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

  11.

Section 1129(a)(11)–Feasibility of the Plan

The Plan satisfies section 1129(a)(11) of the Bankruptcy Code. Based upon the
evidence proffered or adduced at, or prior to, or in affidavits filed in
connection with, the Confirmation Hearing, the Plan is feasible and Confirmation
of the Plan is not likely to be followed by the liquidation, or the need for
further financial reorganization, of the Debtors or any successor to the Debtors
under the Plan, except as such liquidation is proposed in the Plan. Furthermore,
the Debtors will have adequate assets to satisfy their respective obligations
under the Plan.

 

  12.

Section 1129(a)(12)–Payment of Bankruptcy Fees

Article II.E of the Plan provides for the payment of all fees payable under 28
U.S.C. § 1930(a) in accordance with section 1129(a)(12) of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

  13.

Section 1129(a)(13)–Retiree Benefits

The Plan provides for the treatment of all retiree benefits in accordance with
section 1129(a)(13) of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

  14.

Section 1129(a)(14)–Domestic Support Obligations

The Debtors are not required by a judicial or administrative order, or by
statute, to pay any domestic support obligations, and therefore, section
1129(a)(14) of the Bankruptcy Code is inapplicable in these Chapter 11 Cases.

 

  15.

Section 1129(a)(15)–The Debtors Are Not Individuals

The Debtors are not individuals, and therefore, section 1129(a)(15) of the
Bankruptcy Code is inapplicable in these Chapter 11 Cases.

 

  16.

Section 1129(a)(16)–No Applicable Nonbankruptcy Law Regarding Transfers

Each of the Debtors that is a corporation is a moneyed, business, or commercial
corporation or trust, and therefore, section 1129(a)(16) of the Bankruptcy Code
is inapplicable in these Chapter 11 Cases.

 

  17.

Section 1129(b)–Confirmation of Plan Over Rejection of Impaired Classes

The Plan satisfies the requirements of section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code
with respect to the Classes presumed to have rejected the Plan pursuant to
section 1126(g) of the Bankruptcy Code or that have actually rejected the Plan
(if any). To determine whether a plan is “fair and equitable” with respect to a
class of claims, section 1129(b)(2)(B)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Code provides in
pertinent part that “the holder of any claim or interest that is junior to the
claims of such class will not receive or retain under the plan on account of
such junior claim or interest any property.” To determine whether a plan is
“fair and equitable” with respect to a class of interests, section
1129(b)(2)(C)(ii) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that “the holder of any
interest that is junior to the interests of such class will not receive or
retain under the plan on account of such junior interest any property.” There
are no classes junior to the deemed (or actual) rejecting classes of claims or
interests that will receive any distribution under the Plan. The Plan,
therefore, satisfies the requirements of section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

  18.

Section 1129(c)–Confirmation of Only One Plan With Respect to the Debtors

The Plan is the only plan that has been filed in these Chapter 11 Cases with
respect to the Debtors. Accordingly, the Plan satisfies the requirements of
section 1129(c) of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

  19.

Section 1129(d)–Principal Purpose Not Avoidance of Taxes

The principal purpose of the Plan is not the avoidance of taxes or the avoidance
of the application of section 5 of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Plan
satisfies the requirements of section 1129(d) of the Bankruptcy Code.

 

51



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TABLE OF CONTENTS

  20.

Section 1129(e)–Small Business Case

Section 1129(e) is inapplicable because these Chapter 11 Cases do not qualify as
small business cases thereunder.

 

J.

Securities Under the Plan

Pursuant to the Plan, and without further corporate or other action, the New
Common Stock and any debt issued or assumed by the Reorganized Debtors will be
issued or entered into, as applicable, on the Effective Date subject to the
terms of the Plan.

 

K.

Releases and Discharges

The releases and discharges of Claims and Causes of Action described in the
Plan, including releases by the Debtors and by Holders of Claims and Interests,
constitute good faith compromises and settlements of the matters covered
thereby. Such compromises and settlements are made in exchange for consideration
and are in the best interest of Holders of Claims and Interests, are fair,
equitable, reasonable, and are integral elements of the resolution of the
Chapter 11 Cases in accordance with the Plan. Each of the discharge, release,
indemnification, and exculpation provisions set forth in the Plan: (a) is within
the jurisdiction of the Court under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1334(a), 1334(b), and 1334(d);
(b) is an essential means of implementing the Plan pursuant to section
1123(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy Code; (c) is an integral element of the
transactions incorporated into the Plan; (d) confers material benefit on, and is
in the best interests of, the Debtors, their estates, and their creditors;
(e) is important to the overall objectives of the Plan to finally resolve all
Claims and Interests among or against the parties in interest in the Chapter 11
Cases with respect to the Debtors; (f) is consistent with sections 105, 1123,
1129, and all other applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code; (g) given and
made after due notice and opportunity for hearing; and (h), without limiting the
foregoing, with respect to the releases and injunctions in Article VIII of the
Plan, are (i) essential elements of the Restructuring Transactions and Plan,
terms and conditions without which the Consenting Creditors would not have
entered into the Restructuring Support Agreement, and (ii) narrowly tailored.
Furthermore, the injunction set forth in Article VIII is an essential component
of the Plan, the fruit of long-term negotiations and achieved by the exchange of
good and valuable consideration that will enable unsecured creditors to realize
distributions in the Chapter 11 Cases.

 

L.

Release and Retention of Causes of Action

It is in the best interests of Holders of Claims and Interests that the
provisions in Article VIII of the Plan be approved.

 

M.

Approval of Restructuring Support Agreement and Other Restructuring Documents
and Agreements

All documents and agreements necessary to implement the Plan, including the
Restructuring Support Agreement, are essential elements of the Plan, are
necessary to consummate the Plan and the Restructuring Transaction, and entry
into and consummation of the transactions contemplated by each such document and
agreement is in the best interests of the Debtors, the Estates, and Holders of
Claims and Interests. The Debtors have exercised reasonable business judgment in
determining which agreements to enter into and have provided sufficient and
adequate notice of such documents and agreements. The terms and conditions of
such documents and agreements have been negotiated in good faith, at
arm’s-length, are fair and reasonable, and are hereby reaffirmed and approved,
and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date and execution and delivery
in accordance with their respective terms, shall be in full force and effect and
valid, binding, and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms,
without the need for any further notice to or action, order, or approval of the
Bankruptcy Court, or other action under applicable law, regulation, or rule.

All of the exhibits presented at the Confirmation Hearing have been properly
received into evidence and are a part of the record before the Bankruptcy Court.

the Plan do not require additional disclosure or resolicitation under Bankruptcy
Rule 3019.

the right to revoke or withdraw the Plan with respect to any or all Debtors

of Executory Contracts or Unexpired Leases effectuated by the Plan, and any
document or agreement executed pursuant hereto will be null and void in all
respects; and (3) nothing contained in the Plan shall (a) constitute a waiver or
release of any Claims, Interests, or Causes of Action by any Entity,
(b) prejudice in any manner the rights of any Debtor or any other Entity, or
(c) constitute an admission, acknowledgement, offer, or undertaking of any sort
by any Debtor or any other Entity.

K.

Non-Severability

If, prior to Confirmation, the Bankruptcy Court holds any term or provision of
the Plan to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the Bankruptcy Court shall have
the power to alter and interpret such term or provision to make it valid or
enforceable to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with the original
purpose of the term or provision held to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, and
such term or provision shall then be applicable as altered or interpreted.
Notwithstanding any such holding, alteration, or interpretation, the remainder
of the terms and provisions of the Plan will remain in full force and effect and
will in no way be affected, impaired, or invalidated by such holding,
alteration, or interpretation. The Confirmation Order shall constitute a
judicial determination and shall provide that each term and provision of the
Plan, as it may have been altered or interpreted in accordance with the
foregoing, is: (1) valid and enforceable pursuant to its terms; (2) integral to
the Plan and may not be deleted or modified without the consent of the Debtors
and the consent of the Requisite Creditors (such consent not to be unreasonably
