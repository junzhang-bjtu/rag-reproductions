ARTICLE 4


CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS

At the time of their respective execution of this Agreement, the Partners shall
make or shall have made Capital Contributions as set forth in Exhibit A to this
Agreement.  The Partners shall own OP Units of the class or series and in the
amounts set forth in Exhibit A and shall have a Percentage Interest in the
Partnership as set forth in Exhibit A, which Percentage Interest shall be
adjusted in Exhibit A from time to time by the General Partner to the extent
necessary to reflect accurately exchanges, redemptions, Capital Contributions,
the issuance of additional OP Units or similar events having an effect on a
Partner’s Percentage Interest.  Except as required by law, as otherwise provided
in Sections 4.4, 4.5 and 10.5, or as otherwise agreed to by a Partner and the
Partnership, no Partner shall be required or permitted to make any additional
Capital Contributions or loans to the Partnership.
Section 4.2    Classes of Partnership Units.
The General Partner is hereby authorized to cause the Partnership to issue OP
Units designated as Class A OP Units, Class R OP Units, Class T OP Units and

obligations attributed to that Class under this Agreement.

Section 4.4    Additional Funding and Capital Contributions.
A.    General.  The General Partner may, at any time and from time to time,
determine that the Partnership requires additional funds (“Additional Funds”)
for the acquisition of additional Investments or for such other Partnership
purposes as the General Partner may determine.  Additional Funds may be raised
by the Partnership, at the election of the General Partner, in any manner
provided in, and in accordance with, the terms of this Section 4.4.  No Person
shall have any preemptive, preferential or similar right or rights to subscribe
for or acquire any Partnership Interest, except as set forth in this Section
4.4.
B.    Issuance of Additional Partnership Interests.  The General Partner, in its
sole and absolute discretion, may raise all or any portion of the Additional
Funds by accepting additional Capital Contributions of cash.  The General
Partner may also accept additional Capital Contributions of real property or any
other non-cash assets.  In connection with any such additional Capital
Contributions (of cash or property) or events, the General Partner is hereby
authorized to cause the Partnership from time to time to issue to Partners
(including the General Partner) or other Persons (including, without limitation,
in connection with the contribution of property to the Partnership) additional
OP Units or other Partnership Interests in one or more classes, or one or more
series of any of such classes, with such designations, preferences and relative,
participating, optional or other special rights, powers, and duties, including
rights, powers, and duties senior to then existing Limited Partner Interests,
all as shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole and absolute
discretion subject to Delaware law, and as set forth (if applicable) by
amendment to this Agreement, including without limitation, (i) the allocations
of items of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit to such class
or series of Partnership Interests; (ii) the right of each such class or series
of Partnership Interests to share in Partnership distributions; (iii) the rights
of each such class or series of Partnership Interests upon dissolution and
liquidation of the Partnership; and (iv) the right to vote, including, without
limitation, the Limited Partner approval rights set forth in Section 11.2A.  The
General Partner’s determination that consideration is adequate shall be
conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration relates to whether the
Partnership Interests are validly issued and paid.  In the event that the
Partnership issues additional Partnership Interests pursuant to this
Section 4.4B, the General Partner shall make such revisions to this Agreement
(including but not limited to the revisions described in Section 5.4 and
Section 8.6) as it determines are necessary to reflect the issuance of such
additional Partnership Interests.  Without limiting the foregoing, the General
Partner is expressly authorized to cause the Partnership to issue OP Units for
less than fair market value, so long as the General Partner concludes in good
faith that such issuance of Partnership Interests is in the best interests of
the Partnership.
Section 4.5    Other Contribution Provisions.
With the consent of the General Partner, in its sole discretion, one or more
Limited Partners may enter into agreements with the Partnership, in the form of
a guarantee or contribution agreement, which have the effect of providing a
guarantee of certain obligations of the Partnership.

sale of any OP Units or other Partnership Interests.
Section 4.7    No Interest; No Return.
No Partner shall be entitled to interest on its Capital Contribution or on such
Partner’s Capital Account.  Except as provided herein or by law, no Partner
shall have any right to demand or receive the return of its Capital Contribution
from the Partnership.

ARTICLE 5

DISTRIBUTIONS


Section 5.1    Distributions.
A.    Cash Available for Distribution. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
General Partner shall cause the Partnership to distribute, at such times and in
such amounts as the General Partner shall determine (each a “Distribution
Date”), Available Cash to the Partners in the following order of priority:
(1)    First, if any Aggregate Unpaid Dividend Equivalent Amounts exists, then,
such Aggregate Unpaid Dividend Equivalent Amount shall be calculated separately
with respect to each previous calendar quarter, and the amounts thereof shall be
distributed pro rata to the Partners holding Class A-2 OP Units, in the order in
which such Aggregate Unpaid Dividend Equivalent Amounts have accrued (with the
amounts attributable to the earliest calendar quarter being paid first and the
amounts attributable to the most recent calendar quarter being paid last), in
proportion to such Partners’ respective Aggregate Unpaid Divided Equivalent
Amounts attributable to each such calendar quarter;
(2)    Second, pro rata among the Partners holding Class A-2 OP Units in
proportion to their respective Percentage Interests on the Partnership Record
Date for the Current Quarter, until each Partner holding Class A-2 OP Units has
received an amount equal to its Dividend Equivalent for such Current Quarter;
(3)    Third, the remaining Available Cash pro rata among the Partners other
than the Partners holding Class A-2 OP Units, in proportion to such Partners’
respective Percentage Interests in the Partnership.
The amount and frequency of distributions of any cash other than Available Cash
shall be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion and, if
distributed, such cash shall be distributed to the Partners in accordance with
this Section 5.1A. If a new or existing Partner acquires an additional
Partnership Interest in exchange for a Capital Contribution on any date other
than a Partnership Record Date, the cash distribution attributable to such
additional Partnership Interest for the Partnership Record Date following the
issuance of such additional Partnership Interest shall be reduced in the
proportion that the number of days that such


{10654250;3}
25
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




additional Partnership Interest is held by such Partner bears to the number of
days between such Partnership Record Date and the immediately preceding
Partnership Record Date.
B.    Coordination. In no event may any Partner receive a distribution pursuant
to Sections 5.1A with respect to a Partnership Unit if such Partner is entitled
to receive a distribution with respect to REIT Shares for which such a
Partnership Unit has been exchanged.
C.    Special Fees. If the Partnership directly or indirectly incurs Special
Fees, (i) cash available for distribution under this Section 5.1 shall be
increased by the Special Fees to the extent that cash available for distribution
was previously reduced by such fees; and (ii) the amounts otherwise
distributable among the Classes of OP Units shall then be reduced to reflect
their appropriate shares of the Special Fees. For example, if the Partnership
has Available Cash of $1,000 after taking into account a distribution and
shareholder servicing fee of $200 that is required to be borne entirely by the
Partners holding Class T OP Units, Available Cash shall be increased to $1,200
for purposes of this Section 5.1 and the amounts otherwise distributable to the
Class T OP Units under this Section 5.1 shall be reduced by $200.
Section 5.2    Qualification as a REIT.
The General Partner shall use its best efforts to cause the Partnership to
distribute sufficient amounts under this Article 5 to enable the REIT Shares
Issuer to pay dividends to the Stockholders that will enable the REIT Shares
Issuer to (a) satisfy the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the
Code and Regulations (“REIT Requirements”), and (b) avoid any federal income or
excise tax liability; provided, however, that the General Partner shall not be
bound to comply with this covenant to the extent such distributions would (i)
violate applicable Delaware law, or (ii) contravene the terms of any notes,
mortgages or other types of debt obligations to which the Partnership may be
subject in conjunction with borrowed funds.
Section 5.3    Withholding.
With respect to any withholding tax or other similar tax liability or obligation
to which the Partnership may be subject as a result of any act or status of any
Partner or the Special Limited Partner or to which the Partnership becomes
subject with respect to any Partnership Unit or the Special Limited Partner
Interest, the Partnership shall have the right to withhold amounts distributable
pursuant to this Article V to such Partner or the Special Limited Partner or
with respect to such Partnership Units or the Special Limited Partner Interest,
to the extent of the amount of such withholding tax or other similar tax
liability or obligation pursuant to the provisions contained in Section 10.5,
and the amount of any withholding shall reduce the right of such Partner or the
Special Limited Partner to future distribution to the extent provided in Section
10.5.
Section 5.4    Additional Partnership Interests.
If the Partnership issues Partnership Interests in accordance with Section 4.4,
the distribution priorities set forth in Section 5.1 shall be amended, as
necessary, to reflect the distribution priority of such Partnership Interests
and corresponding amendments shall be made to the provisions of Exhibit B.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Section 5.5    Distributions in Kind.
Except as expressly provided herein, no right is given to any Partner to demand
and receive property other than cash.  The General Partner may determine, in its
sole and absolute discretion, to make a distribution in-kind to the Partners of
Partnership assets, and such assets shall be distributed in such a fashion as to
ensure that the fair market value is distributed and allocated in accordance
with Articles 5, 6 and 10.
Section 5.6    Distributions upon Liquidation.
Notwithstanding Section 5.1, proceeds from a Liquidating Event shall be
distributed to the Partners in accordance with Section 13.2.
Section 5.7    Distribution Limitation.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Article 5, the General Partner shall
have the power, in its reasonable discretion, to adjust the distributions to the
Special Limited Partner to the extent necessary to avoid violations of the
“2%/25% Guidelines” as described in the Advisory Agreement.

ARTICLE 6

ALLOCATIONS


Section 6.1    Allocations.
Current Profit, Residual Profit, Residual Loss and other Partnership items shall
be allocated pursuant to the provisions of Exhibit B.

ARTICLE 7


MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS OF BUSINESS


Section 7.1    Management.
A.    Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all management
powers over the business and affairs of the Partnership are and shall be
exclusively vested in the General Partner, and no Limited Partner shall have any
right to participate in or exercise control or management power over the
business and affairs of the Partnership.  The General Partner may not be removed

General Partner.  In addition to the powers now or hereafter granted a general

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




as provided in Section 7.3 or 11.2), the Act or any applicable law, rule or
regulation to the fullest extent permitted under the Act or other applicable
law, rule or regulation.  The execution, delivery or performance by the General

Agreement shall not constitute a breach by the General Partner of any duty that
the General Partner may owe the Partnership or the Limited Partners or any other
Persons under this Agreement or of any duty stated or implied by law or equity.

obligation on behalf of the Partnership.

the General Partner shall not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or
mail a copy of the Certificate or any amendment thereto to any Limited Partner. 
The General Partner shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such
other certificates or documents as may be reasonable and necessary or
appropriate for the formation, continuation, qualification and operation of a

Columbia or other jurisdiction, in which the Partnership may elect to do
business or own property.

A.    The General Partner may not take any action in contravention of an express
prohibition or limitation of this Agreement without the written Consent of the
Limited Partners and the Special Limited Partner, and may not (i) perform any
act that would subject a Limited Partner to liability as a general partner in
any jurisdiction or any other liability except as provided herein or under the
Act; or (ii) enter into any contract, mortgage, loan or other agreement that
prohibits or restricts, or has the effect of prohibiting or restricting, the
ability of a Limited Partner to exercise its rights to a Redemption in full,
except in each case with the written consent of such Limited Partner.
B.    The General Partner shall not, without the prior Consent of the Partners
(in addition to any Consent of the Limited Partners required by any other
provision hereof), or except as provided in Section 7.3D, amend, modify or
terminate this Agreement.
C.    The General Partner may not cause the Partnership to take any action which
the General Partner would be prohibited from taking directly under the General
Partner’s bylaws as in effect from time to time.
D.    Notwithstanding Section 7.3B, the General Partner shall have the exclusive
power to amend this Agreement as may be required to facilitate or implement any
of the following purposes:
(1)    to add to the obligations of the General Partner or surrender any right
or power granted to the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner
for the benefit of the Limited Partners;
(2)    to reflect the issuance of additional Partnership Interests pursuant to
Sections 4.4B and 5.4 or the admission, substitution, termination, or withdrawal
of Partners in accordance with this Agreement (which may be effected through the
replacement of Exhibit A with an amended Exhibit A);
(3)    to set forth or amend the designations, rights, powers, duties and
preferences of the holders of any additional Partnership Interests issued
pursuant to Article 4;
(4)    to reflect a change that is of an inconsequential nature and does not

inconsistent with law or with other provisions, or make other changes with
respect to matters arising under this Agreement that will not be inconsistent
with law or with the provisions of this Agreement;


{10654250;3}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




(5)    to satisfy any requirements, conditions, or guidelines contained in any
order, directive, opinion, ruling or regulation of a federal or state agency or
contained in federal or state law; and
(6)    to reflect such changes as are reasonably necessary for the REIT Shares

necessitated due to a change in applicable law (or an authoritative
interpretation thereof) or a ruling of the IRS.
The General Partner will provide notice to the Limited Partners when any action
under this Section 7.3D is taken.
E.    Notwithstanding Sections 7.3B and 7.3D, this Agreement shall not be
amended with respect to any Partner adversely affected, and no action may be
taken by the General Partner, without the Consent of such Partner adversely
affected if such amendment or action would (i) convert a Limited Partner’s
interest in the Partnership into a general partner’s interest (except as the
result of the General Partner acquiring such interest), (ii) modify the limited
liability of a Limited Partner, (iii) alter rights of the Partner to receive

specified in Article 6 (except as permitted pursuant to Sections 4.4, 5.4 and
7.3D(2)), (iv) materially alter or modify the rights to a Redemption or the REIT
Shares Amount as set forth in Section 8.6, and related definitions hereof, or

on the General Partner’s authority set forth elsewhere in this Section 7.3 or in
Section 11.2A without the Consent specified in such section.  This Section 7.3E
does not require unanimous consent of all Partners adversely affected unless the
amendment is to be effective against all partners adversely affected.
Section 7.4    Reimbursement of the General Partner.
A.    Except as provided in this Section 7.4 and elsewhere in this Agreement
(including the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 regarding distributions, payments
and allocations to which it may be entitled), the General Partner shall not be
compensated for its services as general partner of the Partnership.
B.    The Partnership shall be responsible for and shall pay all expenses
relating to the Partnership’s and the General Partner’s organization, the
ownership of its assets and its operations.  The General Partner is hereby
authorized to pay compensation for accounting, administrative, legal, technical,
management and other services rendered to the Partnership.  Except to the extent
provided in this Agreement, the General Partner and its Affiliates shall be
reimbursed on a monthly basis, or such other basis as the General Partner may
determine in its sole and absolute discretion, for all expenses that the General
Partner and its Affiliates incur relating to the ownership and operation of, or
for the benefit of, the Partnership (including, without limitation,
administrative expenses); provided, that the amount of any such reimbursement
shall be reduced by any interest earned by the General Partner with respect to
bank accounts or other instruments or accounts held by it on behalf of the
Partnership.  The Partners acknowledge that all such expenses of the General
Partner are deemed to be for the benefit of the Partnership.  Such reimbursement
shall be in addition to any reimbursement made as a result of indemnification
pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof.  In the event that certain expenses are incurred
for the benefit of the Partnership and other entities (including


{10654250;3}
33
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




the General Partner), such expenses will be allocated to the Partnership and
such other entities in such a manner as the General Partner in its sole and
absolute discretion deems fair and reasonable.  All payments and reimbursements
hereunder shall be characterized for federal income tax purposes as expenses of
the Partnership incurred on its behalf, and not as expenses of the General
Partner.
C.    In addition to the expenses that are directly attributable to the
Partnership, the Partnership shall pay the REIT Expenses that are allocable to
the Partnership. The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, shall
determine what portion of the REIT Expenses are allocable to the Partnership. If
any REIT Expenses determined by the General Partner to be allocable to the
Partnership are paid by the General Partner, the General Partner shall be
reimbursed by the Partnership therefor.
D.    If and to the extent any reimbursements to the General Partner pursuant to
this Section 7.4 constitute gross income of the General Partner (as opposed to
the repayment of advances made by the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership), such amounts shall constitute guaranteed payments within the
meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code, shall be treated consistently therewith
by the Partnership and all Partners, and shall not be treated as distributions
for purposes of computing the Partners’ Capital Accounts.
Section 7.5    Outside Activities of the General Partner.
The Partners and any officer, director, employee, agent, trustee, Affiliate,
Subsidiary, or stockholder of any Partner shall be entitled to and may have
business interests and engage in business activities in addition to those
relating to the Partnership, including business interests and activities
substantially similar or identical to those of the Partnership. Neither the
Partnership nor any of the Partners nor any other Person shall have any rights
by virtue of this Agreement or the partnership relationship established hereby
in any such business ventures, interests or activities, and the Partners shall
have no obligation pursuant to this Agreement to offer any interest in any such
business ventures, interests and activities to the Partnership or any Partner,
even if such opportunity is of a character which, if presented to the
Partnership or any Partner, could be taken by such Person.
Section 7.6    Contracts with Affiliates.
A.    The Partnership may lend or contribute to Persons in which it has an
equity investment, and such Persons may borrow funds from the Partnership, on
terms and conditions established in the sole and absolute discretion of the
General Partner.  The foregoing authority shall not create any right or benefit
in favor of any Person.
B.    Except as provided in Section 7.5, the Partnership may transfer assets to
joint ventures, other partnerships, corporations or other business entities in
which it is or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and subject to such
conditions consistent with this Agreement and applicable law as the General
Partner in its sole discretion deems advisable.
C.    The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the
approval of the Limited Partners, may propose and adopt on behalf of the
Partnership employee benefit plans funded by the


{10654250;3}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Partnership for the benefit of employees of the General Partner, the
Partnership, Subsidiaries of the Partnership or any Affiliate of any of them in
respect of services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the
Partnership, the General Partner, or any of the Partnership’s Subsidiaries.
D.    Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, neither the General
Partner nor any of its Affiliates shall sell, transfer or convey any property
to, or purchase any property from, the Partnership, directly or indirectly,
except pursuant to transactions that are determined by the General Partner in
good faith to be fair and reasonable.
E.    The General Partner is expressly authorized to enter into, in the name and
on behalf of the Partnership, a right of first opportunity arrangement and other
conflict avoidance agreements with various Affiliates of the Partnership and the
General Partner, on such terms as the General Partner, in its sole and absolute
discretion, believes are advisable.
Section 7.7    Indemnification.
A.    To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Partnership shall indemnify an
Indemnitee from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities,
joint or several, expenses (including legal fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, settlements, and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands,
actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
that relate to the operations of the Partnership as set forth in this Agreement
in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a
party or otherwise, unless (1) the Charter prohibits the corporation from
indemnifying the Indemnitee for a tax matter, in which case the Partnership
shall likewise be prohibited from indemnifying the Indemnitee for the matter, or
(2) it is established that:  (i) the act or omission of the Indemnitee was
material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and either was committed in
bad faith, fraud or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty; (ii) the
Indemnitee actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or
services; or (iii) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the Indemnitee had
reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful.  Without
limitation, the foregoing indemnity shall extend to any liability of any
Indemnitee, pursuant to a loan guaranty or otherwise, for any indebtedness of
the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership (including, without
limitation, any indebtedness which the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the
Partnership has assumed or taken subject to), and the General Partner is hereby
authorized and empowered, on behalf of the Partnership, to enter into one or
more indemnity agreements consistent with the provisions of this Section 7.7 in
favor of any Indemnitee having or potentially having liability for any such
indebtedness.  The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order, settlement,
conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, or any entry of
an order of probation prior to judgment, does not create a presumption that the
Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of conduct set forth in this
Section 7.7A.  Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be made
only out of the assets of the Partnership, and any insurance proceeds from the
liability policy covering the General Partner and any Indemnitee, and neither
the General Partner nor any Limited Partner shall have any obligation to
contribute to the capital of the Partnership or otherwise provide funds to
enable the Partnership to fund its obligations under this Section 7.7, except to
the extent otherwise expressly agreed to by such Partner and the Partnership.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




B.    Reasonable expenses incurred by an Indemnitee who is a party to a
proceeding may be paid or reimbursed by the Partnership in advance of the final
disposition of the proceeding upon receipt by the Partnership of (i) a written
affirmation by the Indemnitee of the Indemnitee’ s good faith belief that the
standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Partnership as
authorized in this Section 7.7 has been met, and (ii) a written undertaking by
or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that the standard of conduct has not been met.
C.    The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 shall be in addition to
any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person may be entitled
under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as a matter of law or
otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in
such capacity unless otherwise provided in a written agreement pursuant to which
such Indemnitee is indemnified.
D.    The Partnership may, but shall not be obligated to, purchase and maintain
insurance, on behalf of the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the General
Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or
expenses that may be incurred by such Person in connection with the
Partnership’s activities, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the
power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of
this Agreement.
E.    For purposes of this Section 7.7, the Partnership shall be deemed to have
requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants or
beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect
to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute fines
within the meaning of Section 7.7; and actions taken or omitted by the
Indemnitee with respect to an employee benefit plan in the performance of its
duties for a purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the interest of the
participants and beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose
which is not opposed to the best interests of the Partnership.
F.    In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.
G.    An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this Section 7.7 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction
with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was
otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.
H.    The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees,
their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to
create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.  Any amendment,
modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 or any provision hereof shall be
prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on the
Partnership’s liability to any Indemnitee under this Section 7.7 as in effect
immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to
claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior
to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may
arise or be asserted.

I.    If and to the extent any reimbursements to the General Partner pursuant to
this Section 7.7 constitute gross income of the General Partner (as opposed to
the repayment of advances made by the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership) such amounts shall constitute guaranteed payments within the
meaning of Section 707(c) of the Code, shall be treated consistently therewith
by the Partnership and all Partners, and shall not be treated as distributions
for purposes of computing the Partners’ Capital Accounts.
J.    Any indemnification hereunder is subject to, and limited by, the
provisions of Section 17-108 of the Act and the Charter.
K.    In the event the Partnership is made a party to any litigation or
otherwise incurs any loss or expense as a result of or in connection with any
Partner’s personal obligations or liabilities unrelated to Partnership business,
such Partner shall indemnify and reimburse the Partnership for all such loss and
expense incurred, including legal fees, and the Partnership interest of such
Partner may be charged therefor.  The liability of a Partner under this
Section 7.7K shall not be limited to such Partner’s Partnership Interest, but
shall be enforceable against such Partner personally.
Section 7.8    Liability of the General Partner.
A.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, none
of the General Partner nor any of its officers, directors, agents or employees
shall be liable or accountable in damages or otherwise to the Partnership, any
Partners or any Assignees, or their successors or assigns, for losses sustained,
liabilities incurred or benefits not derived as a result of errors in judgment
or mistakes of fact or law or any act or omission if the General Partner acted
in good faith.
B.    The Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that the General Partner is
acting for the benefit of the Partnership, the Limited Partners and the General
Partner’s stockholders collectively.  The General Partner is under no obligation
to give priority to the separate interests of the Limited Partners or the
General Partner’s stockholders (including, without limitation, the tax
consequences to Limited Partners or Assignees or to stockholders) in deciding
whether to cause the Partnership to take (or decline to take) any actions.  If
there is a conflict between the interests of the stockholders of the General
Partner on one hand and the Limited Partners on the other, the General Partner
shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the conflict in a manner not adverse to
either the stockholders of the General Partner or the Limited Partners;
provided, however , that for so long as the General Partner, owns a controlling
interest in the Partnership, any such conflict that cannot be resolved in a
manner not adverse to either the stockholders of the General Partner or the
Limited Partners shall be resolved in favor of the stockholders.  The General
Partner shall not be liable under this Agreement to the Partnership or to any
Partner for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred, or
benefits not derived by Limited Partners in connection with such decisions;
provided, that the General Partner has acted in good faith.
C.    Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in
Section 7.1A, the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to it
by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed


{10654250;3}
37

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its agents.  The General
Partner shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of
any such agent appointed by it in good faith.
D.    Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any provision
hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations
on the liability of the General Partner and any of its officers, directors,
agents and employee’s liability to the Partnership and the Limited Partners
under this Section 7.8 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment,
modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to
matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or
repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.
Section 7.9    Other Matters Concerning the General Partner.
(1)    The General Partner may rely and shall be protected in acting or
refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument,
opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other
paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties.
(2)    The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants,
appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants and
advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in reliance
upon the opinion of such Persons as to matters which such General Partner
reasonably believes to be within such Person’s professional or expert competence
shall be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good faith and in
accordance with such opinion.
(3)    The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers
or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers and
a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact.  Each such attorney shall, to
the extent provided by the General Partner in the power of attorney, have full
power and authority to do and perform all and every act and duty which is
permitted or required to be done by the General Partner hereunder.
(4)    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any
non-mandatory provision of the Act, any action of the General Partner on behalf
of the Partnership or any decision of the General Partner to refrain from acting
on behalf of the Partnership, undertaken in the good faith belief that such
action or omission is necessary or advisable in order to protect the ability of
the REIT Shares Issuer, for so long as the REIT Shares Issuer has determined to
qualify as a REIT, to (i) continue to qualify as a REIT or (ii) avoid the
General Partner or the REIT Shares Issuer incurring any taxes under Section 857
or Section 4981 of the Code, is expressly authorized under this Agreement and is
deemed approved by all of the Limited Partners.

Section 7.10    Title to Partnership Assets.
Title to Partnership assets, whether real, personal or mixed and whether
tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to be owned by the Partnership as an
entity, and no Partners, individually or collectively, shall have any ownership
interest in such Partnership assets or any portion thereof.  Title to any or all
of the Partnership assets may be held in the name of the Partnership, the
General Partner or one or more subsidiaries or nominees, as the General Partner
may determine, including Affiliates of the General Partner.  The General Partner
hereby declares and warrants that any Partnership assets for which legal title
is held in the name of the General Partner or any nominee or Affiliate of the
General Partner shall be held by the General Partner for the use and benefit of
the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided,
however, that the General Partner shall use its best efforts to cause beneficial
and record title to such assets to be vested in the Partnership, a subsidiary or
a nominee thereof, as soon as reasonably practicable.  All Partnership assets
shall be recorded as the property of the Partnership in its books and records,
irrespective of the name in which legal title to such Partnership assets is
held.
Section 7.11    Reliance by Third Parties.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing
with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the General Partner has
full power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any
and all assets of the Partnership and to enter into any contracts on behalf of
the Partnership, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with the General
Partner as if it were the Partnership’s sole party in interest, both legally and
beneficially.  Each Limited Partner hereby waives any and all defenses or other
remedies which may be available against such Person to contest, negate or
disaffirm any action of the General Partner in connection with any such
dealing.  In no event shall any Person dealing with the General Partner or its
representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of this Agreement have
been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or expedience of any act or
action of the General Partner or its representatives.  Each and every
certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of the Partnership
by the General Partner or its representatives shall be conclusive evidence in
favor of any and every Person relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (i) at
the time of the execution and delivery of such certificate, document or
instrument, this Agreement was in full force and effect, (ii) the Person
executing and delivering such certificate, document or instrument was duly
authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of the Partnership and
(iii) such certificate, document or instrument was duly executed and delivered
in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and is binding
upon the Partnership.

Units shall have the right (subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein
and in any other such agreement, as applicable) to require the Partnership to
redeem, or the REIT Shares Issuer to acquire, as applicable, all of the Class
A-2 OP Units held by such Limited Partner (such Class A-2 OP Units being
hereafter referred to as “Tendered Class A-2 OP Units” and collectively with the
Tendered Class ART Units, the “Tendered Units”) in an amount per Class A-2 OP
Unit equal to and in the form of, at the election of the Tendering Partner, (x)
the Cash Amount or (y) the REIT Shares Amount (a “Class A-2 OP Units Redemption”
and together with a Class ART OP Units Redemption, a “Redemption”).
(iii)    Any Redemption shall be exercised pursuant to a Notice of Redemption
delivered to the General Partner by the Limited Partner who is exercising the
right (the “Tendering Partner”).
B.    Notwithstanding Section 8.6A above, if a Limited Partner has delivered to
the General Partner a Notice of Redemption then the General Partner may, in its
sole and absolute discretion (subject to the limitations on ownership and
transfer of REIT Shares set forth in the Charter), elect to acquire some or all
of the Tendered Units (such Tendered Units for which the General Partner has
exercised its right, the “REIT Share Tendered Units”) from the Tendering Partner
in exchange for the REIT Shares Amount (as of the Specified Redemption Date)
and, if the General Partner so elects, the Tendering Partner shall sell the REIT
Share Tendered Units to the General Partner in exchange for the REIT Shares
Amount.  The General Partner shall promptly give such Tendering Partner written
notice of its election, and the Tendering Partner may elect to withdraw its
redemption request at any time prior to the acceptance of the cash or REIT
Shares Amount by such Tendering Partner; provided, however, that any Tendered
Units for which the General Partner has not issued or caused to be issued REIT
Shares shall be redeemed by the Partnership in accordance with Section 8.6A.
C.    The Cash Amount, if applicable, shall be payable to the Tendering Partner
within 30 days of the Specified Redemption Date in accordance with the
instructions set forth in the Notice of Redemption. The REIT Shares Amount, if
applicable, shall be delivered within 10 days of the Specified Redemption Date
as duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable REIT Shares
and, if applicable, free of any pledge, lien, encumbrance or restriction, other
than those provided in the Charter, the Bylaws, the Securities Act, relevant
state securities or blue sky laws and any applicable registration rights
agreement with respect

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




to such REIT Shares entered into by the Tendering Partner.  Notwithstanding any
delay in such delivery (but subject to Section 8.6E), the Tendering Partner
shall be deemed the owner of such REIT Shares for all purposes, including
without limitation, rights to vote or consent, and receive dividends, as of the
Specified Redemption Date.
D.    Each Limited Partner covenants and agrees with the General Partner that
all Tendered Units shall be delivered to the General Partner free and clear of
all liens, claims and encumbrances whatsoever and should any such liens, claims
and/or encumbrances exist or arise with respect to such Tendered Units, the
General Partner shall be under no obligation to acquire the same.  Each Limited
Partner further agrees that, in the event any state or local property transfer
tax is payable as a result of the transfer of its Tendered Units to the General
Partner (or its designee), such Partner shall assume and pay such transfer tax.
E.    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.6A, 8.6B, 8.6C or any other
provision of this Agreement, a Limited Partner (i) shall not be entitled to
effect a Redemption for cash or an exchange for REIT Shares to the extent the
ownership or right to acquire REIT Shares pursuant to such exchange by such
Partner on the Specified Redemption Date could cause such Partner or any other
Person, or, in the opinion of counsel selected by the General Partner, may cause
such Partner or any other Person, to violate the restrictions on ownership and
transfer of REIT Shares set forth in the Charter and (ii) shall have no rights
under this Agreement to acquire REIT Shares which would otherwise be prohibited
under the Charter.  To the extent any attempted Redemption or exchange for REIT
Shares would be in violation of this Section 8.6E, it shall be null and void ab
initio and such Partner shall not acquire any rights or economic interest in the
cash otherwise payable upon such Redemption or the REIT Shares otherwise
issuable upon such exchange.
F.    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (but subject to
Section 8.6E), with respect to any Redemption or exchange for REIT Shares
pursuant to this Section 8.6:
(1)    All OP Units acquired by the General Partner pursuant thereto shall
automatically, and without further action required, be converted into and deemed
to be General Partner Interests comprised of the same number and class of OP
Units.
(2)    A Limited Partner may not effect a Redemption for less than one thousand
(1,000) OP Units or, if such Partner holds less than one thousand (1,000) OP
Units, such Partner may effect a Redemption only with respect to all OP Units
held by such Partner.
(3)    A Tendering Partner may not effect more than four (4) Redemptions in a
single calendar year.
(4)    Without the consent of the General Partner, a Limited Partner may not
effect a Redemption during the period after the Partnership Record Date with
respect to a distribution and before the record date established by the General
Partner for a distribution to its stockholders of some or all of its portion of
such distribution.


{10654250;3}
43
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




(5)    The consummation of any Redemption or exchange for REIT Shares shall be
subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period, if
any, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.
(6)    Each Tendering Partner shall continue to own all OP Units subject to any
Redemption or exchange for REIT Shares, and be treated as a Partner with respect
to such OP Units for all purposes of this Agreement, until such OP Units are
transferred to the General Partner and paid for or exchanged on the Specified
Redemption Date.  Until a Specified Redemption Date, the Tendering Partner shall
have no rights as a stockholder of the General Partner with respect to such
Tendering Partner’s OP Units.
(7)    The General Partner may place restrictions on the ability of any Limited
Partner to exercise its Redemption rights hereunder to the extent the General
Partner determines, in its discretion, such restrictions are advisable to ensure
the Partnership does not constitute a “publicly traded partnership” under
Section 7704 of the Code.
G.    In the event that the Partnership issues additional Partnership Interests
to any Additional Limited Partner pursuant to Section 4.4B, the General Partner
shall make such revisions to this Section 8.6 as it determines are necessary to
reflect the issuance of such additional Partnership Interests.
H.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner
is authorized to take any action that it determines to be necessary or
appropriate to cause the Partnership to comply with any withholding requirements
established under the Code or any other federal, state or local law that apply
upon a Redemption or exchange of Tendered Units.  If a Tendering Partner
believes that it is exempt from withholding upon a Redemption or exchange of
Tendered Units, such Partner must furnish the General Partner a FIRPTA
certificate or other documentation requested by the General Partner in a form
acceptable to the General Partner.  If the Partnership or the General Partner is
required to withhold and pay over to any taxing authority any amount upon a
Redemption or exchange of Tendered Units and the Cash Amount or the REIT Shares
Amount, as the case may be, equals or exceeds the amount of tax required to be
withheld, the amount withheld shall be treated as an amount received by such
Partner in redemption of its Tendered Units.  If the Cash Amount or the REIT
Shares Amount, as the case may be, is less than the amount of tax required to be
withheld, the Tendering Partner shall not receive any Cash Amount or REIT Shares
Amount, and the Tendering Partner shall contribute the excess of the amount of
tax required to be withheld over the Cash Amount or REIT Shares Amount before
such excess taxes are required to be paid to the taxing authority.
I.    The Conversion Factor shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:
(1)    In the event that the REIT Shares Issuer (A) declares or pays a dividend
on its outstanding REIT Shares in REIT Shares or makes a distribution to all
holders of its outstanding REIT Shares in REIT Shares, (B) subdivides its
outstanding REIT Shares, or (C) combines its outstanding REIT Shares into a
smaller number of REIT Shares, the Conversion Factor shall be adjusted by
multiplying the Conversion Factor by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be
the number of REIT Shares issued and outstanding on the record date for such
dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination (assuming for such purposes
that


{10654250;3}
44
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




such dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination has occurred as of such
time), and the denominator of which shall be the actual number of REIT Shares
(determined without the above assumption) issued and outstanding on such date;
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, if the REIT Shares Issuer
declares or pays a dividend on its outstanding REIT Shares in REIT Shares or
makes a distribution to all holders of its outstanding REIT Shares or makes a
distribution to all holders of its outstanding REIT Shares in REIT Shares
(including a dividend in which stockholders may elect to receive all or a
portion of such dividend in cash (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment
program)), no adjustment shall be made if, promptly thereafter, with respect to
any dividend or distribution with respect to REIT Shares, the Partnership pays a
distribution with respect to each Partnership Unit consisting of a number of
Partnership Units (or fraction thereof) equal to the product of (i) the quotient
obtained by dividing (a) the aggregate number of REIT Shares paid by the REIT
Shares Issuer as a dividend to all stockholders, by (b) the aggregate number of
REIT Shares outstanding as of the close of business on the record date for such
dividend, and (ii) the number of REIT Shares for which such Partnership Unit is
then redeemable pursuant to Section 8.6.
(2)    Any adjustment to the Conversion Factor shall become effective
immediately after the effective date of any of the events described in
subsection (1), retroactive to the record date, if any, for such event,
provided, however, that if the Partnership receives a Notice of Redemption after
the record date, but prior to the payment date or effective date, of any
dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination referred to in subsection
(1), the Conversion Factor shall be determined as if the General Partner had
received the Notice of Redemption immediately prior to the record date for such
dividend, distribution, subdivision or combination.
J.    
(i)    At any time after on or after April 21, 2025, the date that is five (5)
years following the date of first issuance of the Class A-2 OP Units, the
Partnership shall have the right, at its option, at any time or from time to
time, upon not less than 30 days’ written notice, to redeem the Class A-2 OP
Units, in whole or in part, in exchange for an amount of cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying the number of Class A-2 OP Units subject to the
Partnership’s notice by the Cash Amount (the “Partnership Redemption Price”).
(ii)    The Partnership may exercise its option pursuant to Section 8.6J(i) by
delivering notice of such exercise to each holder of Class A-2 OP Units in
accordance with Section 15.1, which notice shall state: (i) the date of
redemption, which shall be a Business Day that is no earlier than thirty (30)
days and no later than sixty (60) days from the date such notice is sent;
(ii) the Partnership Redemption Price; (iii) the number of Class A-2 OP Units to
be redeemed and, if fewer than all of the Class A-2 OP Units held by such holder
are to be redeemed, the number or percentage of such Class A-2 OP Units to be
redeemed from such holder; (iv) the place or places where the certificates (if
any) evidencing the Class A-2 OP Units are to be surrendered for payment of the
Partnership Redemption Price and any other documents required in connection with
the redemption; and (v) that the distributions on such Class A-2 OP Units to be
redeemed will cease to accrue on the date of redemption except as otherwise
provided herein.  A failure to give such notice or any defect in the notice or
in its mailing shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any Class


{10654250;3}
45
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




A-2 OP Units except as to the holder to whom notice was defective or not given. 
If fewer than all of the outstanding Class A-2 OP Units are to be redeemed, the
Class A-2 OP Units to be redeemed shall be selected by lot or pro rata (as
nearly as practicable without creating fractional units).  From and after the
date of redemption, any Class A-2 OP Units redeemed pursuant to this Section
8.6J shall no longer be outstanding and all rights hereunder with respect to
such Class A-2 OP Units shall cease.

ARTICLE 9

BOOKS, RECORDS, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTS


Section 9.1    Records and Accounting.
The General Partner shall keep, or cause to be kept, at the principal office of
the Partnership appropriate books and records with respect to the Partnership’s
business, including without limitation, all books and records necessary to
provide to the Special Limited Partner and the Limited Partners any information,
lists and copies of documents required to be provided pursuant to Section 9.3. 
Any records maintained by or on behalf of the Partnership in the regular course
of its business may be kept on, or be in the form of any information storage
device, provided, that the records so maintained are convertible into clearly
legible written form within a reasonable period of time.  The books of the
Partnership shall be maintained, for financial and tax reporting purposes, on an
accrual basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Section 9.2    Fiscal Year.
The fiscal year of the Partnership shall be the calendar year.
Section 9.3    Reports.
A.    As soon as practicable, but in no event later than one hundred five
(105) days after the close of each Partnership Year, or such earlier date as
they are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the General Partner
shall cause to be delivered to the Special Limited Partner and each Limited
Partner as of the close of the Partnership Year, an annual report containing
financial statements of the Partnership, or of the General Partner if such
statements are prepared solely on a consolidated basis with the General Partner,
for such Partnership Year, presented in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, such statements to be audited by a nationally recognized
firm of independent public accountants selected by the General Partner.
B.    As soon as practicable, but in no event later than forty five (45) days
after the close of each calendar quarter (except the last calendar quarter of
each year), or such earlier date as they are filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the General Partner shall cause to be delivered to the
Special Limited Partner and each Limited Partner as of the last day of the
calendar quarter, a report containing unaudited financial statements of the
Partnership, or of the General Partner, if such statements are prepared solely
on


{10654250;3}
46
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




a consolidated basis with the applicable law or regulation, or as the General
Partner determines to be appropriate.
Section 9.4    Nondisclosure of Certain Information.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 9.1 and 9.3, the General Partner may
keep confidential from the Special Limited Partner and the Limited Partners any
information that the General Partner believes to be in the nature of trade
secrets or other information the disclosure of which the General Partner in good
faith believes is not in the best interest of the Partnership or which the
Partnership is required by law or by agreements with unaffiliated third parties
to keep confidential.

ARTICLE 10

TAX MATTERS


Section 10.1    Preparation of Tax Returns.
The General Partner shall arrange for the preparation and timely filing of all
returns of Partnership income, gains, deductions, losses and other items
required of the Partnership for federal and applicable state income tax purposes
and shall use all reasonable efforts to furnish, within one hundred and eighty
(180) days of the close of each taxable year, the tax information reasonably
required by the Special Limited Partner and the Limited Partners for federal and
applicable state income tax reporting purposes.  The Special Limited Partner and
each Limited Partner shall promptly provide the General Partner with any
information reasonably requested by the General Partner relating to any
Contributed Property contributed (directly or indirectly) by such Partner to the
Partnership.
Section 10.2    Tax Elections.
A.    Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner shall, in its
sole and absolute discretion, determine whether to make any available election
pursuant to the Code, including the election under Section 754 of the Code.  The
General Partner shall have the right to seek to revoke any such election
(including without limitation, any election under Section 754 of the Code) upon
the General Partner’s determination in its sole and absolute discretion that
such revocation is the best interests of the Partners.
B.    The Partners, intending to be legally bound, hereby authorize the
Partnership to make an election (the “Safe Harbor Election”) to have the
“liquidation value” safe harbor provided in Proposed Treasury Regulation Section
1.83-3(1) and the Proposed Revenue Procedure set forth in Internal Revenue
Service Notice 2005-43, as such safe harbor may be modified when such proposed
guidance is issued in final form or as amended by subsequently issued guidance
(the “Safe Harbor”), apply to any interest in the Partnership transferred to a
service provider while the Safe Harbor Election remains effective, to the extent
such interest meets the Safe Harbor requirements (collectively, such interests
are referred to as “Safe Harbor Interests”). The tax matters partner is
authorized and directed to execute and file the Safe Harbor Election on behalf
of the Partnership and the Partners. The Partnership and the Partners (including
any person to


{10654250;3}
47
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




whom an interest in the Partnership is transferred in connection with the
performance of services) hereby agree to comply with all requirements of the
Safe Harbor (including forfeiture allocations) with respect to all Safe Harbor
Interests and to prepare and file all U.S. federal income tax returns reporting
the tax consequences of the issuance and vesting of Safe Harbor Interests
consistent with such final Safe Harbor guidance. The General Partner is
authorized to take such actions as are necessary to achieve, under the Safe
Harbor, the effect that the election and compliance with all requirements of the
Safe Harbor referred to above would be intended to achieve under Proposed
Treasury Regulation Section 1.83-3, including amending this Agreement.
Section 10.3    Tax Matters.
A.    Tax Matters Partner. For tax returns filed with respect to fiscal years
beginning before December 31, 2017, this Section 10.3A shall apply, and
references to Code sections in this Section 10.3A refer to the Code sections as
in effect prior to such sections’ amendment by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015
(P.L. 114-74) (the “2015 Budget Act”).
(1)    The General Partner shall be the “tax matters partner” of the Partnership
for federal income tax purposes.  Pursuant to Section 6230(e) of the Code, upon
receipt of notice from the IRS of the beginning of an administrative proceeding
with respect to the Partnership, the tax matters partner shall furnish the IRS
with the name, address and profit interest of the Special Limited Partner and
each of the Limited Partners and Assignees; provided, however, that such
information is provided to the Partnership by the Partners and Assignees.
(2)    The tax matters partner is authorized, but not required:
(a)    to enter into any settlement with the IRS with respect to any
administrative or judicial proceedings for the adjustment of Partnership items
required to be taken into account by a Partner for income tax purposes (such
administrative proceedings being referred to as a “tax audit” and such judicial
proceedings being referred to as “judicial review”), and in the settlement
agreement the tax matters partner may expressly state that such agreement shall
bind all Partners, except that such settlement agreement shall not bind any
Partner (i) who (within the time prescribed pursuant to the Code and
Regulations) files a statement with the IRS providing that the tax matters
partner shall not have the authority to enter into a settlement agreement on
behalf of such Partner or (ii) who is a “notice partner” (as defined in
Section 6231 of the Code) or a member of a “notice group” (as defined in
Section 6223(b)(2) of the Code);
(b)    in the event that a notice of a final administrative adjustment at the
Partnership level of any item required to be taken into account by a Partner for
tax purposes (a “final adjustment”) is mailed to the tax matters partner, to
seek judicial review of such final adjustment, including the filing of a
petition for readjustment with the Tax Court or the United States Claims Court,
or the filing of a complaint for refund with the District Court


{10654250;3}
48
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




of the United States for the district in which the Partnership’s principal place
of business is located;
(c)    to intervene in any action brought by any other Partner for judicial
review of a final adjustment;
(d)    to file a request for an administrative adjustment with the IRS at any
time and, if any part of such request is not allowed by the IRS, to file an
appropriate pleading (petition or complaint) for judicial review with respect to
such request;
(e)    to enter into an agreement with the IRS to extend the period for
assessing any tax which is attributable to any item required to be taken into
account by a Partner for tax purposes, or an item affected by such item; and
(f)    to take any other action on behalf of the Partners of the Partnership in
connection with any tax audit or judicial review proceeding to the extent
permitted by applicable law or regulations.
The taking of any action and the incurring of any expense by the tax matters
partner in connection with any such proceeding, except to the extent required by
law, is a matter in the sole and absolute discretion of the tax matters partner
and the provisions relating to indemnification of the General Partner set forth
in Section 7.7 shall be fully applicable to the tax matters partner in its
capacity as such.
(3)    The tax matters partner shall receive no compensation for its services. 
All third party costs and expenses incurred by the tax matters partner in
performing its duties as such (including legal and accounting fees) shall be
borne by the Partnership.  Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict the
Partnership from engaging an accounting firm to assist the tax matters partner
in discharging its duties hereunder, so long as the compensation paid by the
Partnership for such services is reasonable.
B.    Partnership Representative. For tax returns filed with respect to fiscal
years beginning after December 31, 2017, this Section 10.3B shall apply, and
references to Code sections in this Section 10.3B refer to the Code sections as
in effect after taking into account the amendments provided by the 2015 Budget
Act. The General Partner shall take such reasonable actions as it believes will
enhance the avoidance of the application to the Partnership of the provisions of
Sections 6221 through 6241 of the Code. If, however, such provisions do apply to
the Partnership, the General Partner shall also act as the “partnership
representative” for purposes of said Sections 6221 through 6241 of the Code.
Each Partner hereby consents to the General Partner serving as the partnership
representative and agrees upon request of the General Partner to execute,
certify, acknowledge, deliver, swear to, file and record at the appropriate
public offices such further documents as may be necessary or appropriate to
evidence such consent. The partnership representative will be authorized to
represent the Partnership (at the Partnership’s expense) in connection with all
examinations of the Partnership’s affairs by tax authorities, including
resulting administrative and


{10654250;3}
49
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




judicial proceedings, and to (i) sign consents, enter into settlement and other
agreements with such authorities with respect to any such examinations or
proceedings and (ii) expend the Partnership’s funds for professional services
incurred in connection therewith. In such event, the partnership representative
shall duly and timely elect under Section 6226 of the Code to require each
Person who was a Partner during the taxable year of Partnership that was audited
to personally bear any tax, interest and penalty resulting from adjustments
based on such audit and shall notify each such Person (and the Internal Revenue
Service) of their share of such audit adjustments and, if for any reason, the
Partnership is liable for a tax, interest, addition to tax or penalty as a
result of such an audit, each Person who was a Partner during the taxable year
of the Partnership that was audited, even if such Person is no longer a Partner
(unless a Substituted Limited Partner has agreed to bear such liability in an
appropriate document evidencing a transfer), shall pay to the Partnership an
amount equal to such Person’s proportionate share of such liability, as
determined by the General Partner, based on the amount each such Person should
have borne (computed at the tax rate used to compute the Partnership’s
liability) had the Partnership’s tax return for such taxable year reflected the
audit adjustment, and the expense for the Partnership’s payment of such tax,
interest, addition to tax and penalty shall be specially allocated to such
Persons (or their successors) in such proportions.
Section 10.4    Organizational Expenses.
The Partnership shall elect to deduct expenses, if any, incurred by it in
organizing the Partnership as provided in Section 709 of the Code.
Section 10.5    Withholding.
The Special Limited Partner and each Limited Partner hereby authorize the
Partnership to withhold from or pay on behalf of or with respect to such Partner
any amount of federal, state, local, or foreign taxes that the General Partner
determines that the Partnership is required to withhold or pay with respect to
any amount distributable or allocable to such Partner pursuant to this
Agreement, including, without limitation, any taxes required to be withheld or
paid by the Partnership pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 or 1446 of the
Code.  Any amount paid on behalf of or with respect to the Special Limited
Partner or a Limited Partner shall constitute a receivable of the Partnership
from such Partner, which receivable shall be paid by such Partner within fifteen
(15) days after notice from the General Partner that such payment must be made
unless (i) the Partnership withholds such payment from a distribution which
would otherwise be made to the Partner or (ii) the General Partner determines,
in its sole and absolute discretion, that such payment may be satisfied out of
the available funds of the Partnership which would, but for such payment, be
distributed to the Partner.  Any amounts withheld pursuant to the foregoing
clauses (i) or (ii) shall be treated as having been distributed to such
Partner.  The Special Limited Partner and each Limited Partner hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably grants to the Partnership a security interest in
such Partner’s Partnership Interest to secure such Partner’s obligation to pay
to the Partnership any amounts required to be paid pursuant to this
Section 10.5.  Any amounts payable by the Special Limited Partner or a Limited
Partner hereunder shall bear interest at the base rate on corporate loans at
large United States money center commercial banks, as published from time to
time in the Wall Street Journal, plus two percentage points (but not higher than
the maximum lawful rate) from the date such amount is due (i.e., fifteen
(15) days after demand) until such


{10654250;3}
50
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




amount is paid in full.  The Special Limited Partner and each Limited Partner
shall take such actions as the Partnership or the General Partner shall request
in order to perfect or enforce the security interest created hereunder. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 10.5 and Section 5.3 shall not be applied in a
duplicative fashion.

ARTICLE 11

TRANSFERS AND WITHDRAWALS


Section 11.1    Transfer.
A.    The term “transfer”, when used in this Article 11 with respect to a
Partnership Interest, shall be deemed to refer to a transaction by which a
Partner purports to assign its Partnership Interest to another Person and
includes a sale, assignment, gift (outright or in trust), pledge, encumbrance,
hypothecation, mortgage, exchange or any other disposition by law or otherwise. 
The term “transfer” when used in this Article 11 does not include any Redemption
or exchange for REIT Shares pursuant to Section 8.6, except as otherwise
provided herein.  No part of the interest of a Limited Partner shall be subject
to the claims of any creditor, any spouse for alimony or support, or to legal
process, and may not be voluntarily or involuntarily alienated or encumbered
except as may be specifically provided for in this Agreement or consented to by
the General Partner and the Special Limited Partner.
B.    No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Article 11.  Any
transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in accordance
with this Article 11 shall be null and void ab initio unless otherwise consented
to by the General Partner and the Special Limited Partner in their sole and
absolute discretion.
Section 11.2    Transfer of the Partnership Interest of the General Partner and
the Special Limited Partner.
A.    The General Partner may not Transfer any of its General Partner Interest
or withdraw as General Partner, or Transfer any of its Limited Partner Interest,
except (i) if holders of at least two-thirds of the Limited Partner Interests
consent to such Transfer or withdrawal; (ii) if such Transfer is to an entity
which is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by the General Partner; or (iii)
in connection with a transaction described in Section 11.2C or 11.2D (as
applicable).
B.    In the event the General Partner withdraws as general partner of the
Partnership in accordance with Section 11.2A, the General Partner’s General
Partner Interest shall immediately be converted into a Limited Partner Interest.
C.    Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.2D, the General Partner shall
not engage in any merger, consolidation or other combination of the General
Partner with or into another Person (other than a merger in which the General
Partner is the surviving entity) or sale of all or substantially all of its
assets, or any reclassification, or any recapitalization of outstanding REIT
Stock (other than a change in par value, or


{10654250;3}

DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




from par value to no par value, or as a result of a subdivision or combination
of REIT Stock) (a “Transaction”), unless in connection with the Transaction all
Limited Partners will either receive, or will have the right to elect to
receive, for each OP Unit an amount of cash, securities, or other property equal
to the amount of cash, securities or other property or value paid in the
Transaction to or received by a holder of one REIT Share corresponding to such
OP Unit in consideration of one REIT Share (subject to any adjustments set forth
in the definition of the “REIT Shares Amount” as determined by the General
Partner) at any time during the period from and after the date on which the
Transaction is consummated; provided that if, in connection with the
Transaction, a purchase, tender or exchange offer (“Offer”) shall have been made
to and accepted by the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding REIT Shares,
each holder of OP Units shall be given the option to exchange its OP Units for
the amount of cash, securities, or other property which a Limited Partner would
have received had it (i) exercised its right of Redemption and (ii) sold,
tendered or exchanged pursuant to the Offer the REIT Shares received upon
exercise of the right of Redemption immediately prior to the expiration of the
Offer.
The foregoing is not intended to, and does not, affect the ability of (i) a
stockholder of the General Partner to sell its stock in the General Partner or
(ii) the General Partner to perform its obligations (under agreement or
otherwise) to such stockholders (including the fulfillment of any obligations
with respect to registering the sale of stock under applicable securities laws).
D.    Notwithstanding Section 11.2C, the General Partner may merge into or
consolidate with another entity if immediately after such merger or
consolidation: (i) substantially all of the assets of the successor or surviving
entity (the “Surviving General Partner”), other than OP Units held by the
General Partner, are contributed to the Partnership as a Capital Contribution in
exchange for OP Units with a fair market value equal to the value of the assets
so contributed as determined by the Surviving General Partner in good faith and
(ii) the Surviving General Partner expressly agrees to assume all obligations of
the General Partner hereunder.
Upon such contribution and assumption, the Surviving General Partner shall have
the right and duty to amend this Agreement as set forth in this Section 11.2D.
The Surviving General Partner shall in good faith arrive at a new method for the
calculation of the REIT Shares Amount for an OP Unit after any such merger or
consolidation so as to approximate the existing method for such calculation as
closely as reasonably possible. Such calculation shall take into account, among
other things, the kind and amount of securities, cash and other property that
was receivable upon such merger or consolidation by a holder of REIT Shares or
options, warrants or other rights relating thereto, and which a holder of OP
Units could have acquired had such OP Units been redeemed for REIT Shares
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation. Such amendment to this
Agreement shall provide for adjustment to such method of calculation, which
shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided
for in the definition of REIT Shares Amount.
The above provisions of this Section 11.2D shall similarly apply to successive
mergers or consolidations permitted hereunder.

E.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Special Limited
Partner shall not transfer all or any portion of its Partnership Interest to any
transferee without the consent of the General Partner, which consent may be
withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner. 
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, however, the Special Limited Partner
shall have the right, at any time, to transfer its Partnership Interest to the
General Partner, an Affiliate of the General Partner, or an Affiliate of the
Special Limited Partner.
Section 11.3    Limited Partners’ Rights to Transfer.
A.    Prior to the first anniversary of a Limited Partner’s acquisition of a
Partnership Interest, no Limited Partner shall transfer all or any portion of
its Partnership Interest to any transferee without the consent of the General
Partner, which consent may be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion;
provided, however, that any Limited Partner may, at any time, without the
consent of the General Partner, (i) transfer all or any portion of its
Partnership Interest to the General Partner, (ii) transfer all or any portion of
its Partnership Interest to an Affiliate, another original Limited Partner or to
an Immediate Family Member, subject to the provisions of Section 11.6,
(iii) transfer all or any portion of its Partnership Interest to a trust for the
benefit of a charitable beneficiary or to a charitable foundation, subject to
the provisions of Section 11.6, and (iv) subject to the provisions of
Section 11.6, pledge (a “Pledge”) all or any portion of its Partnership Interest
to a lending institution, which is not an Affiliate of such Limited Partner, as
collateral or security for a bona fide loan or other extension of credit, and
transfer such pledged Partnership Interest to such lending institution in
connection with the exercise of remedies under such loan or extension or credit,
and the transfer of such pledged Partnership Interest by the lender to any
transferee.  Each Limited Partner or Assignee (resulting from a transfer made
pursuant to clauses (i)-(iv) of the provisions of the preceding sentence) shall
have the right to transfer all or any portion of its Partnership Interest,
subject to the provisions of Section 11.6 and the satisfaction of each of the
following conditions (in addition to the right of each such Limited Partner or
Assignee to continue to make any such transfer permitted by clauses (i)-(iv) of
such proviso without satisfying either of the following conditions):
(1)    General Partner Right of First Refusal.  The transferring Partner shall
give written notice of the proposed transfer to the General Partner, which
notice shall state (i) the identity of the proposed transferee, and (ii) the
amount and type of consideration proposed to be received for the transferred OP
Units.  The General Partner shall have ten (10) Business Days upon which to give
the transferring Partner notice of its election to acquire the OP Units on the
proposed terms.  If it so elects, it shall purchase the OP Units on such terms
within ten (10) Business Days after giving notice of such election.  If it does
not so elect, the transferring Partner may transfer such OP Units to a third
party, on economic terms no more favorable to the transferee than the proposed
terms, subject to the other conditions of this Section 11.3.
(2)    Qualified Transferee.  Any transfer of a Partnership Interest shall be
made only to Qualified Transferees.  It is a condition to any transfer otherwise
permitted hereunder that the transferee assumes by operation of law or express
agreement all of the obligations of the transferor Limited Partner under this
Agreement with respect to such transferred Partnership Interest and no such
transfer (other than pursuant to a statutory merger or consolidation wherein all
obligations and liabilities of the transferor Partner


{10654250;3}

DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




are assumed by a successor corporation by operation of law) shall relieve the
transferor Partner of its obligations under this Agreement without the approval
of the General Partner, in its reasonable discretion.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any transferee of any transferred Partnership Interest shall be
subject to any and all ownership limitations contained in the Charter, which may
limit or restrict such transferee’s ability to exercise its Redemption rights,
and to the representations in Section 3.4.D.  Any transferee, whether or not
admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner, shall take subject to the obligations
of the transferor hereunder.  Unless admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner,
no transferee, whether by a voluntary transfer, by operation of law or
otherwise, shall have any rights hereunder, other than the rights of an Assignee
as provided in Section 11.5.
B.    If a Limited Partner is subject to Incapacity, the executor,
administrator, trustee, committee, guardian, conservator, or receiver of such
Limited Partner’s estate shall have all the rights of a Limited Partner, but not
more rights than those enjoyed by other Limited Partners, for the purpose of
settling or managing the estate, and such power as the Incapacitated Limited
Partner possessed to transfer all or any part of his or its interest in the
Partnership.  The Incapacity of a Limited Partner, in and of itself, shall not
dissolve or terminate the Partnership.
C.    The General Partner may prohibit any transfer otherwise permitted under
Section 11.3 by a Limited Partner of his or her OP Units if, in the opinion of
legal counsel to the Partnership, such transfer would require the filing of a
registration statement under the Securities Act by the Partnership or would
otherwise violate any federal or state securities laws or regulations applicable
to the Partnership or the Partnership Unit.
Section 11.4    Substituted Limited Partners.
A.    No Limited Partner shall have the right to substitute a transferee as a
Limited Partner in his or her place (including any transferee permitted by
Section 11.3).  The General Partner shall, however, have the right to consent to
the admission of a transferee of the interest of a Limited Partner pursuant to
this Section 11.4 as a Substituted Limited Partner, which consent may be given
or withheld by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion.  The
General Partner’s failure or refusal to permit a transferee of any such
interests to become a Substituted Limited Partner shall not give rise to any
cause of action, whether at law or in equity, against the Partnership or any
Partner.
B.    A transferee who has been admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner in
accordance with this Article 11 shall have all the rights and powers and be
subject to all the restrictions and liabilities of a Limited Partner under this
Agreement.  The admission of any transferee as a Substituted Limited Partner
shall be subject to the transferee executing and delivering to the General
Partner an acceptance of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including without limitation, the provisions of Section 2.4 and such other
documents or instruments as may be required to effect the admission), each in
form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner) and the acknowledgment
by such transferee that each of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.4 are true and correct with respect to such transferee as of the date
of the


{10654250;3}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




transfer of the Partnership Interest to such transferee and will continue to be
true to the extent required by such representations and warranties.
C.    Upon the admission of a Substituted Limited Partner, the General Partner
shall amend Exhibit A to reflect the name, address, number of OP Units, and
Percentage Interest of such Substituted Limited Partner and to eliminate or
adjust, if necessary, the name, address and interest of the predecessor of such
Substituted Limited Partner.
Section 11.5    Assignees.
If the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, does not consent to
the admission of any permitted transferee under Section 11.3 as a Substituted
Limited Partner, as described in Section 11.4, such transferee shall be
considered an Assignee for purposes of this Agreement.  An Assignee shall be
entitled to all the rights of an assignee of a limited partnership interest
under the Act, including the right to receive distributions from the Partnership
and the share of Current Profit, Residual Profit, Residual Loss, gain and loss
attributable to the OP Units assigned to such transferee, the rights to transfer
the OP Units provided in this Article 11, the right of Redemption provided in
Section 8.6, but shall not be deemed to be a holder of OP Units for any other
purpose under this Agreement, and shall not be entitled to effect a Consent with
respect to such OP Units on any matter presented to the Limited Partners for
approval (such Consent remaining with the transferor Limited Partner).  In the
event any such transferee desires to make a further assignment of any such
Partnership Units, such transferee shall be subject to all the provisions of
this Article 11 to the same extent and in the same manner as any Limited Partner
desiring to make an assignment of OP Units.  Notwithstanding anything contained
in this Agreement to the contrary, as a condition to becoming an Assignee, any
prospective Assignee must first execute and deliver to the Partnership an
acknowledgment that each of the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 3.4 are true and correct with respect to such prospective Assignee as of
the date of the prospective assignment of the Partnership Interest to such
prospective Assignee and will continue to be true to the extent required by such
representations or warranties.
Section 11.6    General Provisions.
A.    No Limited Partner may withdraw from the Partnership other than as a
result of (i) a permitted transfer of all of such Limited Partner’s OP Units in
accordance with this Article 11 and the transferee(s) of such Partnership Units
being admitted to the Partnership as a Substituted Limited Partner or
(ii) pursuant to the exercise of its right of Redemption of all of such Limited
Partner’s OP Units under Section 8.6; provided that after such transfer,
exchange or redemption such Limited Partner owns no Partnership Interest.
B.    Any Limited Partner who shall transfer all of such Limited Partner’s OP
Units in a transfer permitted pursuant to this Article 11 where such transferee
was admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner or pursuant to the exercise of its
rights of Redemption of all of such Limited Partner’s OP Units under Section 8.6
shall cease to be a Limited Partner; provided that after such transfer, exchange
or redemption such Limited Partner owns no Partnership Interest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




C.    Transfers pursuant to this Article 11 may only be made on the first day of
a fiscal quarter of the Partnership, unless the General Partner otherwise
agrees.
D.    If any Partnership Interest is transferred, assigned or redeemed during
any quarterly segment of the Partnership’s Partnership Year in compliance with
the provisions of this Article 11 or transferred or redeemed pursuant to
Section 8.6, on any day other than the first day of a Partnership Year, then
Current Profit, Residual Profit, Residual Loss, each item thereof and all other
items attributable to such Partnership Interest for such Partnership Year shall
be divided and allocated between the transferor Partner and the transferee
Partner by taking into account their varying interests during the Partnership
Year using a method selected by the General Partner that is in accordance with
Section 706(d) of the Code.  Except as otherwise agreed by the General Partner,
all distributions of Available Cash with respect to which the Partnership Record
Date is before the date of such transfer, assignment, exchange or redemption
shall be made to the transferor Partner, and all distributions of Available Cash
thereafter, in the case of a transfer or assignment other than a redemption,
shall be made to the transferee Partner.
E.    In addition to any other restrictions on transfer herein contained,
including without limitation the provisions of this Article 11, in no event may
any transfer or assignment of a Partnership Interest by any Partner (including
pursuant to a Redemption or exchange for REIT Shares by the Partnership or the
General Partner) be made (i) to any person or entity who lacks the legal right,
power or capacity to own a Partnership Interest; (ii) in violation of applicable
law; (iii) except with the consent of the General Partner, which may be given or
withheld in its sole and absolute discretion, of any component portion of a
Partnership Interest, such as the Capital Account, or rights to distributions,
separate and apart from all other components of a Partnership Interest;
(iv) except with the consent of the General Partner, which may be given or
withheld in its sole and absolute discretion, if in the opinion of legal counsel
to the Partnership such transfer could cause a termination of the Partnership
for federal or state income tax purposes (except as a result of the Redemption
or exchange for REIT Shares of all Partnership Interests held by all Limited
Partners or pursuant to a transaction expressly permitted under Section 11.2);
(v) if in the opinion of counsel to the Partnership such transfer could cause
the Partnership to cease to be classified as a partnership for federal income
tax purposes (except as a result of the Redemption or exchange for REIT Shares
of all Partnership Interests held by all Limited Partners); (vi) if such
transfer could, in the opinion of counsel to the Partnership, cause the
Partnership to become, with respect to any employee benefit plan subject to
Title I of ERISA, a “party-in-interest” (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA)
or a “disqualified person” (as defined in Section 4975(c) of the Code); (vii) if
such transfer could, in the opinion of counsel to the Partnership, cause any
portion of the assets of the Partnership to constitute assets of any employee
benefit plan pursuant to Department of Labor Regulations Section 2510.2-101;
(viii) if such transfer requires the registration of such Partnership Interest
pursuant to any applicable federal or state securities laws; (ix) except with
the consent of the General Partner, which may be given or withheld in its sole
and absolute discretion, if such transfer (1) could be treated as effectuated
through an “established securities market” or a “secondary market” (or the
substantial equivalent thereof) within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code,
(2) could cause the Partnership to become a “publicly traded partnership,” as
such term is defined in Sections 469(k)(2) or 7704(b) of the Code, (3) could be
in violation of Section 3.4.E(5), or (4) could cause the Partnership to fail one
or more of the Section 7704 Safe Harbors


{10654250;3}
56
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




(as defined below); (x) if such transfer subjects the Partnership to be
regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisors Act
of 1940 or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, each as amended;
(xi) except with the consent of the General Partner, which may be given or
withheld in its sole discretion, if the transferee or assignee of such
Partnership Interest is unable to make the representations set forth in
Section 3.4C; (xii) if such transfer is made to a lender to the Partnership or
any Person who is related (within the meaning of Section 1.752-4(b) of the
Regulations) to any lender to the Partnership whose loan constitutes a
Nonrecourse Liability, except with the consent of the General Partner, which may
be given or withheld in its sole and absolute discretion; and provided, that, as
a condition to granting such consent the lender may be required to enter into an
arrangement with the Partnership and the General Partner to redeem or exchange
for the REIT Shares Amount any OP Units in which a security interest is held
simultaneously with the time at which such lender would be deemed to be a
partner in the Partnership for purposes of allocating liabilities to such lender
under Section 752 of the Code; or (xiii) if in the opinion of legal counsel for
the Partnership such transfer could adversely affect the ability of the REIT
Shares Issuer to continue to qualify as a REIT or, except with the consent of
the General Partner, which may be given or withheld in its sole and absolute
discretion, subject the General Partner to any additional taxes under
Section 857 or Section 4981 of the Code.
F.    The General Partner shall monitor the transfers of interests in the
Partnership (including any acquisition of OP Units by the Partnership or the
General Partner) to determine (i) if such interests could be treated as being
traded on an “established securities market” or a “secondary market” (or the
substantial equivalent thereof), within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code
and (ii) whether such transfers of interests could result in the Partnership
being unable to qualify for the “safe harbors” set forth in Regulations
Section 1.7704-1 (or such other guidance subsequently published by the IRS
setting forth safe harbors under which interests will not be treated as “readily
tradable on a secondary market” (or the substantial equivalent thereof), within
the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code) (the “Section 7704 Safe Harbors”).  The
General Partner shall have the authority (but shall not be required) to take any
steps it determines are necessary or appropriate in its sole and absolute
discretion to prevent any trading of interests which could cause the Partnership
to become a “publicly traded partnership” within the meaning of Code
Section 7704, or any recognition by the Partnership of such transfers, or to
ensure that one or more of the Section 7704 Safe Harbors is met.
Section 11.7    Put Right of General Partner.
The General Partner shall have the right at any time (the “GP Put Right”) to
require the Partnership to redeem any portion of the General Partner Interest
for the purpose of providing the General Partner with sufficient funds to enable
it to make redemptions of its stock.  The General Partner shall exercise the GP
Put Right at any time by providing the Partnership with written notice of its
desire to exercise the GP Put Right.  The purchase price to be paid by the
Partnership for the portion of the General Partner Interest that the General
Partner desires to be redeemed shall equal the fair market value of such portion
as determined by Appraisal, and shall be paid in cash within one hundred twenty
(120) days after the General Partner provides the written notice required under
this Section 11.7.  In the event that the General Partner exercises the GP Put
Right, the OP Units held by the General Partner shall be reduced as appropriate.

Section 12.1    Admission of Successor General Partner.
A successor to all of the General Partner’s General Partner Interest pursuant to
Section 11.2 who is proposed to be admitted as a successor General Partner shall
be admitted to the Partnership as the General Partner, effective upon such
transfer.  Any such transferee shall carry on the business of the Partnership
without dissolution.  In each case, the admission shall be subject to the
successor General Partner executing and delivering to the Partnership an
acceptance of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and such other
documents or instruments as may be required to effect the admission.  In the
case of such admission on any day other than the first day of a Partnership
Year, all items attributable to the General Partner Interest for such
Partnership Year shall be allocated between the transferring General Partner and
such successor as provided in Article 11.
Section 12.2    Admission of Additional Limited Partners.
A.    After the admission to the Partnership of the initial Limited Partners on
the date hereof, a Person who makes a Capital Contribution to the Partnership in
accordance with this Agreement shall be admitted to the Partnership as an
Additional Limited Partner only upon furnishing to the General Partner
(i) evidence of acceptance in form satisfactory to the General Partner of all of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the
power of attorney granted in Section 2.4 and (ii) such other documents or
instruments as may be required in the discretion of the General Partner in order
to effect such Person’s admission as an Additional Limited Partner.
B.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12.2, no Person
shall be admitted as an Additional Limited Partner without the consent of the
General Partner, which consent may be given or withheld in the General Partner’s
sole and absolute discretion.  The admission of any Person as an Additional
Limited Partner shall become effective on the date upon which the name of such
Person is recorded on the books and records of the Partnership, following the
receipt of the Capital Contribution in respect of such Limited Partner and the
consent of the General Partner to such admission.  If any Additional Limited
Partner is admitted to the Partnership on any day other than the first day of a
Partnership Year, then Current Profit, Residual Profit, Residual Loss, each item
thereof and all other items allocable among Partners and Assignees for such
Partnership Year shall be allocated among such Limited Partner and all other
Partners and Assignees by taking into account their varying interests during the
Partnership Year using a method selected by the General Partner that is in
accordance with Section 706(d) of the Code.  All distributions of Available Cash
with respect to which the Partnership Record Date is before the date of such
admission shall be made solely to Partners and Assignees other than the
Additional Limited Partner (other than in its capacity as an Assignee) and,
except as otherwise agreed to by the Additional Limited Partners and the General
Partner, all distributions of Available Cash thereafter shall be made to all
Partners and Assignees including such Additional Limited Partner.

Section 12.3    Amendment of Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership.
For the admission to the Partnership of any Partner, the General Partner shall
take all steps necessary and appropriate under the Act to amend the records of
the Partnership and, if necessary, to prepare as soon as practical an amendment
of this Agreement (including an amendment of Exhibit A) and, if required by law,
shall prepare and file an amendment to the Certificate and may for this purpose
exercise the power of attorney granted pursuant to Section 2.4.

ARTICLE 13

DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION


Section 13.1    Dissolution.
The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the admission of Substituted Limited
Partners or Additional Limited Partners or by the admission of a successor
General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  Upon the
withdrawal of the General Partner, any successor General Partner (selected as
described in Section 13.1B below) shall continue the business of the
Partnership.  The Partnership shall dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up,
upon the first to occur of any of the following (each a “Liquidating Event”):
A.    the expiration of its term as provided in Section 2.5;
B.    an event of withdrawal of the General Partner, as defined in the Act,
unless, within ninety (90) days after the withdrawal, all of the remaining
Partners agree in writing, in their sole and absolute discretion, to continue
the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date
of withdrawal, of a substitute General Partner;
C.    subject to compliance with Section 11.2 an election to dissolve the
Partnership made by the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion;
D.    entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant to
the provisions of the Act;
E.    any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Partnership or a related series of transactions that, taken together, result
in the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Partnership;
F.    the Incapacity of the General Partner, unless all of the remaining
Partners in their sole and absolute discretion agree in writing to continue the
business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of a date prior
to the date of such Incapacity, of a substitute General Partner;
G.    the redemption or exchange for REIT Shares of all Partnership Interests
(other than those of the General Partner) pursuant to this Agreement; or


{10654250;3}
59
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




H.    a final and non-appealable judgment is entered by a court of competent
jurisdiction ruling that the General Partner is bankrupt or insolvent, or a
final and non-appealable order for relief is entered by a court with appropriate
jurisdiction against the General Partner, in each case under any federal or
state bankruptcy or insolvency laws as now or hereafter in effect, unless prior
to the entry of such order or judgment all of the remaining Partners agree in
writing to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment,
effective as of a date prior to the date of such order or judgment, of a
substitute General Partner.
Section 13.2    Winding Up.
A.    Upon the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, the Partnership shall continue
solely for the purposes of winding up its affairs in an orderly manner,
liquidating its assets, and satisfying the claims of its creditors and
Partners.  No Partner shall take any action that is inconsistent with, or not
necessary to or appropriate for, the winding up of the Partnership’s business
and affairs.  The General Partner (or, in the event there is no remaining
General Partner, any Person elected by a Majority in Interest of the Limited
Partners (the “Liquidator”)) shall be responsible for overseeing the winding up
and dissolution of the Partnership and shall take full account of the
Partnership’s liabilities and property and the Partnership property shall be
liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair value thereof,
and the proceeds therefrom (which may, to the extent determined by the General
Partner, include shares of stock in the General Partner) shall be applied and
distributed in the following order:
(1)    First, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnership’s debts and
liabilities to creditors other than the Partners;
(2)    Second, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnership’s debts
and liabilities to the General Partner;
(3)    Third, to the payment and discharge of all of the Partnership’s debts and
liabilities to the other Partners; and
(4)    The balance, if any, to the General Partner, the Special Limited Partner
and the Limited Partners in proportion to their positive Capital Account
balances, determined after taking into account all Capital Account adjustments
for all prior periods and the Partnership taxable year during which the
liquidation occurs (other than those made as a result of the liquidating
distribution set forth in this Section 13.2A(4)).
(5)    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.2A which require liquidation
of the assets of the Partnership, but subject to the order of priorities set
forth therein, if prior to or upon dissolution of the Partnership the Liquidator
determines that an immediate sale of part or all of the Partnership’s assets
would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners, the Liquidator
may, in its sole and absolute discretion, defer for a reasonable time the
liquidation of any assets except those necessary to satisfy liabilities of the
Partnership (including to those Partners as creditors) and/or distribute to the
Partners, in lieu of cash, as tenants in common and in accordance with the
provisions of Section 13.2A, undivided interests in such


{10654250;3}
60
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Partnership assets as the Liquidator deems not suitable for liquidation.  Any
such distributions in-kind shall be made only if, in the good faith judgment of
the Liquidator, such distributions in-kind are in the best interest of the
Partners, and shall be subject to such conditions relating to the disposition
and management of such properties as the Liquidator deems reasonable and
equitable and to any agreements governing the operation of such properties at
such time.  The Liquidator shall determine the fair market value of any property
distributed in kind using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt.
Section 13.3    Capital Contribution Obligation.
A.    If any Partner has a deficit balance in its Capital Account (after giving
effect to all contributions, distributions and allocations for the taxable
years, including the year during which such liquidation occurs), such Partner
shall have no obligation to make any contribution to the capital of the
Partnership with respect to such deficit, and such deficit at any time shall not
be considered a debt owed to the Partnership or to any other Person for any
purpose whatsoever, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed to by such
Partner and the Partnership.
Section 13.4    Compliance with Timing Requirements of Regulations.
In the discretion of the Liquidator or the General Partner, a pro rata portion
of the distributions that would otherwise be made to the General Partner and
Limited Partners pursuant to this Article 13 may be:
(1)    distributed to a trust established for the benefit of the General Partner
and Limited Partners for the purposes of liquidating Partnership assets,
collecting amounts owed to the Partnership, and paying any contingent or
unforeseen liabilities or obligations of the Partnership or of the General
Partner arising out of or in connection with the Partnership.  The assets of any
such trust shall be distributed to the General Partner and Limited Partners from
time to time, in the reasonable discretion of the Liquidator or the General
Partner, in the same proportions and the amount distributed to such trust by the
Partnership would otherwise have been distributed to the General Partner and
Limited Partners pursuant to this Agreement; or
(2)    withheld or escrowed to provide a reasonable reserve for Partnership
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) and to reflect the unrealized portion of
any installment obligations owed to the Partnership, provided, that such
withheld or escrowed amounts shall be distributed to the General Partner and
Limited Partners in the manner and priority set forth in Section 13.2A as soon
as practicable.
Section 13.5    Deemed Distribution and Recontribution.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 13, in the event the
Partnership is liquidated within the meaning of Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) but no Liquidating Event has occurred, the
Partnership’s property shall not be liquidated, the Partnership’s liabilities

may deem appropriate.  For purposes of obtaining a written consent, the General
Partner may require a response within a reasonable specified time, but not less

EXHIBIT B

ALLOCATIONS


For purposes of this Exhibit B, the term “Partner” shall include the Special
Limited Partner.


1.
Allocations.



Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, after giving effect to the
special allocations in paragraph 2, but subject to subparagraph 1(d), Current
Profits, Residual Profits and Residual Losses of the Partnership for each fiscal
year or other applicable period of the Partnership shall be allocated among the
General Partner and Limited Partners in the following order of priority:
(a)    First, Current Profits shall be allocated to the Partners holding Class
A-2 OP Units in proportion to the amount of cash distributed (and distributable
to the extent not yet distributed) to each such Partner pursuant to Section
5.1A, until such Partners have received cumulative allocations of Current
Profits pursuant to this Section 1(a) equal to the cumulative cash distributed
(and distributable to the extent not yet distributed) to such Partners pursuant
to Section 5.1A;
(b)    Second, Residual Profits and Residual Losses shall be allocated among the
Partners, in such a manner as the General Partner determines in its discretion,
so that:
(i)    the Capital Account balance of each holder of Class A-2 OP Units equals,
as nearly as possible, the aggregate Cash Amount corresponding to the Class A-2
OP Units of such holder (determined as of the end of the relevant fiscal year or
other period), and
(ii)    the Capital Account balance of each Partner other than the holders of
Class A-2 OP Units will equal, as nearly as possible, (i) the amount of the
distributions that would be made to such Partner pursuant to Section 5.1A(3) of
the Agreement if the Partnership were dissolved, its affairs wound up and its
assets were sold for cash equal to their Gross Asset Value, taking into account
any adjustments thereto for such period, all Partnership liabilities were
satisfied in full in cash according to their terms (limited with respect to each
nonrecourse liability to the Gross Asset Value of the assets securing such
liability), and net sale proceeds (after satisfaction of such liabilities) were
distributed in full in accordance with Section 5.1A(3) to the Partners
immediately after making such allocations, minus (ii) the sum of such Partner’s
share of Partnership Minimum Gain and Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain and
the amount, if any and without duplication, that the Partner would be obligated
to contribute to the capital of the Partnership, all computed immediately prior
to the hypothetical sale of assets.
(c)    Definition of Current Profit and Residual Profit and Loss.


{10654250;3}
Exhibit B - 1
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




(1)    “Current Profit” shall mean, for any fiscal year or other applicable
period, the net taxable income of the Partnership for such fiscal year or
period, as determined for federal income tax purposes, as modified by
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), except that “Current Profit”:
(a)    shall not include:
(1)    Items of income, gain and expense that are specially allocated pursuant
to paragraph 2, below;
(2)    Depreciation and amortization;
(3)    Items of loss from the disposition of Partnership assets; and
(4)    Deemed items of gain or loss described in the second sentence of
subparagraph 4(c), below;
(b)    shall not exceed the amount necessary to match allocations under
subparagraph 1(a) above, with distributions of cash under Section 5.1A and
Section 5.02; and
(c)    shall not be less than zero.
(2)    “Residual Profit” and “Residual Loss” shall mean, for any fiscal year or
other applicable period, the net taxable income or loss, as the case may be, of
the Partnership for such fiscal year or period, as determined for federal income
tax purposes, as modified by Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), except that
Residual Profit and Residual Loss shall not include:
(a)    Items of income, gain and expense that are specially allocated pursuant
to paragraph 2, below; and
(b)    Any items included within the definition of Current Profit for such
fiscal year.
(d)    Special Allocation of Special Fees and other Class Specific Items. If the
Partnership directly or on behalf of the General Partner incurs any Special
Fees, such amounts shall be specially allocated among the Partnership Units to
correspond with their appropriate share of such expenses. To the extent that any
other items of income, gain, loss or deduction of the General Partner are
allocable to a specific class or series of REIT Shares as provided in the
Registration Statement, such items, or an amount equal thereto, shall be
specially allocated to the class or series of Partnership Units corresponding to
such class or series of REIT Shares.
2.Regulatory Allocations. Notwithstanding any provisions of paragraph 1 of this
Exhibit B, the following special allocations shall be made.


{10654250;3}
Exhibit B - 2
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------






(a)    Minimum Gain Chargeback (Nonrecourse Liabilities). Except as otherwise
provided in Section 1.704-2(f) of the Regulations, if there is a net decrease in
Partnership Minimum Gain for any Partnership fiscal year, each Partner shall be
specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if
necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to such Partner’s share of the
net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain to the extent required by Section
1.704-2(f) of the Regulations. The items to be so allocated shall be determined
in accordance with Sections 1.704-2(f) and (i) of the Regulations. This
subparagraph 2(a) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback
requirement in said section of the Regulations and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith. Allocations pursuant to this subparagraph 2(a) shall be
made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each
Partner pursuant hereto.
(b)    Partner Minimum Gain Chargeback. Except as otherwise provided in Section
1.704-2(i)(4) of the Regulations, if there is a net decrease in Partner
Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any fiscal year, each Partner who has a
share of the Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain, determined in accordance
with Section 1.704-2(i)(5) of the Regulations, shall be specially allocated
items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary,
subsequent years) in an amount equal to that Partner’s share of the net decrease
in the Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain to the extent and in the manner
required by Section 1.704-2(i) of the Regulations. The items to be so allocated
shall be determined in accordance with Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and (j)(2) of the
Regulations. This subparagraph 2(b) is intended to comply with the minimum gain
chargeback requirement with respect to Partner Nonrecourse Debt contained in
said section of the Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
Allocations pursuant to this subparagraph 2(b) shall be made in proportion to
the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Partner pursuant hereto.
(c)    Qualified Income Offset. If a Partner unexpectedly receives any
adjustments, allocations or distributions described in Sections
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6) of the Regulations, and such Partner has an
Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, items of Partnership income (including gross
income) and gain shall be specially allocated to such Partner in an amount and
manner sufficient to eliminate the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit as quickly
as possible as required by the Regulations. This subparagraph 2(c) is intended
to constitute a “qualified income offset” under Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of
the Regulations and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.
(d)    Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse Deductions for any fiscal year or
other applicable period shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with
their respective Percentage Interests.
(e)    Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any
fiscal year or other applicable period with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse
Debt shall be specially allocated to the Partner that bears the economic risk of
loss for such Partner Nonrecourse Debt (as determined under Sections
1.704-2(b)(4) and 1.704-2(i)(1) of the Regulations).


{10654250;3}
Exhibit B - 3
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




(f)    Section 754 Adjustment. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax
basis of any asset of the Partnership pursuant to Section 734(b) of the Code or
Section 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)
of the Regulations, to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts,
the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an
item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if
the adjustment decreases such basis) and such gain or loss shall be specially
allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with the manner in which
each of their respective Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted pursuant
to such section of the Regulations.
(g)    Gross Income Allocation. If any Partner has an Adjusted Capital Account
Deficit at the end of any fiscal year or other applicable period which is in
excess of the amount such Partner is obligated to restore pursuant to the
penultimate sentences of Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5) of the
Regulations, such Partner shall be specially allocated items of Partnership
income (including gross income) and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly
as possible, provided, that an allocation pursuant to this subparagraph 2(g)
shall be made if and only to the extent that such Partner would have an Adjusted
Capital Account Deficit in excess of such amount after all other allocations
provided for under this Agreement have been tentatively made as if subparagraph
2(c) and this subparagraph 2(g) were not in this Agreement.
3.Curative Allocations. The General Partner is authorized to offset all
Regulatory Allocations either with other Regulatory Allocations or with special
allocations of other items of Partnership income, gain, loss, or deduction
pursuant to this paragraph 3. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of
this Exhibit B (other than the Regulatory Allocations and Tax Allocations), the
General Partner shall make such offsetting allocations of Partnership income,
gain, loss or deduction in whatever manner the General Partner determines
appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each Partner’s
Capital Account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the Capital Account
balance such Partner would have had if the Regulatory Allocations were not part
of this Agreement.
4.Tax Allocations.
(a)    Items of Income or Loss. Except as is otherwise provided in this Exhibit
B, an allocation of Current Profit, Residual Profit or Residual Loss to a
Partner shall be treated as an allocation to such Partner of the same share of
each item of income, gain, loss, deduction and item of tax-exempt income or
Section 705(a)(2)(B) expenditure (or item treated as such expenditure pursuant
to Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(i) of the Regulations) (“Tax Items”) that is taken
into account in computing Current Profit, Residual Profit or Residual Loss.
(b)    Section 1245/1250 Recapture. Subject to subparagraph 4(c) below, if any
portion of gain from the sale of Partnership assets is treated as gain which is
ordinary income by virtue of the application of Sections 1245 or 1250 of the
Code (“Affected Gain”), then such Affected Gain shall be allocated among the
Partners in the same proportion that the depreciation and amortization
deductions giving rise to the Affected Gain were allocated. This subparagraph
4(b) shall not alter the amount of Current Profit or Residual Profit (or items
thereof) allocated among the Partners, but merely the character of such Current
Profit or Residual Profit (or items thereof). For purposes hereof, in order to
determine the proportionate allocations


{10654250;3}
Exhibit B - 4
 
DocID: 4848-4047-1218.3
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




of depreciation and amortization deductions for each fiscal year or other
applicable period, such deductions shall be deemed allocated on the same basis
as Current Profit, Residual Profit and Residual Loss for such respective period.
(c)    Precontribution Gain, Revaluations. With respect to any Contributed
Property, the Partnership shall use any permissible method contained in the
Regulations promulgated under Section 704(c) of the Code selected by the General
Partner, in its sole discretion, to take into account any variation between the
adjusted basis of such asset and the fair market value of such asset as of the
time of the contribution (“Precontribution Gain”). Each Partner hereby agrees to
report income, gain, loss and deduction on such Partner’s federal income tax
return in a manner consistent with the method used by the Partnership. If any
asset has a Gross Asset Value which is different from the Partnership’s adjusted
basis for such asset for federal income tax purposes because the Partnership has
revalued such asset pursuant to Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) of the Regulations,
the allocations of Tax Items shall be made in accordance with the principles of
Section 704(c) of the Code and the Regulations and the methods of allocation
promulgated thereunder. The intent of this subparagraph 4(c) is that each
Partner who contributed to the capital of the Partnership a Contributed Property
will bear, through reduced allocations of depreciation, increased allocations of
gain or other items, the tax detriments associated with any Precontribution
Gain. This subparagraph 4(c) is to be interpreted consistently with such intent.
(d)    Excess Nonrecourse Liability Safe Harbor. Pursuant to Section
1.752-3(a)(3) of the Regulations, solely for purposes of determining each
Partner’s proportionate share of the “excess nonrecourse liabilities” of the
Partnership (as defined in Section 1.752-3(a)(3) of the Regulations), the
Partners’ respective interests in Partnership profits shall be determined under
any permissible method reasonably determined by the General Partner.
(e)    References to Regulations. Any reference in this Exhibit B or the
Agreement to a provision of proposed and/or temporary Regulations shall, if such
provision is modified or renumbered, be deemed to refer to the successor
provision as so modified or renumbered, but only to the extent such successor
provision applies to the Partnership under the effective date rules applicable
to such successor provision.)
(f)    Successor Partners. For purposes of this Exhibit B , a transferee of a
Partnership Interest shall be deemed to have been allocated the Current Profit,
Residual Profit, Residual Loss and other items of Partnership income, gain,
loss, deduction and credit allocable to the transferred Partnership Interest
that previously have been allocated to the transferor Partner pursuant to this
Agreement.
