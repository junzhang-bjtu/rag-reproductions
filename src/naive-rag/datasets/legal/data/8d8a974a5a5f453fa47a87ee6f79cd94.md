(“Venator LLC” and, together with Venator Finance, the “Issuers”), propose,
subject to the terms and conditions stated in this agreement (this “Agreement”),
to issue and sell to the Purchasers named in Schedule I hereto (the

2020 by and among the Issuers, the Guarantors (as defined below) and Wilmington
Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”) and as collateral agent

The obligations of the Issuers, including the due and punctual payment of

Certain of the Guarantors as set forth on Schedule II (the “Post-Closing
Guarantors”) will not guarantee the obligations of the Issuers at the Time of

not be guaranteed by the Post-Closing Guarantors and the Post-Closing Guarantors
will not be Guarantors hereunder.

 

The Securities and the Guarantees will be secured by (a) a first-priority lien,
subject to Permitted Liens (as defined below), on the assets of the Issuers and
Guarantors set forth in the Collateral Documents, other than the ABL Priority
Collateral (the “Notes Priority Collateral”) and (b) a second-priority lien,
subject to the first-priority liens securing the ABL Facility and to Permitted
Liens, in the ABL Priority Collateral (the “ABL Priority Collateral” and,

ABL Facility on a first-priority basis. The Collateral shall be described in:

Exhibit 1 hereto, to be delivered in accordance with Exhibit 2 hereto, the
mortgages, deeds of trust, deeds to secure debt or similar agreements

in the ABL Priority Collateral, in each case, subject to Permitted Liens, in
favor of the Notes Collateral Agent for its benefit and for the benefit of the
Trustee and each holder of the Securities and the successors and assigns of the
foregoing. The term “Collateral Documents,” as used herein, shall mean the
Mortgages and the Security Agreements, together with any other filings,
amendments, joinders, supplements and agreements required to create or perfect
or render opposable to third parties the liens in the Collateral. The rights of
the holders of the Securities with respect to the Collateral shall be further

having a tenor of more than one year without the prior written consent of the

(e)Not to be or become, at any time prior to the expiration of two years after
the Time of Delivery, an open-end investment company, unit investment trust,
closed-end investment company or face-amount certificate company that is or is

purchasers of Securities information (the “Additional Issuer Information”)
satisfying the requirements of subsection (d)(4)(i) of Rule 144A under the Act;

 

(g)Except for such documents that are publicly available on EDGAR, to furnish to
the holders of the Securities as soon as practicable after the end of each
fiscal year an annual report (including a balance sheet and statements of
income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows of the Parent and its consolidated
subsidiaries certified by independent public accountants) and, as soon as
practicable after the end of each of the first three quarters of each fiscal
year (beginning with the fiscal quarter ending after the date of the Offering
Memorandum), to make available to its stockholders consolidated summary
financial information of the Parent and its subsidiaries for such quarter in
reasonable detail;

 

(h)During the period of one year after the Time of Delivery, the Issuers and the

“restricted securities” under Rule 144 that have been reacquired by any of them;

on account of any present or future taxes, duties or governmental charges
whatsoever imposed by the United Kingdom or Luxembourg, or any political
subdivision thereof (each, a “Taxing Jurisdiction”), unless an Issuer or any
such Guarantor, as the case may be, is compelled by law to deduct or withhold
such taxes, duties or charges. In that event, such Issuer or such Guarantor, as
the case may be, shall pay such additional amounts as may be necessary in order
that the net amounts received after such withholding or deduction will equal the
amounts that would have been received if no withholding or deduction had been
made, except to the extent that such taxes, duties or charges (a) were imposed
due to some connection of a Purchaser with the Taxing Jurisdiction other than
the mere entering into of this Agreement or receipt of payments or performance
of services hereunder or (b) would not have been imposed but for the failure of
such Purchaser to comply with any reasonable certification, identification or
other reporting requirements concerning the nationality, residence, identity or
connection with the Taxing Jurisdiction of the Purchaser if such compliance is
timely requested by an Issuer or Guarantor and required or imposed by law as a
precondition to an exemption from, or reduction in, such taxes, duties or other
charges. The Issuers and each of the Guarantors, jointly and severally, further
agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchasers against any documentary,
transfer, stamp, registration or issue tax or other similar fees or charges,
including any interest and penalties, imposed on the creation, issue and initial
sale of the Securities (subject to Section 7(b), which shall govern with respect
to VAT (as defined below)), and on the execution, delivery, performance and
enforcement of the Transaction Documents.

 

6.(a) (i) The Issuers represent and agree that, without the prior consent of the
Representative, they have not made and will not make any offer relating to the
Securities that, if the offering of the Securities contemplated by this
Agreement were conducted as a public offering pursuant to a registration
statement filed under the Act with the Commission, would constitute an “issuer
free writing prospectus,” as defined in Rule 433 under the Act (any such offer
is hereinafter referred to as an “Issuer Supplemental Disclosure Document”);

Issuers and the Representative, other than one or more term sheets, including,
without limitation, Bloomberg term sheets, or customary Bloomberg communications
relating to the Securities (provided that, other than the information attached
on Schedule IV hereto, any such term sheets or Bloomberg communications shall
not contain any information that would require such term sheets to be filed
pursuant to Rule 433 of the Act if this offering were registered under the Act)
containing customary information and conveyed to purchasers of securities, it
has not made and will not make any offer relating to the Securities that, if the
offering of the Securities contemplated by this Agreement were conducted as a
public offering pursuant to a registration statement filed under the Act with
the Commission, would constitute a “free writing prospectus,” as defined in
Rule 405 under the Act (any such offer (other than any such term sheets), is
hereinafter referred to as a “Purchaser Supplemental Disclosure Document”); and

 

(iii)any Issuer Supplemental Disclosure Document or Purchaser Supplemental
Disclosure Document the use of which has been consented to by the Issuers and
the Representative is listed on Schedule III hereto.

 

7.(a) The Issuers and the Guarantors, jointly and severally, covenant and agree
with the several Purchasers that the Issuers and the Guarantors will pay or
cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements and expenses of the
Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ counsel and accountants in connection with the
issuance of the Securities and all other expenses in connection with the
preparation, printing, reproduction and, if any filings are made, the cost of
such filings, of the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Offering Memorandum
and any amendments and supplements thereto and the mailing and delivering of
copies thereof to the Purchasers and dealers; (ii) the cost of printing or
producing any agreement among Purchasers, this Agreement, the Blue Sky
Memorandum, closing documents (including any compilations thereof) and any other
documents in connection with the offering, purchase, sale and delivery of the
Securities; (iii) all expenses in connection with the qualification of the
Securities for offering and sale under state securities laws as provided in
Section 5(b) hereof, including the fees and disbursements of counsel for the

Sky surveys, provided that payment of expenses under this clause (iii) shall not
exceed $7,550; (iv) any fees charged by securities rating services for rating
the Securities; (v) the fees and expenses of the Trustee, the Notes Collateral
Agent and any agent of the Trustee or the Notes Collateral Agent and the fees
and disbursements of counsel for the Trustee and the Notes Collateral Agent in
connection with the Transaction Documents; (vi) (A) 50% of the fees and expenses
of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP (other than as set forth in immediately

taxes on resale of any of the Securities by them and any advertising expenses
connected with any offers they may make.

(b)All amounts expressed to be payable under this Agreement by any Issuer or
Guarantor to a Purchaser which constitute the consideration for any supply for
VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of VAT. If any VAT for which a Purchaser
is liable to account is or becomes chargeable in respect of any such supply, the
relevant Issuer or Guarantor shall pay in addition (in the same manner and time
as paying any other amounts payable for such supply) the amount of such VAT on
receipt of a valid VAT invoice. Where this Agreement requires an Issuer or
Guarantor to reimburse or indemnify the Purchasers for any costs, charges or
expenses, the Issuers or Guarantors, as the case may be, shall reimburse or
indemnify, as relevant, the Purchasers for the full amount of such cost, charge
or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT to the extent the
Purchasers and their affiliates determine in their absolute discretion and in
good faith that they are not entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such
VAT from the relevant tax authorities. “VAT” means value added tax chargeable
under or pursuant to Council Directive 2006/112/EC or the Sixth Council
Directive of the European Communities and any other similar tax, wherever
imposed.

 

8.The obligations of the Purchasers hereunder shall be subject, in their
discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other
statements of the Issuers and the Guarantors herein are, on the date hereof and
at and as of the Time of Delivery, true and correct, the condition that the
Issuers and the Guarantors shall have performed all of their obligations
hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the following additional conditions:

and in the manner contemplated in the Offering Memorandum;

 

(h)The Issuers shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to the Purchasers
at the Time of Delivery a certificate of an officer of each Issuer satisfactory

jurisdictions where assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors are located and any
jurisdictions in which valid filings with respect to such assets of the Issuers
and the Guarantors may be in effect, and such search shall reveal no liens on
any of the assets of the Issuers and the Guarantors or their respective
subsidiaries except for Permitted Liens;

 



-26- 

 

 

(l)To the extent required to be delivered at the Time of Delivery, the

or reasonably requested by the Representative, in each case, to be filed,
registered or recorded, or delivered for filing on or prior to the Time of
Delivery, including filings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the U.S.

9.(a) The Issuers and each of the Guarantors will, jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless each Purchaser (and the entities listed on Exhibit 7
hereto that are acting solely in their capacity as selling agents for this
offering and not as Purchasers) against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, to which such Purchaser may become subject, under
the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary
Offering Memorandum, the Pricing Memorandum, the Offering Memorandum, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, any Issuer Supplemental Disclosure Document, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein
a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse
each Purchaser for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
Purchaser in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim
as such expenses are incurred; provided, however, that neither the Issuers nor
any Guarantor shall be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss,
claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary
Offering Memorandum, the Pricing Memorandum, the Offering Memorandum, or any
such amendment or supplement, or any Issuer Supplemental Disclosure Document or
Purchaser Supplemental Disclosure Document, in reliance upon and in conformity
with written information furnished to the Issuers by any Purchaser through the
Representative expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that
the only such information furnished by any Purchaser consists of the information
described as such in subsection (f) below.

 



-28- 

 

 

(b)Each Purchaser will severally and not jointly indemnify and hold harmless the
Issuers and each Guarantor against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to
which the Issuers or any Guarantor may become subject, under the Act or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in
respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Offering
Memorandum, the Pricing Memorandum, the Offering Memorandum, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, any Issuer Supplemental Disclosure Document or any Purchaser
Supplemental Disclosure Document, or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but with respect
to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in or omitted from any Preliminary Offering Memorandum, the
Pricing Memorandum, the Offering Memorandum, or any such amendment or
supplement, or any Issuer Supplemental Disclosure Document, only to the extent
such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Issuers by such Purchaser through the
Representative expressly for use therein, it being understood and agreed that
the only such information furnished by any Purchaser consists of the information
described as such in subsection (f) below; and will reimburse the Issuers and
any Guarantor for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Issuers
or such Guarantor in connection with investigating or defending any such action
or claim as such expenses are incurred.

 

(c)Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or
(b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying
party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall
not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party
otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought
against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the
commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate
therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other
indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with
counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the
consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and,
after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its
election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation unless (i) the indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different
from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying party; (ii) the named
parties in any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both
the indemnifying person and the indemnified person and representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them; or (iii) the indemnifying party has failed
within a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees
and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition to any local counsel)
separate from their own counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with
any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same
jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. No
indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party,
effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment
with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the
indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim)
unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional
release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action
or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault,
culpability or a failure to act, by or on behalf of any indemnified party. No
indemnifying party shall be liable under this Section 9(c) for any settlement of
any claim or action effected without its consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 



-29- 

 

 

(d)If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable to or
insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or
(b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions
in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received
by the Issuers and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Purchasers on the
other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided
by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law or if
the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection
(c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the
Issuers and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other in
connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the
Issuers and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Purchasers on the other shall
be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the
offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Issuers bear to the total
discounts and commissions received by the Purchasers, in each case as set forth
in the Offering Memorandum. The relative fault shall be determined by reference
to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the Issuers and the Guarantors on the one
hand or the Purchasers on the other and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. The Issuers, the Guarantors and the Purchasers agree that it would not
be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were
determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Purchasers were treated as one
entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not
take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this
subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result
of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or
other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this subsection (d), no Purchaser shall be required to contribute
any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the
Securities purchased by it and distributed to investors exceeds the amount of
any damages which such Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who
was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Purchasers’ obligations
in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their
respective purchasing obligations and not joint.

(e)The obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors under this Section 9 shall
be in addition to any liability which the Issuers or the Guarantors may
otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to any
affiliate (as defined in Rule 144 under the Act), director or officer of each
Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls any Purchaser within the meaning
of the Act; and the obligations of the Purchasers under this Section 9 shall be
in addition to any liability which the respective Purchasers may otherwise have
and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer and
director of the Issuers and the Guarantors and to each person, if any, who
controls the Issuers and the Guarantors within the meaning of the Act.

 

(f)The statements set forth in the fourth sentence of the seventh paragraph and
the eighth paragraph under the heading “Plan of distribution” in the Preliminary
Offering Memorandum and the Offering Memorandum (to the extent such statements
relate to the Purchasers) constitute the only information furnished by the
Purchasers to the Issuers for the purposes of Sections 1(a) and (b), 5(c) and
9(a) and (b) hereof.

 

10.(a)If any Purchaser shall default in its obligation to purchase the
Securities which it has agreed to purchase hereunder, the Representative may in
its discretion arrange for the Representative or another party or other parties
to purchase such Securities on the terms contained herein. If within thirty-six
hours after such default by any Purchaser the Representative does not arrange
for the purchase of such Securities, then the Issuers shall be entitled to a
further period of thirty-six hours within which to procure another party or
other parties satisfactory to the Representative to purchase such Securities on
such terms. In the event that, within the respective prescribed periods, the
Representative notifies the Issuers that the Representative has so arranged for
the purchase of such Securities, or the Issuers notify the Representative that
they have so arranged for the purchase of such Securities, the Representative or
the Issuers shall have the right to postpone the Time of Delivery for a period
of not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be
made necessary in the Offering Memorandum, or in any other documents or
arrangements, and the Issuers agree to prepare promptly any amendments to the
Offering Memorandum which in the Representative’s opinion may thereby be made
necessary. The term “Purchaser” as used in this Agreement shall include any
person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had
originally been a party to this Agreement with respect to such Securities.

 



 -31- 

 

 

(b)If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Securities of a defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers by the Representative and the
Issuers as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of
such Securities which remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the
aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Issuers shall have
the right to require each non-defaulting Purchaser to purchase the principal
amount of Securities which such Purchaser agreed to purchase hereunder and, in
addition, to require each non-defaulting Purchaser to purchase its pro rata
share (based on the principal amount of Securities which such Purchaser agreed
to purchase hereunder) of the Securities of such defaulting Purchaser or
Purchasers for which such arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein
shall relieve a defaulting Purchaser from liability for its default.

 

(c)If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Securities of a defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers by the Representative and the
Issuers as provided in subsection (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of
Securities which remains unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate
principal amount of all the Securities, or if the Issuers shall not exercise the
right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting Purchasers to
purchase Securities of a defaulting Purchaser or Purchasers, then this Agreement
shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting
Purchaser or the Issuers, except for the expenses to be borne by the Issuers and
the Purchasers as provided in Section 7 hereof and the indemnity and
contribution agreements in Section 9 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a
defaulting Purchaser from liability for its default.

 

11.The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, agreements,
representations, warranties and other statements of the Issuers, the Guarantors
and the several Purchasers, as set forth in this Agreement or made by or on
behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement, shall remain in full
force and effect, regardless of any termination of this Agreement or any
investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf
of any Purchaser or any affiliate, director, officer or controlling person of
any Purchaser, or the Issuers or the Guarantors, or any officer or director or
controlling person of the Issuers or the Guarantors, and shall survive delivery
of and payment for the Securities.

 



 -32- 

 

 

12.If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 8(g) (other than
subclauses (i) or (ii) thereof) or Section 10 hereof, the Issuers and the
Guarantors shall not then be under any liability to any Purchaser except as
provided in Sections 7 and 9 hereof; but, if for any other reason, the
Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Issuers as provided herein,
the Issuers and the Guarantors will reimburse the Purchasers through the
Representative for all reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by
the Representative, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably
incurred by the Purchasers in making preparations for the purchase, sale and
delivery of the Securities, but the Issuers and the Guarantors shall then be
under no further liability to any Purchaser except as provided in Sections 7 and
9 hereof.

 

13.In all dealings hereunder, the Representative shall act on behalf of each of
the Purchasers, and the parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon
any statement, request, notice or agreement on behalf of any Purchaser made or
given by the Representative jointly or by the Representative on behalf of the
Purchasers as the Purchasers’ representative.

 

All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in writing,
and if to the Purchasers shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile
transmission to the Representative in care of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, 383
Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10179 (fax: 212-270-1063), Attention: Wray
Whitticom; and if to the Issuers shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile
transmission to the address of the Issuers set forth in the Offering Memorandum,
Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice to a Purchaser pursuant
to Section 9(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by mail or facsimile
transmission to such Purchaser at its address set forth in its Purchasers’
Questionnaire, or telex constituting such Questionnaire, which address will be
supplied to the Issuers by the Representative upon request. Any such statements,
requests, notices or agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.

 

In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L.
107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Purchasers are required to
obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients,
including the Issuers, which information may include the name and address of
their respective clients, as well as other similar information that will allow
the Purchasers to properly identify their respective clients.

 

14.This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure solely to the benefit of, the
Purchasers, the Issuers and the Guarantors and, to the extent provided in
Sections 9 and 11 hereof, the officers and directors of the Issuers and the
Guarantors, the affiliates, directors and officers of any Purchaser and each
person who controls the Issuers, the Guarantors or any Purchaser, and their
respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no
other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this
Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities from any Purchaser shall be
deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such purchase.

 



 -33- 

 

 

15.Time shall be of the essence of this Agreement.

 

16.The Issuers and the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that (i) the purchase
and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement is an arm’s-length
commercial transaction between the Issuers and the Guarantors, on the one hand,
and the several Purchasers, on the other, (ii) in connection therewith and with
the process leading to such transaction each Purchaser is acting solely as a
principal and not the agent or fiduciary of the Issuers or any Guarantor,
(iii) no Purchaser has assumed an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor
of the Issuers or any Guarantor with respect to the offering contemplated hereby
or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Purchaser has
advised or is currently advising the Issuers or any Guarantor on other matters)
or any other obligation to the Issuers or any Guarantor except the obligations
expressly set forth in this Agreement and (iv) the Issuers and the Guarantors
have consulted their own legal and financial advisors to the extent they deemed
appropriate. The Issuers and the Guarantors agree that they will not claim that
the Purchasers, or any of them, have rendered advisory services of any nature or
respect, or owe a fiduciary or similar duty to the Issuers or any Guarantor, in
connection with such transaction or the process leading thereto.

 

17.This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether
written or oral) between the Issuers and the Guarantors and the Purchasers, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

18.All of the obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors hereunder shall be
joint and several obligations of each of them.

 

19.THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE ARISING UNDER OR RELATED
TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY NON-CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS OR MATTERS RELATED TO THIS
TRANSACTION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK. The Issuers and Guarantors agree that any suit or
proceeding arising in respect of this Agreement or our engagement will be tried
exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York or,
if that court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in any state court
located in The City and County of New York and the Issuers and the Guarantors
agree to submit to the jurisdiction of, and to venue in, such courts.

 

20.The Issuers, each of the Guarantors and each of the Purchasers hereby
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and
all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

21.This Agreement may be executed by any one or more of the parties hereto in
any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but
all such respective counterparts shall together constitute one and the same
instrument. The words “execution,” “executed,” “signed,” “signature,”
“delivery,” and words of like import in or relating to this Agreement or any
document to be signed in connection with this Agreement shall be deemed to
include electronic signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records in
electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or
enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or
the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, and the
parties hereto consent to conduct the transactions contemplated hereunder by
electronic means.

 



 -34- 

 

 

22.Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Issuers and the
Guarantors (and their employees, representatives and other agents) are
authorized to disclose to any and all persons, the tax treatment and tax
structure of the potential transaction and all materials of any kind (including
tax opinions and other tax analyses) provided to the Issuers and the Guarantors
relating to that treatment and structure, without the Purchasers’ imposing any
limitation of any kind. For this purpose, “tax treatment” means U.S. federal and
state income tax treatment, and “tax structure” is limited to any facts that may
be relevant to that treatment.

 

23.The Issuers and each of the Guarantors, jointly and severally, agree to
indemnify each Purchaser against any loss incurred by such Purchaser as a result
of any judgment or order being given or made for any amount due hereunder and
such judgment or order being expressed and paid in a currency (the “judgment
currency”) other than U.S. dollars and as a result of any variation as between
(i) the rate of exchange at which the U.S. dollar amount is converted into the
judgment currency for the purpose of such judgment or order, and (ii) the rate
of exchange at which such indemnified person is able to purchase U.S. dollars
with the amount of the judgment currency actually received by the indemnified
person. The foregoing indemnity shall constitute a separate and independent
obligation of the Issuers and each Guarantor and shall continue in full force
and effect notwithstanding any such judgment or order as aforesaid. The term
“rate of exchange” shall include any premiums and costs of exchange payable in
connection with the purchase of, or conversion into, the relevant currency.

 

24.Limitations Applicable to German Guarantors. In respect of any obligation,
indemnification and/or hold harmless obligation under this Agreement (whether
several or joint and several) of a Guarantor incorporated or established in
Germany, the limitations on the guarantee of such Guarantor set out in the
Indenture or in the relevant supplemental indenture, including the enforcement
limitations, shall fully apply mutatis mutandis to any such obligation,
indemnification and/or hold harmless obligation hereunder.

 

25.Limitations Applicable to Finnish Guarantor. In respect of any obligation,
indemnification and/or hold harmless obligation under this Agreement (whether
several or joint and several) of a Guarantor incorporated in Finland, the
limitations on the guarantee of such Guarantor set out in the Indenture or in
the relevant supplemental indenture, shall fully apply mutatis mutandis to any
such obligation, indemnification and/or hold harmless obligation hereunder.

 

26.To the extent that an Issuer or any Guarantor has or hereafter may acquire
any immunity (sovereign or otherwise) from jurisdiction of any court of (i) the
United Kingdom, Luxembourg, or any political subdivision thereof, (ii) the
United States or the State of New York, (iii) any jurisdiction in which it owns
or leases property or assets or from any legal process (whether through service
of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution,
execution, set-off or otherwise) with respect to themselves or their respective
property and assets or this Agreement, the Issuers and each Guarantor hereby
irrevocably waive such immunity in respect of its obligations under this
Agreement to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

 



 -35- 

 

 

27.Limitations Applicable to French Guarantors. Notwithstanding anything to the

assistance within the meaning of Article L.225-216 of the French Code de
commerce or/and would constitute a misuse of corporate assets within the meaning
of Article L.241-3, L.242-6 or L.244-1 of the French Code de commerce or any
other law or regulations having the same effect.

 

28.Limitations Applicable to Spanish Guarantors.

 

(a)Any guarantee, indemnity, obligation and/or liability granted, incurred,
undertaken, assumed or otherwise agreed by any Guarantor incorporated in Spain
(a “Spanish Guarantor”) shall be limited to the following:

constitute unlawful financial assistance within the meaning of articles 143 and
150 of the Spanish Companies Act (“Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010 de 2 de
Julio, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de
Capital”); and

 

(ii)if the Spanish Guarantor is incorporated as a limited liability company
(“sociedad de responsabilidad limitada”), restrictions contained in the Spanish

a Spanish Guarantor incorporated under the form of a private limited liability
company (sociedad de responsabilidad limitada), such guarantee or security
should be limited to twice the amount of the Spanish Guarantor’s own funds
(recursos propios), to the extent that the Notes are not secured by a mortgage,

proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer from such
Purchaser of this Agreement, and any interest and obligation in or under this
Agreement, will be effective to the same extent as the transfer would be
effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if this Agreement, and any
such interest and obligation, were governed by the laws of the United States or
a state of the United States.

 



 -36- 

 

 

(b)In the event that any Purchaser that is a Covered Entity or a BHC Act
Affiliate of such Purchaser becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special
Resolution Regime, Default Rights under this Agreement that may be exercised
against such Purchaser are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than
such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime

the United States.

Additional changes from the Preliminary Offering Memorandum

 

In addition to the pricing information set forth above, the Preliminary Offering
Memorandum will be updated to reflect the following:

 

SUMMARY

 

The following summary box paragraph is added immediately before the section
titled “Transfer restrictions” appearing on page 13:

 

Original Issue Discount

The Notes will be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes in an amount equal to the excess of the stated principal
amount of the Notes over their issue price. As such, U.S. holders, whether on
the cash or accrual method of tax accounting, would be required to include any
amounts representing such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as it accrues
on a constant yield to maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax purposes in
advance of the receipt of cash payments to which such income is attributable.
For further discussion, see “Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations.”

 

RISK FACTORS

 

The risk factor titled “The interest payments on the Notes may be treated as
U.S. source income.” beginning on page 74 is replaced with the following:

 

The interest payments on the Notes may be treated as U.S. source income.

 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, payments of interest (including, for this
purpose, any original issue discount) on debt obligations of a U.S. corporation
will generally be considered U.S. source income. Payments of interest on debt
obligations of a foreign corporation will generally be considered non-U.S.
source income unless the interest payments are allocated to U.S. source as a
result of the foreign corporation’s trade or business activities in the United
States.

 







 

The Notes will be co-issued by Venator Finance and Venator Co-Issuer. Each of
Venator Finance and Venator Co-Issuer is currently treated as a “disregarded
entity” owned by Venator for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as a result,
the Notes are expected to be deemed debt obligations of Venator. As discussed in
the risk factor titled “The IRS may not agree that we are a foreign corporation
for U.S. federal tax purposes,” it is currently expected that Venator will not
be treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under
Section 7874 of the Code. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS will
not challenge Venator’s status as a foreign corporation. As a result, there is a
risk that the Notes may be treated as debt obligations of a U.S. corporation.

 

In addition, Venator is engaged in trade or business activities in the U.S.
through Venator Co-Issuer. Even though it is currently expected that none of the
interest payments on the Notes will be allocable to Venator’s income effectively
connected with trade or business activities in the U.S. for purposes of the
source rule, there can be no assurance that, due to potential unforeseen changes
in our business or operations or a challenge by the IRS, interest on the Notes
would not be in part or whole treated as U.S. source.

 

As a result, there is significant uncertainty regarding the source of interest
paid on the Notes and all or a portion of such interest may be treated by an
applicable withholding agent as U.S. source income.

 

In order to avoid a U.S. withholding tax that may apply if all or a portion of
the interest payments under the Notes are treated as U.S. source income,
non-U.S. holders (as such term is defined in “Certain U.S. federal income tax
considerations”) may need to demonstrate that they meet the requirements of the
so-called “portfolio interest” exemption (which will generally be met if the
non-U.S. holder (i) is not a bank that received such note on an extension of
credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of
its trade or business, (ii) does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock and
(iii) is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to us through
actual or constructive stock ownership) or an exemption under an applicable
income tax treaty, and, in each case, satisfies any applicable certification or
documentation requirements. In the event any U.S. withholding tax is imposed
with respect to any payments on the Notes, there generally will be no additional
amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount. Prospective purchasers of
the Notes should consult their advisors regarding the impact of the source
rule and the uncertainty on their investments. See “Certain U.S. federal income
tax considerations.”

 

The following risk factor is added immediately before the risk factor titled
“Investors may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities
law violations.” appearing on page 75:

 

The Notes will be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 

The Notes will be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for
U.S. federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the excess of the stated
principal amount of the Notes over their issue price. As such, U.S. holders,
whether on the cash or accrual method of tax accounting, would be required to
include any amounts representing OID in gross income (as ordinary income) as it
accrues on a constant yield to maturity basis for U.S. federal income tax
purposes in advance of the receipt of cash payments to which such income is
attributable. For further discussion, see “Certain U.S. federal income tax
considerations.”

 







 

 

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

 

The section titled “Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations” beginning on
page 218 is replaced with the following in its entirety:

 

Certain U.S. federal income tax considerations

 

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax consequences of
the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be
a complete analysis of all potential tax effects. This discussion does not
address the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws (such as estate and gift tax
laws) other than U.S. federal income tax laws or any state, local or non-U.S.
tax laws. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the “Code”), Treasury Regulations issued thereunder, and judicial
and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date
hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive
effect. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been
or are expected to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There
can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different position concerning
the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or
that any such position would not be sustained.

 

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences
that may be relevant to a holder in light of such holder’s particular
circumstances, including the impact of the unearned income Medicare contribution
tax or the alternative minimum tax, or to holders subject to special rules, such
as certain financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, “controlled foreign
corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies,” insurance companies,
dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders (as
defined below) whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt
entities, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
partnerships or other pass through entities and investors in such entities,
persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross
income with respect to the Notes being taken into account in an applicable
financial statement, U.S. holders that hold Notes through non-U.S. brokers or
other non-U.S. intermediaries and persons holding the Notes as part of a
“straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated transaction.
In addition, this discussion is limited to persons who purchase the Notes for
cash at original issue and at their “issue price” (i.e., the first price at
which a substantial amount of the Notes is sold to the public for cash,
excluding to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in
the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers) and who hold the
Notes as capital assets within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code.

 

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Note
that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a
citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation or any entity
treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes created or
organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States or of any
state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) any estate the income of which
is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) any
trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary
supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons
have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a
valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person. A “non-U.S.
holder” is an individual, an entity taxable as a corporation, an estate or a
trust that is not a U.S. holder.

 

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income
tax purposes holds the Notes, the U.S. tax treatment of a partner in the
partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the
activities of the partnership. A partnership considering an investment in the
Notes, and partners in such a partnership, should consult their tax advisors
regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the purchase, ownership
and disposition of the Notes.

 





 

 

Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning
the tax consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular
circumstances, including the application of the U.S. federal income tax
considerations discussed below, as well as the application of other federal,
state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

 

(a)           Source of the interest income and characterization of the Issuers

 

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, payments of interest (including for this
purpose, any “OID”, as defined below) on debt obligations of a U.S. corporation
will generally be considered U.S. source income. Payments of interest on debt
obligations of a foreign corporation will generally be considered non-U.S.
source income unless the interest payments are allocated to U.S. source as a
result of the foreign corporation’s trade or business activities in the United
States.

 

The Notes will be co-issued by Venator Finance and Venator Co-Issuer. Each of
Venator Finance and Venator Co-Issuer is currently treated as a “disregarded
entity” owned by Holdings for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as a result,
the Notes are expected to be deemed debt obligations of Holdings. As discussed
in the risk factor titled “Risk factors—Risks relating to our relationship with
Huntsman—The IRS may not agree that we are a foreign corporation for U.S.
federal tax purposes,” it is currently expected that Holdings will not be
treated as a U.S. corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes under
Section 7874 of the Code. However, there can be no assurance that the IRS will
not challenge Holdings’ status as a foreign corporation. As a result, there is a
risk that the Notes may be treated as debt obligations of a U.S. corporation.

 

In addition, Holdings is engaged in trade or business activities in the United
States through Venator Co-Issuer. Even though it is currently expected that none
of the interest payments on the Notes will be allocable to Holdings’ income
effectively connected with trade or business activities in the United States for
purposes of the source rule, there can be no assurance that, due to potential
unforeseen changes in our business or operations or a challenge by the IRS,
interest on the Notes would not be in part or in whole treated as U.S. source.

 

As a result, there is significant uncertainty regarding the source of interest
paid on the Notes and all or a portion of such interest may be treated by an
applicable withholding agent as U.S. source. Prospective purchasers of the Notes
should consult their advisors regarding the impact of the source rule and the
uncertainty on their investments.

 

(b)           U.S. holders

 

(c)           Payments of stated interest

 

Payments of stated interest on the Notes (including any additional amounts paid
in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld)
generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary income at the time that
such payments are received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holder’s
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 





 

 

(d)          Original issue discount

 

The Notes will be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes in an amount equal to the excess of the stated principal
amount of the Notes over their issue price.

 

As a result, in addition to the stated interest on the note, a U.S. holder
(whether a cash or accrual method taxpayer) will be required to include in gross
income (as ordinary income) OID as it accrues on a constant yield to maturity
basis, before the receipt of cash payments attributable to this income. The
amount of OID includible in gross income for a taxable year will be the sum of
the daily portions of OID with respect to the note for each day during that
taxable year on which the U.S. holder holds the note. The daily portion is
determined by allocating to each day of an accrual period a pro rata portion of
the OID allocable to that accrual period. An accrual period can be any length of
time that is not longer than one year, provided that each scheduled payment of
principal and interest occurs on either the first or last day of an accrual
period. The OID allocable to any accrual period generally will equal (i) the
product of the “adjusted issue price” of the note at the beginning of such
period and the note’s yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding
at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such
period, less (ii) the stated interest allocable to the accrual period. The
“adjusted issue price” of a note as of the beginning of any accrual period will
equal its issue price, increased by any previously accrued OID and decreased by
any payments other than stated interest. The “yield to maturity” of a note
generally will be the discount rate that, when applied to all payments to be
made under the note, produces a present value equal to the issue price of the
note. The OID allocable to a final accrual period generally will be the
difference between the amount payable at maturity, other than a payment of
stated interest, and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final
accrual period. Special rules apply for calculating OID for an initial short
accrual period. Under these rules, a U.S. holder generally will have to include
in taxable income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual
periods.

 

(e)          Foreign tax credit

 

As discussed under “—Source of the interest income and characterization of the
Issuers,” stated interest income and OID on a Note may be considered U.S.
source, in which case, the availability of foreign tax credits (or deductions in
lieu thereof) with respect to any non-U.S. withholding taxes imposed on interest
payments will be significantly limited. Even if treated as foreign source, there
are significant complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign
tax credits. Interest income and OID on a Note generally will be considered
“passive category income” in computing the foreign tax credit. U.S. holders
should consult their tax advisors regarding the creditability or deductibility
of any non-U.S. withholding taxes.

 

(f)          Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition
of Notes

 

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of
a Note, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the
difference, if any, between the amount realized upon such disposition (less any
amount equal to any accrued but unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as
stated interest income as discussed above to the extent not previously included
in income by the U.S. holder) and such U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the
Note.

 





 

 

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note will, in general, be the cost of
such Note to such U.S. holder, increased by any OID previously accrued by such
U.S. holder with respect to such note.

 

Any gain or loss recognized upon the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or
other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source gain or loss
and generally will be capital gain or loss. Capital gains of certain
non-corporate U.S. holders (including individuals) derived in respect of capital
assets held for more than one year generally are eligible for reduced rates of
taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

 

(g)          Information reporting and backup withholding

 

In general, information reporting requirements will apply to payments of
interest (including the accrual of OID) on the Notes and to the proceeds of the
sale or other disposition (including a retirement or redemption) of a Note paid
to a U.S. holder unless such U.S. holder is an exempt recipient, and, when
required, provides evidence of such exemption. Backup withholding may apply to
such payments if the U.S. holder fails to provide a taxpayer identification
number or a certification that it is not subject to backup withholding.

 

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and any amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S.
holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability provided the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.

 

(h)          Tax return disclosure requirements

 

Individuals that own “specified foreign financial assets” with an aggregate
value in excess of certain thresholds generally are required to file an
information report (IRS Form 8938) with respect to such assets with their tax
returns. The Notes generally will constitute specified foreign financial assets
subject to these reporting requirements, unless the Notes are held in an account
at certain financial institutions. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be
treated as an individual for purposes of these rules. U.S. holders are urged to
consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing disclosure
requirements to their ownership of the Notes, including the significant
penalties for non-compliance.

 

(i)           Non-U.S. holders

 

(j)           Payments of stated interest and OID

 

As discussed under “—Source of the interest income and characterization of the
Issuers,” stated interest income and OID on a Note may be considered U.S.
source. Subject to discussions below under “—Information reporting and backup
withholding” and “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” even if interest is
treated as U.S. source (for this purpose, including any accrued OID), it
generally will not be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax provided that:

 

·the interest is not effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of
a trade or business in the United States;

 

·the non-U.S. holder does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of
the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting stock;

 

·the non-U.S. holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related to
us through actual or constructive stock ownership and is not a bank that
received such Note on an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement
entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business; and

 





 

 

·either (1) the non-U.S. holder certifies in a statement provided to the
applicable withholding agent, under penalties of perjury, that it is not a
“United States person” for U.S. federal income tax purposes and provides its
name and address, (2) a securities clearing organization, bank or other
financial institution that holds customers’ securities in the ordinary course of
its trade or business and holds the Note on behalf of the non-U.S. holder
certifies to the applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that
it, or a financial institution between it and the non-U.S. holder, has received
from the non-U.S. holder a statement certifying, under penalties of perjury,
that such holder is not a United States person and provides the applicable
withholding agent with a copy of such statement or (3) the non-U.S. holder holds
its Note directly through a “qualified intermediary” and certain conditions are
satisfied.

 

If the above conditions are not met, payments of interest to a non-U.S. holder
that are treated as U.S. source will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal
withholding tax, although a non-U.S. holder may be entitled to a reduction in or
an exemption from withholding tax on interest if the non-U.S. holder provides
the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed (1) IRS Form W-8BEN or
W-8BEN-E claiming an exemption from or reduction of the withholding tax under
the benefit of a tax treaty between the United States and the non-U.S. holder’s
country of residence, or (2) IRS Form W-8ECI stating that interest paid on the
Note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with
the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business in the United States.

 

If interest paid to a non-U.S. holder is effectively connected with the non-U.S.
holder’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable
income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in
the United States to which such interest is attributable), then, although such
interest will be exempt from U.S. federal withholding tax (provided, in the case
of interest that is treated as U.S. source, the non-U.S. holder provides
appropriate certification), the non-U.S. holder generally will be subject to
U.S. federal income tax on such interest in the same manner as if such non-U.S.
holder were a U.S. holder, regardless of whether the interest is treated as U.S.
source or non-U.S. source. In addition, if the non-U.S. holder is a foreign
corporation, any effectively connected earnings and profits, as adjusted for
certain items, may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% or lower
applicable treaty rate.

 

(k)          Sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition
of Notes

 

Subject to the discussions below under “—Information reporting and backup
withholding” and “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act,” any gain realized by a
non-U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable
disposition of a Note (other than any amount allocable to accrued and unpaid
interest, which is taxable as interest and may be subject to the rules discussed
above) generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax unless:

 

·the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder’s conduct of a trade
or business in the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax
treaty, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United
States to which such gain is attributable); or

 





 

 

·the non-U.S. holder is an individual who is present in the United States for
183 days or more in the taxable year of the sale, exchange, retirement,
redemption or other taxable disposition, and certain conditions are met.

 

A non-U.S. holder described in the first bullet point above will generally be
required to pay U.S. federal income tax on the net gain derived from the
disposition in the same manner as if such non-U.S. holder were a U.S. holder,
and if such non-U.S. holder is a foreign corporation, an additional branch
profits tax at a 30% rate (or a lower rate if so specified by an applicable
income tax treaty) may apply to any effectively connected earnings and profits,
as adjusted for certain items. A non-U.S. holder described in the second bullet
point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or, if
applicable, a lower treaty rate) on the gain derived from the sale or other
taxable disposition of a Note which may be offset by certain U.S.-source capital
losses, provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax
returns with respect to such losses, even though the non-U.S. holder is not
considered a resident of the United States.

 

(l)            Information reporting and backup withholding

 

Payments of interest to a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to
backup withholding, provided the applicable withholding agent does not have
actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a United States person
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and the holder has provided the statement
described above under “—Payments of stated interest and OID.” However, if
interest is treated as U.S. source, payors will generally be required to report
annually to the IRS and to the non-U.S. holder the amount of, and the tax
withheld with respect to, any interest paid to the non-U.S. holder, regardless
of whether any tax was actually withheld. Copies of these information returns
may also be made available under the provisions of a specific treaty or
agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder
resides.

 

A non-U.S. holder will not be subject to backup withholding or information
reporting with respect to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition
(including a retirement or redemption) of a Note within the United States or
conducted through certain U.S.-related brokers if the payor receives the
statement described above under “—Payments of stated interest and OID” and does
not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a United States
person for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or the holder otherwise establishes
an exemption. Proceeds of a disposition of a Note paid outside the United States
and conducted through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker (other than a
U.S.-related broker as mentioned above) generally will not be subject to backup
withholding or information reporting.

 

Backup withholding is not an additional tax and a non-U.S. holder generally will
be entitled to credit any amounts withheld under the backup withholding
rules against the holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability or may claim a
refund provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a
timely manner.

 





 

 

(m)          Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act

 

Withholding taxes may be imposed under Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (such
Sections commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or
“FATCA”) to certain types of payments made to “foreign financial institutions”
(as defined in the Code) and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, a
30% withholding tax may be imposed on payments of U.S. source interest on debt
instruments (including, for this purpose, any accrued OID) or (subject to the
proposed Treasury Regulations discussed below) gross proceeds from the sale or
other disposition of debt instruments which can produce U.S. source interest or
certain “passthru payments” made to a “foreign financial institution” (as
defined in the Code) or a “non-financial foreign entity” (as defined in the
Code), unless (1) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence
and reporting obligations, (2) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies
it does not have any “substantial United States owners” (as defined in the Code)
or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States
owner, or (3) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity
otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign
financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements
in (1) above, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of the
Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertake to identify accounts
held by certain “specified United States persons” or “United States owned
foreign entities” (each as defined in the Code), annually report certain
information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to non-compliant
foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders.

 

Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an
intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing FATCA may be
subject to different rules.

 

Under the applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative guidance,
withholding under FATCA generally applies to payments of U.S. source interest on
a Note. While withholding under FATCA would have applied also to payments of
gross proceeds in certain circumstances, recently proposed Treasury Regulations
eliminate FATCA withholding on payments of gross proceeds entirely. Taxpayers
generally may rely on these proposed Treasury Regulations until final Treasury
Regulations are issued.

 

Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential
application of withholding under FATCA to their investment in the Notes. In the
event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the
Notes, there generally will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for
the withheld amount.

 

Other information presented in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum is deemed to
have changed to the extent affected by the changes described herein.

 

This material is confidential and is for your information only and is not
intended to be used by anyone other than you. This information does not purport

The undersigned, as the Chief Financial Officer of Venator Materials PLC, a

“Parent”), in connection with the offering of $225,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of 9.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the “Notes”) of Venator Finance
S.à r.l. (“Venator Finance”) and Venator Materials LLC (“Venator LLC” and,

(the “Purchase Agreement”) between the Issuers, the guarantors named therein and
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, as representative of the several initial purchasers
named in Schedule I thereto (the “Purchasers”), hereby certifies, solely in his
capacity as an officer of the Parent and not individually, on behalf of the
Parent and the Issuers as follows:

 



            1.        I am the duly elected, qualified and acting Chief
Financial Officer of the Parent and am providing this certificate based on my
examination of the internal accounting records of Parent and its subsidiaries.

 



            2.        I am knowledgeable with respect to the internal accounting
records and internal accounting practices, policies, procedures and controls of
the Parent and have responsibility for financial and accounting matters with
respect to the Parent and its subsidiaries.

records or schedules or analyses derived therefrom of the Parent and its
subsidiaries that the undersigned has deemed necessary to make the
certifications set forth herein.

 

            4.        I have reviewed the financial data and information
identified by you in certain pages from the Pricing Disclosure Package attached
hereto as Exhibit A and have compared such financial data and information to a
schedule prepared by the Parent from its accounting records and found such
amounts to be in agreement. I (a) compared the amounts in the schedule to the
underlying accounting records and found such amounts to be in agreement and
(b) determined that the schedule was mathematically accurate.
