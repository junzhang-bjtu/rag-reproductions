Agreement Claims); provided, however, that any Supporting Lender may Transfer

that does not comply with the foregoing shall be deemed void ab initio and the
Company and each other Party shall have the right to enforce the voiding of such
Transfer.

circumstance that would give rise to or lead to any such action, suit, demand,
claim, complaint, hearing, investigation, notice, demand letter, warning letter,
proceeding or request for information or any such liability. There has not been
any violation of any FDA Law and Regulation and the Laws and regulations of
other similar Governmental Entities that regulate the safety and effectiveness
of medical device and biological products in product development efforts,
submissions, record keeping and reports to FDA or other similar Governmental
Entity that could require or lead to investigation, corrective action or
enforcement, regulatory or administrative action. There are no civil or criminal
proceedings relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any Company or

Business (taken as a whole) and (z) would not reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially hinder or delay any of the Transactions or the transactions
contemplated by any of the Definitive Documents or affect the ability of the

51



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Proposed Alternative Transaction”); provided that the Debtors shall promptly
notify the Prepetition Agents of any Proposed Alternative Transaction within two
(2) Business Days of receipt thereof with such notice to include the material
terms thereof and any accompanying documentation and/or correspondence relating
to the Proposed Alternative Transaction, including (unless prohibited by a
separate agreement) the identity of the person or group of persons submitting
such Proposed Alternative Transaction.

(b) To the extent that the Debtors, in consultation with the Prepetition Agents,
determine, in good faith and consistent with the Debtors’ fiduciary duties, that
a Proposed Alternative Transaction would reasonably be expected to provide
better recovery to holders of Claims and Equity Interests in the Debtors as
compared to the recovery such holders would receive pursuant to the transactions
contemplated herein, including consummation of the Restructuring (such Proposed
Alternative Transaction, a “Superior Alternative Transaction”), the Debtors may
negotiate, provide due diligence in connection with, discuss, and/or analyze
such Superior Alternative Transaction without breaching or terminating this
Agreement; provided that a determination by the Board, in good faith, after
consulting its outside legal counsel, that proceeding with the Restructuring and
pursuit of confirmation and consummation of the Plan or consummation of the
Transactions instead of a Superior Alternative Transaction would be a breach of
the Board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law shall be required prior to the
Debtors electing to enter into a Superior Alternative Transaction; provided
further that the Debtors shall, prior to electing to enter into a Superior
Alternative Transaction, provide the Prepetition Agents with seven (7) Business
Days’ written notice of their intent to enter into such Superior Alternative
Transaction, with such notice to include the definitive documentation with
respect to such Superior Alternative Transaction (such seven (7) Business Day
notice period, the “Alternative Transaction Notice Period”).

(c) At any time during the Alternative Transaction Notice Period, the Supporting
Lenders may submit to the Debtors a proposal for one or more Alternative
Transactions (any such proposal, a “Revised Supporting Lender Proposal”). The
Debtors shall, (i) promptly following the receipt of any Revised Supporting
Lender Proposal, determine in consultation with the Prepetition Agents whether
the Revised Supporting Lender Proposal would reasonably be expected to provide
equal or better recovery to holders of Claims and Equity Interests in the
Debtors as compared to the recovery such holders would receive pursuant to the
Superior Alternative Transaction, and (ii) if so, immediately terminate any
negotiations, provision of due diligence or other discussions in connection with
such Superior Alternative Transaction.

(d) If the Debtors notify counsel to the Prepetition Agents that the Debtors
have entered, or will be entering, into definitive documentation with respect to
a Superior Alternative Transaction, all obligations of the Supporting Lenders
shall immediately terminate and all of the Supporting Lenders’ rights shall be
reserved.

Section 7.6 Insurance. The Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to)
provide the Supporting Lenders with all cooperation, information and assistance
reasonably requested by the Supporting Lenders in connection with obtaining the
Post-Restructuring Insurance, including providing any prospective insurer (and
its advisors and representatives) access to information, documents and personnel
as may reasonably be requested by such Persons.

that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.2 shall
not be available to any Party whose breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement set forth in this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Plan to become effective on or before the
Outside Date.

Section 9.3 Effect of Termination.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 9.3, in the event of
termination of this Agreement in accordance with this Article IX, (a) this
Agreement shall be of no further force and effect and each Party shall be
released from its commitments, undertakings and agreements under or related to
this Agreement, and shall have all the rights and remedies that it would have
had it not entered into this Agreement, and shall be entitled to take all
actions, whether with respect to the Restructuring or otherwise, that it would
have been entitled to take had it not entered into this Agreement, including all
rights and remedies available to it under applicable law; provided, however,
that the rights and obligations of the Parties under Section 10.13, if
applicable, with respect to the payment of fees and expenses incurred up to such
date of termination shall survive such termination and all rights and remedies
with respect to such claims shall not be prejudiced in any way; and (b) to the
extent Bankruptcy Court permission shall be required for a Supporting Lender to
change or withdraw (or cause to be changed or withdrawn) its vote in favor of
the Plan or any release, the Company shall support and not object to such change
or withdrawal and shall use reasonable best efforts to modify or amend its Plan
or other pleadings, as applicable, to permit such Supporting Lender to change or
withdraw (or cause to be changed or withdrawn) such vote or release. Nothing in
this Section 9.3 shall relieve any Party from (i) liability for such Party’s
breach of such Party’s obligations hereunder or (ii) obligations under this
Agreement that expressly survive termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 10.6.

(b) In consideration of the Supporting Lenders having expended considerable time
and expense in connection with this Agreement, the Plan and the Definitive
Documentation, the Debtors shall pay to the Supporting Lenders the Expense
Reimbursement Amount upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1
(other than pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(i), Section 9.1(d)(iii),
Section 9.1(d)(iv) or Section 9.1(d)(v)). Such Expense Reimbursement Amount
shall be due and payable within five (5) Business Days after the termination of
this Agreement. The Expense Reimbursement Amount shall, subject to Bankruptcy
Court approval, be treated as administrative expenses in the Chapter 11 Case
under Section 503(b)(1)(A) and Section 507(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code. The
Debtors acknowledge and agree that: (i) the approval and payment of the Expense
Reimbursement Amount are integral parts of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) in the absence of the Debtors’ obligation to pay the Expense
Reimbursement Amount, the Supporting Lenders would not have entered into this
Agreement; (iii) the entry of the Supporting Lenders into this Agreement is
necessary for preservation of the Estates and is beneficial to the Debtors
because, in the Debtors’ business judgment, it will enhance the Debtors’ ability
to maximize the value of their assets for the benefit of their creditors and
other stakeholders; and (iv) the Expense Reimbursement Amount is reasonable in
relation to the Supporting Lenders’ costs and efforts and to the magnitude of
the transactions contemplated hereby and the Supporting Lenders’ lost
opportunities resulting from the time spent pursuing the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

59



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c) Notwithstanding Section 9.3(a), the Supporting Lenders’ right to receive the
one-time payment of the Expense Reimbursement Amount from the Debtors as
provided in Section 9.3(b) shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy
available to the Supporting Lenders against the Debtors with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 9.1 (other than pursuant to
Section 9.1(d)(i), Section 9.1(d)(iii), Section 9.1(d)(iv) or Section 9.1(d)(v))
(including if terminated or terminable pursuant to one or more of such
provisions), and upon such payment of the Expense Reimbursement Amount, the
Debtors shall have no further liability or obligation arising out of any such
breach of this Agreement or failure to consummate the Transactions in connection
with such termination event. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event
shall the Debtors be required to pay the Expense Reimbursement Amount on more
than one occasion. The Debtors’ obligations to pay the Supporting Lenders the
Expense Reimbursement Amount in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.3(b)
will (i) be binding upon and enforceable against each Debtor immediately upon
the Bankruptcy Court’s entering the Disclosure Statement Order, (ii) not be
terminable or dischargeable thereafter for any reason, (iii) survive any
subsequent conversion, dismissal or consolidation of the Chapter 11 Case, any
plan of reorganization or liquidation in the Chapter 11 Case and (iv) survive
the subsequent termination of this Agreement by any means. The Debtors’
obligations to pay the Supporting Lenders the Expense Reimbursement Amount, as
and when required under this Agreement, are intended to be, and upon entry of
the Disclosure Statement Order are, binding upon (A) each Debtor, (B) any
successors or assigns of any Debtor, (C) any trustee, examiner or other
representative of an Estate, (D) the reorganized Debtors and (E) any other
entity vested or revested with any right, title or interest in or to a Debtor,
or any other Person claiming any rights in or control (direct or indirect) over
any Debtor (each of (A) through (E), a “Successor”) as if such Successor were a
Debtor hereunder. The Debtors’ obligations to pay the Supporting Lenders the
Expense Reimbursement Amount, as and when required under this Agreement, may not
be discharged under Sections 1141 or 727 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise and
may not be abandoned under Section 554 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise.

the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement to
enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by, and enforced in accordance

ACTION BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND CERTIFIES

EVENT OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE RESTRUCTURING TERM SHEET AND THE DEFINITIVE DOCUMENTS AND THE

WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 10.12(c).

Section 10.13 Transaction Expenses. The Debtors shall pay (a) one (1) Business
Day prior to the Petition Date, (b) subject to the DIP Orders, including the

expenses of the Supporting Lenders in connection with the Restructuring
(provided that the amount paid pursuant to (a) above shall be agreed by the
Debtors and the Supporting Lenders and shall be less than the total amount of
accrued and unpaid expenses owing to the Supporting Lenders as of such date)
without the need to file any application with, or obtain any order from, the

(i) Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, (ii) Houlihan Lokey Capital, Inc., (iii) local
Texas counsel, (iv) any other professionals that may be retained by the

Section 10.14 Amendments and Waivers.

(a) Any amendment or modification of any term or provision of this Agreement or
the Restructuring and any waiver of any term or provision of this Agreement or
of the Restructuring or of any default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty
or covenant hereunder shall not be valid unless the same shall be in writing and
(i) signed by the Company and the DIP Agent or (ii) confirmed by email by both
counsel to the Company and counsel to the

 

64



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DIP Agent representing that it is acting with the authority of the Company and
the DIP Agent, respectively.

(b) Any waiver shall not be deemed to extend to any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any
way any rights arising by virtue of any prior or subsequent default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant.

(c) The failure of any Party to exercise any right, power or remedy provided
under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in
equity, or to insist upon compliance by any other Party with its obligations
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver by such Party of its right to exercise
any such or other right, power or remedy or to demand such compliance.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 10.14, no
amendment, modification or waiver of any term or provision of this Agreement or
the Restructuring shall be effective with respect to any Supporting Lender
without such Supporting Lender’s prior written consent to the extent such
amendment, modification or waiver materially affects such Supporting Lender in a
manner that is disproportionately adverse to such Supporting Lender in relation
to the other Supporting Lenders.

(e) All rights, powers, and remedies provided under this Agreement or otherwise
available in respect hereof at law or in equity shall be cumulative and not
alternative, and the exercise of any right, power, or remedy thereof by any
Party shall not preclude the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such
right, power, or remedy by such Party.

Section 10.15 Parties, Succession and Assignment. This Agreement is intended to
bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors,
assigns, heirs, executors, estates (including the Estates), administrators and
representatives. No rights or obligations of any Party under this Agreement may
be assigned or transferred to any other person or entity except as otherwise
expressly provided herein. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall
give to any person or entity, other than the Parties (and those permitted
assigns under Section 3.3), any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy
or claim under this Agreement; provided, however, that a Supporting Lender may
assign some or all of its rights or delegate some or all of its obligations
hereunder to one or more Affiliates without any other Party’s consent. Upon any
such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to the applicable
Party will also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise
requires.

Section 10.16 No Waiver of Participation and Reservation of Right. Except as
expressly provided in this Agreement or the Plan, nothing herein is intended to,
nor does, in any manner waive, limit, impair, or restrict any right of any Party
or the ability of each of the Parties to protect and preserve its rights,
remedies and interests, including Claims against and interests in the Company.
If the Restructuring is not consummated, or following the occurrence of a
Supporting Lender Termination Event, a Company Termination Event, an event
triggering automatic termination pursuant to Section 9.1(c), or the termination
of this Agreement, nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver by any Party of
any or all of such Party’s rights, and the Parties expressly reserve any and all
of their respective rights. This Agreement, the Plan, and any

 

65



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

related document shall in no event be construed as or be deemed to be evidence
of an admission or concession on the part of any Party of any claim or fault or
liability or damages whatsoever. The Parties acknowledge that this Agreement,
the Plan, and all negotiations related hereto are part of a proposed settlement
of matters that may otherwise be the subject of litigation.

Section 10.17 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Unless expressly stated herein, this
Agreement shall be solely for the benefit of the Parties and no other person or
entity shall be a third-party beneficiary.

Section 10.18 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement and any amendments,
joinders, consents or supplements, may be executed in one or more counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall constitute one
and the same agreement. Scanned signatures on this Agreement shall be treated as
originals for all purposes. Executed copies of this Agreement may be delivered
by facsimile or by electronic mail in portable document format (.pdf), which
shall be deemed to be an original for the purposes of this Section 10.18.

Section 10.19 Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability at any time of
any provision hereof shall not affect or diminish in any way the continuing
validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof. If any
provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other authority of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, void or unenforceable, or the application of such provision, covenant
or restriction to any Person or any circumstance, is held by a court of
competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable,
(a) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to
carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of
such invalid or unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement
and the application of such provision, covenant or restriction to other Persons
or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability,
nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or
enforceability of such provision, or the application of such provision, in any
other jurisdiction and the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall
in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.

Section 10.20 Specific Performance. Each Party hereto recognizes and
acknowledges that a breach by it of any covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement would cause the other Parties to sustain damages for which such
Parties would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages, and
therefore each Party hereto agrees that in the sole event of any breach, the
other Parties shall be entitled to the remedy of specific performance and
injunctive or other equitable relief (including attorney’s fees and costs) to
enforce such covenants and agreements, in addition to any other remedy to which
such non-breaching Party may be entitled, at law or in equity, without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy, including an
order of the Bankruptcy Court requiring any Party to comply promptly with any of
its obligations hereunder.

Section 10.21 Conflicts. In the event the terms and conditions set forth in the
Restructuring Term Sheet and in this Agreement are inconsistent, the
Restructuring Term Sheet shall control. In the event of any conflict among the
terms and provisions of the Plan, this

 

66



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Agreement and the Restructuring Term Sheet, the terms and provisions of the Plan
shall control. In the event of any conflict among the terms and provisions of
the Confirmation Order, the Plan, this Agreement and the Restructuring Term
Sheet, the terms of the Confirmation Order shall control. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 10.21 shall affect, in any way, the
requirements that the Plan and the Confirmation Order be in all material
respects materially consistent with this Agreement and the Restructuring Term
Sheet and the requirements set forth herein for the amendment of this Agreement.

Options and Equity Incentive/Compensation Plans:

2015 Stock Incentive Plan: The Company’s 2015 Stock Incentive Plan as amended
(the “2015 Plan”) authorizes the grant of equity awards to purchase up to
5.13 million shares of Common Stock. As of June 30, 2020 approximately
1.9 million shares were reserved for issuance under outstanding stock options,
including stock options granted under equity compensation plans preceding the
2015 Plan, and approximately 730,000 shares were subject to unvested restricted
stock awards. The outstanding stock options have exercise prices ranging from
$4.71 to $175.80 and a weighted average exercise price of $10.15. There have
been no material changes to the items discussed in this paragraph as of the date
of the Agreement.

Amended and Restated 2006 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”): As of
June 30, 2020, approximately 374,000 shares of Common Stock were available for
issuance under the ESPP. There have been no material changes to such amount as
of the date of the Agreement.

2017 Inducement Stock Incentive Plan: The Board has reserved 900,000 shares of
the Company’s Common Stock for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the
2017 Inducement Stock Incentive Plan. As of June 30, 2020, approximately 218,000
shares of Common Stock were available for



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

issuance under this plan. There have been no material changes to such amount as
of the date of the Agreement.

Non-Plan Inducement Grants: In connection with its merger with TriVascular
Technologies, Inc., on February 4, 2016 the Company issued non-plan inducement
stock options to purchase 140,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of
$75.30 per share, and non-plan inducement restricted stock units for
approximately 8,000 shares of Common Stock. As of June 30, 2020, there were
non-plan inducement stock options outstanding to purchase approximately 14,000
shares of Common Stock of the Company at a weighted-average exercise price of
$20.40 per share and zero outstanding non-plan inducement restricted stock
units.

Warrants:

In connection with its merger with TriVascular Technologies, Inc. on February 3,
2016, the Company assumed unexercised out-of-the-money warrants of TriVascular
Technologies, Inc., which converted into warrants to purchase 3,508 shares of
Common Stock, 2,426 at an exercise price of $125.80 per share and 1,082 at an
exercise price of $282.10 per share.

The Company has previously issued warrants to Lenders (as defined in the
Prepetition Facility Agreement) to purchase an aggregate of 1,522,002 shares of
Common Stock of the Company at an exercise price of $6.61 per share.

On April 3, 2019, the Company issued and sold a pre-paid warrant exercisable for
the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $6.61 per share to an
investor, as contemplated pursuant to Equity Financing Documents (as defined in
the Prepetition Facility Agreement). The exercise price for the pre-paid warrant
was fully paid at issuance and is exercisable at any time until April 3, 2029,
subject to satisfaction of certain equity ownership limitations as described in
such warrant.

Convertible Notes:

2020 3.25% Convertible Notes; 2024 5.0% Convertible Senior Notes: On November 2,
2015, the Company issued $125.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25%
Convertible Notes. Pursuant to the terms of the Prepetition Facility Agreement
with Deerfield, $40.5 million of the aggregate principal amount of the 3.25%
Convertible Notes was cancelled; $84.5 million aggregate principal amount of
3.25% Convertible Notes were thereafter outstanding. At the Second Amendment
Effective Date (as defined in the Prepetition Facility Agreement), approximately
$73.4 million of the remaining $84.5 million of 3.25% Convertible Notes was
exchanged for (i) approximately $42 million of new 5.0% Voluntary Convertible
Senior Notes due 2024; and $25 million of new 5.0% Mandatory Convertible Senior
Notes due 2024. At the Fourth Amendment Effective Date (as defined in the
Prepetition Facility Agreement), approximately $11.00 million of aggregate
principal plus outstanding interest of the remaining outstanding 3.25%
Convertible Notes will be exchanged for approximately $11.1 million of new 5.0%
Voluntary Convertible Senior Notes due 2024.

Pursuant to the Prepetition Facility Agreement, the Company may issue Conversion
Shares (as defined in the Prepetition Facility Agreement) pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of the Notes (as defined in the Prepetition Facility
Agreement).

Other Rights to Securities of the Company:



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In connection with its merger with Nellix, Inc. (“Nellix”), the Company agreed
to issue shares of Common Stock to the former stockholders of Nellix upon the
Company’s receipt of FDA approval to sell its Nellix EVAS System in the United
States (the “PMA Milestone”). The number of shares of Common Stock issuable to
the former stockholders of Nellix upon achievement of the PMA Milestone shall
equal the quotient obtained by dividing $15.0 million by the average per share
closing price of Common Stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market for each of the
30 consecutive trading days ending with the fifth trading day immediately
preceding the date of the Company’s receipt of FDA approval to sell its Nellix
EVAS System in the United States, subject to a stock price floor of $45.00 per
share, but not subject to a stock price ceiling.

Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement dated as of August 9, 2018,

registration obligation)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 5.10

Litigation

(a)

Active Matters: Set forth below are certain legal matters that are either in
active litigation or could proceed to active litigation. It is possible that the
Company’s aggregate liability arising for monetary judgements or relief arising
out of these matters, and other litigation involving the Company, could be
material to the Company or its Subsidiaries, however the Company does not
believe that any one of the matters discussed below (including the AFX product
liability suits considered as a consolidated group) would individually result in
monetary judgements or relief which would be material to the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

 

  •  

Derivative Lawsuits: As of June 11, 2017, four shareholders have filed
derivative lawsuits on behalf of the Company, the nominal plaintiff, based on
allegations substantially similar to those alleged by lead plaintiff in Vicky
Nguyen v. Endologix, Inc., et al., Case No. 2:17-cv-00017 (United States
District Court, Central District of California). Those actions consist of:
Sindlinger v. McDermott et al., Case No. BC662280 (Los Angeles Superior Court);
Abraham v. McDermott et al., Case No. 30-2018-00968971-CU-BT-CSC (Orange County
Superior Court); and Green v. McDermott et al., Case No. 8:17-cv-01155-AB
(PLAx), consolidated with Cocco v. McDermott et al., Case No. 8:17-cv-01183-AB
(PLAx) (U.S. District Court for the Central District of California). Plaintiffs
in the Sindlinger, Abraham and Green derivative actions have agreed to stay
litigation pending resolution of the Nguyen action by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. A related case, Ahmed v. Endologix, Inc., et al.
(Filed January 11, 2017 in the United States District Court, Central District of
California; Case No. 8:17-cv-00061) was consolidated into Nguyen v. Endologix,
Inc.

 

  •  

Kerr: On July 30, 2019, an action was brought in United States District Court
for the Central District of California (Case No. 8:19-cv-01457) against the
Company and certain other Loan Parties by Andrew Kerr, M.D., alleging
infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,257,423, 9,050,182 and 10,105,209, which
allegedly were issued to and are owned by Dr. Kerr. As alleged in the complaint,
the accused infringing devices include the Ovation Abdominal Stent Graft System,
the Ovation Prime Abdominal Stent Graft System, the Ovation Prime, the Ovation
IX Abdominal Stent Graft System, and the Ovation iX (collectively, the “Ovation
Devices”). The Company believes plaintiff’s claims are without merit and is
vigorously defending the action.

 

  •  

AFX: The Company has been named as a defendant in a number of complaints, in
each case alleging a variety of product liability-based claims pertaining to the
Company’s AFX with Strata product. The Company believes it has insurance
responsive to these claims, which insurance provides for a $150,000 per claim
deductible and an aggregate one million dollar aggregate deductible (for the
policy year applicable to these claims). The Company believes plaintiffs’ claims
are without merit and is vigorously defending the action.

 

  •  

Kaiser: The Company has received a letter, dated January 10, 2020, from outside
counsel to KP Select, LLC, one of the Kaiser Permanent family of companies
(“Kaiser”), demanding that the Company provide reimbursement to Kaiser in the
amount of $4.1 million dollars for costs allegedly incurred by Kaiser for
treating patients whose AFX Endovascular AAA Systems were subject to the July
2018 recall notice. This demand was subsequently lowered to $2.8 million dollars
in March 2020 The Company vigorously disputes this payment demand. Since it is
presently not possible to determine the outcome of any future discussions with
Kaiser regarding this matter, and



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

whether litigation will ensue, or the outcomes associated with potential
litigation, no provision has been made in the Company’s financial statements for
the ultimate resolution.

 

  •  

Royalty Demand: The Company has received a letter, dated February 13, 2020, from
a licensor under one of the Company’s inbound patent license agreements alleging
that the Company is in breach of certain royalty payment obligations under such
agreement. In this letter, licensor has expressed a desire to reach a reasonable
and amicable resolution of this matter. The Company vigorously disagrees with
this payment demand. Since it is presently not possible to determine the outcome
of any future discussions with the licensor regarding this matter, and whether
litigation will ensue, or the outcomes associated with potential litigation, no
provision has been made in the Company’s financial statements at this time for
the ultimate resolution. Should a bona fide dispute ensure, it is possible that

Other IP Infringement Notice: The Loan Parties have received notice from an
individual claiming that certain of our products read on certain issued patents
held by such individual. The Loan Parties, after consultation with independent
patent counsel, strongly disagrees with these claims. Since it is presently not
possible to determine the outcome of any future discussions with these
individuals in regard to their patents, and whether litigation will ensue, or
the outcomes associated with potential litigation, no provision has been made in
the Company’s financial statements for the ultimate resolution.
