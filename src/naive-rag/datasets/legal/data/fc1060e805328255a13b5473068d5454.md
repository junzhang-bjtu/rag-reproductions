conversion, continuation or prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan, an amount,
such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such
Borrowing, Eurocurrency Rate Loan is denominated in an Alternative Currency,

(a)           The Borrower may from time to time request that Eurocurrency Rate
Loans be made in a currency other than those specifically listed in the

discretion, to the making of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in such requested currency.

 

(c)           Any failure by a Lender to respond to such request within the time
period specified in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a refusal by
such Lender to permit Eurocurrency Rate Loans to be made in such requested
currency. If the Administrative Agent and all the Lenders consent to making
Eurocurrency Rate Loans in such requested currency, the Administrative Agent
shall so notify the Borrower and such currency shall thereupon be deemed for all
purposes to be an Alternative Currency hereunder for purposes of any Borrowings
of Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If the Administrative Agent shall fail to obtain

to the currency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of interest
expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent
with any convention or practice in the London interbank market for the basis of
accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be
replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on which such
member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency; provided that if any
Borrowing in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior
to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such
Borrowing, at the end of the then current Interest Period.

 

(b)           Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such

time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member
state of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices

termination of the obligations under the Original Credit Agreement and that all
such obligations are in all respects continued and outstanding as Obligations
under this Agreement except to the extent such Obligations are modified from and
after the Restatement Date as provided in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

2.02        Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans.

 

(a)           Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to the
other, and each continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be made upon the
Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by
(A) telephone, or (B) a Loan Notice; provided that any telephonic notice must be
confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Loan Notice.
Each such Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later
than noon (i) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing
of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in
Dollars or of any conversion of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars
to Base Rate Loans, (ii) four Business Days (or five Business Days in the case
of a Special Notice Currency) prior to the requested date of any Borrowing or
continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies,
and (iii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans; provided,
however, that if the Borrower wishes to request Eurocurrency Rate Loans having
an Interest Period other than one, two, three or six months in duration as
provided in the definition of “Interest Period,” the applicable notice must be
received by the Administrative Agent not later than noon (i) four Business Days
prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, or (ii) five Business Days (or
six Business Days in the case of a Special Notice Currency) prior to the
requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation of Eurocurrency
Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, whereupon the Administrative
Agent shall give prompt notice to the Lenders of such request and determine
whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all of them. Not later
than noon (i) three Business Days before the requested date of such Borrowing,
conversion or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, or
(ii) four Business Days (or five Business days in the case of a Special Notice
Currency) prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or
continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies,
the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower (which notice may be by
telephone) whether or not the requested Interest Period has been consented to by
all the Lenders. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Borrowing of or conversion to
Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple
of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each Loan Notice shall specify (i) whether the
Borrower is requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the
other, or a continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of
the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a
Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or
continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing Loans are
to be converted, (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with
respect thereto, and (vi) the currency of the Loans to be borrowed. If the
Borrower fails to specify a currency in a Loan Notice, then the Loans so
requested shall be made in Dollars. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of
Loan in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice
requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made
as, or converted to, Base Rate Loans; provided, however, that in the case of a
failure to timely request a continuation of Loans denominated in an Alternative
Currency, such Loans shall be continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans in their
original currency with an Interest Period of one month. Any automatic conversion
to Base Rate Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period
then in effect with respect to the applicable Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If the
Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Eurocurrency
Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it
will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month. No Loan may be
converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency, but
instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in
the other currency.

 

 24 

 



 

(b)           Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender in writing of the amount (and currency) of its
Applicable Percentage of the applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a
conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent
shall notify each Lender in writing of the details of any automatic conversion
to Base Rate Loans or continuation of Loans denominated in a currency other than
Dollars, in each case as described in the preceding subsection. In the case of a
Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the
Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds at the Administrative Agent’s Office for
the applicable currency not later than 1:00 p.m., in the case of any Loan
denominated in Dollars (or in the case of Base Rate Loans, 2:00 p.m.), and not
later than 1:00 p.m. in the place of payment specified by the Administrative
Agent in the case of any Loan in an Alternative Currency, in each case on the
Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice. Upon satisfaction or
waiver of the applicable conditions set forth in Section 4.02 (and, if such
Borrowing is the initial Borrowing, Section 4.01), the Administrative Agent
shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower in like funds as
received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting the account of the
Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or
(ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with instructions
provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent by the
Borrower.

 

(c)           Except as otherwise provided herein, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan may
be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such
Eurocurrency Rate Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans may be
requested as, converted to or continued as Eurocurrency Rate Loans (whether in
Dollars or any Alternative Currency) without the consent of the Required
Lenders, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the then
outstanding Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency be
prepaid, or redenominated into Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent
thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect
thereto.

 

(d)           The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and
the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for
Eurocurrency Rate Loans upon determination of such interest rate. At any time
that Base Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Borrower and the Lenders of any change in Bank of America’s prime rate used in
determining the Base Rate promptly following the public announcement of such
change.

 

(e)           After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans
from one Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type,
there shall not be more than eight Interest Periods in effect with respect to
Loans.

 

2.03        Prepayments.

 

(a)           The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent pursuant
to delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Notice of Loan Prepayment, at any
time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Loans in whole or in part without
premium or penalty; provided that (i) such notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than noon (A) three Business Days prior to any
date of prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, (B) four
Business Days (or five, in the case of prepayment of Loans denominated in
Special Notice Currencies) prior to any date of prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate
Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies, and (C) one Business Day prior to
any date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; and (ii) any prepayment of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars shall be in a principal amount of
$1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; (iii) any
prepayment of Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies
shall be in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iv) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall
be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof
then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such
prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if Eurocurrency Rate
Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each
such notice, and of the amount of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such
prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make
such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date specified therein; provided that if such prepayment is to be
made from the proceeds of another transaction that will result in the
refinancing of all of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement,
then such prepayment may be conditioned upon the closing of such refinancing
transaction. Any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall be accompanied by
all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts
required pursuant to Section 3.05. Subject to Section 2.14, each such prepayment
shall be applied to the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Applicable Percentages.

 



 25 

 

 

(b)           If the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower at any time that
the Total Outstandings at such time exceed an amount equal to 105% of the
Aggregate Commitments then in effect, then, within two Business Days after
receipt of such notice, the Borrower shall prepay Loans in an aggregate amount
sufficient to reduce such Outstanding Amount as of such date of payment to an
amount not to exceed 100% of the Aggregate Commitments then in effect.

 

2.04        Termination or Reduction of Commitments.

 

(a)           The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent,
terminate the Aggregate Commitments, or from time to time permanently reduce the
Aggregate Commitments in whole or in part; provided that (i) any such notice
shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than noon three Business
Days prior to the date of termination or reduction, (ii) any such partial
reduction shall be in an aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or any whole multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof, and (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or
reduce the Aggregate Commitments if, after giving effect thereto and to any
concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total Outstandings would exceed the
Aggregate Commitments. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders
of any such notice of termination or reduction of the Aggregate Commitments. Any
reduction of the Aggregate Commitments shall be applied to the Commitment of
each Lender according to its Applicable Percentage. All fees accrued until the
effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Commitments shall be paid on
the effective date of such termination. A notice of termination of the
Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned
upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may
be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to
the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.

 

(b)           The Borrower shall have the right, at any time, upon at least
three Business Days’ notice to a Defaulting Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), to terminate in whole such Defaulting Lender’s Commitment
under this Section 2.04(b). The Borrower will pay an amount equal to 100% of the
outstanding principal of such Defaulting Lender’s Loans, accrued interest
thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to such Defaulting Lender
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and upon such payments, the
obligations of such Defaulting Lender hereunder shall, by the provisions hereof,
be released and discharged; provided, however, that (i) such Defaulting Lender’s
rights under Section 3.04 shall survive such release and discharge as to matters
occurring prior to such date and (ii) no claim that the Borrower may have
against such Defaulting Lender arising out of such Defaulting Lender’s default
hereunder shall be released or impaired in any way. The aggregate amount of the
Commitments of the Lenders once reduced pursuant to this Section 2.04(b) may not
be reinstated.

 

2.05        Repayment of Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the
Maturity Date the aggregate principal amount of Loans outstanding on such date.
All Loans must be repaid in the same currency in which made.

 

 26 

 



 

2.06        Interest.

 



(a)           Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each
Eurocurrency Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount
thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency
Rate for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate; and (ii) each Base Rate
Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the
applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Rate.

 

(b)         (i)         If any amount of principal of any Loan is not paid when
due (without regard to any applicable grace periods), whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, such amount shall thereafter bear
interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws so long as such
amount has not been paid.

 

(ii)            In the event of the occurrence of an Event of Default under
Section 8.01(h), the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all
outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at
all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Laws so long as such Event of Default is continuing.

 

(iii)           If any amount (other than principal of any Loan) payable by the
Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (without regard to any
applicable grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders, such amount shall
thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times
equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws so
long as such amount has not been paid.

 

(iv)           Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of
Default exists (other than as set forth in clauses (b)(i), (b)(ii) and
(b)(iii) above), the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all
outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at
all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Laws so long as such Event of Default is continuing.

 

(v)            Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including
interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.

 

(c)            Interest on each Loan shall be due and payable in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at such other times as may be
specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with
the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

 

2.07        Fees.

 

(a)            Facility Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of each Lender in accordance with its Applicable Percentage, a
facility fee in Dollars equal to the Applicable Rate times the actual daily
amount of the Aggregate Commitments (or, if the Aggregate Commitments have
terminated, on the Outstanding Amount of all Loans), regardless of usage,
subject to adjustment as provided in Section 2.14. The facility fee shall accrue
at all times during the Availability Period (and thereafter so long as any Loans
remain outstanding), including at any time during which one or more of the
conditions in Article IV is not met, and shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on the first Business Day of each January, April, July and October,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the Restatement Date, and on
the last day of the Availability Period (and, if applicable, thereafter on
demand). The facility fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if there
is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the actual daily amount
shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately for each
period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was in effect.

 

 27 

 



 

(b)           Other Fees. The Borrower shall pay to each Arranger and the
Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts, in Dollars, fees in the
amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letters. Such fees shall be fully
earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.

 

2.08        Computation of Interest and Fees. All computations of interest for
Base Rate Loans (including when the Base Rate Loan is determined by reference to
the Eurocurrency Rate) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days,
as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and
interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed
(which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if
computed on the basis of a 365-day year), or, in the case of interest in respect
of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which market practice
differs from the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice. Interest
shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not
accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such
portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which
it is made shall, subject to Section 2.10(a), bear interest for one day. Each
determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

 

2.09        Evidence of Debt.

 

The Borrowings made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or
records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the
ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error
of the amount of the Borrowings made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the
interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so
shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower
hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event
of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and
the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters,
the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the
absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made through the
Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender
(through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall evidence such Lender’s
Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules
to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount, currency
and maturity of its Loans and payments with respect thereto.

 

2.10        Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback.

 

(a)            General. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made
free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim,
defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein and
except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an
Alternative Currency, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to
the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which
such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars
and in Same Day Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower
hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an
Alternative Currency shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account
of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable
Administrative Agent’s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day Funds
not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the
dates specified herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent may require that any payments due under this Agreement be
made in the United States. If, for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by any
Law from making any required payment hereunder in an Alternative Currency, the
Borrower shall make such payment in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the
Alternative Currency payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly
distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share
as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer
to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative
Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the
Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments in
an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next
succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to
accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other
than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day,
and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as
the case may be.

 

 28 

 



 

(b)         (i)         Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent.
All payments to be made by a Lender to the Administrative Agent shall be made
free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim,
defense, recoupment or setoff. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have
received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans,
prior to 1:00 p.m. on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available
on such date in accordance with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of
Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance
with and at the time required by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such
event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing
available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the
Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand
such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day
from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of
a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any
administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the
Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a
payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate
Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the
Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative
Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by
the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable
Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute
such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall
be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that
shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

 

(ii)            Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent.
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Lenders that the Borrower will not make such payment, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such
date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not
in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to
the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender, in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including
the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment
to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight Rate.

 

A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect
to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error.

 

 29 

 



 

(c)            Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes
available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such
Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such
funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because
the conditions to the applicable Borrowing set forth in Article IV are not
satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative
Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to
such Lender, without interest.

 

(d)            Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders
hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are
several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any
payment under Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve
any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no
Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its
Loan or to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).

 

(e)            Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any
Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to
constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain
the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.

 

2.11         Sharing of Payments by Lenders. If any Lender shall, by exercising
any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of
any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such
Lender’s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans
and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided
herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the
Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments
as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared
by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of
and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them,
provided that:

 

(i)            if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and
all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and

 

(ii)           the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to
(x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in
accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application
of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), or (y) any payment
obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a
participation in any of its Loans, other than an assignment to the Borrower or
any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply)

 

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under Applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of
such participation.

 



 30 

 

 

2.12         Extension of Maturity Date.

 

Commencing with the second anniversary of the Restatement Date, the Borrower
may, upon not less than 30 days’ (but not more than 45 days’) notice prior to
such second anniversary of the Restatement Date and each anniversary of the
Restatement Date thereafter (each such anniversary, “Current Anniversary Date”)
to the Administrative Agent (which shall notify each Lender of receipt of such
request), propose to extend the Maturity Date for an additional one-year period
measured from the Maturity Date. Each Lender shall endeavor to respond to such
request, whether affirmatively or negatively (such determination to be in the
sole discretion of such Lender), by notice to the Administrative Agent in
writing not less than 20 days (but not more than 30 days) prior to the Current
Anniversary Date. The Administrative Agent shall, upon not less than 15 days’
notice prior to the Current Anniversary Date, notify the Borrower in writing of
the Lenders’ decisions. No Maturity Date of any Lender shall be extended unless
(i) by the date 20 days prior to the Maturity Date then in effect Banks having
at least 50% in aggregate amount of the Commitments in effect at the time any
such extension is requested shall have elected so to extend their Commitments
and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate signed by a
Designated Officer dated as of such extension date in form and substance
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent stating that the representations and
warranties contained in Article V and the other Loan Documents are true and
correct in all material respects on and as of such date, except to the extent
that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an earlier date,
in which case they are true and correct in all material respects as of such
earlier date, and except that for purposes of this Section 2.12, the
representations and warranties contained in Section 5.05 shall be deemed to
refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to subsections (a) and
(b) of Section 6.01 and the representations and warranties contained in
Section 5.06 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent financial statements
furnished pursuant to subsection (b) of Section 6.01, and that no Default has
occurred and is continuing. Any Lender which does not give such notice to the
Administrative Agent by the date 20 days prior to the Maturity Date then in
effect shall be deemed to have elected not to extend as requested, and the
Commitment of each non-extending Lender shall terminate on its Maturity Date
determined without giving effect to such requested extension. If any Lender does
not consent to a request for an extension of the Maturity Date, or is deemed not
to have consented to the requested extension (each, a “Declining Lender”), and
the Maturity Date has been extended for the other Lender(s) (the “Extending
Lenders”), the Borrower may, prior to the end of the Current Anniversary Date,
replace such Declining Lender in accordance with Section 10.13 with one or more
Eligible Assignees or increase the Commitment of an Extending Lender, in an
amount equal to the amount of the Commitments of the Declining Lenders, provided
that, as provided in Section 2.13, the Extending Lenders shall have the right to
increase their Commitments ratably up to the amount of the Declining Lenders’
Commitments before the Borrower will be permitted to substitute any other
financial institution for the Declining Lenders.

 

2.13         Increase in Commitments.

 

(a)            After the Restatement Date, the Borrower may, upon at least
thirty (30) days’ notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly
provide a copy of such notice to the Lenders), propose to increase the amount of
the Commitments in an aggregate minimum amount of $25,000,000 and an aggregate
maximum amount for all increases pursuant to this Section 2.13 not to exceed
$400,000,000 (the amount of any such increase, the “Increased Commitments”)
provided that (i) the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate
signed by a Designated Officer dated as of the date of such increase (the
“Increase Effective Date”) in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent stating that (x) the representations and warranties
contained in Article V are true and correct in all material respects on and as
of such date, except to the extent that such representations and warranties
specifically refer to an earlier date, in which case they are true and correct
in all material respects as of such earlier date, and except that for purposes
of this Section 2.13, the representations and warranties contained in
Section 5.05 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished
pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of Section 6.01 and the representations and
warranties contained in Section 5.06 shall be deemed to refer to the most recent
financial statements furnished pursuant to subsection (b) of Section 6.01 and
(y) no Default has occurred and is continuing and (ii)(x) upon the reasonable
request of any Lender or Additional Lender providing the Increased Commitments,
made at least five days prior to the Increase Effective Date, the Borrower shall
have provided to such Lender or Additional Lender, as applicable, and such
Lender or Additional Lender, as applicable, shall be reasonably satisfied with,
the documentation and other information so requested in connection with
applicable “know your customer” and anti-money-laundering rules and regulations,
including, without limitation, the Act, in each case at least two days prior to
the Increase Effective Date and (y) at least two days prior to the Increase
Effective Date, if the Borrower qualifies as a “legal entity customer” under the
Beneficial Ownership Regulation, then the Borrower shall have delivered, to each
Lender that so requests a Beneficial Ownership Certification.

 



 31 

 

 

(b)            The Borrower may offer the Increased Commitments to: (i) any
Lender party to this Agreement; provided, that any Lender offered an Increased
Commitment shall have no obligation to accept such Increased Commitment; or
(ii) any other Eligible Assignee acceptable to the Administrative Agent and
which agrees to become a party to this Agreement (an “Additional Lender”);
provided that the Commitment of each such Lender or Additional Lender equals or
exceeds $10,000,000. The sum of (1) the aggregate amount of Commitment increases
of any existing Lenders pursuant to this subsection (b) plus (2) the aggregate
amount of any Commitments of Additional Lenders shall not in the aggregate
exceed the total amount of the Increased Commitments.

 

(c)            An increase in the aggregate amount of the Commitments pursuant
to this Section 2.13 shall become effective upon the receipt by the
Administrative Agent of an agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent signed by the Borrower, by each Additional Lender and by
each other Lender whose Commitment is to be increased, setting forth the new
Commitments of such Lenders and setting forth the agreement of each Additional
Lender to become a party to this Agreement and to be bound by all the terms and
provisions hereof, together with such evidence of appropriate corporate
authorization on the part of the Borrower with respect to the Increased
Commitments and such opinions of counsel for the Borrower with respect to the
Increased Commitments as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request.

 

2.14         Defaulting Lenders. (a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender,
to the extent permitted by Applicable Law:

 

(i)            Waivers and Amendments. Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve
or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement
shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of “Required Lenders” and
Section 10.01.

 

(ii)           Defaulting Lender Waterfall. Any payment of principal, interest,
fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of
such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to
Article VIII or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a
Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08, shall be applied at such time or
times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the
payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative
Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default
exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender
has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as
determined by the Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower, to be held in a deposit account and
released pro rata in order to satisfy such Defaulting Lender’s potential future
funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the
payment of any amounts owing to the other Lenders as a result of any judgment of
a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting
Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under
this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the
payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting
Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under
this Agreement; and sixth, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by
a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if (x) such payment is a
payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting
Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made
at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or
waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all
Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment
of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by
the Lenders pro rata in accordance with the Commitments hereunder. Any payments,
prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are
applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this
Section 2.14(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting
Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

 



 32 

 

 

(iii)          Certain Fees. No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive
fees payable under Section 2.07(a) for any period during which that Lender is a
Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to pay any such fee
that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting
Lender).

 

(b)            Defaulting Lender Cure. If the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent agree in their sole discretion in writing that a Lender is no longer a
Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto,
whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any
conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable,
purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take
such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to
cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with
their Applicable Percentages, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a
Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will be made retroactively with
respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while
that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and provided, further, that except to the
extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder
from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any
claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting
Lender.

 

ARTICLE III. TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

 

3.01         Taxes.

 

(a)            Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on
Account of Taxes. (i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of
the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or
withholding for any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Laws. If any
Applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Withholding
Agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by
the Withholding Agent or the Borrower, then the Withholding Agent or Borrower
shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding.

 

(ii)          If Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by the
Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal
backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the
Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions, (B) the
Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to
the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the
extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified
Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that
after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it
would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.

 



 33 

 

 

(iii)         If Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by any
Applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any
payment, then (A) Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as required by such
Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions, (B) Borrower or the Administrative
Agent, to the extent required by such Laws, shall timely pay the full amount
withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on
account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by Borrower shall be increased as
necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required
deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under
this Section 3.01) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum
it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

 

(b)            Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower. Without limiting the
provisions of subsection (a) above, the Borrower shall timely pay any Other
Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Laws.

 

(c)            Tax Indemnifications. (i) The Borrower shall, and does hereby,
indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10
days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes
(including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts
payable under this Section 3.01) payable or paid by such Recipient or required
to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any reasonable
expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such
Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of any such payment or
liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on
behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

 

(ii)          Each Lender shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof
within 10 days after demand therefor, against (x) any Indemnified Taxes
attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not
already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and
without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (y) any Taxes
attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of
Section 10.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and
(z) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are
payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower in connection with
any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect
thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted
by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such
payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall
be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the
Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing
to such Lender, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause
(ii).

 

(d)            Evidence of Payments. As soon as practicable after any payment of
Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority as provided in this
Section 3.01, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the
original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority
evidencing such payment, a copy of any return required by Laws to report such
payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent.

 



 34 

 

 

(e)            Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation.

 

(i)           Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times
reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly
completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding
or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other
documentation prescribed by Applicable Law or reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to
backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion,
execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation
set forth in Section 3.01(e)(ii)(A), (e)(ii)(B) and (e)(ii)(D) below) shall not
be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or
submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or
expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such
Lender.

 

(ii)          Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event
that the Borrower is a U.S. Borrower,

 

(A)            any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender
becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the
reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed
originals of IRS Form W-9 (or any successor form) certifying that such Lender is
exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;

 

(B)            any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to
do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of
copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which
such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

 

(I)            in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an
income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, (x) with respect to
payments of interest under any Loan Document, executed originals of IRS
Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any successor form) establishing an exemption from,
or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article
of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under
any Loan Document, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any successor form)
establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax
pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;

 

(II)           executed originals of IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor form);

 

(III)          in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the
exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a
certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit E-1 to the effect that such
Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation”
described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “U.S. Tax Compliance
Certificate”) and (y) executed originals of IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any
successor form); or

 



 35 

 

 

(IV)          to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner,
executed originals of IRS Form W-8IMY (or any successor form), accompanied by
IRS Form W-8ECI (or any successor form), IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or any
successor form), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit E-2 or Exhibit E-3, IRS Form W-9 (or any successor form), and/or other
certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable; provided that
if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect
partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption,
such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially
in the form of Exhibit E-4 on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;

 

(C)            any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to
do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of
copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which
such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative
Agent), executed originals of any other form prescribed by Applicable Laws as a
basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding
Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be
prescribed by Applicable Law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent
to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and

 

(D)            if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be
subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to
fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including
those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such
Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or
times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by Applicable
Laws (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such
additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such
Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine
the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of
this Agreement.

 

(iii)         Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously
delivered pursuant to this Section 3.01 expires or becomes obsolete or
inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or
promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its
legal inability to do so.

 

(f)            Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by Applicable Laws,
at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or
otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any
Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account
of such Lender. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its
sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any
Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to
which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section 3.01, it
shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent
of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under
this Section 3.01 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of
all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) and without interest (other than
any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative
Agent or such Lender agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus
any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the
Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any
amount to the Borrower pursuant to this subsection (f) the payment of which
would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such
Recipient would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional
amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid. This subsection
(f) shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to
make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes
that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

 



 36 

 

 

(g)            Survival. Each party’s obligations under this Section 3.01 shall
survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any
assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the
Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other
Obligations.

 

(h)            Defined Terms. For purposes of this Section 3.01, the term
“Applicable Law” includes FATCA.

 

3.02         Illegality. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans
whose interest is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate (whether
denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency), or to determine or charge
interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate, or any Governmental Authority
has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or
sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Alternative Currency in the
applicable interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the
Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation of such Lender to
make or continue Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected currency or currencies
or, in the case of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in Dollars, to convert Base Rate
Loans to Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice
asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining the Base Rate Loans
the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate
component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such
Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the
Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the
Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer
exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from
such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable
and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Rate Loans
of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of
such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the
Administrative Agent without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate component of the
Base Rate), either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such
Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Rate Loans to such
day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such
Eurocurrency Rate Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such
Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate,
the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the
Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Eurocurrency Rate
component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such
Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge
interest rates based upon the Eurocurrency Rate. Upon any such prepayment or
conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so
prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.05.

 



 37 

 

 

3.03         Inability to Determine Rates.

 

(a)            If in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or
a conversion to or continuation thereof, (i) the Administrative Agent reasonably
determines that (A) deposits (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) are
not being offered to banks in the applicable offshore interbank market for such
currency for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such Eurocurrency Rate
Loan, or (B) (x) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the
Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Eurocurrency Rate Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate
Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) and (y) the
circumstances described in Section 3.03(c)(i) do not apply (in each case with
respect to this clause (i), “Impacted Loans”), or (ii) the Administrative Agent
or the Required Lenders reasonably determine that for any reason the
Eurocurrency Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed
Eurocurrency Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Lenders of funding such Eurocurrency Rate Loan, the Administrative Agent will
promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation
of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected
currency or currencies shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected
Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a
determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the
Eurocurrency Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the
Eurocurrency Rate component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in
each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by
the Required Lenders described in clause (ii) of Section 3.03(a), until the
Administrative Agent upon the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such
notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request
for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in
the affected currency or currencies (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency
Rate Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have
converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the
amount specified therein.

 

(b)            Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has
made the determination described in clause (i) of Section 3.03(a), the
Administrative Agent, in consultation with the Borrower, may establish an
alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such
alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans
until (1) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to
the Impacted Loans under clause (i) of the first sentence of this Section,
(2) the Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that
such alternative interest rate does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost
to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or (3) any Lender reasonably
determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority
has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its applicable Lending
Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is determined by reference
to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or charge interest rates
based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has imposed material
restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the foregoing and
provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice thereof.

 

(c)            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any
other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or
Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the
Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Lenders
(as applicable) have determined that:

 

(i)           adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR
for any requested Interest Period, including, without limitation, because the
LIBOR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis and such
circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or

 



 38 

 

 

(ii)          the administrator of the LIBOR Screen Rate or a Governmental
Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent has made a public
statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR or the LIBOR Screen Rate
shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest rate of
loans, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is no successor
administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will
continue to provide LIBOR after such specific date (such specific date, the
“Scheduled Unavailability Date”); or

 

(iii)         syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include
language similar to that contained in this Section, are being executed or
amended (as applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to
replace LIBOR;

 

then, reasonably promptly after such determination by the Administrative Agent
or receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, as applicable, the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the
purpose of replacing LIBOR in accordance with this Section 3.03 with (x) for
Loans denominated in Dollars, one or more SOFR-Based Rates or (y) another
alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then
existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities (whether in Dollars
or an Alternative Currency) for such alternative benchmarks and, in each case,
including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due
consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated
credit facilities (whether in Dollars or an Alternative Currency) for such
benchmarks, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be
published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from
time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated (the
“Adjustment;” and any such proposed rate, a “LIBOR Successor Rate”), and any
such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day
after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all
Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the
Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that
such Required Lenders (A) in the case of an amendment to replace LIBOR with a
rate described in clause (x), object to the Adjustment; or (B) in the case of an
amendment to replace LIBOR with a rate described in clause (y), object to such
amendment; provided that for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of clause (A),
the Required Lenders shall not be entitled to object to any SOFR-Based Rate
contained in any such amendment. Such LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a
manner consistent with market practice; provided that to the extent such market
practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such
LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably
determined by the Administrative Agent.

 

If no LIBOR Successor Rate has been determined and the circumstances under
clause (i) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as
applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and
each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain
Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected
Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) the Eurocurrency Rate
component shall no longer be utilized in determining the Base Rate. Upon receipt
of such notice, the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of,
conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans in the affected
currency or currencies (to the extent of the affected Eurocurrency Rate Loans or
Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such
request into a request for a Committed Borrowing of Base Rate Loans (subject to
the foregoing clause (y)) in the amount specified therein.

 

Notwithstanding anything else herein, any definition of LIBOR Successor Rate
shall provide that in no event shall such LIBOR Successor Rate be less than zero
for purposes of this Agreement.

 

In connection with the implementation of a LIBOR Successor Rate, the
Administrative Agent will have the right to make LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming
Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such LIBOR Successor
Rate Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or
consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any
such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment
implementing such LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes to the Lenders
reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.

 



 39 

 

 

3.04         Increased Costs; Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans.

 

(a)            Increased Costs Generally. If any Change in Law shall:

 

(i)           impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit,
compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of,
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by,
any Lender (except any reserve requirement contemplated by Section 3.04(e));

 

(ii)          subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified
Taxes or (B) Excluded Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit,
commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities
or capital attributable thereto; or

 

(iii)         impose on any Lender or the London interbank market any other
condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or
Eurocurrency Rate Loans made by such Lender;

 

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan the interest
of which is determined by reference to the Eurocurrency Rate (or of maintaining
its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest
or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to
such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered; provided that such costs
are not being imposed on the Borrower disproportionately in comparison with the
general treatment of other similarly situated borrowers to which such Lender has
extended credit.

 

(b)            Capital Requirements. If any Lender determines that any Change in
Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender or such Lender’s
holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or
on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of
this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender,
to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could
have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such
Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect
to capital adequacy or liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay
to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender
or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.

 

(c)            Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting
forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding
company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this
Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

 

(d)            Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to
demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section shall
not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation,
provided that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant
to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or
reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender
notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs
or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor
(except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or
reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be
extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).

 



 40 

 

 

(e)            Reserves on Eurocurrency Rate Loans. The Borrower shall pay to
each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to maintain reserves
with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including Eurocurrency
funds or deposits (currently known as “Eurocurrency liabilities”), additional
interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurocurrency Rate Loan equal to
the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by such Lender (as
determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination shall be
conclusive), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to comply with
any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any central banking or
financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the maintenance of the
Commitments or the funding of the Eurocurrency Rate Loans, such additional costs
(expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the
nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such
Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith,
which determination shall be conclusive), which in each case shall be due and
payable on each date on which such interest or cost is payable on or with
respect to such Loan, provided the Borrower shall have received at least 10
days’ prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional
interest or costs from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days
prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs
shall be due and payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.

 

3.05         Compensation for Losses. Upon written demand of any Lender (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time, which written demand shall
set forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts as necessary to compensate
such Lender as specified in this Section 3.05 and be delivered to the Borrower
and shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error, the Borrower shall
promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any
documented loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:

 

(a)            any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan
other than a Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest
Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of
acceleration, or otherwise);

 

(b)            any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure
of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan
other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the
Borrower;

 

(c)            any failure by the Borrower to make payment of any Loan (or
interest due thereon) denominated in an Alternative Currency on its scheduled
due date or any payment thereof in a different currency; or

 

(d)            any assignment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan on a day other than
the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 10.13;

 

including any foreign exchange losses and any loss or expense arising from the
liquidation or reemployment of funds (but excluding any loss of anticipated
profits) obtained by it to maintain such Loan, from fees payable to terminate
the deposits from which such funds were obtained or from the performance of any
foreign exchange contract entered into in connection with the Loans. The
Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender
in connection with the foregoing.

 



 41 

 

 

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency
Rate Loan made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching
deposit or other borrowing in the offshore interbank market for such currency
for a comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such
Eurocurrency Rate Loan was in fact so funded.

 

3.06         Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

 

(a)            Designation of a Different Lending Office. Each Lender may make
any Loan to the Borrower through any Lending Office, provided that the exercise
of this option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loan
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If any Lender requests
compensation under Section 3.04, or the Borrower is required to pay any
Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental
Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01, or if any
Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 3.02, then at the request of the
Borrower such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different
Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its
rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment
(i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.04,
as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant
to Section 3.02, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such
Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

 

(b)            Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or
additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account
of any Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 and, in each case, such Lender has
declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with
Section 3.06(a), the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with
Section 10.13.

 

3.07         Survival. All of the Borrower’s obligations under this Article III
shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment of all other
Obligations hereunder, and resignation of the Administrative Agent.

be deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with,
each document or other matter required thereunder to be consented to or approved
by or acceptable or satisfactory to a Lender unless the Administrative Agent
shall have received notice from such Lender prior to the proposed Restatement
Date specifying its objection thereto.

financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange rates or
exchange controls which in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent or
the Required Lenders (in the case of any Loans to be denominated in an
Alternative Currency) would make it impracticable for such Borrowing to be
denominated in the relevant Alternative Currency.

 

Each Loan Notice (other than a Loan Notice requesting only a conversion of Loans
to the other Type or a continuation of Eurocurrency Rate Loans) submitted by the
Borrower shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty that the conditions
specified in Sections 4.02(a) and (b) have been satisfied on and as of the date
of the applicable Borrowing.

and in good standing under the laws of Delaware. The Borrower is duly qualified
or registered to transact business in California and each other jurisdiction in
which the conduct of its business or the ownership of its properties make such
qualification or registration necessary, except where the failure so to qualify
or register would not have a Material Adverse Effect. The Borrower has all
requisite corporate power and authority to (i) conduct its business, (ii) own
and lease its properties and (iii) execute, deliver and perform all of its
obligations under the Loan Documents, except in each case referred to in clauses
(i) and (ii), to the extent that failure to do so would not have a Material
Adverse Effect.

 

(b)            All outstanding shares of capital stock of the Borrower are duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid, nonassessable, and issued in compliance
with all applicable state and federal securities and other Laws.

requirements applicable to its business, has obtained all authorizations,
consents, approvals, orders, licenses and permits from, and has accomplished all

transaction of its business, except where the failure to be in such compliance,
obtain such authorizations, consents, approvals, orders, licenses, and permits,

any provision of the Borrower’s Organization Documents; (c) conflict with or

provision of any Laws (including without limitation Regulation U of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System), order, writ, judgment, injunction,
decree, determination, or award presently in effect having applicability to the
Borrower, in each case under clauses (c)(ii) and (d) in a way that would have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.03         No Governmental Approvals Required. No authorization, consent,
approval, order, license or permit from, or filing, registration, or
qualification with, notice to or exemption from any of the foregoing from any
Governmental Authority or any other Person is or will be necessary or required

states whether each is or is not a Consolidated Subsidiary. Except for shares of
capital stock or partnership interests in a Subsidiary required by Applicable
Laws to be held by a director or comparable official of that Subsidiary and
unless otherwise indicated in Schedule 5.04 or where the failure to own all of
the shares of capital stock or partnership interests in such Subsidiary would
have a Material Adverse Effect, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock
or partnership interests of each Subsidiary are owned beneficially by the
Borrower, and, to the knowledge of the Borrower, all securities and interests so
owned are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable, and
issued in compliance with all applicable state and federal securities and other
Laws, and are free and clear of all Liens and Rights of Others.

 

(b)            Each Subsidiary is a corporation or other legal entity duly
formed, validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of formation, is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the

except where the failure to be so duly qualified and in good standing would have
a Material Adverse Effect, and has all requisite legal power and authority to
(i) conduct its business and (ii) own and lease its properties, except in the
cases of clause (i) and (ii), where the failure to do so would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(c)            Each Subsidiary is in compliance with all Laws and other legal
requirements applicable to its business and has obtained all authorizations,
consents, approvals, orders, licenses, and permits from, and has accomplished
all filings, registrations, and qualifications with, or obtained exemptions from
any of the foregoing from, any Governmental Authority that are necessary for the
transaction of its business, except where the failure to be in such compliance,
obtain such authorizations, consents, approvals, orders, licenses, and permits,
accomplish such filings, registrations, and qualifications, or obtain such
exemptions, would have a Material Adverse Effect.

following financial statements: (i) the consolidated balance sheet of the
Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 29, 2018, and the
related consolidated statements of income, Shareholders’ Equity and changes in
financial position for the year then ended, together with the report of
PricewaterhouseCoopers on such financial statements and (ii) the condensed
consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as
at September 28, 2019, and the related condensed consolidated statements of
income and changes in financial position for the year-to-date then ended. The

of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries, (ii) were prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the periods covered thereby
and (iii) fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial
condition and results of operations of the Borrower and the Consolidated
Subsidiaries as at the dates and for the periods covered thereby, except as
otherwise expressly noted therein and in the case of the condensed consolidated
balance sheet of the Borrower and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as at
September 28, 2019, subject only to normal year-end audit adjustments and the
absence of footnotes.

 

5.06         No Material Adverse Change or Other Liabilities. Since December 29,
2018, there has been no event or circumstance that has had a Material Adverse
Effect. The Borrower and the Consolidated Subsidiaries do not have any material
liability or material contingent liability required to be reflected or disclosed
in the financial statements or notes thereto described in Section 5.05 which is
not so reflected or disclosed.

 

5.07         Title to Assets. The Borrower has good and valid title to all of
the assets reflected in the financial statements described in Section 5.05
(except for assets that are sold in transactions that are not prohibited by the
terms of this Agreement) free and clear of all Liens and Rights of Others other
than (a) those reflected or disclosed in such financial statements or notes
thereto, (b) immaterial Liens or Rights of Others not required under GAAP to be
so reflected or disclosed, and (c) Liens or Rights of Others permitted pursuant
to Section 7.02.

 

5.08         Regulated Industries. Neither the Borrower, any Person
“controlling” (as such term is defined in the definition of “Affiliate”) the
Borrower, nor any Subsidiary is or is required to be registered as an
“investment company” under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

 

5.09         Litigation. There are no actions, suits, proceedings or
investigations pending or, to the Borrower’s knowledge, threatened against or
affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any property of any of them
in any court of law or before any Governmental Authority which, (a) purport to
affect or pertain to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (b) if determined adversely to any of them,
would have a Material Adverse Effect, except, with respect to the foregoing
subsection (b), as referred to in the Borrower’s news releases and filings with
the SEC made or filed on or prior to the Restatement Date.

 

5.10         Binding Effect. This Agreement has been, and each other Loan
Document, when delivered hereunder, will have been, duly executed and delivered
by the Borrower. This Agreement constitutes, and each other Loan Document when
so delivered will constitute, the legal, valid, and binding obligation of the
Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with its terms, except
as enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
arrangement, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting
creditors’ rights generally or by equitable principles relating to the granting
of specific performance and other equitable remedies as a matter of judicial
discretion.

 

5.11         No Default. No Default exists or has resulted from the incurring of
any Obligations by the Borrower. As of the Restatement Date, neither the
Borrower nor any Subsidiary is in default under or with respect to any material
Contractual Obligation in any respect which, individually or together with all
such defaults, has had a Material Adverse Effect.

 



 46 

 

 

5.12         ERISA. (a) The actuarial present value of all vested accrued
benefits under all Pension Plans does not exceed the current fair market value
of the assets determined on an ongoing basis of the Pension Plans by an amount
which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; (b) no
Pension Plan or trust created thereunder has failed to satisfy the minimum
funding standards under Section 412 of the Code and Section 302 of ERISA, in
each case, whether or not waived, except to the extent such failure would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; (c) based on written
information received from the respective administrators of “multiemployer plans”
(as defined in ERISA) to which the Borrower or any Subsidiary contributes, the
aggregate present value of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to the
Borrower or such Subsidiaries under all such multiemployer plans is not an
amount which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; and
(d) the Borrower is not and will not be (i) an employee benefit plan subject to
Title I of ERISA; (ii) a plan or account subject to Section 4975 of the Code;
(iii) an entity deemed to hold “plan assets” of any such plans or accounts for
purposes of ERISA or the Code; (iv) a “governmental plan” within the meaning of
ERISA; or (v) using “plan assets” (within the meaning of 29 CFR § 2510.3-101, as
modified by Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans in
connection with the Loans or the Commitments.

 

5.13         Regulation U. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is
engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of
extending credit for purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock within
the meanings of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System. No part of any Borrowing will be used to buy or carry any Margin Stock,
or to extend credit to others for that purpose, or for any purpose, if to do so
would violate the provisions of Regulation U.

 

5.14         Tax Liability. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have filed or
caused to be filed all income tax returns which are required to have been filed
by them, and have paid, or made provision for the payment of, all Taxes which
have become due pursuant to said returns or pursuant to any assessment received
by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, except (a) such Taxes, if any, as are being
contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been established
in accordance with GAAP or (b) where the failure to so file or pay would not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.15         Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks and Licenses, etc. The Borrower or
its Subsidiaries own or are licensed or otherwise have the right to use all of
the patents, patent rights trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights,
contractual franchises, licenses, authorizations and other rights that are
reasonably necessary for the operation of their respective businesses, where the
failure to have such rights would have a Material Adverse Effect. To the
knowledge of the Borrower, no slogan or other advertising device, product,
process, method, substance, part or other material now employed, or now
contemplated to be employed, by the Borrower or any Subsidiary infringes upon
any rights held by any other Person, where such infringement would create a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.16         Environmental Matters. The Borrower conducts in the ordinary course
of business a review of the effect of existing Environmental Laws and existing
Environmental Claims on its business, operations and properties, and as a result
thereof the Borrower has reasonably concluded that such Environmental Laws and
Environmental Claims would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 

5.17         Insurance. The properties of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries are
insured with financially sound and reputable insurance companies not Affiliates
of the Borrower, in such amounts, with such deductibles and covering such risks
as are customarily carried by companies engaged in similar businesses and owning
similar properties in localities where the Borrower or such Subsidiary operates.

 



 47 

 

 

5.18         Disclosure. No written statement made by the Borrower to the
Lenders in connection with the Loan Documents or any Loan (in each case, as
modified or supplemented by other information so furnished) when furnished and
taken as a whole, contains or will contain any material misstatement of fact or
omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not materially
misleading; provided that, with respect to projected financial information and
estimates, the Borrower represents only that such information was prepared in
good faith based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable at the time, it
being understood that such projected information as to future events and are not
to be viewed as facts, such projected information is subject to uncertainties
and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Borrower’s control, no assurance
can be given that any particular projected information will be realized and
actual results during the period or periods covered by any such projected
information may differ significantly from the projected results and such
differences may be material. There is no fact which the Borrower has not
disclosed to the Lenders in writing which materially and adversely affects nor,
so far as the Borrower can now foresee, is reasonably likely to prove to affect
materially and adversely the business, operations, properties, profits or
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or the ability of the Borrower to perform the Obligations.

 

5.19         OFAC. Neither the Borrower, nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor, to
the knowledge of the Borrower, any director, officer, or employee of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, is an individual or entity that is or is
owned or Controlled by one or more individuals or entities that are
(i) currently the subject or target of any Sanctions, (ii) included on OFAC’s
List of Specially Designated Nationals, HMT’s Consolidated List of Financial
Sanctions Targets and the Investment Ban List, or any similar list enforced by
any other relevant sanctions authority having jurisdiction over the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) located, organized or resident in a Designated
Jurisdiction. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Sanctions and have
instituted and maintained policies and procedures designed to promote and
achieve compliance with such Sanctions.

 

5.20         Anti-Corruption Laws. The Borrower and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their businesses in compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act of 1977, the UK Bribery Act 2010, and other applicable similar
anti-corruption legislation in other jurisdictions having jurisdiction over the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries and have instituted and maintained policies
and procedures designed to promote and achieve compliance with such laws.

 

5.21         Affected Financial Institution. The Borrower is not an Affected
Financial Institution.

 

5.22         Beneficial Ownership. As of the Restatement Date, the Borrower is
subject to an exclusion to the definition of “legal entity customer” under the
Beneficial Ownership Regulation.

 

5.23         Covered Entity. The Borrower is not a Covered Entity.

the Administrative Agent). The Administrative Agent shall have no obligation to
request the delivery of or to maintain paper copies of the documents referred to
above, and in any event shall have no responsibility to monitor compliance by
the Borrower with any such request by a Lender for delivery.

Effect, a written notice specifying the nature thereof, what action the Borrower
and/or any of its Subsidiaries is taking or proposes to take with respect
thereto, and, when known, any action taken by the Internal Revenue Service with

qualified to transact business in each jurisdiction in which such qualification
is necessary in view of their respective business or the ownership or leasing of
their respective properties, except that the failure to preserve and maintain
any particular license, right, franchise, privilege, authorization, consent,
approval, order, permit, exemption, or registration, or to qualify or remain
qualified in any jurisdiction, that would not have a Material Adverse Effect

preserve, and protect a particular item of property or equipment would not
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

and reputable insurance companies in such amounts and against such risks as is
usually carried by responsible companies engaged in similar businesses and

Subsidiaries operate.

 

6.08         Compliance with Laws. Comply with the requirements of all

accountants, all at such reasonable times during normal business hours and as
often as may be reasonably desired, but not more than once a year unless an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, upon reasonable advance notice
to the Borrower; provided, however, that (a) when an Event of Default exists the

books of account reflecting financial transactions in conformity with GAAP and
all applicable requirements of any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction

misleading.

 

6.11         ERISA Compliance. Comply with the minimum funding requirements of
ERISA with respect to all Pension Plans, except where a failure to comply with

would have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

6.13         Use of Proceeds. Use the proceeds of the Loans for working capital

approved by the board of directors, requisite general partners, requisite

ARTICLE IX. ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

 

9.01         Appointment and Authority. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably
appoints Bank of America to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative
Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are
delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together
with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Other than
with respect to the Borrower’s consent rights under Section 9.06, the provisions
of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, and the Borrower shall not have rights as a third party beneficiary of
any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term
“agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with
reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary
or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any
Applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is
intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between
contracting parties.

 

9.02         Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent
hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as
any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person
serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such
Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own
securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity
for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any
Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the
Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the
Lenders.

 

9.03         Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent or the Arrangers,
as applicable, shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly
set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall
be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Administrative Agent or the Arrangers, as applicable:

 

(a)          shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties,
regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

 

(b)          shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or
exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers
expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the
Administrative Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the
Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be
expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the
Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its
opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to
liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or Applicable Law, including
for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic
stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification
or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor
Relief Law;

 



 57 

 

 

(c)          shall not have any duty or responsibility to disclose, and shall
not be liable for the failure to disclose, to any Lender, any credit or other
information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower or any of its
Affiliates, that is communicated to, obtained by or in the possession of, the
Administrative Agent, Arrangers or any of their Related Parties in any capacity,
except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required to be
furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein;

 

(d)          shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it
(i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other
number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the
Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the
circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) or (ii) in the absence of
its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative
Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until
notice describing such Default is given in writing to the Administrative Agent
by the Borrower or a Lender; and

 

(e)          shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or
inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of
any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or
in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any
of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or
therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability,
effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any
other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition
set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of
items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

 

9.04         Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any
notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other
writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting
or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed,
sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent
also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed
by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability
for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to
the making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of
a Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is
satisfactory to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received
notice to the contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The
Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the
Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall
not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the
advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

 

9.05         Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and
all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any
other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may
perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this
Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective
activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided
for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Administrative Agent
acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such
sub-agents.

 



 58 

 

 

9.06         Resignation of Administrative Agent.

 

(a)          The Administrative Agent may at any time give notice of its
resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of
resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the
Borrower so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a
successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an
Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent
gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the
Required Lenders) (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the retiring
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the
Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set
forth above; provided that in no event shall any such successor Administrative
Agent be a Defaulting Lender. Whether or not a successor has been appointed,
such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the
Resignation Effective Date.

 

(b)          If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is a Defaulting
Lender pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders
may, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, by notice in writing to the
Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with
the consent of the Borrower so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days (or
such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the “Removal
Effective Date”), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in
accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date.

 

(c)          With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal
Effective Date (as applicable) (1) the retiring or removed Administrative Agent
shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents and (2) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts
then owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent, all payments,
communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the
Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until
such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative
Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become
vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or
removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in Section 3.01(g) and
other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the
retiring or removed Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or
the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom
as provided above in this Section 9.06). The fees payable by the Borrower to a
successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its
predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor.
After the retiring or removed Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and
Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring or
removed Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related
Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
(i) while the retiring or removed Administrative Agent was acting as
Administrative Agent and (ii) after such resignation or removal for as long as
any of them continues to act in any capacity hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents, including in respect of any actions taken in connection with
transferring the agency to any successor Administrative Agent.

9.07         Non-Reliance on the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the
Other Lenders. Each Lender expressly acknowledges that none of the
Administrative Agent nor any Arranger has made any representation or warranty to
it, and that no act by the Administrative Agent or any Arranger hereafter taken,
including any consent to, and acceptance of any assignment or review of the
affairs of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates, shall be deemed to constitute
any representation or warranty by the Administrative Agent or any Arranger to
any Lender as to any matter, including whether the Administrative Agent or any
Arranger have disclosed material information in their (or their Related
Parties’) possession. Each Lender represents to the Administrative Agent and the
Arrangers that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent, the Arrangers, any other Lender or any of their Related
Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit analysis of, appraisal of, and investigation
into, the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other
condition and creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and all
applicable bank or other regulatory Laws relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and made its own decision to enter into this Agreement and
to extend credit to the Borrower hereunder. Each Lender also acknowledges that
it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any
Arranger, any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such
documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate,
continue to make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or
not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or
any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder, and to
make such investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the
business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower. Each Lender represents and warrants that
(i) the Loan Documents set forth the terms of a commercial lending facility and
(ii) it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans in the
ordinary course and is entering into this Agreement as a Lender for the purpose
of making, acquiring or holding commercial loans and providing other facilities
set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender, and not for the purpose of
purchasing, acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument, and
each Lender agrees not to assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing. Each
Lender represents and warrants that it is sophisticated with respect to
decisions to make, acquire and/or hold commercial loans and to provide other
facilities set forth herein, as may be applicable to such Lender, and either it,
or the Person exercising discretion in making its decision to make, acquire
and/or hold such commercial loans or to provide such other facilities, is
experienced in making, acquiring or holding such commercial loans or providing
such other facilities.

 

9.08         No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, none of the Bookrunners, Arrangers or other titles listed on
the cover page hereof shall have any powers, duties or responsibilities under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as
applicable, as the Administrative Agent, a Lender hereunder.

 

9.09         Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the
pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial
proceeding relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein
expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be
entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

 



 60 

 

 

 

(a)            to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal
and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations
that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary
or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative
Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their
respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 10.04) allowed in such judicial
proceeding; and

 

(b)            to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same;

 

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 10.04.

 

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent
to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan
of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Obligations or the rights of any Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to
vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

Administrative Agent and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit
of the Borrower, that the Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary with respect
to the assets of such Lender involved in such Lender’s entrance into,
participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the
Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or
exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any

Agent Party as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction or (ii) a claim brought by the Borrower against an Agent
Party for a material breach of such Agent Party’s obligations hereunder or under
any other Loan Document, if the Borrower has obtained a final and nonappealable
judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have any
liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for indirect, special,
incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual

or the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges
herein provided, and provided under each other Loan Document, are cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

Administrative Agent from exercising on its own behalf the rights and remedies
that inure to its benefit (solely in its capacity as Administrative Agent)
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, (b) any Lender from exercising
setoff rights in accordance with Section 10.08 (subject to the terms of

the other Loan Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders shall have the rights
otherwise ascribed to the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 and
(ii) in addition to the matters set forth in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of the

or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the performance by the parties hereto
of their respective obligations hereunder or thereunder, the consummation of the

prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of
the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether

Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall not, as to any
Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to (i) have resulted from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or (ii) result from a
claim brought by the Borrower against an Indemnitee for a material breach of
such Indemnitee’s obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, or

inaction, participation or contribution of the Borrowers or its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective officers, directors, stockholders, partners, members,
employees, agents, representatives or advisors. Without limiting the provisions
of Section 3.01(c), this Section 10.04(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes

(c)            Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower for any
reason fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under
subsection (a) or (b) of this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative
Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party of any of the foregoing,
each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such
sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s pro rata
share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or
indemnity payment is sought based on each Lender’s share of the Total Credit
Exposure at such time) of such unpaid amount (including any such unpaid amount
in respect of a claim asserted by such Lender), such payment to be made
severally among them based on such Lenders’ Applicable Percentage (determined as
of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is
sought), provided, further that, the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss,
claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by
or asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in its
capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting
for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such
capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject
to the provisions of Section 2.10(d).

 

(d)            Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives,
and acknowledges that no Subsidiary of the Borrower shall have, any claim
against any Indemnitee, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages)
arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other
Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds
thereof. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for
any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or
other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee
through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems
in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual
damages resulting (i) from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnitee as determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction or (ii) a claim brought by the Borrower against an
Indemnitee for a material breach of such Indemnitee’s obligations hereunder or
under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower has obtained a final and
nonappealable judgment in its favor on such claim as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 



 67 

 

 

(e)            Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not
later than ten Business Days after presentation of a reasonably detailed invoice
therefor.

 

(f)            Survival. The agreements in this Section and the indemnity
provisions of Section 10.02(e) shall survive the resignation of the
Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of the
Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all the
other Obligations.

 

10.05      Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of
the Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the
Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such
payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent
or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or
otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part
thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had
not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so
recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from
the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum
equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, in the
applicable currency of such recovery or payment. The obligations of the Lenders
under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of
the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

 

10.06      Successors and Assigns.

 

(a)            Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each
Lender and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in
accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by
way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions
of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or
transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than
the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby,
Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to
the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

(b)           Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one
or more assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the
time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the
following conditions:

 

(i)             Minimum Amounts.

 

(A)            in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of
the assigning Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or
contemporaneous assignments to related Approved Funds that equal at least the
amount specified in subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section in the aggregate or in
the case of an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved
Fund, no minimum amount need be assigned; and

 



 68 

 

 

(B)            in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this
Section, the aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes
Loans outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the
principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to
each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption
with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if
“Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade
Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in
excess thereof unless each of the Administrative Agent and, so long as no Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower otherwise consents (each
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed and each such consent to
be within the sole discretion of the consenting party).

 

(ii)            Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as
an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and
obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment
assigned, except that this clause (ii) shall not prohibit any Lender from
assigning all or a portion of its rights and obligations among the revolving
credit facility provided hereunder and any separate revolving credit facilities
provided pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 10.01 on a non-pro rata
basis;

 

(iii)           Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any
assignment except to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this
Section and, in addition:

 

(A)            the consent of the Borrower shall be required (which consent may
be given or withheld in the Borrower’s sole discretion) (1) unless an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or
(2) unless such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an
Approved Fund; provided that, if, as a result of such assignment to a Lender, an
Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, the Borrower would incur an
additional cost pursuant to Article III, then the consent of the Borrower shall
be required (which consent may be given or withheld in the Borrower’s sole
discretion);and provided, further, that if no consent of the Borrower is
required in accordance with clause (2) of this subsection (b)(iii)(A), the
assigning Lender shall give the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written
notice thereof; and

 

(B)            the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a
Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund
with respect to such Lender.

 

(iv)           Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall
execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption,
together with a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500;
provided, however, that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion,
elect to waive such processing and recordation fee in the case of any
assignment. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

 



 69 

 

 

(v)            No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be
made (A) to the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or
(B) to any Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon
becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons
described in this clause (B), or (C) to a natural Person (or a holding company,
investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit
of a natural Person).

 

(vi)           Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of
rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment
shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto
set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional
payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon
distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by
the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating
actions, including funding, with the consent of the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously
requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the
applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and
satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon)
and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans
in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender
hereunder shall become effective under Applicable Law without compliance with
the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be
deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such
compliance occurs.

 

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant
to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to
this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with
respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such
assignment; provided, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by
the affected parties, no assignment by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a
waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s
having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon request, the Borrower (at its expense)
shall execute and deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or
transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a
sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

 

(c)           Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose
as an agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for Tax purposes),
shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each Assignment
and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in electronic form)
and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders,
and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans
owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
“Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest
error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof
as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

 



 70 

 

 

(d)           Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent
of, or notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations
to any Person (other than a natural Person (or a holding company, investment
vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural
Person), a Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates
or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under
Section 10.04(c) without regard to the existence of any participation.

 

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 10.01 that affects such Participant. The Borrower agrees, subject to
Section 10.06(e), that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this
Section 10.06 (it being understood that the documentation required under
Section 3.01(e) shall be delivered to the Lender who sells the participation) to
the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by
assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section 10.06; provided that such
Participant agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 3.06 and 10.13 as
if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section 10.06. Each Lender
that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s request and expense, to use
reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to effectuate the provisions
of Section 3.06 with respect to any Participant. To the extent permitted by law,
each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 10.08 as
though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to
Section 2.11 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender that sells a participation
shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower,
maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant
and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest
in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant
Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or
any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any
Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any
commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan
Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary
to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is
in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury
Regulations or Section 1.163-5(b) of the proposed United States Treasury
Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent
manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes
of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance
of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent)
shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

 

(e)            Limitations upon Participation Rights. A Participant shall not be
entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.01 or 3.04 than the
applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to
such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent. A
Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01 unless the
Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such
Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with
Section 3.01(e) as though it were a Lender.

 



 71 

 

 

(f)            Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a
security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement
(including under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender,
including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve
Bank or other central banking authority; provided that no such pledge or
assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

 

10.07      Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of
the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed
(a) to its Affiliates and to its Related Parties (it being understood that the
Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential), (b) to the extent required or requested by any regulatory
authority purporting to have jurisdiction over such Person or its Related
Parties (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by
Applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process;
provided that, to the extent practicable and permitted by law, written notice is
delivered promptly to the Borrower, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan
Document or any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject
to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this
Section, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee
of or Participant in, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement or
any Eligible Assignee invited to be a Lender pursuant to Section 2.13(b) or
Section 10.01 or (ii) any actual or prospective party (or its Related Parties)
to any swap, derivative or other transaction under which payments are to be made
by reference to the Borrower and its obligations, this Agreement or payments
hereunder, (g) on a confidential basis to (i) any rating agency in connection
with rating the Borrower or its Subsidiaries or the credit facilities provided
hereunder or (ii) the CUSIP Service Bureau or any similar agency in connection
with the application, issuance, publishing and monitoring of CUSIP numbers or
other market identifiers with respect to the credit facilities provided
hereunder, (h) with the consent of the Borrower or (i) to the extent such
Information (x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of
this Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or
any of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source
other than the Borrower or any Subsidiary. In addition, the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders may disclose the existence of this Agreement and information
about this Agreement to market data collectors, similar service providers to the
lending industry and service providers to the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders in connection with the administration of this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, and the Commitments.

 

For purposes of this Section, “Information” means all information received from
the Borrower or any Subsidiary relating to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or any
of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is
available to the Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis
prior to disclosure by the Borrower or any Subsidiary. Any Person required to
maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be
considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has
exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information.

 

Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that (a) the
Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower
or a Subsidiary, as the case may be, (b) it has developed compliance procedures
regarding the use of material non-public information and (c) it will handle such
material non-public information in accordance with Applicable Law, including
United States Federal and state securities Laws.

 



 72 

 

 

10.08      Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any
time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law,
to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and other
obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender or any such
Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and
all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender, irrespective of whether or
not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other
Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or
unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender different
from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such
indebtedness; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall
exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over
immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.14 and, pending such payment, shall be
segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in
trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the
Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement
describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender
as to which it exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender and its
Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its Affiliates may have.
Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly
after any such setoff and application, provided that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application.

 

10.09      Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the
Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest
permitted by Applicable Law (the “Maximum Rate”). If the Administrative Agent or
any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate,
the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it
exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether
the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or
a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an
expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments
and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in
equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated
term of the Obligations hereunder.

 

10.10      Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable
to the Administrative Agent, constitute the entire contract among the parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous
agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter
hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become
effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when
the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when
taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto.
Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by
facsimile or other electronic imaging means (e.g. “pdf” or “tif”) shall be
effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 

10.11      Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith
shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default at the time of any Borrowing, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as any Loan or any other Obligation hereunder shall remain unpaid
or unsatisfied.

 



 73 

 

 

10.12      Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality,
validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the
parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of
which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in
this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief
Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such
provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.

 

10.13      Replacement of Lenders. If the Borrower is entitled to replace a
Lender pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.06, or if any Lender is a
Defaulting Lender, Declining Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender or if any other
circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower the right to replace a
Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort,
upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to
assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the
restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 10.06), all of its
interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to
Sections 3.01 and 3.04) and obligations under this Agreement and the related
Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which
assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided
that:

 

(a)           the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the
assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 10.06(b);

 

(b)           such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 100%
of the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued
fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents (including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the
extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the
Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);

 

(c)            in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for
compensation under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 3.01, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or
payments thereafter;

 

(d)           such assignment does not conflict with Applicable Laws; and

 

(e)            in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a
Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the
applicable amendment, waiver or consent.

 

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if,
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation
cease to apply.

 

Each party hereto agrees that (a) an assignment required pursuant to this
Section 10.13 may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed
by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and (b) the Lender
required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such
assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to and be bound
by the terms thereof; provided that, following the effectiveness of any such
assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver
such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by
the applicable Lender; provided, further that any such documents shall be
without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.

 



 74 

 

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, the Lender that acts
as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance
with the terms of Section 9.06.

 

10.14      Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Etc.

 

(a)            GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS AND
ANY CLAIMS, CONTROVERSY, DISPUTE OR CAUSE OF ACTION (WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT
OR OTHERWISE) BASED UPON, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT (EXCEPT, AS TO ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AS EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH THEREIN) AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND THEREBY SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF
CALIFORNIA.

 

(b)            SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. THE BORROWER IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT COMMENCE ANY ACTION, LITIGATION OR
PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN LAW OR EQUITY, WHETHER IN

OR ANY RELATED PARTY OF THE FOREGOING IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS RELATING HERETO OR THERETO, IN ANY
FORUM OTHER THAN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SITTING IN LOS ANGELES

AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH ACTION, LITIGATION OR PROCEEDING SHALL
BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS BY SUIT ON THE JUDGMENT
OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY LAW. NOTHING IN THIS AGREEMENT OR IN ANY
OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL AFFECT ANY RIGHT THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, ANY
LENDER MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AGAINST THE BORROWER OR ITS PROPERTIES IN
THE COURTS OF ANY JURISDICTION.

 

(c)            WAIVER OF VENUE. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY

10.16      California Judicial Reference. If any action or proceeding is filed
in a court of the State of California by or against any party hereto in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, (a) the court shall, and is hereby directed to, make a
general reference pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 638 to
a referee (who shall be a single active or retired judge) to hear and determine
all of the issues in such action or proceeding (whether of fact or of law) and
to report a statement of decision, provided that at the option of any party to
such proceeding, any such issues pertaining to a “provisional remedy” as defined
in California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1281.8 shall be heard and
determined by the court, and (b) without limiting the generality of
Section 10.04, the Borrower shall be solely responsible to pay all fees and
expenses of any referee appointed in such action or proceeding.

 

10.17      No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all
aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with
any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan
Document), the Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its
Subsidiaries’ understanding, that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services
regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and
the Lenders are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers
and the Lenders, on the other hand, (B) the Borrower has consulted its own
legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed
appropriate, and (C) the Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and
accepts, the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby
and by the other Loan Documents; (ii) (A) the Administrative Agent, each
Arranger and each Lender each is and has been acting solely as a principal and,
except as expressly agreed in writing by the relevant parties, has not been, is
not, and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or fiduciary for the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any other Person and (B) none of the
Administrative Agent, any Arranger nor any Lender has any obligation to the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in
the other Loan Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and
the Lenders and their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of
transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and
its Affiliates, and none of the Administrative Agent, any Arranger nor any
Lender has any obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or
its Subsidiaries. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Borrower hereby
agrees not to assert any claims that it may have against the Administrative
Agent, any Arranger or any Lender with respect to any alleged breach of agency
or fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated
hereby.

 



 76 

 

 

10.18      Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents. The
words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in any Loan
Document or any other document executed in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to include electronic
signatures, the electronic matching of assignment terms and contract formations
on electronic platforms approved by the Administrative Agent, or the keeping of
records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect,
validity or enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery
thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to
the extent and as provided for in any Applicable Law, including the Federal
Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State
Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws
(including those under California) based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions
Act; provided that notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary,
the Administrative Agent is under no obligation to agree to accept electronic
signatures in any form or in any format unless expressly agreed to by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to procedures approved by it; and provided further
without limiting the foregoing, upon the request of any party, any electronic
signature shall be promptly followed by such manually executed counterpart.

 

10.19      USA PATRIOT Act. Each Lender that is subject to the Act (as
hereinafter defined) and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf
of any Lender) hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of
the USA PATRIOT Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26,
2001)) (the “Act”), it is required to obtain, verify and record information that
identifies the Borrower, which information includes the name and address of the
Borrower and other information that will allow such Lender or the Administrative
Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrower in accordance with the Act. The
Borrower shall, promptly following a request by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, provide all documentation and other information that the Administrative
Agent or such Lender requests in order to comply with its ongoing obligations
under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations, including the Act.

 

10.20      Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence of the Loan Documents.

 

10.21      Judgment Currency. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any
court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or any other Loan Document
in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that
at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent
could purchase the first currency with such other currency on the Business Day
preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower
in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment
in a currency (the “Judgment Currency”) other than that in which such sum is
denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the
“Agreement Currency”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day
following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may
be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with
normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment
Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the
sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender from the Borrower
in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and
notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement
Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender in such currency, the Administrative Agent or
such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to
the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under
Applicable Law).

 



 77 

 

 

10.22     Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial
Institutions. Solely to the extent any Lender that is an Affected Financial
Institution is a party to this Agreement and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or
understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any
liability of any Lender that is an Affected Financial Institution arising under
any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to
the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and
agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

 

(a)           the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the
applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which
may be payable to it by any Lender that is an Affected Financial Institution;
and

 

(b)           the effects of any Bail-In Action on any such liability,
including, if applicable:

 

(i)             a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such
liability;

 

(ii)            a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares
or other instruments of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its
parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or
otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of
ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such
liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or

 

(iii)           the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with
the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable
Resolution Authority.

 

10.23      Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the
Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any swap
contract or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC
Credit Support”, and each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge
and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the
regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in
respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below
applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in
fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the
United States or any other state of the United States):

 

(a)            In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC
(each, a “Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special
Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such
QFC Credit Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported
QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such
Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be
effective to the same extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S.
Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and
any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws
of the United States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered
Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding
under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents
that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that
may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no
greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S.
Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were
governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.
Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and
remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event
affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any
QFC Credit Support.

 



 78 

 

 

(b)            As used in this Section 10.23, the following terms have the
following meanings:

 

“BHC Act Affiliate” of a party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined
under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.

 

“Covered Entity” means any of the following: (i) a “covered entity” as that term
is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b); (ii) a
“covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with,
12 C.F.R. § 47.3(b); or (iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and
interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b).

 

“Default Right” has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be
interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as
applicable.

 

“QFC” has the meaning assigned to the term “qualified financial contract” in,
and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).
