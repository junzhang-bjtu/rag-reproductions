Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement (DRIVE 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each of the Owner Trustee and the Administrator, as applicable, is hereby
authorized to engage in the foregoing activities on behalf of the Issuer.
Neither the Issuer nor any Person acting on behalf of the Issuer shall engage in
any activity other than in connection with the foregoing or other than as
required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents.

SECTION 2.4. Appointment of the Owner Trustee. The Seller hereby appoints the
Owner Trustee as trustee of the Issuer effective as of the date hereof, to have
all the rights, powers and duties set forth herein. The Owner Trustee accepts
such appointment.

SECTION 2.5. Initial Capital Contribution of Trust Estate. As of the date of the
Original Trust Agreement, the Seller sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed and
set over to the Owner Trustee the sum of $1. The Owner Trustee hereby
acknowledges receipt in trust from the Seller, as of such date, of the foregoing
contribution, which shall constitute the initial Trust Estate and shall be
deposited in the Collection Account.

SECTION 2.6. Declaration of Trust. The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it
will hold the Trust Estate in trust upon and subject to the conditions set forth
herein for the use and benefit of the Certificateholders, subject to the
obligations of the Issuer under the Transaction Documents. It is the intention
of the parties hereto that the Issuer constitute a statutory trust under the
Statutory Trust Statute and that this Agreement constitute the governing
instrument of such statutory trust. It is the intention of the parties hereto
that, solely for United States federal income or state and local income,
franchise and value added tax purposes, so long as there is a single beneficial
owner of the Certificates, the Issuer will be disregarded as an entity separate
from such beneficial owner and the Notes will be characterized as debt. The
parties agree that, unless otherwise required by appropriate tax authorities,
the Issuer will not file or cause to be filed annual or other necessary returns,
reports or other forms consistent with the characterization of the Issuer as an
entity separate from its owner. In the event that the Issuer is deemed to have
more than one beneficial owner for United States federal income tax purposes,
the Issuer will file returns, reports and other forms consistent with the
characterization of the Issuer as a partnership (that is not treated as a
publicly traded partnership), and this Agreement may be amended to include such
provisions as may be required under Subchapter K of the Code. No election will
be made by or on behalf of the Issuer to be classified as an association taxable
as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. Effective as of
the date hereof, the Owner Trustee shall have all rights, powers and duties set
forth herein and, to the extent not inconsistent herewith, in the Statutory
Trust Statute with respect to accomplishing the purposes of the Issuer. It is
the intention of the parties hereto that except as expressly stated herein, the
affairs of the Trust shall be managed by the Administrator pursuant to the
Administration Agreement. The Owner Trustee has heretofore filed the Certificate
of Trust with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as required by
Section 3810(a) of the Statutory Trust Statute, such filing hereby being
ratified and approved in all respects. Notwithstanding anything herein or in the
Statutory Trust Statute to the contrary, it is the intention of the parties
hereto that (i) the Issuer constitute a “business trust” within the meaning of
Section 101(9)(A)(v) of the Bankruptcy Code and (ii) the Issuer be and remain a
separate legal entity under Delaware law.

Trust Agreement (DRIVE 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 2.7. Organizational Expenses; Liabilities of the Holders.

(a) The Servicer shall pay organizational expenses of the Issuer as they may
arise.

(b) No Certificateholder (including the Seller if the Seller becomes a
Certificateholder) shall have any personal liability for any liability or
obligation of the Issuer.

SECTION 2.8. Title to the Trust Estate. Legal title to all the Trust Estate
shall be vested at all times in the Issuer as a separate legal entity.

SECTION 2.9. Representations and Warranties of the Seller. The Seller hereby
represents and warrants to the Owner Trustee that:

(a) Existence and Power. The Seller is a Delaware limited liability company
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
and has, in all material respects, full power and authority required to own its
assets and operate its business as presently owned or operated, and to execute,
to deliver and to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party and the Underwriting Agreement. The Seller has obtained all
necessary licenses and approvals in each jurisdiction where the failure to do so
would materially and adversely affect the ability of the Seller to perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents and the Underwriting Agreement.

(b) Authorization and No Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Seller of each Transaction Document to which it is a party and the
Underwriting Agreement (i) have been duly authorized by all necessary action on
the part of the Seller and (ii) do not violate or constitute a default under
(A) any applicable law, rule or regulation, (B) its organizational documents or
(C) any material agreement to which the Seller is a party or by which its
properties are bound (other than violations of such laws, rules, regulations,
organizational instruments, agreements or documents which do not affect the
legality, validity or enforceability of any of such agreements and which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not materially and adversely affect the
transactions contemplated by, or the Seller’s ability to perform its obligations
under, the Transaction Documents to which it is a party or the Underwriting
Agreement).

(c) No Consent Required. No approval, authorization or other action by, or
filing with, any Governmental Authority is required in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of any Transaction Document
other than UCC filings and other than (i) approvals and authorizations that have
previously been obtained and filings which have previously been made and
(ii) approvals, authorizations or filings which, if not obtained or made, would
not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Seller to perform its
obligations under the Underwriting Agreement or the Transaction Documents to
which it is a party.

Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement (DRIVE 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d) Binding Effect. Each of the Transaction Documents to which the Seller is a
party and the Underwriting Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Seller enforceable against the Seller in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, receivership, conservatorship or other
similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally and, if applicable the rights
of creditors of limited liability companies from time to time in effect or by
general principles of equity or other similar laws of general application
relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally and
subject to general principles of equity.

(e) No Proceedings. There are no actions, orders, suits or proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of the Seller, threatened against the Seller before or by
any Governmental Authority that (i) assert the invalidity or unenforceability of
this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents, (ii) seek to prevent
the issuance of the Notes or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or
(iii) seek any determination or ruling that would materially and adversely
affect the performance by the Seller of its obligations under this Agreement or
any of the other Transaction Documents.

(f) To the best of the Seller’s knowledge, as of the date hereof, no amounts are
required to be deducted or withheld pursuant to FATCA with respect to payments
to be made to the Certificateholders hereunder or under the Sale and Servicing
Agreement. If the Seller has actual knowledge that withholding tax under FATCA
applies with respect to one or more payments on a Certificate, the Seller will
notify the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Certificate Paying Agent
of such fact.

SECTION 2.10. Situs of Issuer. The Issuer shall be located in the State of
Delaware (it being understood that the Issuer may have bank accounts located and
maintained outside of Delaware).

SECTION 2.11. Covenants of the Certificateholders. Each Certificateholder, by
becoming an owner of a Certificate and beneficial owner of the Issuer, hereby
acknowledges and agrees (a) that the Certificateholder is subject to the terms,
provisions and conditions of the Certificate and this Agreement, to which the
Certificateholder agrees to be bound; and (b) that it shall not take any
position in such Certificateholder’s tax returns inconsistent with Section 2.6
herein and Section 2.14 of the Indenture.

SECTION 2.12. Federal Income Tax Allocations. If the Certificates have more than
one beneficial owner for United States federal income tax purposes, then for
United States federal income tax purposes each item of income, gain, loss,
credit and deduction for a month shall be allocated to the Certificateholders as
of the first Record Date following the end of such month in proportion to their
Percentage Interests on such Record Date. The Seller (or the Administrator in
accordance with the Administration Agreement and Section 5.3) is authorized, in
its sole discretion, (i) to modify the allocations in this paragraph if
necessary or appropriate for the allocations to fairly reflect the economic
income, gain or loss to the Certificateholders or otherwise comply with the
requirements of the Code and (ii) to determine whether or not to make any
available tax elections such as an election under Sections 1278 or 754 of the
Code.

ARTICLE III

CERTIFICATES AND TRANSFER OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 3.1. Initial Ownership. Upon the formation of the Issuer and until the
issuance of the Certificates, the Seller shall be the sole beneficiary of the
Issuer, and upon the issuance of the Certificates, the Seller will no longer be
a beneficiary of the Issuer, except to the extent that the Seller is a
Certificateholder.

SECTION 3.2. Authorization of the Certificates. Concurrently with the sale of
the Transferred Assets to the Issuer pursuant to the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, at the direction of the Seller, (a) one or more Book-Entry
Certificates shall be executed by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the Issuer and
authenticated and delivered by the Certificate Registrar in the name of Cede &
Co. or (b) one or more Definitive Certificates shall be executed by the Owner
Trustee on behalf of the Issuer and authenticated and delivered by the
Certificate Registrar to or upon the written order of the Seller. The
Certificates shall in the aggregate represent 100% of the Percentage Interest in
the Issuer and shall be fully paid and nonassessable.

SECTION 3.3. Book-Entry Certificates.

(a) The Certificates, upon original issuance, may be issued, substantially in
the form of Exhibit A hereto, representing the Certificates to be delivered to
the Certificate Registrar, as initial agent for the Clearing Agency, by, or on
behalf of, the Issuer. The Book-Entry Certificates shall be issued in an
aggregate nominal principal amount of $100,000 (which shall be deemed to be the
equivalent of 100,000 units), and all beneficial interests in the Book-Entry
Certificates shall be owned, in the minimum principal amount of $5,000 and
integral multiples of $1 in excess thereof. The Issuer shall not issue any
Certificate that would cause the aggregate nominal principal amount of all
Certificates to exceed $100,000, or 100,000 units, without the prior written
consent of all Certificateholders. No distributions of moneys to the
Certificateholders under the Transaction Documents shall be deemed to reduce the
nominal principal amount of any Certificate prior to payment in full of all
Notes; provided, however, that the final aggregate $100,000 distributed to the
Certificateholders under the Transaction Documents upon final distribution of
the Trust Estate and termination of the Issuer pursuant to Sections 9.1 and 9.2
shall be deemed to repay the aggregate nominal principal amount of the
Certificates in full; provided, further, that any failure to pay in full the
nominal principal amount of a Certificate on such final distribution date shall
not result in any recourse to, claim against or liability of any Person for such
shortfall. Any amounts payable to the Certificateholders on or in respect of the
Certificates under the Transaction Documents shall be paid and allocated to the
various Certificateholders ratably based on their respective Percentage
Interests. Unless the Seller directs otherwise pursuant to Section 3.2, such
Certificates shall initially be registered on the Certificate Register in the
name of Cede & Co., the nominee of DTC as the initial Clearing Agency, and no
Certificateholder will receive a Definitive Certificate representing such
Certificateholder’s interest in such Certificate, except as provided in
Section 3.5. Unless and until definitive, fully registered Certificates (the
“Definitive Certificates”) have been issued to the applicable Certificateholders
pursuant to Section 3.2 or 3.5:

Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement (DRIVE 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i) the provisions of this Section shall be in full force and effect;

(ii) the Certificate Registrar, the Certificate Paying Agent, the Indenture
Trustee and the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing Agency
for all purposes of this Agreement (including the distribution or payment of
amounts distributable or payable under the Transaction Documents and the giving
of instructions or directions hereunder) as the sole Certificateholders, and
shall have no obligation to the Certificate Owners;

(iii) to the extent that the provisions of this Section conflict with any other
provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Section shall control;

(iv) the rights of Certificate Owners shall be exercised only through the
Clearing Agency and shall be limited to those established by law and agreements
between or among such Certificate Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the
Clearing Agency Participants or Persons acting through Clearing Agency
Participants. Pursuant to the Depository Agreement, unless and until Definitive
Certificates are issued pursuant to Section 3.5, the initial Clearing Agency
will make book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants and
receive and transmit payments due under the Transaction Documents with regard to
the Certificates to such Clearing Agency Participants;

(v) whenever this Agreement requires or permits actions to be taken based upon
instructions or directions of Certificateholders evidencing a specified
percentage of the Percentage Interest, the Clearing Agency shall deliver
instructions to the Owner Trustee only to the extent that it has received
instructions to such effect from Certificate Owners and/or Clearing Agency
Participants or Persons acting through Clearing Agency Participants owning or
representing, respectively, such required percentage of the beneficial interest
in the Certificates;

(vi) owners of a beneficial interest in a Book-Entry Certificate will not be
entitled to have any portion of a Book-Entry Certificate registered in their
names and will not be considered to be the Certificate Owners or
Certificateholders of any Certificates under this Agreement; and

(vii) payments on a Book-Entry Certificate will be made to the Clearing Agency,
or its nominee, as the registered owner thereof, and none of the Issuer, the
Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent will have
any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or
payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in a Book-Entry
Certificate or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to
the beneficial ownership interests.

Trust Agreement (DRIVE 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, so long as a
Book-Entry Certificate remains outstanding and is held by or on behalf of the
Clearing Agency, transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate, in whole or in part,
shall only be made in accordance with Section 3.3(a). Subject to clauses
(i) through (iii) of Section 3.3(a), transfers of a Book-Entry Certificate shall
be limited to transfers of such Book-Entry Certificate in whole, but not in
part, to a nominee of the Clearing Agency or to a successor of the Clearing
Agency or such successor’s nominee.

In the event that a Book-Entry Certificate is exchanged for one or more
Definitive Certificates pursuant to Section 3.5, such Certificates may be
exchanged for one another only in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement and with such procedures as may be from time to time adopted by the
Issuer and the Certificate Registrar.

SECTION 3.4. Notices to Clearing Agency. Whenever a notice or other
communication to the Certificateholders is required under this Agreement, unless
and until Definitive Certificates shall have been issued to Certificate Owners
pursuant to Section 3.5, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or the
Certificate Paying Agent, as applicable, shall give all such notices and
communications specified herein to be given to the Certificateholders to the
Clearing Agency, and shall have no obligation to the Certificate Owners.

SECTION 3.5. Definitive Certificates.

(a) If (i) the Seller advises the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee in
writing that the Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to properly
discharge its responsibilities with respect to the Certificates, and the Seller
is unable to locate a qualified successor or (ii) the Seller at its option
advises the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee in writing that it elects to
terminate the book-entry system through the Clearing Agency, then the Clearing
Agency shall notify all Certificate Owners and the Certificate Paying Agent of
the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of Definitive
Certificates representing the Certificates to Certificate Owners requesting the
same. Upon surrender to the Certificate Registrar of the typewritten Certificate
or Certificates representing the Book-Entry Certificates by the Clearing Agency,
accompanied by re-registration instructions, the Owner Trustee shall execute and
the Certificate Registrar shall register, authenticate and deliver the
Definitive Certificates representing the Certificates in accordance with the
instructions of the Clearing Agency. None of the Issuer, Certificate Registrar,
the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee shall be liable for any delay in
delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be
protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive
Certificates representing the Certificates, the Owner Trustee, the Certificate
Registrar, the Certificate Paying Agent and the Indenture Trustee shall
recognize such Holders of the Definitive Certificates, as reflected on the
Certificate Register, as the applicable Certificateholders.

(b) Subject to the transfer restrictions contained herein and in the
Certificates, any Holder of a Definitive Certificate may transfer all or any
portion of the Percentage Interest (subject to the requirements set forth in
Sections 3.3 and 3.7) evidenced by such Certificate upon surrender thereof to

transfer in the form of the “Assignment” attached to the Form of Certificate
attached hereto as Exhibit A and with such signature guarantees and evidence of
authority of the Persons signing the instrument of transfer as the Certificate
Registrar may reasonably require, (b) an executed direction letter regarding
registration of such transfer in the form attached hereto as Exhibit B, and
(c) the documents required by Section 3.7(c) hereof. Promptly upon the receipt
of such documents and receipt by the Certificate Registrar of the transferor’s
Certificate, the Certificate Registrar shall record the name of such transferee
as a Certificateholder and its Percentage Interest in the Certificate Register
and the Owner Trustee shall execute, and the Certificate Registrar shall
authenticate and deliver to such Certificateholder, a Certificate evidencing
such Percentage Interest. In the event a transferor transfers only a portion of
its Percentage Interest, the Owner Trustee shall execute, and the Certificate
Registrar shall register, authenticate and deliver to such transferor, a new
Certificate evidencing such transferor’s new Percentage Interest and the Owner
Trustee shall execute, and the Certificate Registrar shall register,
authenticate and deliver to such transferee, a new Certificate evidencing such
transferee’s Percentage Interest. Subsequent to each transfer of a beneficial
interest and upon the issuance of the new Certificate or Certificates, the
Certificate Registrar shall cancel and destroy in accordance with its customary
practices the Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such transfer.
The Owner Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and the Indenture Trustee shall
treat, for all purposes whatsoever (other than as required by Section 3.7 or
under applicable law), the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered as
the owner of the Percentage Interest evidenced by such Certificate without
regard to any notice to the contrary.

Definitive Certificates will not be eligible for clearing or settlement through
DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream.

SECTION 3.6. Registration of the Certificates. Wilmington Trust, National
Association, as an agent of the Issuer, in its capacity as “Certificate
Registrar” (the “Certificate Registrar”) shall maintain at its Corporate Trust
Office, or at the office of any agent appointed by it and approved in writing by
the Certificateholders at the time of such appointment, a register (the
“Certificate Register”) for the registration and transfer of any Certificate.
Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of any Certificate,
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Certificate Registrar or any
agent of the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Certificate Registrar
shall treat the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered (as of the
applicable Record Date) as the owner of such Certificate for the purpose of
receiving distributions on such Certificate and for all other purposes
whatsoever. For the avoidance of doubt, a Certificate is not negotiable, and the
records maintained by the Certificate Registrar in the Certificate Register with
respect to each Certificate and its related registered owner are intended to
cause the Certificates to be issued in registered form, within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation section 5f.103-1(c), and shall record (a) the Percentage
Interest evidenced by each Certificate and (b) all distributions made to each
Certificateholder with respect to the Issuer’s assets. The entries in the
Certificate Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

SECTION 3.7. Transfer of the Certificates.

(a) A Certificateholder may assign, convey or otherwise transfer all or any of
its right, title and interest in the related Certificate, subject to the
restrictions set forth in Section 3.5 and this Section 3.7.

By accepting and holding a Certificate (or any interest therein), the holder
thereof (and, if the holder is a Plan, its fiduciary) shall be deemed to have
represented and warranted that it is not, and is not purchasing the Certificate
(or any interest therein) on behalf of or with any assets of, a Benefit Plan or
Plan that is subject to Similar Law. Subject to the transfer restrictions
contained herein and in the Certificate, each Certificateholder may transfer all
or any portion of the Percentage Interest evidenced by such Certificate upon
delivery to the Certificate Registrar of the documents required by Section 3.5
and this Section 3.7 and, in the case of a Definitive Certificate, surrender of
such Definitive Certificate to the Certificate Registrar. Such transfer may be
made by a registered Certificateholder in person or by his attorney duly
authorized in writing upon (i) in the case of a Definitive Certificate,
surrender of such Certificate to the Certificate Registrar accompanied by (x) a
written instrument of transfer in the form of the “Assignment” attached to the
Form of Certificate attached hereto as Exhibit A and with such signature
guarantees and evidence of authority of the Persons signing the instrument of
transfer as the Certificate Registrar may reasonably require and (y) an executed
direction letter regarding registration of such transfer in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit B, and (ii) delivery of the documents required by clause
(c) hereof. Promptly upon the receipt of such documents and, in the case of a
Definitive Certificate, receipt by the Certificate Registrar of the transferor’s
Certificate, the Certificate Registrar shall record the name of such transferee
as a Certificateholder and its Percentage Interest in the Certificate Register
and, in the case of a Definitive Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall execute,
and the Certificate Registrar shall authenticate and deliver, to such
Certificateholder a Certificate evidencing such Percentage Interest. As a
condition precedent to any registration of transfer under this Section 3.7, the
Certificate Registrar may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover the
payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental charges required to be paid in
connection with such transfer. In the event a transferor transfers only a
portion of its Percentage Interest, the Owner Trustee shall execute, and the
Certificate Registrar shall register, authenticate and deliver to such
transferor, a new Certificate evidencing such transferor’s new Percentage
Interest. Subsequent to a transfer and upon the issuance of a new Definitive
Certificate or Definitive Certificates, the Certificate Registrar shall cancel
and destroy the Definitive Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such
transfer. Unless otherwise provided under applicable law, the Owner Trustee, the
Certificate Registrar and the Indenture Trustee shall treat the Person in whose
name any Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the beneficial interest
in the Issuer evidenced by such Certificate, without regard to any notice to the
contrary.

(b) Each Certificateholder and, if different, each Certificate Owner, shall
deliver Tax Information to the Owner Trustee, the Administrator and the
Certificate Paying Agent on or prior to the date on which such Certificateholder
or Certificate Owner becomes a Certificateholder or Certificate Owner under this
Agreement and from time to time thereafter if such Tax Information becomes
incorrect or obsolete, as otherwise prescribed by applicable law or upon the
request of the Owner Trustee, the Administrator or the Certificate Paying Agent.

(c) By accepting and holding a Certificate (or any interest therein), each
transferee of a Certificate (other than a U.S. corporate Affiliate of the
Seller, or disregarded entity thereof) shall be deemed to have acknowledged,
represented and agreed as follows:

(1) It (and any Person for which it holds Certificates as agent or nominee) has
neither acquired nor will it transfer any Certificate it purchases (or any
interest therein) or cause any such Certificate (or any interest therein) to be
marketed on or through an “established securities market” within the meaning of
Section 7704(b)(1) of the Code, including, without limitation, an
over-the-counter market or an interdealer quotation system that regularly
disseminates firm buy or sell quotations.

(2) If it (and any Person for which it holds Certificates as agent or nominee,
collectively for purposes of this paragraph (2), a “transferee”) is a
partnership, Subchapter S corporation or grantor trust for United States federal
income tax purposes (or a disregarded entity the single owner of which is any of
the foregoing), it is not being used with a principal purpose of the arrangement
involving such entity’s beneficial interest in any Restricted Notes or
Certificates to permit any partnership to satisfy the 100 partner limitation of
Treasury Regulation section 1.7704-1(h)(1)(ii) necessary for such partnership
not to be classified as a publicly traded partnership under the Code.

(3) [Reserved.]

(4) It (and any Person for which it holds Certificates as agent or nominee)
understands that no subsequent transfer of the Certificates (or any interest
therein) is permitted unless such transfer is of a Certificate with a Percentage
Interest of more than 5% (or of an interest in a Certificate representing a
Percentage Interest of more than 5%).

(5) Each registered owner of and, if different, each owner of a beneficial
interest in, a Certificate is a “United States person” (as defined in
Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) and shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the
Administrator, the Indenture Trustee and the Certificate Paying Agent two
properly completed and duly executed originals of U.S. Internal Revenue Service
Form W-9 (or applicable successor form) certifying that it is a United States
person and not subject to backup withholding, or other information or
documentation requested by the Administrator, the Indenture Trustee, the
Certificate Paying Agent or the Owner Trustee to determine, in its sole
discretion, that payments on such Certificates will not be subject to
withholding under U.S. tax law. Further, in the event of any subsequent transfer
of a Certificate (or any interest therein), such owner of a beneficial interest
shall comply with Section 1446(f) of the Code (including with respect to
deducting and withholding from the purchase price paid in respect of such
Certificate unless the transferee obtained a certificate providing for an
exemption from such withholding).

(6) (A) It shall provide to the Administrator on behalf of the Issuer and the
Depositor any further information required by the Issuer to comply with Sections
6221 through 6241 of the Code, including Section 6226(a) of the Code (and any
corresponding provision of state law) and (B) if it is not the beneficial owner
of a Certificate, such beneficial owner shall provide to the Administrator on
behalf of the Issuer and the Depositor any further information required by the
Issuer to comply with Sections 6221 through 6241 of the Code, including
Section 6226(a) of the Code (and any corresponding provision of state law) and,
to the extent the Issuer determines such appointment necessary for it to make an
election under Section 6226(a) of the Code (or any corresponding provision of
state law), hereby appoints the transferee as its agent for purposes of
receiving any notifications or information pursuant to the notice requirements
under Section 6226(a)(2) of the Code (and any corresponding provision of state
law).

(7) No transfer of a Certificate (or interest therein) shall be permitted (nor
shall a Certificate be so held) if (i) it causes the Issuer to be a Section 385
Controlled Partnership (i.e., 80 percent or more of the Issuer’s ownership
interests are owned, directly or indirectly, by one or more members of a
Section 385 Expanded Group) that has an expanded group partner (within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.385-3(g)(12)) which is a Domestic
Corporation and (ii) either (x) a member of such Section 385 Expanded Group owns
any Notes or (y) a Section 385 Controlled Partnership of such Section 385
Expanded Group owns any Notes (in the case of clause (x), unless such member, or
in the case of clause (y), unless each member of the Section 385 Expanded Group
that is a partner in the Section 385 Controlled Partnership, is a member of the
consolidated group (as described in Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-1(h))
which includes such Domestic Corporation). No transfer of a Certificate (or
interest therein) shall be permitted (nor shall a Certificate be so held) if
(i) it results in the Issuer becoming an entity disregarded as separate from a
Domestic Corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and (ii) either (x) a
member of a Section 385 Expanded Group that includes such Domestic Corporation
owns any Notes or (y) a Section 385 Controlled Partnership of such Section 385
Expanded Group owns any Notes (in the case of clause (x), unless such member, or
in the case of clause (y), unless each member of the Section 385 Expanded Group
that is a partner in the Section 385 Controlled Partnership, is a member of the
consolidated group (as described in Treasury Regulation section 1.1502-1(h))
which includes such Domestic Corporation). For purposes of determining the
Issuer’s ownership interests in this paragraph, any Restricted Notes shall be
taken into account either as debt interests or ownership interests based on
whichever treatment, if any, would result in the Issuer as a Section 385
Controlled Partnership or a disregarded entity for purposes of applying this
paragraph’s restriction (it being understood that if the Restricted Notes are
taken into account as ownership interests for this purpose then the Restricted
Notes are not also considered Notes for the Note ownership restriction of this
paragraph).

(8) It (and any Person for which it holds Certificates as agent or nominee)
understands that any attempted transfer that contravenes any provisions of
Section 3.5(b), Section 3.7(c) or Section 3.7(h) shall be a void transfer ab

(9) The transferee is either (a) an Affiliate of the Seller or is acquiring its
interest in the Certificates as part of the initial distribution or any
redistribution of the Certificates by the Seller or one of its Affiliates or
(b) (1) is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, (2) is aware that the sale of the
Certificates (other than a sale of the Certificates by the Seller or any of its
Affiliates as part of the initial distribution or any redistributions of the
Certificates by the Seller or any of its Affiliates) to it is being made in

registered under the Securities Act, and, if in the future the transferee
decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer the Certificates, such
Certificates may only be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred in

financial and other information concerning the Issuer and the Certificates as it
deemed necessary or appropriate in order to make an informed investment decision
with respect to its purchase of the Certificates. The transferee has such
knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that the transferee
is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the
Certificates, and the transferee and any accounts for which it is acting are
each able to bear the economic risk of its investment.

(13) The transferee will not make any general solicitation by means of general
advertising or in any other manner, or take any other action that would
constitute a distribution of the Certificates under the Securities Act or that

Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws or require registration
pursuant thereto, and will not authorize any Person to act on its behalf, in
such manner with respect to the Certificates.

(14) The transferee is not acquiring the Certificates with a view to the resale,
distribution or other disposition thereof in violation of the Securities Act.

(15) The transferee will provide notice to each Person to whom it proposes to

interests are owned, directly or indirectly, by one or more members of a
Section 385 Expanded Group) that has an expanded group partner (within the

the sole Certificateholder. Any Certificate Paying Agent shall have the
revocable power to withdraw funds from the Certificate Distribution Account for
the purpose of making the distributions referred to above. The Issuer may revoke
such power and remove the Certificate Paying Agent if the Issuer determines in
its sole discretion that the Certificate Paying Agent shall have failed to
perform its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect. The
Certificate Paying Agent shall initially be Wilmington Trust, National
Association, and any co-paying agent chosen by the Certificate Paying Agent.
Wilmington Trust, National Association shall be permitted to resign as
Certificate Paying Agent upon thirty (30) days’ written notice to the Owner
Trustee. If Wilmington Trust, National Association shall no longer be the

shall cause such successor Certificate Paying Agent or any additional
Certificate Paying Agent appointed by the Issuer to execute and deliver an
instrument in which such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional
Certificate Paying Agent shall agree with the Issuer that as Certificate Paying
Agent, such successor Certificate Paying Agent or additional Certificate Paying
Agent shall hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the
Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders entitled
thereto until such sums shall be paid to such Certificateholders. If a successor
Certificate Paying Agent does not take office within 30 days after the retiring
Certificate Paying Agent resigns or is removed, the retiring Certificate Paying
Agent, the Administrator and the Seller, acting jointly, or the Majority
Certificateholders may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Certificate Paying Agent (with all costs, fees and
expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expenses, incurred by the Indenture
Trustee, in its capacity as Certificate Paying Agent, in connection with such
petition to be paid by the Issuer). The Certificate Paying Agent shall return
all unclaimed funds to the Owner Trustee and upon removal of a Certificate
Paying Agent such Certificate Paying Agent shall also return all funds in its
possession to the Owner Trustee. The rights, protections, indemnities and
immunities of the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture and the Sale and
Servicing Agreement shall apply to Wilmington Trust, National Association in its
roles as Certificate Paying Agent, Certificate Registrar and Relevant Trustee
for so long as it shall act as Certificate Paying Agent, Certificate Registrar
and/or Relevant Trustee and, to the extent applicable, to any other paying
agent, certificate registrar or authenticating agent appointed hereunder. Any
reference in this Agreement to the Certificate Paying Agent shall include any
co-paying agent unless the context requires otherwise.

SECTION 3.9. Maintenance of Office or Agency. As long as any of the Certificates
remain outstanding, the Issuer shall maintain an office or agency where
Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange, and
where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in respect of the Certificates
and this Agreement may be served. The Issuer hereby initially designates the
Corporate Trust Office of the Certificate Registrar for the purposes of
surrendering Certificates for registration or exchange of Certificates, and the
Corporate Trust Office of the Owner Trustee for all other purposes. The Issuer
shall give prompt written notice to the Certificateholders, the Indenture
Trustee and the Owner Trustee of the location, and of any change in the
location, of any such office or agency. If at any time the Issuer shall fail to
maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Indenture
Trustee and the Owner Trustee with the address thereof, such surrenders, notices
and demands may be made or served at the applicable Corporate Trust Office, and
the Issuer hereby appoints the Owner Trustee as its agent to receive all such
surrenders, notices and demands.

ARTICLE IV

ACTIONS BY OWNER TRUSTEE

SECTION 4.1. Prior Notice to Certificateholders with Respect to Certain Matters.
With respect to the following matters, unless the Administrator notifies the
Owner Trustee that the Indenture, the Purchase Agreement or the Sale and
Servicing Agreement, as applicable, provides that the consent of the
Certificateholders shall not be required, the Owner Trustee shall not take
action unless at least 10 days before the taking of such action (or if 10 days’
advance notice is impracticable, as much advance notice as is practicable), the
Owner Trustee shall have notified the Certificateholders in writing of the
proposed action and within 10 days of such notice (or such shorter time as
specified in such notice) none of the Certificateholders shall have notified the
Owner Trustee in writing that such Certificateholder has withheld consent or
provided alternative direction:

(a) the amendment of the Indenture by a supplemental indenture in circumstances
where the consent of any Noteholder is required;

(b) the amendment of the Indenture by a supplemental indenture in circumstances
where the consent of any Noteholder is not required and such amendment
materially adversely affects the interests of the Certificateholders;

(c) the amendment, change or modification of the Sale and Servicing Agreement,
or the Administration Agreement, except to cure any ambiguity or defect or to
amend or supplement any provision in a manner that would not materially
adversely affect the interests of the Certificateholders; or

or the consent to the assignment by the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee
of its obligations under the Indenture or this Agreement, as applicable.

(a) The Issuer shall not, without the prior written consent of the Owner Trustee

the Issuer. In considering whether to give or withhold written consent to the
Bankruptcy Event by the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, with the consent of the
Certificateholders, shall consider the interests of the Noteholders in addition
to the interests of the Issuer and whether the Issuer is insolvent. The Owner
Trustee shall have no duty to give such written consent to a Bankruptcy Event by
the Issuer if the Owner Trustee shall not have been furnished (at the expense of
the Person that requested such letter be furnished to the Owner Trustee) a
letter from an independent accounting firm of national reputation stating that

such action or inaction would be contrary to any obligation of the Issuer or the
Owner Trustee under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents or would
be contrary to Section 2.3, nor shall the Owner Trustee be obligated to follow
any such direction, if given.

SECTION 4.5. Acts of Certificateholders; Majority Control.

(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or
other action provided by this Agreement to be given or taken by
Certificateholders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments
of substantially similar tenor signed by such Certificateholders in person or by
agents duly appointed in writing; and except as herein otherwise expressly
provided such action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments
are delivered to the Owner Trustee, and, where it is hereby expressly required,
to the Issuer. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein
and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the “Act” of the
Certificateholders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of

made upon such Certificate.

(e) Except as otherwise provided herein, to the extent that there is more than
one Certificateholder, any action which may be taken or consent or instructions

Sections 6.3(a) and 7.1 hereof, the Owner Trustee may act at the written
direction of one or more Certificateholders holding in the aggregate less than
50% of the Percentage Interests. To the extent the Owner Trustee is required to

Certificateholders, and receives conflicting directions from Certificateholders
holding equal Percentage Interests, it shall act in accordance with the
earliest-received such direction.

States federal income tax purposes, the Depositor (or a U.S. affiliate of the
Depositor if the Depositor is ineligible) is hereby designated as the
partnership representative under Section 6223(a) of the Code (and any
corresponding provision of state law) to the extent allowed under the law (and

Issuer shall (or the Depositor shall cause the Issuer to, or the Depositor shall
instruct the Administrator on behalf of the Issuer to), to the extent eligible,
make the election under Section 6221(b) of the Code (and any corresponding

partnership level and take any other action such as disclosures and
notifications necessary to effectuate such election (including working with the
Depositor to designate any designated individual required under the law). If the
election described in the preceding sentence is not available, to the extent
applicable, the Issuer shall (or the Depositor shall cause the Issuer to, or the
Depositor shall instruct the Administrator on behalf of the Issuer to) make the
election under Section 6226(a) of the Code (and any corresponding provision of
state law) with respect to the alternative to payment of imputed underpayment by
partnership and take any other action such as filings, disclosures and
notifications necessary to effectuate such election. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Issuer, Depositor and Administrator are each authorized, in its
sole discretion, to make any available election related to Sections 6221 through
6241 of the Code (and any corresponding provision of state law) and take any
action it deems necessary or appropriate to comply with the requirements of the
Code and conduct the Issuer’s affairs under Sections 6221 through 6241 of the
Code (and any corresponding provision of state law). Each Certificateholder and,
if different, each beneficial owner of a Certificate, shall promptly provide the
Issuer, Depositor and Administrator any requested information, documentation or
material to enable the Issuer to make any of the elections described in this
clause (c) and otherwise comply with Sections 6221 through 6241 of the Code (and

affiliates harmless for any expenses or losses (i) resulting from a beneficial
owner of a Certificate not properly taking into account or paying its allocated
adjustment or liability under Section 6226 of the Code (or any corresponding
provision of state law) or (ii) suffered that are attributable to the management
or defense of an audit under Sections 6221 through 6241 of the Code (or any

Account and all proceeds thereof. Except as otherwise provided herein, in the
Indenture or in the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Certificate Distribution
Account shall be under the sole dominion and control of the Certificate Paying
Agent for the benefit of the Certificateholders. If, at any time, the
Certificate Distribution Account ceases to be an Eligible Account, the Servicer
on behalf of the Issuer, shall, within ten (10) Business Days (or such longer
period) after becoming aware of the fact, establish a new Certificate
Distribution Account as an Eligible Account and shall direct the Certificate

SECTION 5.5. Withholding.

(a) If any withholding tax is imposed on the Issuer’s payment, distribution or
allocation of income to a Certificateholder, such tax shall reduce the amount
otherwise distributable to the Certificateholder in accordance with this
Section 5.5; provided that the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the
Certificate Paying Agent shall not have an obligation to withhold any such
amount if and for so long as the Seller or a U.S. Affiliate of the Seller is the
sole Certificateholder. The Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the
Certificate Paying Agent is hereby authorized and directed to retain from
amounts otherwise distributable to the Certificateholders sufficient funds for
the payment of any tax that is legally owed by the Issuer (but such
authorization shall not prevent the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the
Certificate Paying Agent from contesting any such tax in appropriate proceedings
and withholding payment of such tax, if permitted by law, pending the outcome of
such proceedings). The amount of any withholding tax imposed with respect to a
Certificateholder shall be treated as cash distributed to such Certificateholder
at the time it is withheld by the Issuer and remitted to the appropriate taxing
authority. If there is a possibility that withholding tax is payable with
respect to a payment, distribution or allocation of income, the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent may in its sole discretion
withhold such amounts in accordance with this Section 5.5.

(b) With respect to any and all payments to a Certificateholder, (i) the
Certificateholder will provide to the applicable withholding agent (including
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent), any
documentation or certification required or reasonably appropriate for the such
withholding agent to satisfy its obligations with respect to FATCA, if any, and
to determine whether any withholding tax may be required to be withheld pursuant
to FATCA; and (ii) the Certificateholder acknowledges and agrees that the
applicable withholding agent (including, if applicable, the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent) shall have the right to
deduct and withhold any required U.S. withholding tax, including any withholding
tax pursuant to FATCA, on any amounts payable with respect to the Certificates
(without any corresponding gross-up or other indemnification) if any such
Certificateholder or beneficial owner either is subject to withholding under
FATCA, fails to comply with the documentation requirements in clause (i), or
otherwise fails to establish a complete exemption from such withholding tax to
the reasonable satisfaction of the applicable withholding agent (including, if
applicable, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Paying Agent).

SECTION 5.6. Preservation of Information; Communications to Certificateholders.

(a) The Certificate Registrar shall preserve, in as current a form as is
reasonably practicable, the names and addresses of Certificateholders received
in its capacity as the Certificate Registrar and provide a copy thereof to the
Owner Trustee and Certificate Paying Agent; provided, however, that so long as
the Certificate Paying Agent is the Certificate Registrar, no list separate from
the Certificate Register shall be required to be provided to the Certificate
Paying Agent.

(b) The Certificateholders may communicate with other Certificateholders with
respect to their rights under this Agreement or under the Certificates. Upon
receipt by the Certificate Registrar of any written request by three or more
Certificateholders or by one or more Certificateholders holding in the aggregate
more than 25% of the Percentage Interests to receive a copy of the most current
list of Certificateholders together with a copy of the communication that the
applicant proposes to send, the Certificate Registrar shall, at the expense of
the Issuer, distribute such list to the requesting Certificateholders; provided,
that the Certificate Registrar may elect not to afford the requesting
Certificateholders access to the list of Certificateholders if it agrees to mail
the desired communication or proxy, on behalf of and at the expense of the
requesting Certificateholders, to all Certificateholders.

(c) The Certificate Registrar shall promptly give notice to each
Certificateholder of any change in the Indenture Trustee’s website pursuant to
which the statement pursuant to Section 4.6 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement
is made available of which it has been provided notice pursuant to Section 4.6
of the Sale and Servicing Agreement.

SECTION 5.7. Rule 144A Information. At any time when the Issuer is not subject
to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and is not exempt from reporting
pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act, upon the request of a
Certificateholder, the Seller shall promptly furnish or cause to be furnished
Rule 144A Information to such Certificateholder, to a prospective purchaser of
such Certificate designated by such Certificateholder or to the Certificate
Registrar for delivery to such Certificateholder or a prospective purchaser
designated by such Certificateholder in order to permit compliance by such
Certificateholder with Rule 144A in connection with the resale of such
Certificate by such Certificateholder.

ARTICLE VI

AUTHORITY AND DUTIES OF OWNER TRUSTEE

SECTION 6.1. General Authority. The Owner Trustee is authorized and directed to
execute and deliver (i) the Transaction Documents to which the Issuer is named
as a party and (ii) each certificate or other document attached as an exhibit to
or contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which the Issuer or the Owner
Trustee is named as a party and any amendment thereto, in each case, in such
form as the Seller shall approve, as evidenced conclusively by the Owner
Trustee’s execution thereof, and at the written direction of the Seller, to

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

but shall not be obligated, to take all actions required of the Issuer pursuant
to the Transaction Documents. The Owner Trustee is further authorized from time
to time to take such action as the Seller, the Administrator or the Majority
Certificateholders direct in writing with respect to the Transaction Documents,
except to the extent that this Agreement expressly requires the consent of each
Certificateholder for such action.

SECTION 6.2. General Duties. It shall be the duty of the Owner Trustee to
discharge (or cause to be discharged) all of its express responsibilities under
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to have
discharged its duties and responsibilities hereunder and under the Transaction
Documents to the extent the Administrator has agreed in the Administration
Agreement to perform any act or to discharge any duty of the Issuer or the Owner
Trustee hereunder or under any Transaction Document, and the Owner Trustee shall
not be liable for the default or failure of the Administrator to carry out its
obligations under the Administration Agreement and shall have no duty to monitor
the performance of the Administrator or any other Person under the
Administration Agreement or any other document. The Owner Trustee shall have no
obligation to administer, service or collect the Receivables or to maintain,
monitor or otherwise supervise the administration, servicing or collection of
the Receivables.

SECTION 6.3. Action upon Instruction.

(a) Subject to Article IV, and in accordance with the Transaction Documents, the
Certificateholders may, by written instruction, direct the Owner Trustee or the
Administrator in the management of the Issuer. Such direction may be exercised
at any time by written instruction of the Certificateholders pursuant to Article
IV. The Owner Trustee shall not be required to take any discretionary action to
investigate or review any matter without direction from the Majority
Certificateholders. Further, with respect to provisions hereunder that provide
for instruction by the Certificateholders, for so long as all outstanding
Certificates are Book-Entry Certificates, if the Owner Trustee shall have
notified the Certificateholders in writing of a proposed action and within 15
Business Days of such notice none of the Certificateholders shall have notified
the Owner Trustee in writing that such Certificateholder has withheld consent or
provided alternative instruction, the Owner Trustee, in the place of
Certificateholder instruction hereunder, may accept and rely on written
instruction of the Administrator. If subsequently the Owner Trustee receives
alternative written instruction from the Certificateholders, such subsequent
instruction shall control.

(b) The Owner Trustee shall not be required to take any action hereunder or
under any Transaction Document if the Owner Trustee shall have reasonably
determined or been advised by counsel that such action is likely to result in
liability on the part of the Owner Trustee or is contrary to the terms hereof or
of any Transaction Document or is otherwise contrary to law.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is unable to decide between alternative courses
of action permitted or required by the terms of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document or is unsure as to the application of any provision of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document or any such provision is ambiguous as to
its application, or is, or appears to be, in conflict with any other applicable
provision, or in the event that this Agreement permits any determination by the
Owner Trustee or is silent or is incomplete as to the course of action that the
Owner Trustee is required to take with respect to a particular set of facts, or
more than one methodology can be used to make any determination or calculation
to be performed by the Owner Trustee hereunder, the Owner Trustee shall promptly
give notice (in such form as shall be appropriate under the circumstances) to
the Certificateholders requesting instruction as to the course of action to be
adopted or application of such provision, and to the extent the Owner Trustee
acts or refrains from acting in good faith in accordance with any written
instruction of the Majority Certificateholders (or, if specifically required
hereunder, all Certificateholders) received, the Owner Trustee shall not be
liable on account of such action or inaction to any Person. If the Owner Trustee
shall not have received appropriate instruction within ten days of such notice
(or within such shorter period of time as reasonably may be specified in such
notice or may be necessary under the circumstances) it may, but shall be under
no duty to, take or refrain from taking any action and shall have no liability
to any Person for such action or inaction. For the avoidance of doubt, the Owner
Trustee shall be fully protected by the indemnification provisions applicable to
it under this Agreement in connection with any action the Owner Trustee takes or
refrains from taking in accordance with this paragraph.

SECTION 6.4. No Duties Except as Specified in this Agreement or in Instructions.
The Owner Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to manage, make any
payment with respect to, register, record, sell, dispose of, or otherwise deal
with the Trust Estate, or to otherwise take or refrain from taking any action
under, or in connection with, any document contemplated hereby to which the
Issuer or the Owner Trustee is a party, except as expressly provided by the
terms of this Agreement or in any document or written instruction received by
the Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 6.3; and no implied duties (including
fiduciary duties existing at law or in equity) or obligations shall be read into
this Agreement or any Transaction Document against the Owner Trustee. The Owner
Trustee shall have no responsibility for the preparation, correctness, accuracy,
existence, or filing of any financing or continuation statement in any public
office at any time or the validity, existence, perfection or maintenance of the
perfection of any security interest or lien granted to it or to the Issuer
hereunder or under any Transaction Document, nor shall the Owner Trustee have
any responsibility to monitor the performance of any collateral, or to prepare
or file any tax (subject to Section 5.3(a)), qualification to do business,
license, Commission or other securities law filing, or other regulatory filing
or report for the Issuer, or to record this Agreement or any Transaction
Document, or to monitor or enforce the satisfaction of any risk retention
requirement or other regulatory requirement applicable to the Issuer in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. The
Owner Trustee shall have no responsibility, duty, obligation or liability with
respect to any transition event for an interest rate index/benchmark,
determining an alternative index/benchmark, nor shall it have any involvement in
connection with the cessation or replacement of an index/benchmark, including
providing, obtaining, or calculating any index, alternative rate, benchmark or
adjustment factors or any other matters related to or arising in connection with
the foregoing. Wells Fargo nevertheless agrees that it will, at its own cost and
expense, promptly take all action as may be necessary to discharge any Liens on

at the office of the Certificate Registrar therein specified. The Certificate
Registrar shall give such notice to the Owner Trustee (if other than the

Certificates for cancellation within six (6) months after the date specified in
the above mentioned written notice, the Certificate Registrar shall give a
second written notice to the remaining Certificateholders to surrender their

knowledge of any other claim against the Issuer, shall be deemed to have made
reasonable provision to pay all claims and obligations (including conditional,
contingent or unmatured obligations) for purposes of Section 3808(e) of the
Statutory Trust Statute. The Certificate Paying Agent, upon surrender of the
outstanding Certificates shall distribute the remaining Trust Estate (if any) in
accordance with Article V hereof and, at the written direction and expense of
the Administrator, the Owner Trustee shall cause the Certificate of Trust to be
cancelled by filing a certificate of cancellation with the Delaware Secretary of

shall at all times be a Person (i) authorized to exercise corporate trust

(iii) subject to supervision or examination by Federal or state authorities. If
such Person shall publish reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to
law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority,
then for the purpose of this Section 10.1, the combined capital and surplus of
such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set
forth in its most recent report of condition so published. The Owner Trustee
shall at all times be a Person satisfying the provisions of Section 3807(a) of

appoint a successor Owner Trustee which satisfies the eligibility requirements
set forth in Section 10.1 by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which

appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the giving of such
notice of resignation, the resigning Owner Trustee may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Owner Trustee;
provided, however, that such right to appoint or to petition for the appointment
of any such successor shall in no event relieve the resigning Owner Trustee from
any obligations otherwise imposed on it under the Transaction Documents until
such successor has in fact assumed such appointment.

If at any time the Owner Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with
the provisions of Section 10.1 and shall fail to resign after written request
therefor by the Seller or the Administrator, or if at any time the Owner Trustee
shall be legally unable to act, or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or a
receiver of the Owner Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any
public officer shall take charge or control of the Owner Trustee or of its
property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
liquidation, then the Seller or the Administrator may remove the Owner Trustee.
If the Seller or the Administrator shall remove the Owner Trustee under the
authority of the immediately preceding sentence, the Seller and the
Administrator, acting jointly, shall promptly appoint a successor Owner Trustee
by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be
delivered to the outgoing Owner Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor
Owner Trustee and shall pay all fees owed to the outgoing Owner Trustee.

with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor under
this Agreement, with like effect as if originally named as the Owner Trustee.
The predecessor Owner Trustee shall upon payment of its fees and expenses
deliver to the successor Owner Trustee all documents and statements and monies
held by it under this Agreement; and the Seller and the predecessor Owner
Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as
may reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the
successor Owner Trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations.

No successor Owner Trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this
Section 10.3 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Owner Trustee
shall be eligible pursuant to Section 10.1.

Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Owner Trustee pursuant to this
Section 10.3, the Seller shall mail (or shall cause to be mailed) notice of the
successor of such Owner Trustee to the Certificateholders, Indenture Trustee,
the Noteholders and each of the Rating Agencies. If the Seller shall fail to
mail (or cause to be mailed) such notice within 10 days after acceptance of
appointment by the successor Owner Trustee, the successor Owner Trustee shall
cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Seller. Any successor Owner
Trustee appointed pursuant to this Section 10.3 shall promptly file an amendment
to the Certificate of Trust with the Delaware Secretary of State identifying the
name and principal place of business of such successor Owner Trustee in the
State of Delaware.

succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of the
Owner Trustee, shall, without the execution or filing of any instrument or any
further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, be the successor of the Owner Trustee hereunder;
provided that such Person shall be eligible pursuant to Section 10.1; and
provided further that the Owner Trustee shall file an amendment to the
Certificate of Trust of the Issuer, if required by applicable law, and mail
notice of such merger or consolidation to the Seller and the Administrator.

SECTION 10.5. Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee. Notwithstanding any
other provisions of this Agreement, at any time, for the purpose of avoiding
conflicts of interests or enforcement actions, meeting any legal requirements of
any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Estate may at the time be
located or other jurisdictional issues, or for such other purposes as may arise,
the Seller and the Owner Trustee acting jointly shall have the power and shall
execute and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by
the Owner Trustee to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Owner Trustee, or
separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the Trust Estate,
and to vest in such Person, in such capacity, such title to the Trust Estate, or
any part thereof, and, subject to the other provisions of this Section 10.5,
such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Seller and the Owner
Trustee may consider necessary or desirable. If the Seller shall not have joined
in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request to do
so, the Owner Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment. No
co-trustee or separate trustee under this Agreement shall be required to meet
the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee pursuant to Section 10.1 and no
notice of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee shall be
required pursuant to Section 10.3.

Each separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
appointed and act subject to the following provisions and conditions:

(i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the
Owner Trustee may be conferred upon and exercised or performed by such separate
trustee singly or by the Owner Trustee and such co-trustee jointly (it being
understood that such co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the
Owner Trustee joining in such act, except to the extent that under any law of
any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed, the
Owner Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts,
in which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the
holding of title to the Trust Estate or any portion thereof in any such
jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed singly by such co-trustee, but
solely at the direction of the Administrator);

(ii) no trustee under this Agreement shall be personally liable by reason of any
act or omission of any other trustee under this Agreement; and

(iii) the Seller and the Owner Trustee acting jointly may at any time accept the
resignation of or remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.

Any notice, request or other writing given to the Owner Trustee shall be deemed
to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees, as
effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any
separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions
of this Article. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance of
the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in
its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Owner Trustee or
separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this
Agreement, specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to
the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the
Owner Trustee. Each such instrument shall be filed with the Owner Trustee and
copies thereof given to the Seller and the Administrator.

If any separate trustee or co-trustee shall become incapable of acting, resign
or be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall
vest in the Owner Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the
appointment of a new or successor trustee. The Owner Trustee shall have no
obligation to determine whether a co-trustee or separate trustee is legally
required in any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Estate may be
located. The Owner Trustee shall not have any responsibility or liability for or
with respect to, and shall not be required to supervise or monitor, any separate
trustee or co-trustee duly appointed hereunder unless otherwise expressly
required by the instrument of appointment.

Seller shall provide written notification of the substance of such amendment to
each Rating Agency and the Indenture Trustee; and promptly after the execution
of any such amendment, the Seller shall furnish a copy of such amendment to each

of the Trust Estate.

are solely for the benefit of the Owner Trustee, the Seller, the Administrator,
the Certificateholders and, to the extent expressly provided herein, the
Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders, and nothing in this Agreement, whether
express or implied, shall be construed to give to any other Person any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim in the Trust Estate or under or in respect of

parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and

the appointment of an administrator, a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian
or other similar official with respect to such Bankruptcy Remote Party or any
substantial part of its property or to consent to any such relief or to the

Trustee authorize, institute or join in any bankruptcy or similar Proceeding
described in the preceding sentence other than in accordance with Section 4.3.

(b) The Seller’s obligations under this Agreement are obligations solely of the
Seller and will not constitute a claim against the Seller to the extent that the
Seller does not have funds sufficient to make payment of such obligations. In
furtherance of and not in derogation of the foregoing, the Owner Trustee (in its
individual capacity and as the Owner Trustee), each Certificateholder, by
accepting a Certificate, and the Indenture Trustee and each Noteholder or Note
Owner, by accepting the benefits of this Agreement, hereby acknowledges and
agrees that such Person has no right, title or interest in or to the Other
Assets of the Seller. To the extent that, notwithstanding the agreements and
provisions contained in the preceding sentence, each of the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee, each Noteholder or Note Owner and each Certificateholder
either (i) asserts an interest or claim to, or benefit from, Other Assets, or
(ii) is deemed to have any such interest, claim to, or benefit in or from Other
Assets, whether by operation of law, legal process, pursuant to applicable
provisions of insolvency laws or otherwise (including by virtue of
Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any successor provision having similar
effect under the Bankruptcy Code), then such Person further acknowledges and
agrees that any such interest, claim or benefit in or from Other Assets is and
will be expressly subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full of all other
obligations and liabilities, which, under the terms of the relevant documents
relating to the securitization or conveyance of such Other Assets, are entitled
to be paid from, entitled to the benefits of, or otherwise secured by such Other
Assets (whether or not any such entitlement or security interest is legally
perfected or otherwise entitled to a priority of distributions or application
under applicable law, including insolvency laws, and whether or not asserted
against the Seller), including the payment of post-petition interest on such
other obligations and liabilities. This subordination agreement will be deemed a
subordination agreement within the meaning of Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code. Each of the Owner Trustee (in its individual capacity and as the Owner
Trustee), by entering into or accepting this Agreement, each Certificateholder,
by accepting a Certificate, and the Indenture Trustee and each Noteholder or
Note Owner, by accepting the benefits of this Agreement, hereby further
acknowledges and agrees that no adequate remedy at law exists for a breach of
this Section 11.8 and the terms of this Section 11.8 may be enforced by an
action for specific performance. The provisions of this Section 11.8 will be for
the third party benefit of those entitled to rely thereon and will survive the
