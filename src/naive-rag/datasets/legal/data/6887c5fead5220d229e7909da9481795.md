The Receivables

SECTION 3.01 Representations and Warranties of the Seller with Respect to the

Schedule I to this Agreement as to the Receivables on which the Issuer is deemed
to have relied in acquiring the Receivables. Such representations and warranties
speak as of the Closing Date or as of such date expressly set forth therein, but
shall survive the sale, transfer and assignment of the Receivables to the Issuer
and the pledge thereof to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.

SECTION 3.02 Repurchase upon Breach. The Seller, the Servicer, the Issuer, the
Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee, as the case may be, shall inform the
other parties to this Agreement and the Indenture Trustee promptly, in writing,
upon the discovery of any breach of the Seller’s representations and warranties
pursuant to Section 3.01 that materially and adversely affects the interests of
the Securityholders in any Receivable; provided, that the delivery of the
Servicer’s Certificate pursuant to Section 4.08 shall be deemed to constitute
prompt written notice by the Servicer of such breach. If the breach materially
and adversely affects the interests of the Securityholders in such Receivable,
then the Seller shall either (a) correct or cure such breach or (b) repurchase
such Receivable from the Issuer, in either case on or before the Distribution
Date following the end of the Collection Period which includes the 60th day (or,
if the Seller elects, an earlier date) after the date that the Seller became
aware or was notified of such breach. Any such breach or failure will be deemed
not to have a material and adverse effect on the interests of Securityholders if
such breach or failure does not affect the ability of the Issuer to receive and
retain timely payment in full on such Receivable. In consideration of the
purchase of the Receivables, the Seller shall remit (or cause to be remitted)
the Repurchase Payment in the manner specified in Section 5.05. Upon payment of
such Repurchase Payment by the Seller, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee
shall release and shall execute and deliver such instruments of release,
transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse or representation, as

any breach of the Seller’s representations and warranties unless an Authorized
Officer has actual knowledge thereof or has received written notice thereof in
accordance with the Basic Documents. Neither the Owner Trustee nor the Indenture
Trustee will have any duty to conduct an affirmative investigation as to the
occurrence of any condition requiring the repurchase of any Receivable pursuant
to this Section 3.02. The sole remedy of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee (by
operation

 

   25    (NAROT 2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of the assignment of the Issuer’s rights hereunder pursuant to the Indenture),
or any Securityholder with respect to a breach with a material adverse effect on

warranties pursuant to Section 3.01, shall be to require the Seller to
repurchase Receivables pursuant to this Section 3.02.

SECTION 3.03 Duties of Servicer as Custodian.

(a) Safekeeping. The Servicer, in its capacity as custodian, shall hold the
Receivable Files for the benefit of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, as
pledgee of the Issuer. In performing its duties as custodian, the Servicer shall

promptly report to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee any failure on its part
to hold a material portion of the Receivable Files and maintain its accounts,
records and computer systems as herein provided in all material respects and
promptly take appropriate action to remedy any such material failure. The
Servicer may, in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices: (i) maintain
all or a portion of the Receivable Files in electronic form and (ii) maintain
custody of all or any portion of the Receivable Files with one or more of its
agents or designees. Nothing in this Section 3.03 shall affect the obligation of
the Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting disclosure of information
regarding the Obligors and the failure of the Servicer to provide access to
information as a result of such obligation shall not constitute a breach of this
Section 3.03.

(b) Maintenance of and Access to Records. The Servicer shall maintain each
Receivable File in the United States (it being understood that the Receivable
Files, or any part thereof, may be maintained at the offices of any Person to
whom the Servicer has delegated responsibilities in accordance with

Trustee or their respective duly authorized representatives, attorneys or
auditors the Receivable Files and the related accounts, records and computer
systems maintained by the Servicer at such times during normal business hours

shall instruct. The Servicer shall permit the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and
their respective agents at any time during normal business hours upon reasonable
prior written notice to inspect, audit and make copies of and abstracts from the
Servicer’s records regarding any Receivable.

instruction from the Indenture Trustee, release any Receivable File to the
Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee’s agent or the Indenture Trustee’s
designee, as the case may be, at such place or places as the Indenture Trustee

all liabilities, obligations, losses, compensatory damages, payments, costs or

expenses) that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any of them as
the result of any improper act or omission in any way relating to the
maintenance and custody by the Servicer as custodian of the Receivable Files
including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
enforcement by any such Person of any indemnification or other obligation of the
Servicer as custodian; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not be liable
to the Owner Trustee for any portion of any such amount resulting from the
willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of the Owner Trustee, and the
Servicer shall not be liable to the Indenture Trustee for any portion of any
such amount resulting from the willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of
the Indenture Trustee. Any indemnity claimed under this Section 3.05 shall be
subject to the procedures described in Section 7.02.

SECTION 3.06 Effective Period and Termination. The Servicer’s appointment as
custodian shall become effective as of the Cut-off Date, and shall continue in
full force and effect until terminated pursuant to this Section 3.06. If NMAC
resigns as Servicer in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or if
all of the rights and obligations of any Servicer shall have been terminated
under Section 8.01, the appointment of NMAC as custodian may be terminated by
the Indenture Trustee or by the Holders of Notes evidencing not less than 25% of
the Outstanding Amount of the Notes or, with the consent of Holders of the Notes
evidencing not less than 25% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, by the
Owner Trustee or by the Certificateholders evidencing not less than 25% of the

(a) The Servicer is hereby appointed by the Issuer and authorized to act as
agent for the Issuer and, in such capacity, shall manage, service, administer
and make collections on the Receivables in accordance with its Customary
Servicing Practices, using that degree of skill and attention that the Servicer
exercises with respect to all comparable receivables that it services for itself
or others. There are no requirements under the Basic Documents to maintain a

practice or promotion or any sale of any products, goods or services to Obligors
with respect to the Receivables so long as such

 

   27    (NAROT 2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

practices, promotions or sales are offered to obligors of comparable motor
vehicle receivables serviced by the Servicer for itself and others, whether or
not such practices, promotions or sales might result in a decrease in the
aggregate amount of payments on the Receivables, prepayments or faster or slower
timing of the payment of the Receivables. Subject to Section 4.05, the Servicer
may grant extensions, rebates, deferrals, amendments, modifications or
adjustments with respect to any Receivable in accordance with its Customary
Servicing Practices; provided, however, that if the Servicer (i) extends the
date for final payment by the Obligor of any Receivable beyond the last day of
the Collection Period preceding the latest Final Scheduled Distribution Date of
any Notes issued under the Indenture or (ii) reduces the APR or Principal
Balance with respect to any Receivable other than as required by applicable law
(including, without limitation, by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act) or court
order, it will promptly purchase such Receivable in the manner provided in
Section 4.06 if such change in the Receivable would materially and adversely
affect the interests of the Securityholders in such Receivable. The Servicer may
in its discretion waive any late payment charge or any other fees that may be
collected in the ordinary course of servicing a Receivable.

(b) The Servicer’s duties shall include collection and posting of all payments,
responding to inquiries of Obligors on the Receivables, investigating
delinquencies, sending remittance advises to Obligors, reporting tax information
to Obligors, accounting for collections and furnishing monthly and annual
statements to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee with respect to
distributions. The Servicer is not required under the Basic Documents to make
any disbursements via wire transfer or otherwise on behalf of an Obligor. There
are no requirements under the Receivables or the Basic Documents for funds to
be, and funds shall not be, held in trust for an Obligor. The Servicer shall not
make any payments or distributions on behalf of an Obligor.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer is authorized
and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of itself, the Trust, the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Securityholders or any of them, any and
all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or partial or full release or
discharge, and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Receivables
or to the Financed Vehicles securing the Receivables. If the Servicer shall
commence a legal proceeding to enforce a Receivable (other than a Repurchased
Receivable), the Issuer shall thereupon be deemed to have automatically
assigned, solely for the purpose of collection, such Receivable to the Servicer.
If in any enforcement suit or legal proceeding it shall be held that the
Servicer may not enforce a Receivable on the ground that it shall not be a real
party in interest or a holder entitled to enforce such Receivable, the Issuer
shall, at the Servicer’s expense and direction, take steps to enforce the
Receivable, including bringing suit in its name or the name of the Indenture
Trustee or the Securityholders. The Issuer shall furnish the Servicer with any
powers of attorney and other documents reasonably necessary or appropriate to
enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties
hereunder.

 

   28    (NAROT 2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d) Nothing in any section of this Agreement shall be construed to prevent the
Servicer from implementing new programs, whether on an intermediate, pilot or
permanent basis, or on a regional or nationwide basis, or from modifying its
standards, policies and procedures as long as, in each case, such programs or
modifications would be consistent with its Customary Servicing Practices, even
if such practices, promotions or sales might result in a decrease in the
aggregate amount of payments on the Receivables, prepaying or faster or slower
timing of the payment of the Receivables.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Servicer may
refinance any Receivable and deposit the full Principal Balance of such
Receivable into the Collection Account. The receivable created by such
refinancing shall not be property of the Issuer. The Servicer and its Affiliates
may also sell insurance or debt cancellation products, including products which
result in the cancellation of some or all of the amount of a Receivable upon the
death or disability of the Obligor or any casualty with respect to the Financed
Vehicle.

SECTION 4.02 Collection of Receivable Payments. The Servicer shall make
reasonable efforts to collect all payments called for under the terms and
provisions of the Receivables as and when the same shall become due in
accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices. Payments on the Receivables
made in accordance with the related documentation for such Receivables, shall be
posted to the Servicer’s Obligor records in accordance with the Servicer’s
Customary Servicing Practices. Such payments shall be allocated to principal,
interest or other items in accordance with the related documentation for such
Receivables

SECTION 4.03 Realization upon Receivables. On behalf of the Issuer, the Servicer
shall use commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with its Customary
Servicing Practices, to repossess or otherwise convert the ownership of the
Financed Vehicle securing any Receivable as to which the Servicer shall have
determined eventual payment in full is unlikely, unless it determines in its
sole discretion that repossession will not increase the Net Liquidation Proceeds
by an amount greater than the expense of such repossession or that the proceeds
ultimately recoverable with respect to such Receivable would be increased by
forbearance. The Servicer shall follow such Customary Servicing Practices and
procedures as it shall deem necessary or advisable, which may include reasonable
efforts to realize upon any Dealer Recourse and selling the related Financed
Vehicle at public or private sale. The foregoing shall be subject to the
provision that, in any case in which the Financed Vehicle shall have suffered
damage, the Servicer shall not be required to expend funds in connection with
the repair or the repossession of such Financed Vehicle unless it shall
determine in its discretion that such repair and/or repossession will increase
the Net Liquidation Proceeds.

SECTION 4.04 Maintenance of Security Interests in Financed Vehicles. The
Servicer shall, in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices, take such
steps as are necessary to maintain perfection of the security interest created
by each Receivable in the related Financed Vehicle. The Servicer is hereby
authorized to take such steps as are necessary to re-perfect such security
interest on behalf of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee in the event of the
relocation of a Financed Vehicle or for any other reason. If the assignment of a
Receivable to the Issuer is insufficient, without a notation on the related
Financed Vehicle’s Certificate of Title, to grant to the Issuer a first priority
perfected security interest in the related Financed Vehicle, the Servicer hereby
agrees to serve as the agent of the Issuer for the purpose of perfecting the
security interest of the Issuer in such Financed Vehicle and agrees that the
Servicer’s listing as the secured party

 

   29    (NAROT 2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

on the Certificate of Title is in this capacity as agent of the Issuer. The
provisions set forth in this Section 4.04 are the sole requirements under the
Basic Documents with respect to the maintenance of collateral or security on the
Receivables. It is understood that the Financed Vehicles are the collateral and
security for the Receivables, but that the Certificate of Title with respect to
a Financed Vehicle does not constitute collateral and merely evidences such
security interest.

SECTION 4.05 Covenants of Servicer. Unless required by law or court order, the
Servicer shall not release the Financed Vehicle securing any Receivable from the
security interest granted by such Receivable in whole or in part except (i) in
the event of payment in full by or on behalf of the Obligor thereunder or
payment in full less a deficiency which the Servicer would not attempt to
collect in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices, (ii) in connection
with repossession or (iii) except as may be required by an insurer in order to
receive proceeds from any insurance policy covering such Financed Vehicle.

SECTION 4.06 Purchase of Receivables upon Breach. The Servicer or the Issuer
shall inform the other party and the Indenture Trustee promptly, in writing,
upon the discovery of any breach by the Servicer of its obligations under
Section 4.01(a) or 4.05 that would materially and adversely affect any
Receivable. If the breach materially and adversely affects the interests of the
Securityholders in such Receivable, then the Servicer shall either (a) correct
or cure such breach or (b) repurchase such Receivable from the Issuer, in either
case on or before the Distribution Date following the end of the Collection
Period which includes the 60th day (or, if the Servicer elects, an earlier date)
after the date that the Servicer became aware or was notified of such breach.
Any such breach or failure will be deemed not to have a material and adverse
effect if such breach or failure does not affect the ability of the Issuer to
receive and retain timely payment in full on such Receivable. In consideration
of such Receivable, the Servicer shall remit the Repurchase Payment in the
manner specified in Section 5.05. Upon payment of such Repurchase Payment by the
Servicer, the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee shall release and shall execute
and deliver such instruments of release, transfer or assignment, in each case
without recourse or representation, as shall be reasonably requested of it to
vest in the Servicer or its designee any Receivable and any related Purchased
Assets repurchased pursuant hereto. Neither the Owner Trustee nor the Indenture
Trustee will have any duty to conduct an affirmative investigation as to the
occurrence of any condition requiring the repurchase of any Receivable pursuant
to this Section 4.06. The sole remedy of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner
Trustee, the Issuer, the Securityholders against the Servicer with respect to a
breach by the Servicer of its obligations under Sections 4.01(a) or 4.05 shall
be to require the Servicer to purchase Receivables pursuant to this
Section 4.06.

SECTION 4.07 Servicing Fee and Expenses. As compensation for the performance of
its obligations hereunder, the Servicer shall be entitled to receive on each
Distribution Date the Base Servicing Fee and shall be entitled to retain all
Supplemental Servicing Fees. The Servicer will also be entitled to receive
investment earnings (net of investment losses and expenses) on funds on deposit
in the Collection Account and the Reserve Account during each Collection Period.
Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, the Servicer shall be required
to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities under this
Agreement (including fees and disbursements of independent accountants, taxes
imposed on the Servicer, expenses incurred in connection with distributions and
reports to Securityholders and all other fees and expenses not expressly stated
under this Agreement to be for the account of the Securityholders).

Servicer shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, each Paying Agent and the Indenture
Trustee, with a copy to each Rating Agency, a Servicer’s Certificate containing
all information necessary to make the distributions pursuant to Sections 5.06,

information in any Servicer’s Certificate and shall have no duty to confirm or
verify the contents thereof. At the sole option of the Servicer, each Servicer
Certificate may be delivered in electronic or hard copy form.

SECTION 4.09 Communication among Noteholders. A Noteholder (if the Notes are
represented by Definitive Notes) or a Note Owner (if the Notes are represented
by Book-Entry Notes) may send a request to the Seller at any time notifying the
Seller that such Noteholder or Note Owner, as applicable, would like to
communicate with other Noteholders or Note Owners, as applicable, with respect
to an exercise of their rights under the terms of the Basic Documents. If the
requesting party is not a Noteholder as reflected on the Note Register, the
Seller may require that the requesting party provide Verification Documents.
Each request must include (i) the name of the requesting Noteholder or Note
Owner, and (ii) a description of the method by which other Noteholders or Note
Owners, as applicable, may contact the requesting Noteholder or Note Owner. A
Noteholder or Note Owner, as applicable, that delivers a request under this
Section 4.09 will be deemed to have certified to the Issuer and the Servicer
that its request to communicate with other Noteholders or Note Owners, as
applicable, relates solely to a possible exercise of rights under this Indenture
or the other Basic Documents, and will not be used for other purposes. In each
monthly distribution report on Form 10-D under the Exchange Act with respect to
the Issuer, the Seller shall include disclosure regarding any request that
complies with the requirements of this Section 4.09 received during the related
Collection Period from a Noteholder or Note Owner to communicate with other
Noteholders or Note Owners, as applicable, related to the Noteholders or Note
Owners exercising their rights under the terms of the Basic Documents. The
disclosure in such Form 10-D regarding the request to communicate shall include

received, (y) a statement to the effect that the Issuer has received a request
from such Noteholder or Note Owner, as applicable, stating that such Noteholder
or Note Owner, as applicable, is interested in communicating with other
Noteholders or Note Owners, as applicable, with regard to the possible exercise
of rights under the Basic Documents, and (z) a description of the method other
Noteholders or Note Owners, as applicable, may use to contact the requesting

Servicer Default under Section 8.01. Except to the extent set forth in this

the Servicer, the Seller or their respective Affiliates) to furnish to the

attestation report on assessments of compliance with the Servicing Criteria with
respect to the Servicer or any Affiliate thereof during the related fiscal year
delivered by such accountants pursuant to paragraph (c) of Rule 13a-18 or Rule
15d-18 of the Exchange Act and Item 1122 of Regulation AB. The certification

other procedures or attestation standards which are now or in the future in use
by servicers of comparable assets, or which otherwise comply with any rule,
regulation, “no action” letter or similar guidance promulgated by the

The Servicer, however, shall not be obligated to add as an addressee or reliance

of its duties under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates or (b) specific

however, that no such delegation or subcontracting shall relieve the Servicer of
its responsibilities with respect to such duties as to which the Servicer shall

delegated to third parties in accordance with this Section 4.12, the Servicer

(collectively, the “Accounts”) shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
laws, rules and regulations and as directed by the Servicer, be invested by the
Indenture Trustee in Eligible Investments in accordance with Section 8.03 of the
Indenture. All such Eligible Investments shall mature not later than the
Business Day preceding the next Distribution Date, in such manner that such
amounts invested shall be available to make the required distributions on the
Distribution Date. The Servicer will not direct the Indenture Trustee, and the
Issuer shall cause the Servicer not to make any investment of any funds or to
sell any investment held in the Collection Account unless the security interest
granted and perfected in such account will continue to be perfected in such
investment or the proceeds of such sale, in either case without any further
action by any Person, and, in connection with any direction to the Indenture
Trustee to make any such investment or sale, if requested by the Indenture
Trustee, the Servicer shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel, acceptable to the Indenture Trustee, to such effect.

(c) If either (i) the Servicer, in its sole discretion and for any reason,
notifies the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee in writing that the
Accounts should be moved or (ii) the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as
applicable, notifies the Servicer that the short-term unsecured debt obligations
of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as applicable, no longer have the

Business Days after receipt of the notice described in clause (i) or (ii), as
applicable, cause the Accounts (x) to be moved to segregated trust accounts in a
bank or trust company selected by the Servicer, the short-term unsecured debt
obligations of which shall have the Required Deposit Rating, or (y) to be moved
to the trust department of the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as
applicable. The Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as applicable, shall
assist the Servicer with the moving of Accounts described in the preceding
sentence.

(d) Earnings on investment of funds in the Collection Account and the Reserve
Account shall be paid to the Servicer as additional servicing compensation, and
any losses and investment expenses shall be charged against the funds on deposit
in the Collection Account or the Reserve Account, as applicable.

(e) Except for the Collection Account and the Reserve Account, there are no
accounts required to be maintained under the Basic Documents.

(f) The Indenture Trustee shall transfer all amounts remaining on deposit in the
Collection Account on the Distribution Date on which the Notes of all Classes
have been paid in full (or when substantially all of the Collateral is otherwise
released from the lien of the Indenture) to the Designated Account, and take all
necessary or appropriate actions to transfer all of its right, title and
interest in the Collection Account, all funds or investments held therein and
all proceeds thereof, whether or not on behalf of the Securityholders, to the
Owner Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders, subject to the
limitations set forth in the Indenture with respect to amounts held for payment
to Noteholders that do not promptly deliver a Note for payment on such
Distribution Date. After the transfer to the Designated Account described in the
immediately preceding sentence, references in this Agreement to “Collection
Account” shall be deemed to be references to the “Designated Account.”

(g) With respect to the Accounts and all property held therein, the Issuer
agrees, by its acceptance hereof that, on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Indenture, for so long as Notes of any Class remain outstanding, the
Indenture Trustee shall possess all right, title and interest therein (excluding
interest or investment income thereon payable to the Servicer or the Seller, as
the case may be), and the Accounts shall be under the sole dominion and control
of the Indenture Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders and the
Certificateholders, as the case may be, as set forth in the Indenture. The
parties hereto agree that the Servicer shall have the power, revocable by the
Indenture Trustee or by the Issuer with the consent of the Indenture Trustee, to
instruct the Indenture Trustee to make withdrawals and payments from the
Collection Account for the purpose of permitting the Servicer, Indenture
Trustee, Issuer or the Owner Trustee to carry out its respective duties
hereunder or under the Indenture or the Trust Agreement, as the case may be.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall be entitled to withhold, or to
be reimbursed from amounts otherwise payable into or on deposit in the
Collection Account, as the case may be, amounts previously deposited in the
Collection Account but later determined to have resulted from mistaken deposits
or posting.

(h) With respect to the Account Property, the parties hereto agree that:

(i) any Account Property that consists of uninvested funds shall be held solely
in Eligible Accounts and, except as otherwise provided herein, each such

respect thereto;

(ii) any Account Property that constitutes Physical Property shall be delivered
to the Indenture Trustee or its designee, in accordance with paragraph (a) of
the definition of “Delivery” and shall be held, pending maturity or disposition,
solely by the Indenture Trustee or any such designee;

(iii) any Account Property that is an “uncertificated security” under Article 8
of the UCC and that is not governed by clause (iv) below shall be delivered to
the Indenture Trustee or its designee in accordance with paragraph (c) of the
definition of “Delivery” and shall be maintained by the Indenture Trustee or
such designee, pending maturity or disposition, through continued registration
of the Indenture Trustee’s (or its designee’s) ownership of such security on the
books of the issuer thereof;

(iv) any Account Property that is an uncertificated security that is a
“book-entry security” (as such term is defined in Federal Reserve Bank Operating
Circular No. 7) held in a securities account at a Federal Reserve Bank and
eligible for transfer through the Fedwire® Securities Service operated by the
Federal Reserve System pursuant to Federal book-entry regulations shall be
delivered in accordance with paragraph (b) of the definition of “Delivery” and
shall be maintained by the

Indenture Trustee or its designee or a securities intermediary (as such term is
defined in Section 8-102(a)(14) of the UCC) acting solely for the Indenture
Trustee or such designee, pending maturity or disposition, through continued
book-entry registration of such Account Property as described in such paragraph;
and

(v) to the extent any Account Property is credited to a securities account, the
account agreement establishing such securities account shall provide that the
account agreement is governed by the law of the State of New York and that the
law of the State of New York shall govern all issues specified in Article 2(1)
of the Hague Securities Convention.

(i) The Indenture Trustee, to the extent it is acting in the capacity of
securities intermediary with respect to Account Property, covenants and agrees
that:

(i) it is a “securities intermediary,” as such term is defined in
Section 8-102(a)(14)(ii) of the relevant UCC;

(ii) pursuant to Section 8-110(e)(1) of the relevant UCC for purposes of Article
8 of the UCC, the jurisdiction of the Indenture Trustee as “securities
intermediary” is the State of New York; and

(iii) it has, at the time of entry into this Agreement, one or more offices in
the United States of America engaged in a business or other regular activity of
maintaining securities accounts.

To the extent that there are any other agreements with the Indenture Trustee
governing the Accounts, the parties agree that each and every such agreement is
hereby amended to provide that, with respect to the Accounts, the law applicable
to all issues specified in Article 2(1) of the Hague Securities Convention shall
be the laws of the State of New York.

SECTION 5.02 Collections. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the
Servicer shall remit to the Collection Account all Collections (other than
payments on Repurchased Receivables) not later than the second Business Day
after identification thereof; provided, however, that if the Monthly Remittance
Condition is satisfied, then the Servicer shall not be required to deposit into
the Collection Account an amount equal to the Collections received during the
related Collection Period until the Business Day before each Distribution Date.
The “Monthly Remittance Condition” shall be deemed to be satisfied if (i) NMAC
is the Servicer and (ii) NMAC’s short-term unsecured debt obligations are rated
at least “P-1” by Moody’s and at least “A-1” by S&P (so long as Moody’s and S&P
are Rating Agencies). Commencing with the first day of the first Collection
Period that begins at least two Business Days after the day on which the Monthly
Remittance Condition is not satisfied, all Collections then held by the Servicer
shall be immediately deposited into the Collection Account and all future
Collections on or in respect of the Receivables (other than payments on
Repurchased Receivables) and all Net Liquidation Proceeds shall be remitted by
the Servicer to the Collection Account not later than the second Business Day
after identification thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer may
remit Collections to the Collection Account on any other alternate remittance
schedule (but not later than the related Distribution Date) if the Rating Agency
Condition is satisfied with respect to such alternate remittance schedule.
Pending deposit into the Collection Account, Collections may be commingled and
used by the Servicer at its own risk and are not required to be segregated from
its own funds.

The Seller

SECTION 6.01 Representations of Seller. The Seller makes the following
representations on which the Issuer is deemed to have relied in acquiring the
Receivables. The representations speak as of the Closing Date, and shall survive
the sale of the Receivables to the Issuer and the pledge thereof to the
Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture.

(a) Organization and Good Standing. The Seller is duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of its formation, with
power and authority to own its properties and to conduct its business as such
properties are currently owned and such business is presently conducted, and had
at all relevant times, and has, power, authority and legal right to acquire and
own the Receivables.

(b) Due Qualification. The Seller is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
entity in good standing, and has obtained all necessary licenses and approvals
in all jurisdictions in which the ownership or lease of property or the conduct
of its business shall require such qualifications and where the failure to so
qualify would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Seller to
perform its obligations under this Agreement.

(c) Power and Authority. The Seller has the power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to carry out its terms. The Seller has full power and
authority to sell and assign the property to be sold and assigned to and
deposited as part of the Owner Trust Estate, and has duly authorized such sale

delivery and performance of this Agreement has been duly authorized by the
Seller by all necessary action.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d) Valid Sale; Binding Obligations. This Agreement evidences a valid sale,
transfer and assignment of the Receivables, enforceable against creditors of and
purchasers from the Seller (other than a good faith purchaser for value in the
ordinary course of business who takes actual possession of one or more
Receivables); and this Agreement is a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Seller enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to the effect of
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting creditors’ rights generally and by general equitable principles,
regardless of whether such enforceability shall be considered in a proceeding in
equity or law.

(e) No Violation. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the fulfillment of the terms hereof do not conflict with, result
in any breach of any of the terms and provisions of, nor constitute (with or
without notice or lapse of time) a default under, the governing documents of the
Seller, or any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which the Seller is a
party or by which it shall be bound; nor result in the creation or imposition of
any Lien upon any of its properties pursuant to the terms of any such indenture,
agreement or other instrument (other than the Basic Documents); nor violate any
law or, to the best of the Seller’s knowledge, any order, rule or regulation
applicable to the Seller of any court or of any federal or state regulatory
body, administrative agency or other governmental instrumentality having
jurisdiction over the Seller or its properties; which breach, default, conflict,
Lien or violation in any case would have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

(f) No Proceedings. There are no proceedings or investigations pending, or, to
the Seller’s knowledge, threatened, before any court, regulatory body,
administrative agency or other governmental instrumentality having jurisdiction
over the Seller or its properties: (i) asserting the invalidity of this
Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Indenture, the Certificates or the Notes;
(ii) seeking to prevent the issuance of the Certificates, or the Notes or the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Trust Agreement, the Indenture; (iii) seeking any determination or ruling that
would materially and adversely affect the performance by the Seller of its
obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of, this Agreement, the
Trust Agreement, the Indenture, the Certificates or the Notes; or (iv) relating
to the Seller and that would adversely affect the federal or any state income
tax attributes of the Issuer, the Certificates or the Notes.

(g) Valid Assignment. The Receivables and the other Purchased Assets have been
validly assigned by NMAC to the Seller pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and
the Receivables and the other Transferred Assets have been validly assigned by
the Seller to the Issuer pursuant to this Agreement.

(h) Accuracy of Information. The information set forth in the Schedule of
Receivables was true and correct in all material respects as of the opening of
business on the Cut-off Date.

 

   42    (NAROT 2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i) No Adverse Selection. No selection procedures believed to be adverse to the
Securityholders were used to select the Receivables and other Purchased Assets.

(j) Good Title. Immediately prior to the transfer and assignment herein
contemplated, the Seller had good and marketable title to the Receivables and
other Transferred Assets free and clear of all Liens, and immediately upon the
transfer thereof, the Issuer, for the benefit of the Noteholders, the
Certificateholders, shall have good and marketable title to the Transferred
Assets, free and clear of all Liens and adverse interests of others.

(k) No Liens. Other than the security interest granted to the Issuer pursuant to
this Agreement, the Seller has not pledged, assigned, sold, granted a security
interest in, or otherwise conveyed any of the Receivables or other Transferred
Assets to any other Person. The Seller has not authorized the filing of and is
not aware of any financing statements against the Seller that include a
description of collateral covering the Receivables or other Transferred Assets
other than any financing statement relating to the security interest granted to
the Issuer hereunder or a financing statement as to which the security interest
covering the Receivables or other Transferred Assets has been released. The
Seller is not aware of any judgment or tax lien filings against the Seller.

SECTION 6.02 Compliance with Organizational Documents. The Seller agrees with
the Certificateholders, the Note Owners and each Rating Agency that the Seller
shall at all times comply with its organizational documents.

SECTION 6.03 Liability of Seller; Indemnities. The Seller shall be liable in
accordance herewith only to the extent of the obligations specifically
undertaken by the Seller under this Agreement. The Seller shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless the Trust, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee
(in such role and as Successor Servicer) from and against any taxes that may at
any time be asserted against any such Person with respect to, as of the date
hereof, the sale of the Receivables to the Issuer or the issuance and original
sale of the Notes and the Certificates, including any sales, gross receipts,
general corporation, tangible personal property, privilege or license taxes and
any and all other taxes levied or assessed upon the Issuer or upon all or any
part of the Collateral (but, in the case of the Trust, not including any taxes
asserted with respect to ownership of the Receivables or federal or other income
taxes arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Basic Documents) and costs and expenses in defending against the same.

Indemnification under this Section 6.03 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and shall include reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and expenses
of litigation (including the costs of defending any claim or bringing any claim
to enforce the Seller’s indemnity obligations hereunder). If the Seller shall
have made any indemnity payment to any Person entitled thereto pursuant to this
Section 6.03 and such Person thereafter shall collect any of such amounts from
others, such Person shall promptly repay such amounts to the Seller, without
interest (except to the extent the recipient collects interest from others).

 

   43    (NAROT 2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Promptly after receipt by a party indemnified under this Section 6.03 (for
purposes of this paragraph, an “Indemnified Party”) of notice of the
commencement of any action, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim is to be
made in respect thereof against the Seller under this Section 6.03, notify the
Seller of the commencement thereof. If any such action is brought against any
Indemnified Party under this Section 6.03 and it notifies the Seller of the
commencement thereof, the Seller will assume the defense thereof, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party (who may, unless there is, as
evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to the Indemnified Party stating that there
is, a conflict of interest, be counsel to the Seller), and the Seller will not
be liable to such Indemnified Party under this Section 6.03 for any legal or
other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection
with the defense thereof, other than reasonable costs of investigation. The
obligations set forth in this Section 6.03 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement or the resignation or removal of the Owner Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee (in such role and as Successor Servicer) and shall include reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel and expenses of litigation. If the Seller shall
have made any indemnity payments pursuant to this Section 6.03 and the Person to
or on behalf of whom such payments are made thereafter collects any of such
amounts from others, such Person shall promptly repay such amounts to the
Seller, without interest (except to the extent received by such Person).

The Seller’s obligations under this Section 6.03 are obligations solely of the
Seller and will not constitute a claim against the Seller to the extent that the
Seller does not have funds sufficient to make payment of such obligations. In
furtherance of and not in derogation of the foregoing, the Issuer, the Servicer,
the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee, by entering into or accepting this
Agreement, acknowledge and agree that they have no right, title or interest in
or to the Other Assets of the Seller. To the extent that, notwithstanding the
agreements and provisions contained in the preceding sentence, the Issuer, the
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee either (i) asserts an
interest or claim to, or benefit from, Other Assets, or (ii) is deemed to have
any such interest, claim to, or benefit in or from Other Assets, whether by
operation of law, legal process, pursuant to applicable provisions of insolvency
laws or otherwise (including by virtue of Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code
or any successor provision having similar effect under the Bankruptcy Code),
then the Issuer, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as
applicable, further acknowledges and agrees that any such interest, claim or
benefit in or from Other Assets is and will be expressly subordinated to the
indefeasible payment in full, which, under the terms of the relevant documents
relating to the securitization or conveyance of such Other Assets, are entitled
to be paid from, entitled to the benefits of, or otherwise secured by such Other
Assets (whether or not any such entitlement or security interest is legally
perfected or otherwise entitled to a priority of distributions or application
under applicable law, including insolvency laws, and whether or not asserted
against the Seller), including the payment of post-petition interest on such
other obligations and liabilities. This subordination agreement will be deemed a
subordination agreement within the meaning of Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code. The Issuer, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee each
further acknowledges and agrees that no adequate remedy at law exists for a
breach of this Section 6.03 and the terms of this Section 6.03 may be enforced
by an action for specific performance. The provisions of this Section 6.03 will
be for the third party benefit of those entitled to rely thereon and will
survive the termination of this Agreement.

SECTION 6.04 Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption of the Obligations of,
Seller. Subject to Section 6.02, any Person (i) into which the Seller may be
merged or consolidated, (ii) resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Seller shall be a party,

 

   44    (NAROT 2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(iii) succeeding to the business of the Seller or (iv) that is a corporation
more than 50% of the voting stock of which is owned directly or indirectly by
Nissan, which Person in any of the foregoing cases executes an agreement of
assumption to perform every obligation of the Seller under this Agreement, will
be the successor to the Seller under this Agreement without the execution or
filing of any document or any further act on the part of any of the parties to
this Agreement; provided, however, that (x) immediately after giving effect to
such transaction, no representation or warranty made pursuant to Section 6.01
shall have been breached, (y) the Seller shall have delivered to the Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such
consolidation, merger or succession and such agreement or assumption comply with
this Section 6.04 and that all conditions precedent, if any, provided for in
this Agreement relating to such transaction have been complied with and (z) the
Seller shall have delivered to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee an
Opinion of Counsel either (A) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel,
based on customary qualifications and assumptions, all financing statements and
continuation statements and amendments thereto have been executed and filed that
are necessary to fully perfect the interest of the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee, respectively, in the Receivables, and reciting the details of such
filings, or (B) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, no such action
shall be necessary to preserve and protect such interest. The Seller shall
provide notice of any merger, consolidation or succession pursuant to this
Section 6.04 to the Servicer and the Servicer shall provide notice thereof to
each Rating Agency.

SECTION 6.05 Limitation on Liability of Seller and Others.

(a) Neither the Seller nor any of the directors, officers, employees or agents
of the Seller shall be under any liability to the Trust, the Certificateholders
or the Noteholders, except as provided under this Agreement, for any action
taken or for refraining from the taking of any action pursuant to this Agreement
or for errors in judgment; provided, however, that this provision shall not
protect the Seller or any such person against any liability that would otherwise
be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the
performance of duties or by reason of reckless disregard of obligations and
duties under this Agreement. The Seller and any director, officer, employee or
agent of the Seller may rely in good faith on the advice of counsel or on any
document of any kind, prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person
respecting any matters arising under this Agreement.

(b) The Seller shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or
defend any legal action that shall not be incidental to its obligations under
this Agreement, and that in its opinion may cause it to incur any expense or
liability; provided, however, that the Servicer may undertake any reasonable
action that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement and
the rights and duties of the parties to this Agreement and the interests of the
Certificateholders and the Noteholders under this Agreement. In such event, the
legal expenses and costs of such action and any liability resulting therefrom
shall be expenses, costs and liabilities of the Servicer, and the Servicer will
not be entitled to be reimbursed therefor.

SECTION 6.06 Seller May Own Certificates or Notes. The Seller and any Affiliate
of the Seller may in its individual or any other capacity become the owner or
pledgee of Certificates or Notes with the same rights as it would have if it
were not the Seller or an Affiliate thereof,

 

   45    (NAROT 2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

except as otherwise provided in the Basic Documents. Certificates or Notes so
owned by or pledged to the Seller or such controlling or commonly controlled
Person shall have an equal and proportionate benefit under the provisions of
this Agreement, without preference, priority or distinction as among all of the
Certificates or the Notes, as the case may be, except as otherwise expressly
provided in the Basic Documents.

SECTION 6.07 Sarbanes-Oxley Act Requirements. To the extent any documents are
required to be filed or any certification is required to be made with respect to
the Issuer or the Notes pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Issuer hereby
authorizes the Servicer and the Seller, or either of them, to prepare, sign,
certify and file any such documents or certifications on behalf of the Issuer.

Servicer to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

deliver this Agreement and to carry out its terms; and the execution, delivery

   46    (NAROT 2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(e) No Violation. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the fulfillment of the terms hereof, do not conflict with, result
in any breach of any of the terms and provisions of, nor constitute (with or

or by-laws of the Servicer, or any indenture, agreement or other instrument to
which the Servicer is a party or by which it shall be bound; nor result in the
creation or imposition of any Lien upon any of its properties pursuant to the

Certificates or the Notes; (ii) seeking to prevent the issuance of the
Certificates or the Notes or the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Trust Agreement, the Indenture or the

herewith only to the extent of the obligations specifically undertaken by the
Servicer under this Agreement:

(a) The Servicer shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee, and the Trust from and against any and all costs
(including reasonable attorneys’ fees), expenses, losses, damages, claims and

Trust) of a Financed Vehicle.

(b) The Servicer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Owner Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee, and the Issuer from and against any and all Damages to
the extent that such Damage arose out of, or was imposed upon, the Owner

misfeasance or bad faith of the Servicer in the performance of its duties under
this Agreement or by reason of reckless disregard of its obligations and duties
under this Agreement.

Promptly after receipt by a party indemnified under this Section 7.02 (for

commencement of any action, such Indemnified Party will, if a claim in respect
thereof is to be made against the Servicer under this

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 7.02, notify the Servicer of the commencement thereof. If any such
action is brought against any Indemnified Party under this Section 7.02 and it
notifies the Servicer of the commencement thereof, the Servicer will assume the
defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party
(who may, unless there is, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to the

the Servicer), and the Servicer will not be liable to such Indemnified Party
under this Section 7.02 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by

reasonable costs of investigation. The obligations set forth in this
Section 7.02 shall survive the termination of this Agreement or the resignation

Agreement and shall include reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and expenses
of litigation. If the Servicer shall have made any indemnity payments pursuant
to this Section 7.02 and the recipient thereafter collects any of such amounts

taking of any action pursuant to this Agreement or for errors in judgment;
provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Servicer or any
such person against any liability that would otherwise be imposed by reason of
willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of duties or by
reason of reckless disregard of obligations and duties under this Agreement. The
Servicer and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Servicer may rely
in good faith on the advice of counsel or on any document of any kind, prima
facie properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters
arising under this Agreement.

(b) Except as provided in this Agreement, the Servicer shall not be under any
obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action that shall not be

action that it may deem necessary or desirable in respect of the Basic Documents
and the rights and duties of the parties to the Basic Documents and the
interests of the Certificateholders under this Agreement and the Noteholders
under the Indenture. In such event, the legal expenses and costs of such action
and any liability resulting therefrom shall be expenses, costs and liabilities
of the Servicer, and the Servicer will not be entitled to be reimbursed
therefor.

Section 7.03, NMAC shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby

(i) have taken the actions required by Section 8.01 of this Agreement to effect
the termination of the responsibilities and rights of the predecessor Servicer
under this Agreement, including the transfer to the Successor Servicer for

Certificate Balance; provided, however, that a failure under this clause
(b) that continues unremedied for a period of 150 days or less will not
constitute a Servicer Default if such failure was caused by force majeure or
other similar occurrence; or

(c) the occurrence of an Insolvency Event with respect to the Servicer;

then, and in each and every case, so long as the Servicer Default shall not have
been remedied, either the Indenture Trustee or the Holders of Notes evidencing a
majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, acting together as a single
Class or, if no Notes are Outstanding, Holders of Certificates evidencing not
less than a majority of the Certificate Balance, by notice then given in writing
to the Servicer (and to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee if given by
the Noteholders) and the Administrator (and the Administrator will provide
notice thereof to each Rating Agency pursuant to Section 1(d) of the
Administration Agreement) may terminate all of the rights and obligations (other
than the obligations set forth in Section 7.02 hereof) of the Servicer under
this Agreement. On or after the receipt by the Servicer of such written notice,
all authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with
respect to the Notes, the Certificates or the Receivables or otherwise, shall,
without further action, pass to and be vested in the Indenture Trustee or such
Successor Servicer as may be appointed under Section 8.02; and, without
limitation, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee are hereby authorized
and empowered to execute and deliver, for the benefit of the predecessor
Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other
instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to

complete the transfer and endorsement of the Receivables and related documents,
or otherwise. The predecessor Servicer shall cooperate with the Successor
Servicer and the Owner Trustee in effecting the termination of the
responsibilities and rights of the predecessor Servicer under this Agreement,
including, without limitation, the transfer to the Successor Servicer for
administration by it of all cash amounts that shall at the time be held by the
predecessor Servicer for deposit, or have been deposited by the predecessor
Servicer, in the Accounts or thereafter received with respect to the Receivables
that shall at that time be held by the predecessor Servicer and the delivery of
the Receivable Files and the related accounts and records maintained by the
predecessor Servicer. All reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys’
fees) incurred in connection with transferring the Receivable Files to the
Successor Servicer and amending this Agreement to reflect such succession as
Servicer pursuant to this Section 8.01 shall be paid by the predecessor Servicer
upon presentation of reasonable documentation of such costs and expenses.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the predecessor Servicer is the
Indenture Trustee, the original Servicer hereunder shall reimburse the Indenture
Trustee for all reasonable costs and expenses as described in the immediately
preceding sentence.

SECTION 8.02 Appointment of Successor.

(a) Upon the Servicer’s receipt of notice of termination pursuant to
Section 8.01 or the Servicer’s resignation in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the predecessor Servicer shall continue to perform its functions as
Servicer under this Agreement, in the case of termination, only until the date
specified in such termination notice or, if no such date is specified in a
notice of termination, until receipt of such notice and, in the case of
resignation, until the earlier of (i) the date 45 days from the delivery to the
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee of written notice of such resignation
(or written confirmation of such notice) in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and (ii) the date upon which the predecessor Servicer shall become
unable to act as Servicer, as specified in the notice of resignation and
accompanying Opinion of Counsel. In the event of the Servicer’s resignation or
termination hereunder, the Indenture Trustee (or, if no Notes are Outstanding,
the Issuer acting upon the direction of Holders of Certificates evidencing not
less than a majority of the Certificate Balance) shall appoint a Successor
Servicer, and the Successor Servicer shall accept its appointment (including its
appointment as Administrator under the Administration Agreement as set forth in
Section 8.02(b)) by a written assumption in form acceptable to the Owner Trustee
and the Indenture Trustee and shall provide in writing the information
reasonably required by the Seller to comply with its reporting obligations under
the Exchange Act with respect to a replacement servicer. If a Successor Servicer
has not been appointed at the time when the predecessor Servicer has ceased to
act as Servicer in accordance with this Section 8.02, the Indenture Trustee
without further action shall automatically be appointed the Successor Servicer
and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to the Base Servicing Fee.
Notwithstanding the above, the Indenture Trustee (or, if no Notes are
Outstanding, the Issuer acting upon the direction of Holders of Certificates
evidencing not less than a majority of the Certificate Balance) shall, if it is
unwilling or legally unable so to act, appoint or petition a court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint, and the predecessor Servicer, if no successor Servicer
has been appointed at the time the predecessor Servicer has ceased to act, may
petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint any established
institution having a net worth of not less than $100,000,000 and whose regular
business shall include the servicing of automobile and/or light-duty truck
receivables, as the successor to the Servicer under this Agreement.

(b) Upon appointment, the Successor Servicer (including the Indenture Trustee
acting as Successor Servicer) shall (i) be the successor in all respects to the
predecessor Servicer and shall be subject to all the responsibilities, duties
and liabilities arising thereafter relating thereto placed on the predecessor
Servicer and shall be entitled, subject to the arrangements referred to in
paragraph (c) below, to the servicing fee and all the rights granted to the
predecessor Servicer by the terms and provisions of this Agreement and
(ii) become the Administrator under the Administration Agreement in accordance
with Section 8 of such Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein or in the Basic Documents, if the Indenture Trustee shall act
as Successor Servicer, it shall not, in any event, have obligations (i) to pay
any fees, expenses and other amounts owing to the Administrator, (ii) to pay any
indemnities owed pursuant to Section 3.05 or Section 7.02, or (iii) to
repurchase Receivables pursuant to Section 4.06 if such repurchase obligations
are due to the actions or omissions of the predecessor Servicer.

(c) In connection with such appointment, the Issuer may make such arrangements
for the compensation of such Successor Servicer out of payments on Receivables
as it and such Successor Servicer shall agree; provided, however, that no such
compensation shall be in excess of that permitted the predecessor Servicer under
this Agreement. The Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and such Successor Servicer
shall take such action, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to
effectuate any such succession.

SECTION 8.03 Notification . Upon any termination of, or appointment of a
successor to, the Servicer pursuant to this Article VIII, the Owner Trustee
shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Certificateholders and the
Indenture Trustee shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Noteholders
and the Asset Representations Reviewer and the Administrator (and the
Administrator will provide notice thereof to each Rating Agency pursuant to
Section 1(d) of the Administration Agreement).

SECTION 8.04 Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders of Notes evidencing a majority
of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, or, in the case of any Servicer Default
which does not adversely affect the Indenture Trustee or the Noteholders, the
Holders of Certificates evidencing a majority of the Certificate Balance, may,
on behalf of all the Noteholders and the Certificateholders, waive in writing
any default by the Servicer in the performance of its obligations hereunder and
its consequences, except a default in making any required deposits to or
payments from the Collection Account in accordance with this Agreement. Upon any
such waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to exist, and any
Servicer Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for
every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent
or other default or impair any right consequent thereto.

SECTION 10.13 Dispute Resolution.

(a) If the Seller, Issuer, an Investor, the Owner Trustee (acting at the
direction of a Certificateholder) or the Indenture Trustee (acting at the
direction of an Investor pursuant to Section 7.07 of the Indenture) (the
“Requesting Party”) requests that NMAC or the Seller repurchase any Receivable
pursuant to Section 4.3 of the Purchase Agreement or Section 3.02 hereof,
respectively, (the party or parties requested to repurchase a receivable, the
“Requested Party” or “Requested Parties”) and the repurchase request has not
been fulfilled or otherwise resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Requesting Party within 180 days of the receipt of notice of the request by NMAC
or the Seller, as applicable, the Requesting Party will have the right to refer
the matter, at its discretion, to either mediation or arbitration pursuant to
this Section 10.13. If the Requesting Party is the Indenture Trustee or the
Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as applicable, will
follow the direction of the related Investor or Certificateholder, as
applicable, during the mediation or arbitration. If both the Owner Trustee (on
behalf of one or more Certificateholders) and the Indenture Trustee (on behalf
of one or more Investors) are Requesting Parties, then the Indenture Trustee as
Requesting Party (at the direction of the Investor that directed the Indenture
Trustee to make the repurchase request) shall have the right to make the
selection of mediation or arbitration.

(b) The Requesting Party will provide notice in accordance with the provisions
of Section 10.03 of its intention to refer the matter to mediation or
arbitration, as applicable, to the Requested Parties, with a copy to the Issuer,
the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee. Each of NMAC and the Seller agree
that such Person will participate in the resolution method selected by the
Requesting Party to the extent such Person is a Requested Party. The Requested
Party shall provide notice to the Seller, Issuer, the Owner Trustee, and the
Indenture Trustee that the Requested Party has received a request to mediate or
arbitrate a repurchase request. Upon receipt of such notice, the Depositor, the
Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee shall advise the Requesting
Party and Requested Party of an intent to join in the mediation or arbitration,
which shall result in their being joined as a Requesting Party in the
proceeding. A Requesting Party may not initiate a mediation or arbitration
pursuant to this Section 10.13 with respect to a Receivable that is, or has
been, the subject of an ongoing or previous mediation or arbitration (whether by
that Requesting Party or another Requesting Party) but will have the right to
join an existing mediation or arbitration with respect to that Receivable if the
mediation or arbitration has not yet concluded, subject to a determination by
the parties to the existing mediation or arbitration that such joinder would not
prejudice the rights of the participants to such existing mediation or
arbitration or unduly delay such proceeding.

(c) If the Requesting Party selects mediation as the resolution method, the
following provisions will apply:

(i) The mediation will be administered by a nationally recognized arbitration
and mediation association selected by the Requesting Party and conducted
pursuant to such association’s mediation procedures in effect at such time.

 

   59    (NAROT 2020-A Sale and Servicing Agreement)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(ii) The fees and expenses of the mediation will be allocated as mutually agreed
by the parties as part of the mediation.

(iii) The mediator is required to be impartial, knowledgeable about and
experienced with the laws of the State of New York that are relevant to the
repurchase dispute and will be appointed from a list of neutrals maintained by
the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”).

(d) If the Requesting Party selects arbitration as the resolution method, the
following provisions will apply:

(i) The arbitration will be administered by a nationally recognized arbitration
and mediation association jointly selected by the parties, and if the parties
are unable to agree on an association, by the AAA, and conducted pursuant to
such association’s arbitration procedures in effect at such time.

(ii) The arbitrator is required to be impartial, knowledgeable about and
experienced with the laws of the State of New York that are relevant to the
repurchase dispute and will be appointed from a list of neutrals maintained by
AAA.

(iii) The arbitrator will make its final determination no later than 90 days
after appointment or as soon as practicable thereafter. The arbitrator will
resolve the dispute in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and may not
modify or change this Agreement in any way. The arbitrator will not have the
power to award punitive damages or consequential damages in any arbitration
conducted by it, and the Requested Party shall not be required to pay more than
the applicable Repurchase Amount with respect to any receivable which such
Requested Party is required to repurchase under the terms of the Purchase
Agreement or this Agreement, as applicable. In its final determination, the
arbitrator will determine and award the costs of the arbitration (including the
fees of the arbitrator, cost of any record or transcript of the arbitration, and
administrative fees) and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the parties as determined
by the arbitrator in its reasonable discretion. If an Asset Review was conducted
in connection with the Receivables that are the subject of the arbitration, then
the arbitrator will determine the party or parties required to pay the related
Asset Reviewer Fee. The determination of the arbitrator will be in writing and
counterpart copies will be promptly delivered to the parties. The determination
will be final and non-appealable absent manifest error and may be enforced in
any court of competent jurisdiction.

(iv) By selecting arbitration, the Requesting Party is waiving the right to sue
in court, including the right to a trial by jury.

(v) No person may bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration.
