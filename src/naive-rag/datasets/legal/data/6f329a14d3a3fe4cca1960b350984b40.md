“B” is the gross invoice price in such country of the other therapeutically
active ingredient(s) contained in the Combination Product.

If “A” or “B” cannot be determined by reference to non-Combination Product sales
as described above, then Net Sales will be calculated as above, but the gross
invoice price in the above equation shall be determined by mutual agreement
reached in good faith by the Parties prior to the end of the accounting period
in question based on an equitable method of determining the same that takes into
account, in the applicable country, the relative fair market value (including
taking into account variations in dosage units, if applicable) of such Licensed
Product, on the one





18




hand, and each other therapeutically active ingredient, as applicable, on the
other hand, in the Combination Product.

approval prior to submission thereof).  At the request of Juno,  Editas shall
reasonably assist Juno in communications and filings with Regulatory Authorities
with respect to any Licensed Products, including in connection with the
preparation of any INDs, MAAs and other Regulatory Approvals for any Licensed
Products; provided that Editas shall not be required to write any portion of any
application for Regulatory Approval; provided, further, that Juno will provide
Editas with reasonable regulatory information as may be required in order to
allow Editas to provide such assistance to Juno.  For the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Section 3.2.3 shall prevent Editas from making regulatory
filings or otherwise interacting with Regulatory Authorities with respect to any
RNP Complex outside of the Exclusive Field.

In-License Agreement (other than an assignment to an Affiliate or successor of
Editas receiving an assignment of this Agreement as permitted under Section
12.4) unless Editas otherwise obtains Juno’s prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if doing so would
conflict with or otherwise adversely affect any of the rights or licenses
granted to Juno hereunder; (B) shall not breach, or commit any acts or permit
the occurrence of any omissions that would





28




cause the material breach or termination, of any such In-License Agreement; (C)
shall satisfy all of its obligations under each such In-License
[ex-10d21g001.jpg] Agreement in all material respects; (D) shall maintain each
such In-License Agreement in full force and effect; (E) shall enforce its rights
under each such In-License Agreement to preserve any rights or licenses granted
to Juno under this Agreement; and (F) shall provide Juno with prompt written
notice of any claim of a breach of which it is aware under any such In-License
Agreements or notice of termination of any such In-License Agreement.  Without
limiting the foregoing, if Editas intends to take any action or inaction to
terminate any In-License Agreement, including a Foundational In-License in whole
or in part, Editas shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to provide Juno
with an opportunity to obtain a direct license from the applicable Third Party.

ARTICLE 4

ANTITRUST AND COMPETITION LAW COMPLIANCE

4.1       Antitrust Compliance.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties shall
continue to comply with Section 3.5 of the Master Collaboration Agreement, and
such provisions shall apply to this Agreement as if set forth directly herein,
mutatis mutandis.

ARTICLE 5

EXCLUSIVITY

5.1       Exclusivity.

5.1.1    Competing Product.  During the Term, except to the extent required for
Editas to fulfill its obligations to Juno under and in accordance with this
Agreement or the Master Collaboration Agreement, Editas shall not, and, subject
to Section 5.1.2, shall ensure that its Affiliates shall not, anywhere in the
world,  (a) alone or with or through or for any Third Party, conduct or
participate in any Research,  Development, Manufacturing, Commercialization or
other exploitation activities of any Competing Product; (b) grant a license,
sublicense or other rights to any Third Party to conduct any of the activities
in clause (a); or (c)  except for the rights and licenses granted to Juno
hereunder, transfer, assign, convey or otherwise sell any Competing Product;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not restrict Editas and its
Affiliates from performing their obligations under (i) the Allergan Agreement as
to the Excluded Ocular Field, alone or with or for Allergan, (ii) the Beam
Agreement as to the Excluded Base Editing Non-Cancer Field, or (iii) the
BlueRock Agreement as to the BlueRock Field, in each case, as such agreements
exist as of the Execution Date and solely for so long as such agreements remain
in full force and effect.  As used herein, the term “Competing Product” means
any product that constitutes, incorporates, comprises or contains any (a) α-β
T-Cell or (b) Other Derived T-Cell,  in each case, that is modified using any
Genome Editing Technology (including any RNP Complex or any component thereof)
 Directed to any Licensed Program Target for so long as at least one Licensed
Program Addendum relating to such Licensed Program Target remains in effect.  
For the avoidance of doubt, during the Term, any agreement entered into between
Editas or any of its Affiliates and a Third Party involving the use of Research,
Development, Manufacture, Commercialization or other exploitation activities
with respect to any α-β T-Cell,  Other Derived T-Cell or any other use of Genome
Editing Technology shall expressly exclude the grant of any license, sublicense
or other rights, or the conduct of any activities which would violate the terms
of this Section 5.1.  For clarity, the provisions of this Section 5.1.1 shall
not prohibit Editas and its Affiliates, on their own





29




or through or with any Third Party, from Researching, Developing, Manufacturing,
Commercializing or conducting other exploitation activities (including through
grants of licenses, sublicenses or other rights to any Third Party to conduct
any of the foregoing activities) with respect to its exploitation of Genome
Editing Technology, including the use of Licensed RNP Complexes, with respect to
any product that is not a Licensed Product or a Competing Product.

5.1.2    Exceptions for Change of Control. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 5.1.1, if, following the Execution Date, Editas undergoes a Change of
Control and an Acquiring Affiliate is engaged in any activities immediately
prior to the effective date of such Change of Control that would violate Section
5.1.1 if conducted by Editas (an “Existing Acquirer Program”), then Editas shall
not be in breach of the provisions of Section 5.1.1 as a result of the continued
conduct of such Existing Acquirer Program by such Acquiring Affiliate during the
Term; provided that (a) such Existing Acquirer Program is conducted by such
Acquiring Affiliate independently of the activities of this Agreement (including
maintaining separate lab notebooks) and without use of, or reference to, any
Editas Licensed Background IP, Collaboration IP or any Confidential Information
of Juno or any of its Affiliates; (b) no personnel of Editas or any of its
Affiliates that are conducting or have conducted any activities under the
Research Program or otherwise under this Agreement or the Master Collaboration
Agreement, or that has or had access to any Confidential Information of Juno or
any of its Affiliates, shall work on the Existing Acquirer Program; and (c)
Editas puts in place firewalls and other protections reasonably acceptable to
Juno that are reasonably designed to ensure that the foregoing clauses (a) and
(b) are complied with during the Term.

5.2       [**].  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
during the Term, Editas shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to), use
any Patent Rights, Know-How or other IP, or any other materials or resources
(including any portion of payments from Juno hereunder) that (a) are licensed or
otherwise provided by Juno (or any of its Affiliates) hereunder; or (b) were
otherwise created, conceived, discovered, generated, invented, made or reduced
to practice in the course of conducting any activities pursuant to this
Agreement (or the Master Collaboration Agreement), in each case ((a) or (b)) in
connection with [**].

5.3       Master Collaboration Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, the
provisions of Section 5.3 of the Master Collaboration Agreement shall not limit
in any way the provisions of this ARTICLE 5, and the provisions of this ARTICLE
5 shall not limit in any way the provisions of this Section 5.3 of the Master
Collaboration Agreement.

ARTICLE 6

FINANCIAL TERMS

6.1       Opt-In Exercise Fee.  Subject to Article 3 of the Master Collaboration
Agreement, Juno shall pay to Editas (a) with respect to the Initial Licensed
Program, an opt-in exercise fee of  [**] Dollars ($[**]) within [**] after the
Execution Date; and (b) with respect to each exercise by Juno of its Opt-In
 Right pursuant to the terms of the Master Collaboration Agreement for a
 Licensed Program (other than for the Initial Licensed Program), an opt-in
exercise fee of [**] Dollars ($[**])  within [**] after the Effective Date of
the applicable Licensed Program Addendum (each, an “Opt-In Exercise Fee”).





30




6.2       Royalties.

6.2.1    Licensed Product Royalties.  Subject to the terms of this Section 6.2
(and subject further to Sections  6.4 and 6.7), on a Calendar Year-by-Calendar
Year basis, Juno shall pay Editas royalties on Annual Product Net Sales of a
given Licensed Product (on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis) during
the applicable Royalty Term for such Licensed Product (provided that the Royalty
Term shall be calculated on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and
country-by-country basis), equal to the following portions of Annual Product Net
Sales of such Licensed Product during a given Calendar Year multiplied by the
applicable royalty rate set forth below for such portion of Annual Product Net
Sales during the applicable Royalty Term, which royalties shall be paid in
accordance with Section 6.2.5.  For clarity, the royalties (and royalty tiers)
shall be calculated separately on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis.

 

 

 

Annual Product Net Sales of a Given Licensed Product in a Given Calendar Year

Royalty Rate

Portion of Annual Product Net Sales of a given Licensed Product in a given
Calendar Year above $[**], up to and including $[**]

[**]%

Portion of Annual Product Net Sales of a given Licensed Product in a given
Calendar Year above $[**], up to and including $[**]

[**]%

Portion of Annual Product Net Sales of a given Licensed Product in a given
Calendar Year above $[**]

[**]%

 

The applicable royalty rates set forth in the table above will apply only to
that portion of the Annual Product Net Sales of the applicable Licensed Product
during a given Calendar Year that falls within the indicated range.  For
clarity, (a) if no royalty is payable on a given unit of Licensed Product (e.g.,
following expiration of the Royalty Term for such Licensed Product in a given
country), then the Net Sales of such unit of Licensed Product shall not be
included for purposes of determining the royalties or royalty tiers; (b) Net
Sales of a given Licensed Product will not be combined with Net Sales of any
other Licensed Product for purposes of determining the royalties or royalty
tiers; and (c) with respect to any Licensed Products for which a royalty is
payable, only one royalty shall be payable by Juno to Editas for each sale of a
unit of such Licensed Product, regardless of any Licensed Program Addenda
subsequently entered into by the Parties.  By way of example and without
limitation of this Section 6.2.1, if Annual Product Net Sales of a given
Licensed Product were $[**] for a given Calendar Year, then the royalties
payable with respect to such Annual Product Net Sales for such Licensed Product
for such Calendar Year (assuming no further reductions pursuant to Section 6.2.3
or Section 6.2.4), would be: [**].

6.2.2    Royalty Term.  Juno’s royalty obligations to Editas under Section 6.2.1
shall apply on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country
basis only during the applicable Royalty Term for such Licensed Product in such
country.  Following expiration of the applicable Royalty Term for a given
Licensed Product in a given country, as applicable, no further royalties will be
payable in respect of sales of such Licensed Product in such country and
thereafter





31




the license granted to Juno hereunder with respect to such Licensed Product in
such country will automatically become non-exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual,
irrevocable and royalty-free.

6.2.3    Reductions.

(a)        Reductions for No Valid Claim. The royalty amounts payable with
respect to Annual Product Net Sales shall be reduced on a Licensed
Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis, to [**] percent
([**]%) of the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to Section 6.2.1 during any
portion of the applicable Royalty Term in which the sale of such Licensed
Product in such country is not Covered by at least one (1) Valid Claim.

(b)        Royalty Reduction for Biosimilar Product.  If, on a Licensed
Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country and Calendar
Quarter-by-Calendar Quarter basis:

(i)         Biosimilar Product(s) (in the aggregate) have a market share of
greater than [**] percent ([**]%) but less than or equal to [**] percent
([**]%); or

(ii)       Biosimilar Product(s) (in the aggregate) have a market share of more
than [**] percent ([**]%);

then the royalties payable with respect to Annual Product Net Sales of such
Licensed Product pursuant to Section 6.2.1 in such country during such Calendar
Quarter shall be reduced to [**] percent ([**]%) if subsection (i) applies, or
[**] percent ([**]%) if subsection (ii) applies, respectively, of the royalties
otherwise payable pursuant to Section 6.2.1.  Market share shall be based on the
aggregate market in such country of such Licensed Product and the Biosimilar
Product(s) (based on the number of units of such Licensed Product and such
Biosimilar Product(s) in the aggregate sold in such country, as reported by a
well-known reporting service agreed between the Parties acting reasonably (e.g.,
IQVIA)).

(c)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (i) the reductions
in both Section 6.2.3(a) and Section 6.2.3(b)(i) apply with respect to a
Licensed Product in a given country in a given Calendar Quarter or (ii) the
reductions in both Section 6.2.3(a) and Section 6.2.3(b)(ii) apply with respect
to a Licensed Product in a given country in a given Calendar Quarter, then, in
each case ((i) and (ii)), the royalties payable with respect to Annual Product
Net Sales of such Licensed Product pursuant to Section 6.2.1 in such country
during such Calendar Quarter shall in no event be reduced pursuant to this
Section 6.2.3 to less than [**] percent ([**]%) of such royalty payments that
would otherwise be payable in such Calendar Quarter.

6.2.4    Royalty Offset for Juno Third Party Payments; Payment of Allocable
Costs and Additional Allocable Costs.  Subject to Section 7.18, if  Juno (or any
of its Affiliates or Sublicensees) obtains from a Third Party a right or license
under IP of a Third Party (whether prior to or after the applicable Effective
Date), where the Research, Development, Manufacturing, Commercialization or
other exploitation of a given Licensed Product (or any Licensed RNP Complex or
component thereof) by or on behalf of Juno (or any of its Affiliates or
Sublicensees),  or obtaining the right or license to such IP for use in
connection with any of the foregoing, would result in a payment to such Third
Party, then Juno may deduct from the royalty payments that





32




would otherwise have been due to Editas under Section 6.2.1 with respect to
Annual Product Net Sales in a particular Calendar Quarter with respect to the
applicable Licensed Product, an amount equal to [**] percent ([**]%) of the
amount of any royalties or milestone payments actually paid by Juno (or any of
its Affiliates or Sublicensees) to such Third Party for such right or license
(or the exercise thereof) (“Juno Third Party Payments”); provided that in no
event shall the royalty payments due to Editas under Section 6.2.1 (after
application of any reductions pursuant to Section 6.2.3)  be reduced pursuant to
this Section 6.2.4 to less than [**] percent ([**]%) of such royalty payments
that would otherwise be payable in such Calendar Quarter; provided, however,
that if Juno is unable to fully recover the amounts paid by Juno (or any of its
Affiliates or Sublicensees) in such Calendar Quarter, then Juno shall be
entitled to carry forward such right of offset to future Calendar Quarters with
respect to such excess amount and continue to applying such offset on a Calendar
Quarter basis thereafter until fully utilized.  Without limiting the foregoing,
Juno shall pay to Editas any and all Allocable Costs and Additional Allocable
Costs with respect to each Licensed Program (as set forth in the applicable
Licensed Program Addendum), and any such Allocable Costs and Additional
Allocable Costs shall be deemed Juno Third Party Payments for purposes of this
Agreement.

6.2.5    Payment of Royalties.  Juno shall: (a) within [**] following the end of
each Calendar Quarter in which a royalty payment pursuant to Section 6.2.1
accrues, provide to Editas  a written report specifying for such Calendar
Quarter (i) the number of Licensed Products sold that are subject to such
royalty, (ii) the Annual Product Net Sales in such country during such Calendar
Quarter that are subject to such royalty, (iii) the applicable royalty rate
under this Agreement, and (iv) any reduction to the royalty applied by Juno
pursuant to any one or more of Sections 6.2.3 and 6.2.4; and (b) make the
royalty payments owed to Editas hereunder in accordance with such royalty report
in arrears, within [**] from the end of the Calendar Quarter in which such
payment accrues.  In addition, Juno shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts
to, within [**] following a given Calendar Quarter, provide to Editas a
preliminary nonbinding report of Annual Product Net Sales of Licensed Product,
including gross sales, adjustments made to gross sales and Annual Product Net
Sales for such Calendar Quarter.

6.3       Milestones.

6.3.1    Development Milestones.

(a)        Subject to the terms of Section 6.3.1(b) (and subject further to
Sections  6.4 and 6.7), on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, Juno
will notify Editas within [**] following the first achievement by Juno or its
Affiliates or Sublicensees (provided that if the applicable milestone event is
achieved by a Sublicensee, then such notice period shall be extended to [**]
following such achievement) under this Agreement after the Effective Date of
each milestone event described below in this Section 6.3.1 with respect to a
given Licensed Product to achieve such milestone event (each, a “Development
Milestone Event”), and Juno shall thereafter pay the applicable amounts set
forth below associated with the applicable Development Milestone Event in

provided that, in either case ((a) or (b)), if Juno determines not to seek
separate pricing approvals in such Major

[**] Dollars ($[**])





34

Each of the foregoing milestones in this Section 6.3.1 shall be payable a
maximum of one (1) time for a given Licensed Product as set forth in the
foregoing chart achieving the applicable Development Milestone Event (i.e., a
maximum of nine (9)  Development Milestone Payments may be made pursuant to this
Section 6.3.1 for a given Licensed Product), and no Development Milestone
Payment shall be due hereunder for subsequent or repeated achievement of such
Development Milestone Event.

(b)        Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.3.1(a), (i) with respect
to Development Milestone Events [**],  no Development Milestone Payments shall
be due or payable hereunder in connection with the achievement of any such
Development Milestone Event with respect to any Licensed Product that is not
Covered by at least one (1) Valid Claim in the applicable Major Market country
of Regulatory Approval triggering such Development Milestone Event as of the
date of the achievement of such Development Milestone Event, and (ii) if a given
Development Milestone Event was achieved by a given Licensed Product and such
Development Milestone Event was subsequently achieved by another Licensed
Product that was modified using the same Licensed RNP Complex (alone or as part
of a Licensed RNP Complex Group), then no additional Development Milestone
Payment shall be due or payable hereunder with respect to such subsequent
achievement unless the Licensed Product subsequently achieving such Development
Milestone Event contained a Juno Material Modification as compared to any other
Licensed Product for which such Development Milestone Event was achieved.

6.3.2    Invoice and Payment of Development Milestone Payments.  Following
receipt of notification by Juno to Editas that Juno has achieved the applicable
milestone event triggering a Development Milestone Payment hereunder, Editas
shall invoice Juno for the applicable Development Milestone Payment, and Juno
shall pay such Development Milestone Payment within [**] after receipt of the
invoice therefor.

6.3.3    Commercial Milestones.

(a)        Subject to the terms of Section 6.3.3(b) (and subject further to
Section 6.4 and 6.7),  Juno will notify Editas within [**] after the end of the
Calendar Quarter during which the first achievement by Juno or its Affiliates or
Sublicensees under this Agreement





35




after the Effective Date of a given milestone event described below in this
Section 6.3.3 (each, a “Commercial Milestone Event”)  with respect to each of
the first [**] Licensed Products to achieve such milestone event, and Juno shall
thereafter pay the applicable amounts set forth below associated with the
applicable milestone event in accordance with Section 6.3.4 (each, a “Commercial
Milestone Payment” and together with any Development Milestone Payment, each, a
“Milestone Payment”):

 

Commercial Milestone Event

 

Commercial Milestone Payment

First achievement of Annual Product U.S. Net Sales of a given Licensed Product
in any single Calendar Year exceeding [**] Dollars ($[**])

Each of the foregoing milestones in this Section 6.3.3 shall be payable a
maximum of [**] times, and no Commercial Milestone Payment shall be due
hereunder for (i) any subsequent or repeated achievement of such milestone event
with respect to the same Licensed Product or (ii) the achievement of any
Commercial Milestone Event by additional Licensed Products after [**] Licensed
Products have achieved such Commercial Milestone Event.  For the avoidance of
doubt, the maximum amount payable by Juno pursuant to this Section 6.3.3 is One
Hundred Twenty Million Dollars ($120,000,000).

(b)        For clarity, (i) if no royalty is payable on a given unit of Licensed
Product (e.g., following the Royalty Term for such Licensed Product in a given
country), then the Net Sales of such unit of Licensed Product shall not be
included for purposes of determining whether a Commercial Milestone Event is
achieved and (ii) payment will be due under this Section 6.3.3 with respect to
the first [**] Licensed Products to achieve a Commercial Milestone Event,
regardless of whether a Commercial Milestone Payment was previously paid with
respect such Licensed Product for achievement of an earlier Commercial Milestone
Event.

6.3.4    Invoice and Payment of Commercial Milestone Payments.  Following
receipt of notification by Juno to Editas that Juno has achieved the applicable
milestone event triggering a Commercial Milestone Payment hereunder, Editas
shall invoice Juno for the applicable Commercial Milestone Payment, and Juno
shall pay such Commercial Milestone Payment within [**] after receipt of the
invoice therefor.

6.4       Additional Payment Terms.

6.4.1    Payment Method.  Except as otherwise provided in other sections of this
Agreement, all payments due to a Party hereunder shall be due and payable within
[**] after receipt





36




of an invoice from the other Party and shall be paid via a bank wire or ACH
transfer in  U.S. dollars to such bank account as such Party shall
designate.  All dollar amounts specified in this Agreement are U.S. dollar
amounts.  For clarity, currency transaction rates used by Juno shall be in
accordance with its standard accounting practices consistently applied and in
accordance with its accounting practices for external reporting
purposes.  Editas has the right to verify that the exchange rates used by Juno
for a given month align with Juno’s external reporting.  If the due date of any
payment hereunder is not a Business Day, such payment may be paid on the
following Business Day.  Any undisputed payments that are not paid on the date
such payments are due under this Agreement shall bear interest to the extent
permitted by Law at the prime rate as reported by The Wall Street Journal on the
date such payment is due, plus an additional [**] percent ([**]%), calculated on
the number of days such payment is delinquent.

6.4.2    Blocked Currency. If at any time any Law in any country in the
Territory makes impossible or illegal the prompt remittance of any payments with
respect to sales therein, Juno shall promptly notify Editas of the conditions
preventing such transfer and such royalties or other payments shall be deposited
in local currency in the relevant country to the credit of Editas in a
recognized banking institution with a good creditworthiness, such banking
institution to be designated by Editas or, if none is designated by Editas
within [**], in a recognized banking institution selected by Juno and identified
in a written notice given to Editas. If so deposited in a foreign country, Juno
shall provide reasonable cooperation to Editas so as to allow Editas to assume
control over such deposit as promptly as practicable.

6.4.3    Confidentiality. Each Party shall treat all financial information of
the other Party that is subject to review under this ARTICLE 6 (including all
royalty reports) as such other Party’s Confidential Information.

6.4.4    Taxes; Withholding.

(a)        Generally.  Each Party will pay any and all income taxes levied on
account of all payments it receives under this Agreement except as otherwise
provided in this Section 6.4.4.

(b)        Tax Withholding.  Each Party shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts payable under this Agreement such taxes as are required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under any provision of applicable Law.  The Party
that is required to make such withholding (the “Paying Party”) will (i) deduct
those taxes from such payment, (ii) timely remit the taxes to the proper taxing
authority, and (iii) send evidence of the obligation together with proof of tax
payment to the other Party (the “Payee Party”) on a timely basis following that
tax payment.  Each Party agrees to reasonably cooperate with the Paying Party in
claiming refunds or exemptions from such deductions or withholdings under any
relevant agreement or treaty which is in effect to ensure that any amounts
required to be withheld pursuant to this Section 6.4.4(b) are reduced in amount
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law.

(c)        Tax Documentation.  Editas has provided a properly completed and duly
executed IRS Form W-9  (or other applicable form) to Juno.  Prior to the receipt
of any payment under this Agreement, Editas (and any other recipient of payments
by Juno under this Agreement) shall, to the extent it is legally permitted to,
provide to Juno, at the time or times





37




reasonably requested by Juno or as required by applicable Law, such properly
completed and duly executed documentation (for example, IRS Forms W-8 or W-9 or
foreign equivalents) as will permit payments made under this Agreement to be
made without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding for taxes.

(d)        Gross-Up for Increased Taxes.  In the event that a withholding tax is
imposed at an increased rate on any amount payable under this Agreement solely
as a result of (i) any assignment or delegation under Section 12.4 by the paying
Party or its predecessor or successor in interest to another Person, (ii) any
extension of rights, licenses, immunities and obligations under Section 12.14 by
the paying Party or its predecessor or successor in interest to another Person,
(iii) the payment of the amount by a Person other than the Party obligated to
make such payment under this Agreement, or (iv) any combination of the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), in each case ((i) – (iv)), after the applicable
Effective Date with a resulting harm to the Party entitled to receive the
payment (e.g., the Party entitled to receive the Payment or its Affiliate is not
entitled to seek any offsetting credit), then the increase in withholding tax
resulting from such action or combination of actions to the extent of such harm
(the “Increased Tax”) shall be subject to the provisions of this Section
6.4.4(d).  To the extent an Increased Tax is determinable at the time of the
associated payment, the amount otherwise payable under this Agreement shall be
increased sufficiently that, after payment of all Increased Taxes (including,
for the sake of clarity, Increased Tax on any increased payment under this
Section 6.4.4(d)) the net amount received by the recipient of the payment is
equal to the net amount such recipient would have received in the absence of
action or actions resulting in the Increased Tax to the extent of such harm.

6.5       Records Retention by Juno; Review by Editas.

6.5.1    Records.  With respect to royalty payments to be made under Sections
6.2 of this Agreement, Juno agrees to keep and shall procure that its Affiliates
and Sublicensees keep, for at least [**] from the end of the Calendar Year to
which they pertain, complete and accurate records of sales by Juno or any of its
Affiliates (including sales by Sublicensees), as the case may be, of each
Licensed Product, in sufficient detail to allow the accuracy of such payments
made hereunder to be confirmed.

6.5.2    Review.  Subject to the other terms of this Section 6.5.2, during the
Term, at the request of Editas, which shall not be made more frequently than
[**], upon at least [**] prior written notice from Editas, and at the expense of
Editas,  Juno shall permit an independent, nationally-recognized certified
public accountant selected by Editas and reasonably acceptable to Juno to
inspect (during regular business hours) the relevant records required to be
maintained by Juno under Section 6.5.1; provided that such audit right shall not
apply to records beyond [**] from the end of the Calendar Year to which they
pertain.  In every case,  any such accountant must have previously entered into
a confidentiality agreement reasonably acceptable to both Parties and limiting
the disclosure and use of such information by such accountant to authorized
representatives of the Parties and the purposes germane to Section
6.5.1.  Results of any such review shall be binding on both Parties absent
manifest error.  Such accountant shall report to Editas only whether the
particular amount being audited was accurate, and if not, the amount of any
discrepancy and the basis for such assessment, and such accountant shall not
report any other information to Editas.  Editas shall treat the results of any
such accountant’s review of Juno’s records as Confidential Information of Juno
subject to the terms of ARTICLE 8.  If any review





38




reveals a deficiency or overpayment in the calculation or payment of royalties
by Juno hereunder, then (a) Juno or Editas, as applicable, shall promptly pay
(or refund, as applicable) to the other Party the amount of such deficiency  or
overpayment, as applicable and (b) in the case of a deficiency, if such
deficiency is by more than the greater of (i) [**] percent ([**]%) of the
aggregate amounts owed by Juno or (ii) [**] Dollars ($[**]), Juno shall, within
[**] after receipt of an invoice therefor, pay the reasonable out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by Editas for such independent accountant in
connection with the review.

given Calendar Year, subject and without prejudice to the determination of any
review commenced prior to such third anniversary pursuant to Section 6.5.2, the

binding and conclusive upon Editas, and Juno (and its Affiliates) shall be
released from any liability or accountability with respect to such royalties for
such Calendar Year.

6.6       Editas Third Party Agreements.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, Editas shall be solely responsible for all costs and
payments of any kind (including all upfront fees, annual payments, milestone
payments and royalty payments) arising under any agreements between Editas (or
any of its Affiliates) and any Third Party (including under any In-License
Agreement or other Existing Program Agreement), which costs or payments arise in
connection with, or as a result of, the activities conducted hereunder,
including the Research,  Development, Manufacture or Commercialization of
Licensed RNP Complexes or Licensed Products.  Juno shall use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to comply with Editas’ reasonable requests for financial
information with respect to its activities hereunder, to the extent reasonably
available to Juno, and solely as necessary for Editas to comply with its
reporting obligations to any of its In-License Counterparty under the In-License
Agreements; provided that Editas shall ensure that each such In-License
Counterparty is bound by written confidentiality obligations and non-use
obligations no less restrictive than those set forth in ARTICLE 8 to maintain
the confidentiality thereof and not to use such information except as expressly
permitted by this Agreement; provided, further, that Editas shall remain
responsible for any failure by any In-License Counterparty who receives such
information to treat information as required under ARTICLE 8.

6.7       Additional Provisions.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the terms and provisions of this ARTICLE 6 are subject to
Section 12.7 of the Master Collaboration Agreement and Sections 11.7 and 11.9 of
this Agreement.

Excluded Ocular Field and the Excluded Base Editing Non-Cancer Field, in each
case, for so long as such field is excluded from the Licensed Field in
accordance with Section 1.142) in the Territory.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, (i) if the Licensed Program described in a
Licensed Program Addendum is Directed to a Co-Exclusive Target (as expressly
identified in the Licensed Program Addendum), then the rights sublicensed to
Juno under this Section 7.1 with respect to such Co-Exclusive Target shall be
co-exclusive with the Third Party holding such rights as described in the Master
Collaboration Agreement, but solely with respect to the Editas Licensed
Background IP that is the subject of the Harvard-Broad Agreements and for so
long as such Third Party has co-exclusive rights thereto, (ii) if the Licensed
Program described in a Licensed Program Addendum is Directed to a Target for use
in medullary cystic kidney disease 1 (“MCKD1”) (as expressly identified in the
Licensed Program Addendum), then the rights sublicensed to Juno under this
Section 7.1 with respect to such Licensed Program shall be non-exclusive for use
in the MCKD1 field, and (iii) the rights granted pursuant to this Section 7.1
shall be co-exclusive with BlueRock solely to the extent such rights relate to
the use of iPSC-derived regulatory T-Cells specifically intended for the
treatment, diagnosis or prevention of any Indication that is not a cancer
Indication for so long as BlueRock has co-exclusive rights with respect thereto
pursuant to the BlueRock Agreement.

7.2       Rights Retained by the Parties.  For clarity, each Party retains all
rights under Know-How and Patent Rights Controlled by such Party not expressly
granted to the other Party pursuant to this Agreement.

7.3       Non-Assertion.  Editas hereby covenants and agrees not to (and shall
cause its Affiliates not to) sue or bring any cause of action or otherwise
assert against (a) Juno, (b) any Affiliate or Sublicensee of Juno that receives
a sublicense or other rights from Juno pursuant to the terms of Section 7.4 or
Section 12.14, or (c) any of their respective successors or permitted assigns,
for any type of infringement of any Patent Rights or misappropriation of any
Know-How (but excluding (i) any Excluded Patents or Excluded Know-How, and (ii)
any Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP that Juno has not elected to include
pursuant to Section 7.17), which infringement or misappropriation arises from
the research (including Research), development (including Development), making
(including Manufacture), having made (including having Manufactured), using,
offering for sale, selling, importing, Commercializing or otherwise exploiting
in accordance with this Agreement (A) any Licensed RNP Complex in the Licensed
Field in the Territory; and (B) any Licensed Product for any purpose  (but
excluding the Excluded Ocular Field and the Excluded Base Editing Non-Cancer
Field, in each case, for so long as such field is excluded from the Licensed
Field in accordance with Section 1.142)  in the Territory.

7.4       Sublicenses.  Juno shall have the right to grant sublicenses
(including through multiple tiers,  subject to limitation(s) on further
sublicensing in the In-License Agreement(s) as set forth in Section 7.5, if
applicable) under the licenses granted to it under Section 7.1 to its Affiliates
or Sublicensees; provided that any sublicense granted under this Agreement to a
Sublicensee shall be pursuant to a written agreement that subjects such
Sublicensee to all relevant restrictions and limitations set forth in this
Agreement and Juno shall notify Editas of each such sublicense granted to a
Sublicensee.  Juno shall remain responsible for the performance of its
Sublicensees, and shall ensure that each Sublicensee complies with the
applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing to the contrary, solely with respect





40




to Editas Licensed Background IP sublicensed to Juno under the Harvard-Broad
Licenses, unless and until the receipt of written agreement by Institutions to
permit further sublicensing, Juno shall not have the right to grant any
sublicenses (other than to Affiliates of Juno and other than may be agreed in
writing by Institutions, in each case subject to all restrictions on the
granting of sublicenses herein); provided that at the request of Juno, Editas
shall promptly use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain such consent from
Institutions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, solely with
respect to Editas Licensed Background IP sublicensed to Juno under the MGH
Licenses, unless and until the receipt of written agreement by MGH to permit
further sublicensing, Juno shall not have the right to grant any sublicenses
(other than to Affiliates of Juno and other than may be agreed in writing by
MGH, in each case subject to all restrictions on the granting of sublicenses
herein); provided that at the request of Juno, Editas shall promptly use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain such consent from MGH.  All
sublicenses granted by Juno hereunder, and any further sublicenses by a
Sublicensee shall comply with, and be subject and subordinate to, the relevant
terms and conditions of this Agreement.  If Editas is unable to obtain the
written agreement from the Institutions or MGH, as applicable, within [**] after
request by Juno,  to allow for the further granting of sublicenses by Juno, then
upon Juno’s request at any time during the Term, Editas shall grant a direct
license to any Third Party as Juno directs, provided such direct license is
within the scope of Juno’s licenses granted under Section 7.1.

7.5       Compliance with In-License Agreements.  On a Licensed
Program-by-Licensed Program basis, as applicable, the terms of this Agreement,
insofar as they relate to a sublicense of Editas Licensed Background IP licensed
to Editas or any of its Affiliates pursuant to an In-License Agreement, shall be
subject to the applicable provisions of the relevant In-License Agreement, but
only to the extent that the applicable In-License Agreement requires such terms
and conditions to be imposed on a sublicensee pursuant to such In-License
Agreement, as follows: (a) with respect to any Editas Licensed Background IP
Controlled by Editas or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the Cas9-I Agreement,
the provisions set forth on Schedule 7.5(a) shall apply; (b) with respect to any
Editas Licensed Background IP Controlled by Editas or any of its Affiliates
pursuant to the Cas9-II Agreement, the provisions set forth on Schedule 7.5(b)
shall apply; (c) with respect to Editas Licensed Background IP Controlled by
Editas or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the  Cpf1 Agreement, the provisions

Licensed Background IP Controlled  by Editas or any of its Affiliates pursuant
to the 2014 MGH Agreement, the provisions set forth on Schedule 7.5(d) shall
apply; and (e) with respect to any Editas Licensed Background IP Controlled by
Editas or any of its Affiliates pursuant to the 2016 MGH Agreement, the
provisions set forth on Schedule 7.5(e) shall apply; provided that the terms on
Schedule 7.5 applicable to a given Licensed Program Addendum shall be appended
to such Licensed Program Addendum.  Each applicable Licensed Program Addendum
shall be updated with respect to any Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP in
accordance with Section 7.17.

7.6       No Implied Licenses.  Except as explicitly set forth in this Agreement
or the Master Collaboration Agreement, neither Party shall be deemed by estoppel
or implication to have granted to the other Party any license or other right to
any IP or trademarks (or trademark applications) of such Party.

7.7       Insolvency.  If this Agreement is terminated due to the rejection of
this Agreement by or on behalf of Editas in or during any bankruptcy or similar
proceeding of Editas, all licenses





41




and rights to licenses granted under or pursuant to this Agreement by Editas to
Juno are and shall otherwise be deemed to be licenses of rights to “intellectual
property” (including for purposes of Section 365(n) of Title 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code (“Section 365(n)”) and other similar laws in any other
jurisdiction).  The Parties agree that Juno, as a licensee of such rights under
this Agreement, shall retain and may fully exercise all of its rights and
elections under any applicable insolvency statute, and that upon (x)
commencement of bankruptcy or similar proceeding by or against Editas, (y) any
rejection or similar disavowal of this Agreement by Editas in or during any such
proceeding and (z) any election by Juno to exercise its rights to continue its
licenses hereunder pursuant to Section 365(n) or any similar provision of
applicable law in any jurisdiction, Juno shall be entitled to a complete
duplicate of or complete access to (as Juno deems appropriate), any such IP and
all embodiments of such IP as may be necessary for Juno to enjoy its license
rights hereunder.  Such IP and all embodiments thereof shall be promptly
delivered to Juno following the occurrence of the events described in the
foregoing clauses (x) through (z) of this section and upon written request
therefor by Juno.  The provisions of this Section 7.7 shall be (i) without
prejudice to any rights Juno may have arising under any applicable insolvency
statute or other applicable Law and (ii) effective only to the extent permitted
by applicable Law.  For the avoidance of doubt, the payments required to be made
by Juno in connection with any exercise of rights under Section 365(n) or any
similar provision of applicable law in any jurisdiction shall include both
royalties under Section 6.2 hereof and Milestone Payments under Section 6.3
hereof, in each case as such amounts become due and payable and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein.

7.8       Ownership.

7.8.1    Inventorship.  Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.1,
inventorship of any inventions (whether patentable or not) created, conceived,
discovered, developed, generated, invented, made or reduced to practice by or on
behalf of a Party or its Affiliates, whether solely or jointly with any Third
Party (or with the other Party or its Affiliates), in the course of activities
performed under this Agreement, shall be determined by application of U.S.
patent law pertaining to inventorship, and, except as otherwise provided for in
Sections 7.8.2 and 7.8.3,  ownership of IP shall be determined by inventorship.

7.8.2    Editas Licensed Background IP and Editas Licensed Collaboration IP.  As
between the Parties (including their respective Affiliates), Editas will retain
all right, title and interest in and to all Editas Licensed Background IP and
Editas Licensed Collaboration IP, except to the extent that any such rights are
licensed or granted to Juno under this Agreement or the Master Collaboration
Agreement.

7.8.3    Joint IP.  The Parties shall each own an equal, undivided interest in
(a) any and all Joint Know-How; and (b) any Joint Patents.  Each Party shall
assign, and hereby assigns, to the other Party, a joint equal and undivided
interest in and to such Joint IP (provided, however, that, for clarity, the
foregoing joint ownership rights with respect to Joint IP shall not be construed
as granting, conveying or creating any license or other rights to any of the
other Party’s other IP, unless otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement),
and at the request of a Party, the other Party will execute such documents
(including any necessary assignments) to effect such joint ownership of such
Joint IP.  Each Party shall have the right to disclose (subject to Section 8.1)
and exploit (including granting licenses to Third Parties) the Joint IP and
Joint Collaboration IP without





42




a duty of seeking consent or accounting to the other Party; provided that, with
respect to Editas, such rights shall be subject to the rights and licenses
granted to Juno hereunder (or under the Master Collaboration Agreement),
including the obligations of Editas as set forth in ARTICLE 5.

7.8.4    Further Actions.  Each Party shall cause its Affiliates and its
Affiliates’ employees, consultants, sublicensees, agents and contractors to
assign to such Party, such Person’s right, title and interest in and to any and
all Editas Licensed Collaboration IP (in the case of Editas) or Joint IP, and IP
rights therein, as is necessary to effect the intent of this Section 7.8.

7.9       Patent Liaisons.  Promptly after the Execution Date, each Party shall
appoint an individual to act as a patent liaison for such Party (each, a “Patent
Liaison”).  The Patent Liaisons shall be the primary point of contact for the
Parties regarding IP-related activities and matters contemplated by this
Agreement, as and to the extent requested by Juno from time to time.  The name
and contact information for each Party’s Patent Liaison, as well as any
replacement(s) chosen by such Party, in its sole discretion, from time to time,
shall be promptly provided to the other Party in accordance with Section 12.7.

7.10     Prosecution and Maintenance of Editas Licensed Background Patents,
 Editas Licensed Collaboration Patents,  Joint Collaboration Patents and Joint
Patents.  Following the Effective Date, the provisions of this Section 7.10
shall apply with respect to the Editas Licensed Background Patents,  Editas
Licensed Collaboration Patents,  Joint Collaboration Patents and Joint Patents.

7.10.1  Editas Licensed Background Patents.  As between the Parties, Editas
shall have the sole right (but not the obligation) to Prosecute and Maintain the
Editas Licensed Background Patents; provided, however, that Editas shall use
good faith efforts to keep Juno reasonably informed with respect to any material
developments regarding the Prosecution and Maintenance of any Editas Licensed
Background Patents.

7.10.2  Editas Licensed Collaboration Patents.

(a)        Editas shall be responsible for Prosecuting and Maintaining the
Editas Licensed Collaboration Patents at Juno’s direction and Juno shall have
final decision-making authority with respect thereto.  Juno shall reimburse
Editas for its reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with the
Prosecution and Maintenance of such Editas Licensed Collaboration Patents.

(b)        If Juno intends to allow an  Editas Licensed Collaboration Patent to
lapse or become abandoned without having first directed Editas to file a
substitute, or decides not to participate in any interferences, reissues,
re-examinations, inter partes reviews, derivations, post grant proceedings or
oppositions with respect to an  Editas Licensed Collaboration Patent it shall
notify Editas of such decision or intention at least [**] prior to the date upon
which such Patent Rights shall lapse or become abandoned, and, if after such
consultation between the Parties, Juno still intends to allow such Editas
Licensed Collaboration Patent to lapse or become abandoned, Editas shall
thereupon have the right (but not the obligation) to assume the Prosecution and
Maintenance thereof at Editas’ expense with counsel of its choice.  The
foregoing shall not apply where, with reference to a specific patent family,
Juno, in its reasonable determination, decides





43




not to file a continuing application in a particular country due to the
existence of one or more pending patent application(s) in such country.

(c)        Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely with respect to Editas Licensed
Collaboration Patents that are jointly owned by Editas and BlueRock pursuant to
the BlueRock Agreement (i.e., BlueRock is a joint inventor on such Patent Right)
(the “Editas-BlueRock Joint Patents”), the foregoing prosecution and maintenance
rights set forth in this Section 7.10.2 shall be subject to the prosecution and
maintenance rights of BlueRock set forth in the BlueRock Agreement for such
Editas-BlueRock Joint Patent, as the BlueRock Agreement exists as of the
Execution Date and solely for so long as the BlueRock Agreement, or the
surviving provisions thereof (to the extent the applicable provisions survive),
remains in force and effect.

7.10.3  Joint Collaboration Patents and Joint Patents.

(a)        The Parties shall be jointly responsible for Prosecuting and
Maintaining the Joint Collaboration Patents and Joint Patents, including for
conducting any interferences, re-examinations, inter partes review, post-grant
proceedings, reissues and oppositions relating thereto and shall equally share
all costs related thereto. The Parties have jointly selected counsel (“Joint
Counsel”) for the Prosecution and Maintenance of all Joint Collaboration Patents
and Joint Patents.  The Joint Counsel shall give Juno and Editas (or each
Party’s designee) an opportunity to review the text of each application, office
action response or other substantive document relating to a prospective Joint
Collaboration Patent or Joint Patent before filing with any patent office in the
Territory, shall incorporate Juno’s and Editas’ (or each Party’s designee)
reasonable comments with respect thereto, and shall supply Juno and Editas (or
each Party’s designee) with a copy of each such application, office action
response or other substantive document as filed, together with notice of its
filing date and serial number.  Both Parties shall cooperate with Joint Counsel
for all activities relating to Joint Collaboration Patent or Joint Patent
prosecution and maintenance. In the event that Editas and Juno provide Joint
Counsel with conflicting instructions regarding the Prosecution and/or
Maintenance of a Joint Collaboration Patent or Joint Patent, Juno shall have the
final decision-making authority with respect to the Prosecution and Maintenance
of such Joint Collaboration Patent or Joint Patent.

(b)        If Juno intends to allow a Joint Collaboration Patent or Joint
Patent, as applicable, to lapse or become abandoned in any country in the
Territory without having first filed a substitute, or decides not to participate
in any interferences, reissues, re-examinations, inter partes reviews,
derivations, post grant proceedings or oppositions with respect to a  Joint
Collaboration Patent or Joint Patent, as applicable, it shall notify and consult
with Editas of such decision or intention at least [**] prior to the date upon
which such Patent Rights shall lapse or become abandoned, and, if after such
consultation between the Parties, Juno still intends to allow such Joint
Collaboration Patent or Joint Patent, as applicable, to lapse or become
abandoned,  Editas shall thereupon have the right (but not the obligation) to
assume the Prosecution and Maintenance thereof at Editas’ expense with counsel
of its choice and under Editas’ direction and control.  The foregoing shall not
apply where, with reference to a specific patent family, Juno, in its reasonable
determination, decides not to file a continuing application in a particular
country due to the existence of one or more pending patent application(s) in
such country.





44




7.10.4  Cooperation in Prosecution and Maintenance.  The Party that is
responsible for the Prosecution and Maintenance of any Editas Licensed
Collaboration Patent,  Joint Collaboration Patent or Joint Patent, as
applicable, pursuant to this Section 7.10 (the “Prosecuting Party”) shall keep
the other Party (the “Non-Prosecuting Party”) informed as to material
developments with respect to the Prosecution and Maintenance of such Patent
Rights including by providing copies of all substantive office actions,
examination reports, communications or any other substantive documents to or
from any patent office, including notice of all interferences, reissues,
re-examinations, inter partes reviews, derivations, post grant proceedings or
oppositions.  The Prosecuting Party shall also provide the Non-Prosecuting Party
with a reasonable opportunity to comment substantively on the Prosecution and
Maintenance of such Patent Rights prior to taking material actions (including
the filing of initial applications), and will in good faith consider any
comments made by and actions recommended by the Non-Prosecuting Party; provided,
however, that the Non-Prosecuting Party does so consistent with any applicable
filing deadlines.  The Non-Prosecuting Party shall reasonably cooperate with the
Prosecuting Party in connection with any such actions hereunder, including,
where Juno is the Prosecuting Party, by making its employees, agents and
consultants reasonably available to the Prosecuting Party (and to the
Prosecuting Party’s authorized attorneys, agents or representatives) to enable
the Prosecuting Party to undertake such Prosecution and Maintenance.  In
addition, the Non-Prosecuting Party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates and
its and their employees, agents and consultants to) provide reasonable
assistance to the Prosecuting Party (and to the Prosecuting Party’s authorized
attorneys, agents or representatives) to enable the Prosecuting Party to
undertake such Prosecution and Maintenance, including by executing powers of
attorney and other documents for the Prosecuting Party to undertake such
Prosecution and Maintenance.

7.10.5  Costs of Prosecution and Maintenance.  Except as otherwise expressly set
forth in this Section 7.10, each Party shall be responsible for all costs and
expenses associated with its Prosecution and Maintenance activities under this
Section 7.10 with respect to Editas Licensed Background Patents,  Editas
Licensed Collaboration Patents,  Joint Collaboration Patents and Joint Patents
that it incurs pursuant to Section 7.10.1, Section 7.10.2 or Section 7.10.3, as
applicable.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.10.5,
 Juno will not be responsible for any Prosecution and Maintenance costs
associated with any subject matter divided out of such Patent Rights that is not
licensed to Juno (and Editas shall reimburse Juno for any such costs incurred by
Juno or any of its Affiliates).

7.11     Enforcement of Editas Licensed Background Patents,  Editas Licensed
Collaboration Patents,  Joint Collaboration Patents and Joint Patents.

7.11.1  Notice.  If either Party learns of an infringement or threatened
infringement by a Third Party in the Territory of any Editas Licensed Background
Patent, Editas Licensed Collaboration Patent, Joint Collaboration Patent or
Joint Patent, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party and shall provide
such other Party with available evidence of such infringement, and following
such notification, the Parties shall confer.

7.11.2  Juno Enforcement Rights.  Subject to the provisions of this Section
7.11,  Juno shall have the sole right, but not the obligation, to institute,
prosecute, and control any action or proceeding (which may include settlement or
otherwise seeking to secure the abatement of such infringement) with respect to
any infringement of (a) any Editas Licensed Collaboration Patent to





45




the extent such infringement relates to a Competing Product; and (b) Joint
Collaboration Patent or Joint Patent, in each case, at Juno’s expense, by
counsel of its own choice, in Juno’s own name (or, if required, under Editas’
name) and under Juno’s direction and control, including the right to control the
defense of any challenges to such Patent Rights as a counterclaim in such
infringement proceeding as well as the defense of declaratory judgment actions;
provided, however, that solely with respect to Editas-BlueRock Joint Patents,
the foregoing enforcement rights set forth in this Section 7.11.2 shall be
subject to the enforcement rights of BlueRock set forth in the BlueRock
Agreement for such Editas-BlueRock Joint Patent as the BlueRock Agreement exists
as of the Execution Date and solely for so long as the BlueRock Agreement, or
the surviving provisions thereof (to the extent the applicable provisions
survive), remains in force and effect.

7.11.3  Editas Enforcement Rights.  Subject to the provisions of this Section
7.11, as between the Parties,  Editas shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to institute, prosecute, and control any action or proceeding (which
may include settlement or otherwise seeking to secure the abatement of such
infringement) with respect to any infringement of (a) any Editas Licensed
Background Patent; or (b) any Editas Licensed Collaboration Patent (except to
the extent such infringement relates to a Competing Product), in each case, at
Editas’ expense, by counsel of its own choice, in Editas’ own name and under
Editas’ direction and control, including the right to control the defense of any
challenges to such Patent Rights as a counterclaim in such infringement
proceeding as well as the defense of declaratory judgment
actions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Editas shall notify Juno in writing
prior to initiating any such action or proceeding pursuant to this Section
7.11.3, (ii) Editas shall in good faith give careful consideration of Juno’s
views and to potential effects on Juno’s business in making the decision of
whether or not to commence such enforcement action; provided that if Juno has
any reasonable grounds for believing that Editas’ exercise of its enforcement
right with respect to (A) any Editas Licensed Background Patent in connection
with a Competing Product or (B) any Editas Licensed Collaboration Patent, in
either case, could reasonably be detrimental to the patent protection of any
Licensed RNP Complex or Licensed Product, then Editas shall not be permitted to
enforce such Patent Rights without the prior consent of Juno, in Juno’s
discretion,  and (iii) if Juno reasonably requests that Editas exercise its
enforcement right with respect to (A) any Editas Licensed Background Patent in
connection with a Competing Product or (B) any Editas Licensed Collaboration
Patent,  in either case, then Editas shall enforce such Patent Rights; provided,
however, that if Editas notifies Juno in writing of any reasonable grounds for
believing that exercise of such enforcement right with respect to any such
Editas Licensed Background Patent could reasonably be detrimental to such Editas
Licensed Background Patent, then the Parties shall discuss in good faith and
mutually agree on the appropriate enforcement action; provided, further,
however, that if Juno requests that Editas exercise its enforcement right with
respect to any Editas Licensed Background Patent that is sublicensed to Juno
hereunder pursuant to the terms of any In-License Agreement(s) and the terms of
such In-License Agreement(s) (as set forth in Section 7.5) restrict the ability
of Editas to enforce such Editas Licensed Background Patent, then such
enforcement shall be subject to the applicable provisions of Section 7.5.

7.11.4  Joinder.  In the case of any enforcement action or proceeding set forth
in Section 7.11.2,  the non-enforcing Party will (and will cause its Affiliates
to) join any such action or proceeding as a party at the enforcing Party’s
expense (and the non-enforcing Party will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to
cause any of its Third Party licensors of the applicable Patent





46




Right as necessary to join such action or proceeding as a party) if doing so is
necessary for the purposes of establishing standing or is otherwise required by
applicable Law to pursue such action or proceeding or claim damages.  The
non-enforcing Party may, at its option, participate in such enforcement action
or proceeding at its own expense, but the enforcing Party shall still control
such action or proceeding.  In the case of any enforcement action or proceeding
controlled by Editas pursuant to Section 7.11.3,  Juno may, at its option,
participate in such enforcement action or proceeding at its own expense.

7.11.5  Consultation; Cooperation.  The enforcing Party will keep the
non-enforcing Party regularly informed of the status and progress of such
enforcement efforts with respect to any Editas Licensed Background Patent,
 Editas Licensed Collaboration Patent, Joint Collaboration Patent or Joint
Patent, as applicable.  The enforcing Party shall consult with the non-enforcing
Party and will take comments of the non-enforcing Party into good faith
consideration with respect to the infringement or claim construction of any
claim in any such Editas Licensed Background Patent,  Editas Licensed
Collaboration Patent,  Joint Collaboration Patent or Joint Patent, as
applicable.  The non-enforcing Party will provide the enforcing Party reasonable
cooperation in such enforcement, at such enforcing Party’s request and expense.

7.11.6  Settlement.  A settlement or consent judgment or other voluntary final
disposition of a suit with respect to any Editas Licensed Background Patent,
 Editas Licensed Collaboration Patent, Joint Collaboration Patent or Joint
Patent, as applicable, under this Section 7.11 may be entered into without the
consent of the Party not bringing suit; provided, however, that any such
settlement, consent judgment or other disposition of any action or proceeding by
the Party bringing suit under this Section 7.11 shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Party not bringing suit, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed,  (a) impose any liability or
obligation on the Party not bringing suit or any of its Affiliates;  (b)
conflict with or reduce the scope of the subject matter claimed in the
applicable Editas Licensed Background Patent,  Editas Licensed Collaboration
Patent, Joint Collaboration Patent or Joint Patent;  (c) in the case of Editas
as the party bringing the suit, include the grant of any license, covenant or
other rights to any Third Party that would conflict with or reduce the scope of
the rights or licenses granted to Juno under this Agreement or the Master
Collaboration Agreement; or (d) in the case of Editas as the party bringing the
suit, otherwise adversely affect the rights granted to Juno hereunder with
respect to such Editas Licensed Background Patents,  Editas Licensed
Collaboration Patents,  Joint Collaboration Patents or Joint Patents, as
applicable.

7.11.7  Costs and Recoveries.  Except as otherwise set forth in this Section
7.11, each Party shall bear all of its costs incurred in connection with its
activities under this Section 7.11.  Any damages or other monetary awards
recovered in any action, suit or proceeding brought under this Section 7.11 to
the extent related to any Editas Licensed Background Patents,  Editas Licensed
Collaboration Patents,  Joint Collaboration Patents or Joint Patents shall be
shared as follows:

(a)        the amount of such recovery actually received by the Party
controlling such action shall first be applied to reimburse costs and expenses
incurred by each Party in connection with such action (including, for this
purpose, a reasonable allocation of expenses of internal counsel); and





47




(b)        the remaining portion of such recovery shall be paid to Juno;
provided that Editas shall receive an amount equal to the royalties that would
have been due upon such remainder calculated in accordance with Section 6.2 as
if such remainder are Net Sales of a Licensed Product sold by or under the
authority of Juno; provided that, if the recovery relates to Patent Right(s)
that are sublicensed to Juno hereunder pursuant to the terms of any In-License
Agreement(s) and the terms of such In-License Agreement(s) (as set forth in
Section 7.5), entitles the applicable In-License Counterparty(ies) to a portion
of any recovery that is greater than the amount otherwise payable to Editas
pursuant to this Section 7.11.7(b), the Parties will meet and agree in good
faith on an alternative sharing of such recovery that takes into account the
amounts payable to the applicable In-License Counterparty(ies) and results in an
equitable allocation of the amounts remaining to Juno and Editas.

7.11.8  Biosimilar Applications.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 7.11, if either Party receives a copy of a Biosimilar Application
referencing a Licensed Product, whether or not such notice or copy is provided
under any applicable Law (including under the BPCIA, the United States Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, or their successor provisions, or any
similar provisions in a country outside the United States, as applicable), or
otherwise becomes aware that such a Biosimilar Application has been submitted to
a Regulatory Authority for marketing authorization (such as in an instance
described in 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(2)), the remainder of this Section 7.11.8 shall
apply.  Such Party shall promptly, but in any event within [**] of becoming
aware that such a Biosimilar Application has been submitted to a Regulatory
Authority for marketing authorization, notify the other Party.  The owner of the
relevant Patent Rights shall then seek permission to view the Biosimilar
Application, information regarding the process or processes used to manufacture
the product that is the subject of the Biosimilar Application, and related
confidential information from the filer of the Biosimilar Application if
necessary under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(1)(B)(iii).  If either Party receives any
equivalent or similar communication or notice in the United States or any other
jurisdiction, the Party receiving such communication or notice shall within [**]
notify the other Party of such communication or notice to the extent permitted
by applicable Law. Regardless of the Party that is the “reference product
sponsor”, as defined in 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(1)(A), for purposes of such
Biosimilar Application:

(a)        Juno shall designate, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, or
otherwise Editas shall designate in accordance with Juno’s instructions, the
outside counsel and in-house counsel who shall receive confidential access to
the Biosimilar Application, information regarding the process or processes used
to manufacture the product that is the subject of the Biosimilar Application,
and any related confidential information pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §
262(l)(1)(B)(ii).

(b)        In each case, after consulting with Editas and considering Editas’
comments in good faith, Juno shall have the right to (i) list any Patent Rights,
including any Editas Licensed Background Patents, Editas Licensed Collaboration
Patents, Joint Collaboration Patents and Joint Patents, as required pursuant to
42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(3)(A) or 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(7), (ii) respond to any
communications with respect to such lists from the filer of the Biosimilar
Application, (iii) negotiate with the filer of the Biosimilar Application as to
whether to utilize a different mechanism for information exchange other than
that specified in 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(1) and (iv) as to the Patent Rights that
will be subject to the litigation procedure as described in 42





48




U.S.C. § 262(l)(4), decide which Patent Rights shall be selected for litigation
under 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(5)(B)(i)(II), and commence such litigation under 42
U.S.C. § 262(l)(6).  If Editas is required pursuant to applicable Law to execute
any of these tasks, it shall do so in accordance with Juno’s instructions.

(c)        Juno shall have the right, after consulting with Editas, to identify
Patent Rights, including any Editas Licensed Background Patents, Editas Licensed
Collaboration Patents, Joint Collaboration Patents and Joint Patents, or respond
to relevant communications under any equivalent or similar listing to those
described in the preceding clause (b) in any other jurisdiction outside of the
United States.  If Editas is required pursuant to applicable Law to execute any
of these tasks, it shall do so in accordance with Juno’s instructions.

(d)        Editas shall cooperate with Juno’s reasonable requests in connection
with the foregoing activities to the extent required or permitted by applicable
Law.  Juno shall consult with Editas prior to identifying any Editas Licensed
Background Patents, Editas Licensed Collaboration Patents, Joint Collaboration
Patents or Joint Patents to a Third Party as contemplated by this Section
7.11.8.  Juno shall consider in good faith advice and suggestions with respect
thereto received from Editas, and notify Editas of any such lists or
communications promptly after they are made.

(e)        Each Party shall notify the other Party within [**] after receiving
any notice of commercial marketing provided by the filer of a Biosimilar
Application pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 262(l)(8)(A).  To the extent permitted by
applicable Law, Juno shall have the first right, but not the obligation, to seek
an injunction against such commercial marketing as permitted pursuant to 42
U.S.C. § 262(l)(8)(B) and to file an action for infringement.  If required
pursuant to applicable Law, upon Juno’s request, Editas shall assist in seeking
such injunction or filing such infringement action after consulting with
Juno.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 7.11.8, any such action
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Sections  7.11.1 through 7.11.7.

(f)        The Parties recognize that procedures other than those set forth
above in this Section 7.11.8 may apply with respect to Biosimilar Applications,
either in the United States or elsewhere.  If the Parties determine that certain
provisions of applicable Law in the United States or in any other country in the
Territory apply to actions taken by the Parties with respect to Biosimilar
Applications under this Section 7.11.8 in such country, the Parties shall comply
with any such applicable Law in such country (and any relevant and reasonable
procedures established by Parties) in exercising their rights and obligations
with respect to Biosimilar Applications under this Section 7.11.8 in a manner to
effectuate the intent of this Section 7.11.8.  Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 7.11.8, nothing in this Section 7.11.8 shall grant
any rights to Editas with respect to any Juno IP.

7.12     Patent Term Extensions.  Subject to the terms of the In-License
Agreements as set forth in Section 7.5,  Editas shall reasonably cooperate with
Juno, including providing reasonable assistance to Juno (including executing any
documents as may reasonably be required), in efforts to seek and obtain patent
term restoration or supplemental protection certificates or the like or their
equivalents in any country in the Territory, where applicable to Editas Licensed
Background Patents (excluding any Editas Licensed Background Patents licensed
under an In-License





49




Agreement),  Editas Licensed Collaboration Patents,  Joint Collaboration Patents
or Joint Patents, or any other Patent Rights Controlled by Juno (or any of its
Affiliates), including as may be available to the Parties under the provisions
of the U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 or
comparable laws outside the United States, in each case, in connection with any
Licensed Product.  If elections with respect to obtaining such patent term
restoration or supplemental protection certificates or the like or their
equivalents are to be made in connection therewith, Juno shall have the right to
make the election, and Editas agrees to abide by such election, provided that,
with respect to Editas Licensed Collaboration Patents or Editas Licensed
Background Patents (excluding any Editas Licensed Background Patents licensed
under an In-License Agreement for which Juno shall have no right to make such an
election), Juno has (i) given Editas reasonable advance notice of its intention
to extend any such Patent Rights; (ii) engaged in good faith discussions with
Editas regarding its intention to extend any such Patent Rights and (iii) in
good faith considered any argument by Editas to not extend such Patent Rights
for business reasons.  Without limiting the foregoing, Editas will not (and will
cause its Affiliates not to) extend (a) any Editas Licensed Background Patents
or Editas Licensed Collaboration Patent, with respect to any Licensed Product or
(b) any Joint Collaboration Patent or Joint Patent, in each case ((a) and (b)),
without the prior written approval of Juno, in its sole discretion.

7.13     Regulatory Data Protection.  Subject to the terms of the In-License
Agreements as set forth in Section 7.5, during the Term and after notifying
Editas in writing,  Juno (or its Designee) shall have the sole right to list,
with the applicable Regulatory Authorities in the Territory, all applicable
Patent Rights (including any Editas Licensed Background Patents,  Editas
Licensed Collaboration Patents,  Joint Collaboration Patents or Joint Patents)
for any Licensed Product, including all so called “Purple Book” listings
required under the U.S. Public Health Service Act, and all similar listings in
any other relevant countries, and Editas and its Affiliates shall have no right
to do so.  For the avoidance of doubt, Juno will retain final decision-making
authority as to the listing of all applicable Patent Rights for any Licensed
Product, regardless of which Party owns such Patent Rights, and Editas shall
reasonably assist Juno in connection therewith.

7.14     Common Interest Agreement.  At the request of either Party, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to enter into a common interest agreement to
govern their discussion of Patent matters under this Agreement (and the Master
Collaboration Agreement).

7.15     License Filing.  At the request of Juno,  Editas shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, assist in any license registration processes with applicable
Governmental Authorities that may be available for the protection of Juno’s
interests in this Agreement.

7.16     Defense of Claims Brought by Third Parties.  If a Party becomes aware
of any actual or threatened claim that the Research,  Development, Manufacture
or Commercialization of a Licensed RNP Complex or Licensed Product by or on
behalf of Juno pursuant to this Agreement infringes the IP rights of any Third
Party, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party.  In any such instance,
the Parties shall as soon as practicable thereafter meet to discuss in good
faith regarding the best response to such notice; provided that Juno shall have
the final decision-making authority in connection therewith.  Except as set
forth in Section 10.2 (and without limiting Juno’s rights under Section 10.2),
(a) Juno shall have the sole right, but not the obligation, to defend and
dispose of (including through settlement or license) such claim; and (b) any
costs incurred by or on behalf of Juno (or any of its Affiliates or
Sublicensees) in connection with the defense or





50




disposal of any such claim (including any damages, royalties or other amounts
payable as a result thereof), to the extent relating to the Research,
 Development, Manufacture or Commercialization of a Licensed RNP Complex or
Licensed Product, shall be included as Juno Third Party Payments and may be
deducted from amounts payable to Editas hereunder as set forth in Section 6.2.4,
and Juno shall report any such deductions to Editas as part of Juno’s royalty
report under Section 6.2.5.

7.17     Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP.

7.17.1  In the event that Editas or any of its Affiliates identifies any IP of a
Third Party that is necessary for the research, development, making, having
made, import, use, offering to sell, selling or otherwise exploiting any 
Licensed RNP Complex, Licensed Product or Licensed Program Target, then Editas
shall notify Juno thereof.

7.17.2  Subject to Section 7.17.1, if, following the Effective Date for a given
Licensed Program, Editas or any of its Affiliates (other than an Acquiring
Affiliate, unless such Acquiring Affiliate has provided access to Editas or any
of its Affiliates to the applicable IP, in which case such Acquiring Affiliate
shall be subject to this Section 7.17 with respect to such IP) enters into a
license agreement pursuant to which Editas or such Affiliate acquires Control of
any IP that claims or covers, or is otherwise necessary or useful for, any
Genome Editing Technology, Licensed RNP Complex, Licensed Product or Licensed
Program Target with respect to such Licensed Program or the research,
development, making, having made, import, use, offering to sell, selling or
otherwise exploiting any such Licensed RNP Complex or Licensed Product that was
not previously included in the Editas Licensed Background IP (collectively, the
“Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP”), Editas shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to (a)  obtain license terms with respect to such Subsequently Obtained
Licensed IP that are not more onerous with respect to any Licensed Programs for
which sublicenses are granted to or may be granted to Juno hereunder than they
are with respect to any other actual or potential programs or products for which
such Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP may be practiced or used; provided that
Editas shall in no event disproportionately burden any actual or potential
Licensed RNP Complex, Licensed Product or Licensed Program and (b) allow for
sublicensing to Juno in accordance with this Agreement.  Following execution of
the applicable in-license agreement, Editas shall promptly provide to Juno a
written description of any applicable Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP, which
notice will identify the applicable Licensed Program(s) to which such
Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP relates, together with a true, correct and
complete copy of any such Third Party license (provided that such copy may be
redacted as to terms not applicable to a sublicensee thereunder).  On a Licensed
Program-by-Licensed Program basis, unless and until any such Subsequently
Obtained Licensed IP is sublicensed to Juno in accordance with Section 7.17.3,
such Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP shall be deemed not to be Controlled by
Editas for purposes of the licenses granted to Juno hereunder.

7.17.3  On a Licensed Program-by-Licensed Program basis, as to any Subsequently
Obtained Licensed IP (a) for which Editas has provided notice to Juno pursuant
to Section 7.17.1 and (b) under which Editas is permitted to grant sublicense
rights to Juno, Juno shall notify Editas in writing, within [**] after the date
on which Editas delivers to Juno a copy of the applicable Third Party license
agreement pursuant to Section 7.17.1, whether Juno desires to receive a
sublicense of rights granted under such Third Party license agreement with
respect to such Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP in connection with such
Licensed Program and, following





51




Editas’ receipt of Juno’s notice pursuant to this Section 7.17.3, then the
Parties shall in good faith negotiate and mutually agree on (i) any additional
terms with respect to such Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP under the
applicable Third Party license agreement applicable to Juno as a sublicensees
thereunder (“Additional Subsequently Obtained Sublicense Terms”),  (ii) Juno’s
agreement to reimburse Editas for any royalties actually paid by Editas under
such Third Party agreement directly on account of sales of Licensed Products
hereunder by Juno, its Affiliates and other sublicensees and (iii) Juno’s
reasonable pro rata allocation of any milestone payments actually paid by Editas
under such Third Party agreement solely with respect to the sublicense of such
Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP as such milestone payments result from the
exploitation of the applicable Licensed Product hereunder, which pro rata
allocation shall be mutually agreed by the Parties based on the reasonable
expected exploitation of such Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP by Juno and its
Affiliates and other sublicensees with respect to the applicable Licensed
Product in the Licensed Field pursuant to this Agreement as compared to all
other current and reasonably anticipated potential products relevant to such
Third Party agreement (including Licensed Products and any such products that
may be researched, developed or commercialized outside the Licensed Field)
 ((ii) and (iii), collectively, the “Additional Allocable Costs”); provided
that, in all cases, the Parties in determining such Additional Allocable Costs
shall take into account all current and reasonably anticipated potential
products relevant to such Third Party agreement, including additional Licensed
Products and any such products that may be researched, developed or
commercialized outside the Licensed Field.  In the event that the Parties are
unable to agree on any such Additional Subsequently Obtained Sublicense Terms or
Additional Allocable Costs pursuant to this Section 7.17.3, the Parties shall
escalate the matter to the Executive Officers for resolution, and if the
Executive Officers are unable to resolve such issue within [**], the matter
shall be resolved by binding arbitration pursuant to Section 12.2.2 (and until
such matter is resolved, such Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP shall be deemed
not to be Controlled by Editas for purposes of the licenses granted to Juno
hereunder). Following determination of the Additional Subsequently Obtained
Sublicense Terms and Additional Allocable Costs with respect to any Subsequently
Obtained Licensed IP for a given Program in accordance with this Section 7.17.3,
Juno may elect to include such Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP for each
applicable Licensed Program by providing written notice Editas, in which case,
(A) such Third Party license agreement shall be considered an “In-License
Agreement” under this Agreement solely with respect to the applicable Licensed
Program(s) and such Subsequently Obtained Licensed IP will be deemed to be
included in the Editas Licensed Background IP; and (B) the applicable Licensed
Program Addendum for each such Licensed Program shall be deemed to be amended to
include such Additional Subsequently Obtained Sublicense Terms and Additional
Allocable Costs and (C) any Additional Allocable Costs shall be considered Juno
Third Party Payments hereunder.

7.18     Juno Continuing Rights Under In-License Agreements.  At the written
request of Juno on case-by-case basis, Editas shall (or shall cause its
Affiliates to, as applicable) execute a written agreement, in a form reasonably
acceptable to Juno, with each In-License Counterparty within [**] after the date
of such request, pursuant to which (a) in the event of an early termination of
such In-License Agreement, at the request of Juno, such In-License Counterparty
shall grant a direct license to Juno with respect to the IP licensed to Editas
under such In-License Agreement, on the same terms under which such In-License
Counterparty grants such license to Editas (or its Affiliate, as applicable)
under such In-License Agreement; (b) such In-License Counterparty agrees to and
acknowledges the rights granted to Juno hereunder with respect to any IP
licensed





52




to Editas (or its Affiliate, as applicable) under such In-License Agreement,
including the rights as set forth in this Section 7.18; and (c) Juno shall be a
party to such written agreement and have the right to enforce such agreement
directly against the counterparties thereto.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein (including Section 6.2.4), if Juno (or any of its
Affiliates) obtains a license to any Patent Rights, Know-How or other IP (that
prior to such license had been included in the Editas Licensed IP) from any
In-License Counterparty, then Juno may deduct from any amounts payable by Juno
to Editas hereunder (including royalties and milestones), any and all amounts
payable by Juno (or any of its Affiliates) to such In-License Counterparty for
such right or license (or the exercise thereof).

(or file this Agreement with) any Securities Regulators, or other Persons as may





56




be required by applicable Law, such Party agrees to consult with the other Party
with respect to the preparation and submission of a confidential treatment
request for this Agreement and to mutually agree on the redactions to this
Agreement to be submitted for confidential treatment request, such agreement not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if a Party is required by applicable Law or any Securities Regulator

any respective timing constraints; and (c) such Party has given the other Party
a reasonable time under the circumstances from the date of notice by such Party
of the required disclosure to comment upon and request confidential treatment
for such disclosure, then such Party will have the right to make such disclosure
at the time and in the manner reasonably determined by its counsel to be
required by applicable Law or Securities Regulator if the other Party has not
responded within such reasonable time period.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, it
is hereby understood and agreed that if a Party seeks to make a disclosure as
required by applicable Law or Securities Regulator as set forth in this Section
8.5, and the other Party provides comments within the respective time periods or
constraints specified herein or within the respective notice, the Party seeking
to make such disclosure or its counsel, as the case may be, will in good faith
consider incorporating such comments, and, with respect to submitting this
Agreement to (or filing this Agreement with) any Securities Regulators, or other
Persons as may be required by applicable Law, the Parties shall mutually agree
on the redactions to this Agreement to be submitted for confidential treatment
request, such agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

the activities hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby, unless such
press release or other public statement is approved by Juno in writing; provided
that Editas shall be authorized to make any disclosure, without the approval of
Juno, that is required by applicable Law (including the U.S. Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) or
the rules of any Securities Regulator, or by judicial process, subject to and in

Securities Regulators (solely and to the extent Editas’ counsel determines such
disclosure is required by applicable Law or Securities Regulators) and in
accordance with Sections 8.3 and 8.5, as applicable, and in such case Editas
shall (a) use reasonable good faith efforts to afford Juno a reasonable period
of time to review any such disclosure; (b) at Juno’s request, remove any
Confidential Information of Juno therein; and (c) incorporate any other
reasonable comments from Juno therein, including any reasonable request to limit
such press release or public statement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
information that has been previously publicly disclosed in accordance with this
Agreement may be disclosed again and as long as such disclosure does not exceed
the scope, and is presented in the same context, of such prior public
disclosure.  Subject to the foregoing, if Juno proposes that Editas use specific
wording or language with respect thereto, Editas shall in good faith consider
incorporating such wording or language.

8.6.3    Previously Issued Public Statements.  The contents of any press release

without any reference to any Licensed Product, the sequence of any Collaboration
RNP Complex (including the sequences of the gRNA or RGEN) or the sequence of any
donor template or its component parts and subject to the opportunity for prior
review and comment by Juno in accordance with this Section 8.7.  Editas agrees
to provide Juno with the opportunity to review any proposed abstract, manuscript
or scientific presentation (including any verbal presentation) that relates to
any such Licensed RNP Complex, at least [**] prior to its intended submission
for publication.  Juno shall [ex-10d21g001.jpg] respond in writing promptly and
in no event later than [**] after receipt of the proposed publication, with one
or more of the following: (a) comments [ex-10d21g001.jpg] on the proposed
publication, which Editas [ex-10d21g001.jpg] shall consider in good faith; (b) a
specific statement of





58




concern, based upon the need to seek Patent Rights protection or to block
publication or public disclosure (including publications in journals, posters,
presentations at conferences and abstracts submitted in advance of conferences)
if Juno reasonably determines that the proposed disclosure includes any IP that
should be maintained as a trade secret to protect any [ex-10d21g002.jpg]
Licensed Program Target or Licensed RNP Complex, in which event Editas agrees
not to submit such publication or make such presentation that contains such
information for a reasonable period of time, and in no event more than [**], and
the Parties agree to review and decide whether to seek patent protection for any
such IP in such publication or presentation which may be patentable or to
resolve any other issues; or (c) [ex-10d21g002.jpg] an identification of the
Juno’s Confidential Information that is contained in the publication reviewed,
which Editas shall remove, if requested by Juno.  Both Parties understand that a
reasonable commercial strategy may require delay of publication of information
or filing of patent applications first with respect to activities performed or
results obtained pursuant to this Agreement during the Term, or not to publish
at all if necessary to preserve trade secrets.  The Parties agree to review and
decide whether to delay publication of such information to permit filing of
patent applications.  For clarity, Juno (and its Affiliates and Sublicensees)
shall be free to make publications and presentations with respect to any
Licensed Program Target, Licensed RNP Complex or Licensed Product or the results
of the Research Program with respect thereto, in each case, without the prior
review or consent of Editas; provided that if such publication or presentation
is specific to a Licensed RNP Complex, then, to the extent practicable, Juno
shall notify Editas reasonably in advance of any such publication or
presentation.

8.7.2    Re-Publication; Re-Presentation.  The contents of any Editas
publication or presentation that has been reviewed and approved by Juno may be
re-released by Editas as long as such disclosure is presented in substantially
the same context and does not exceed the scope of such prior public disclosure,
without a requirement for re-approval.

8.8       Use of Names and Marks.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth
herein, no Party (or its respective Affiliates) shall use the name, trademark,
trade name or logo of the other Party or any of its Affiliates, or its or their
respective employee(s) in any publicity, promotion, news release or other public
disclosure relating to this Agreement or its subject matter, without the prior
written permission of the other Party; provided that such permission shall not
be required to the extent use thereof may be required by applicable Law or
Securities Regulators, including the rules of any securities exchange or market
on which a Party’s (or its Affiliate’s) securities are listed or traded.

8.9       Clinical Trials Registry.  For clarity, Juno (and its Affiliates and
Designees) shall have the right to publish registry information and summaries of
data and results from any Clinical Trials conducted in connection with
activities under this Agreement, on its clinical trials registry or on a
government-sponsored database such as www.clinicaltrials.gov, without requiring
the consent of Editas.  The Parties shall reasonably cooperate if required or
reasonably requested by Juno in order to facilitate any such publication by Juno
(and its Affiliates and Designees).

8.10     Relationship to Master Collaboration Agreement.  Except as otherwise
expressly stated in this ARTICLE 8, this Agreement supersedes the provisions of
Article 8 of the Master Collaboration Agreement with respect to any Confidential
Information related to any Licensed Program Target, Licensed RNP Complex or
Licensed Product or the results of the Research Program with respect thereto
(collectively, the “Licensed Program Confidential Information”);





59




provided that, except as otherwise set forth herein, all “Confidential

materially prejudices the Indemnitor’s ability to defend against the relevant
claims).  The Indemnitor shall have the right to assume the defense of any such
claim for which the Indemnitee is seeking indemnification pursuant to Section
10.1 or Section 10.2, as applicable.  The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the
Indemnitor and the Indemnitor’s insurer as the Indemnitor may reasonably
request, and at the Indemnitor’s cost and expense.  The Indemnitee shall have
the right to participate, at its own expense and with counsel of its choice, in
the defense of any claim or suit that has been assumed by the Indemnitor.  The
Indemnitor shall not settle any claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnitee, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided,
however, that the Indemnitor shall not be required to obtain such consent if the
settlement (a) involves only the payment of money and will not result in the
Indemnitee (or other Editas Indemnitees or Juno Indemnitees, as applicable)
becoming subject to injunctive or other similar type of relief;  (b) does not
require an admission by the Indemnitee (or other Editas Indemnitees or Juno
Indemnitees, as applicable); and (c) if Editas is the Indemnitor,





66




does not adversely affect the rights or licenses granted to Juno (or its
Affiliate) under this Agreement or the Master Collaboration Agreement.  The
Indemnitee shall not settle or compromise any such claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitor, which it may provide in its sole
discretion.  If the Parties cannot agree as to the application of Section 10.1
or Section 10.2, as applicable, to any claim, pending resolution of the Dispute
pursuant to Section 12.2, the Parties may conduct separate defenses of such
claims, with each Party retaining the right to claim indemnification from the
other Party in accordance with Section 10.1 or Section 10.2, as applicable, upon
resolution of the underlying claim.  In each case, the Indemnitee shall
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor, and shall make available to the
Indemnitor all pertinent information under the Control of the Indemnitee, which
information shall be subject to ARTICLE 8.

10.4     Insurance.  During the Term and for a period of [**] thereafter, each
Party shall maintain, at its cost, a program of insurance (or, with respect to
Juno, self-insurance) against liability and other risks associated with its
activities and obligations under this Agreement, and its indemnification
obligations hereunder, in such amounts, subject to such deductibles and on such
terms as are customary for such Party for the activities to be conducted by it
under this Agreement.  It is understood that such insurance shall not be
construed to create a limit on either Party’s liability with respect to its
indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE 10, or otherwise.

10.5     LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  NEITHER EDITAS NOR JUNO, NOR ANY OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, WILL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES UNDER
OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS
OR LOST REVENUES), WHETHER LIABILITY IS ASSERTED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT PRODUCT LIABILITY), INDEMNITY, CONTRIBUTION OR OTHERWISE,
AND IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THAT PARTY OR ANY REPRESENTATIVE OF THAT PARTY HAS
BEEN ADVISED OF, OR OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE ANTICIPATED THE POSSIBILITY OF, ANY
SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE.  NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS SECTION
10.5 IS INTENDED TO OR SHALL LIMIT OR RESTRICT THE INDEMNIFICATION RIGHTS OR
OBLIGATIONS OF EITHER PARTY UNDER SECTION 10.1 OR SECTION 10.2 FOR ANY THIRD
PARTY DAMAGES OR THE LIABILITY OF EITHER PARTY FOR ANY BREACHES OF ARTICLE 8 OR
EDITAS FOR BREACH OF ANY OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ARTICLE 5.

ARTICLE 11

TERM AND TERMINATION

11.1     Term; Expiration.

11.1.1  Term.  This Agreement shall become effective on the Execution Date and,
subject to Section 3.5 of the Master Collaboration Agreement as to each such
subsequent Licensed Program, on the Effective Date of the applicable Licensed
Program Addendum, and, unless earlier terminated in accordance with this ARTICLE
11, shall remain in effect until it expires as follows (the “Term”):





67




(a)        on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country
basis, this Agreement shall expire on the date of the expiration of the Royalty
Term with respect to such Licensed Product in such country; and

(b)        in its entirety upon the expiration of all applicable Royalty Terms
under this Agreement with respect to all Licensed Products in all countries in
the Territory.

11.1.2  Effect of Expiration.  After the expiration of the Term pursuant to
Section 11.1.1, the following terms shall apply:

(a)        Licenses after Licensed Product Expiration.  Except with respect to a
Licensed Product as to which this Agreement was previously terminated, on a
country-by-country basis, after expiration of the Royalty Term with respect to a
given Licensed Product in a given country pursuant to Section 11.1.1(a), the
licenses set forth in Section 7.1 with respect to such Licensed Product (and the
Licensed RNP Complex or Licensed RNP Complex Group, as applicable, used to
modify such Licensed Product) in such country will automatically become
non-exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free.

(b)        Licenses after Expiration of this Agreement.  Except with respect to
a Licensed Product as to which this Agreement was previously terminated, after
expiration of the Term with respect to this Agreement in its entirety pursuant
to Section 11.1.1(b), all licenses set forth in Section 7.1 will automatically
become non-exclusive, fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free.

11.2     Termination for Breach.

11.2.1  Material Breach.

(a)        Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product.  This Agreement may be
terminated, on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis, by a Party for the
material breach by the other Party of this Agreement with respect to such
Licensed Program; provided that the breaching Party has not cured such breach
within sixty (60) days after the date of written notice to the breaching Party
of such breach (the “Cure Period”), which notice shall describe such breach in
reasonable detail and shall state the non-breaching Party’s intention to
terminate this Agreement.  For clarity, but subject to Section 11.2.2, the Cure
Period for any allegation made as to a material breach under this Agreement will
run from the date that written notice was first provided to the breaching Party
by the non-breaching Party.  Any such termination of this Agreement under this
Section 11.2.1(a) shall become effective at the end of the Cure Period, unless
the breaching Party has cured such breach prior to the expiration of such Cure
Period, or, if such breach is not susceptible to cure within the Cure Period,
then such Cure Period shall be extended for an additional sixty (60) days so
long as such material breach is susceptible to cure within such extension period
and the breaching Party continues to use commercially reasonable efforts to cure
such material breach during such extension period.  This Agreement shall remain
in force and effect with respect to any and all other Licensed Products that
were not subject to the foregoing termination.





68




(b)        Licensed Program-by-Licensed Program.  On a Licensed
Program-by-Licensed Program basis, in the event that Juno fails to make any
undisputed payment owed to Editas hereunder with respect to a Licensed Product
from a given Licensed Program, Editas may terminate this Agreement as to such
Licensed Program, including all Licensed Products from such Licensed Program;
provided that Editas has provided Juno with a written notice of breach with
respect to such non-payment and Juno not cured such non-payment within the Cure
Period.  For clarity, but subject to Section 11.2.2, the Cure Period for any
allegation made as to such breach under this Agreement will run from the date
that written notice was first provided to Juno by Editas.  Any such termination
of this Agreement under this Section 11.2.1(b) shall result in termination of
the relevant Licensed Program Addenda and become effective at the end of the
Cure Period, unless Juno has cured such non-payment prior to the expiration of
such Cure Period.  This Agreement shall remain in force and effect with respect
to any and all other Licensed Programs that were not subject to the foregoing
termination.

11.2.2  Disagreement as to Breach.  Notwithstanding Section 11.2.1, if the
Parties in good faith disagree as to whether there has been a breach of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 11.2.1, then: (a) the Party that disputes that
there has been a breach may contest the allegation by referring such matter,
within [**] following such written notice of alleged breach, for resolution to
the Executive Officers, who shall meet promptly to discuss the matter and
determine, within [**] following referral of such matter, whether or not a
breach has occurred pursuant to Section 11.2.1; provided that if the Executive
Officers are unable to resolve such dispute within such [**] period after it is
referred to them, the matter will be resolved as provided in Section 12.2; (b)
the relevant Cure Period with respect thereto will be tolled from the date the
breaching Party notifies the non-breaching Party of such dispute and through the
resolution of such dispute in accordance with the applicable provisions of this
Agreement; (c) subject to Section 11.9, during the pendency of such dispute, all
of the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall remain in effect and the
Parties shall continue to perform all of their respective obligations hereunder;
and (d) if it is ultimately determined that the breaching Party committed such
breach, then the breaching Party shall have the right to cure such breach, after
such determination, within the Cure Period (as may be extended in accordance
with Section 11.2.1) which shall commence as of the date of such determination. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicable dispute resolution terms of
Section 7.5 shall apply with respect to termination rights solely with respect
to any IP Controlled by Editas under the Harvard-Broad Licenses.

11.3     Voluntary Termination.  Juno may terminate this Agreement at will, in
its sole discretion, on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product basis or in its
entirety upon ninety (90) days’ prior written notice to Editas at any time.

11.4     Termination for Bankruptcy.  To the extent allowed under Law, either
Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement in the event of the
commencement of any proceeding in or for bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or
winding up by or against the other Party (other than pursuant to a corporate
restructuring) that is not dismissed or otherwise disposed of within [**]
thereafter.

11.5     Termination for Patent Challenge.  In the event that Juno (or its
Affiliate or Sublicensee) brings a Patent Challenge against an Editas Licensed
Background Patent or Editas Licensed Collaboration Patent or knowingly assists
another party in a Patent Challenge against an





69




Editas Licensed Background Patent or Editas Licensed Collaboration Patent,
except as required under a court order or subpoena or where Juno (or its
Affiliate or Sublicensee) is required by legal process to be joined as a party
to the Patent Challenge proceeding, Editas shall have the option to terminate
this Agreement at its sole discretion with respect to such Editas Licensed
Background Patent(s) or Editas Licensed Collaboration Patent(s), as applicable,
that are subject of the Patent Challenge upon [**] written notice to Juno if
such Patent Challenge or assistance, as applicable, is not dropped by Juno
within such [**] period; provided that Editas shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement with respect to the applicable Editas Licensed
Background Patent(s) or Editas Licensed Collaboration Patent(s), as applicable,
under this Section 11.5, with respect to any such Patent Challenge by a
Sublicensee if Juno terminates the sublicense granted to such Sublicensee with
respect to the challenged Editas Licensed Background Patent(s) or Editas
Licensed Collaboration Patent(s), as applicable, within [**] of Editas’ notice
to Juno under this Section 11.5.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the applicable
terms of Section 7.5 shall apply with respect to any Patent Challenge brought by
Juno against Patent Rights Controlled by Editas under the Harvard-Broad
Licenses.

11.6     Effects of Termination.

11.6.1  Termination in Full.  In the event of termination of this Agreement in

twelve  (12)-month period immediately following the effective date of
termination, to (i) finish or otherwise wind-down any ongoing Clinical Trials
with respect to any Licensed Products hereunder; and (ii) finish and sell any
work-in-progress and any Licensed Products remaining in inventory;  provided
that Juno shall pay royalties on Annual Product Net Sales of such Licensed
Products sold by Juno during such period, to the extent during the applicable
Royalty Term, as and to the extent Juno would otherwise be required to pay such
royalties as set forth in Section 6.2; provided, however, that Juno shall have
no obligation to undertake such activities, in each case of (i) and (ii), as and
to the extent determined by Juno.





70




11.6.2  Termination as to a Licensed Product or Licensed Program.  In the event
of termination of this Agreement with respect to a given Licensed Product or

confidentiality and non-use provisions of ARTICLE 8); and

(d)        notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 11.6, the
licenses granted to Juno hereunder with respect to such Licensed Product or
Licensed Program shall survive for twelve (12) months following the effective
date of termination in order for Juno (and its Affiliates, Sublicensees and
Distributors), at Juno’s discretion, during the twelve (12)-month period
immediately following the effective date of termination, to (a) finish or
otherwise wind-down any ongoing Clinical Trials with respect to such Licensed
Product or any Licensed Products under such Licensed Program, as applicable; and
(b) finish and sell any work-in-progress and such Licensed Product or any
Licensed Products remaining in inventory with respect to such Licensed Program,
as applicable; provided that Juno shall pay royalties on Annual Product Net

required to pay such royalties as set forth in Section 6.2;  provided, however,
that Juno shall have no obligation to undertake such activities, in each case of
(a) and (b), as and to the extent determined by Juno.

11.7     Certain Additional Remedies of Juno in Lieu of Termination.  If Juno
has the right to terminate this Agreement (with respect to a given Licensed
Product(s)) pursuant to Section 11.2, then in lieu of Juno terminating pursuant
to Section 11.2, Juno may elect to have this Agreement continue in full force
and effect as modified by this Section 11.7 by providing written notice to
Editas prior to the date that otherwise would have been the effective date of
termination had Juno exercised its right to so terminate this Agreement (with
respect to a given Licensed Product(s)) under Section 11.2; provided that (a)
Juno has provided notice to Editas asserting the alleged breach as required by
Section 11.2, (b) Editas fails to cure such breach prior to the expiration of
the applicable Cure Period (provided that if Editas has notified Juno that it
disputes that it is in material breach in accordance with Section 11.2.2, then
the Cure Period shall be tolled during the pendency of such dispute as set forth
in Section 11.2.2).  In such an event, Juno may elect to have this Agreement
continue in full force and effect by providing written notice to Editas;
provided, however, that if Juno so elects to continue this Agreement, then from
and after such time as Juno delivers such written notice to Editas, any and all
amounts thereafter payable by Juno hereunder (including Milestone Payments and
royalties) shall be reduced by [**] percent ([**]%).





71




11.8     Surviving Provisions.

11.8.1        Accrued Rights; Remedies.  Termination or expiration of this
Agreement for any reason shall be without prejudice to any rights that shall
have accrued to the benefit of any Party prior to such termination or
expiration, and any and all damages or remedies (whether in law or in equity)
arising from any breach hereunder, each of which shall survive termination or
expiration of this Agreement.  Such termination or expiration shall not relieve
any Party from obligations, which are expressly indicated to survive termination
or expiration of this Agreement.  Any payment obligations of a Party that have
accrued as of termination or expiration of this Agreement shall survive such
termination or expiration, as applicable.  Except as otherwise expressly set
forth in this Agreement, the termination provisions of this ARTICLE 11 are in
addition to any other relief and remedies available to either Party under this
Agreement and at applicable Law.

11.8.2        Survival.  Without limiting the provisions of Section 11.8.1, the
rights and obligations of the Parties set forth in the following Sections and
Articles of this Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of this
Agreement (in its entirety or with respect to a given Licensed Product or
Licensed Program, as applicable, and, if terminated with respect to a given
Licensed Product or Licensed Program, as applicable, then the following Sections
and Articles of this Agreement shall survive solely with respect to such

ARTICLE 12

MISCELLANEOUS

12.1     Governing Laws; Venue; Jurisdiction.  This Agreement shall be governed
by, interpreted and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York, without regard to principles of conflicts or choice of laws that would
cause the application of the laws of another jurisdiction and excluding the
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sales of Goods;
provided, however, that with respect to matters involving the validity or
infringement of Patent Rights in a given country, such matter may be brought in
the applicable country and the applicable Laws of the applicable country shall
apply (subject to Section 7.8.1). Subject to Section 12.2, Disputes arising out
of this Agreement shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of
the state and federal courts located in New York, New York (and the appellate
courts thereof), and each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the personal and
exclusive jurisdiction and venue thereof.

12.2     Disputes.

12.2.1  General.  Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement, if
any dispute, claim or controversy of arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, including any action or claim based on tort, contract or statute, or
concerning the interpretation, effect, termination validity, performance or
breach of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”), arises between the Parties and the
Parties cannot resolve such dispute within [**] of a written request by either
Party to the other Party, the Parties agree to refer the Dispute to the
respective Executive Officers of each Party for resolution; provided that
decisions that are subject to the decision-making authority of a given Party, as
expressly set forth in this Agreement, will not be subject to the provisions of
Section 12.2 so long as such decisions are made in accordance with this
Agreement.

12.2.2  Arbitration.  If, after an additional [**], such representatives have
not succeeded in negotiating a resolution of the Dispute, and a Party wishes to
begin an arbitration to resolve such Dispute arising under this Agreement, such
Party shall provide written notice (the “Arbitration Request”) to the other
Party of such intention and a statement of the issues for resolution.  From the
date of the Arbitration Request and until such time as such Dispute has become
finally settled, the running of the time periods as to which Party must cure a
breach of this Agreement becomes suspended as to any breach that is the subject
matter of the Dispute.  Within [**] after the receipt of the Arbitration
Request, the other Party may, by written notice, add additional issues for
resolution in a statement of counter-issues.

12.2.3  Arbitration Procedure.  Any arbitration pursuant to this Section 12.2
will be held in New York, New York, United States unless another location is
mutually agreed by the Parties.  The arbitration will be governed by the United
States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, to the exclusion of any inconsistent
state Law.  The Parties shall mutually agree on the rules to govern discovery
and the rules of evidence for the arbitration within [**] after the Arbitration
Request.  If the Parties fail to timely agree to such rules, the United States
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure will govern discovery and the United States
Federal Rules of Evidence will govern evidence for the arbitration.  The
arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator knowledgeable in the
subject matter at issue in the dispute and acceptable to both Parties; provided
that the Parties may by mutual agreement elect to have the arbitration conducted
by a panel of three (3) arbitrators.





73




If the Parties fail to agree on a mutually acceptable arbitrator within [**]
after the Arbitration Request, then the arbitrator shall be selected by the New
York, New York office of the American Arbitration Association.  The arbitrator
may proceed to an award, notwithstanding the failure of either Party to
participate in the proceedings.  The arbitrator shall, within [**] after the
conclusion of the arbitration hearing, issue a written award and statement of
decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is
based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator shall
be limited in the scope of his or her authority to resolving only the specific
matter which the Parties have referred to arbitration for resolution and shall
not have authority to render any decision or award on any other issues.  Subject
to Section 10.5, the arbitrator shall be authorized to award compensatory
damages, but shall not be authorized to award punitive, special, consequential,
or any other similar form of damages, or to reform, modify or materially change
this Agreement.  The arbitrator also shall be authorized to grant any temporary,
preliminary or permanent equitable remedy or relief the arbitrator deems just
and equitable and within the scope of this Agreement, including an injunction or
order for specific performance.  The award of the arbitrator shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Parties, except for those remedies that are set
forth in this Agreement or which apply to a Party by operation of the applicable
provisions of this Agreement, and the Parties hereby expressly agree to waive
the right to appeal from the decisions of the arbitrator, and there shall be no
appeal to any court or other authority (government or private) from the decision
of the arbitrator.  Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be
enforced in any court having competent jurisdiction thereof.

12.2.4  Arbitration Costs.  Each Party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees,
costs, and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal
share of the fees and costs of the arbitrator; provided, however, that the
arbitrator, in his or her award, shall be authorized to determine whether a
Party is the prevailing Party, and if so, to award to that prevailing Party
reimbursement for its reasonable attorneys’ fees, costs and disbursements
(including, for example, expert witness fees and expenses, transcripts,
photocopy charges and travel expenses).

12.2.5  Confidentiality.  All proceedings and decisions of the arbitrator shall
be deemed Confidential Information of each of the Parties, and shall be subject
to ARTICLE 8.

12.2.6  Equitable Relief; Cumulative Remedies.  Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, including Section 12.2.2, either Party may, without
waiving any remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction
equitable relief, including any injunctive or provisional relief and specific
performance to protect the rights or property of that Party.  Such remedies will
not be deemed to be the exclusive remedies for a breach of this Agreement but
will be in addition to all other remedies available at law or equity.  In
addition, notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.2.2, either Party may
bring an action in any court having jurisdiction to enforce an award rendered
pursuant to Section 12.2.2.  The Parties further agree not to raise as a defense
or objection to the request or granting of such relief that any breach of this
Agreement is or would be compensable by an award of money damages.  No remedy
referred to in this Agreement is intended to be exclusive, but each shall be
cumulative and in addition to any other remedy referred to in this Agreement or
otherwise available under applicable Law.

12.2.7  Pending Final Resolution.  Until final resolution of the Dispute in
accordance with this Agreement, (a) this Agreement will remain in full force and
effect; and (b)





74




the time periods for cure as to any termination will be tolled.  The Parties
further agree that any payments made pursuant to this Agreement pending
resolution of the dispute shall be refunded if a final determination is made in
accordance with this Agreement that such payments are not due.

12.2.8  WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EXCEPT AS LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH PARTY
HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF EITHER PARTY
HERETO IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.

12.3     Independent Contractors.  The relationship of the Parties under this
Agreement is that of independent contractors. Nothing contained herein is
intended or is to be construed so as to constitute (a) Editas as a partner,
agent, or joint venturer of Juno; or (b) Juno as a partner, agent or joint
venturer of Editas.  Neither Editas nor Juno, respectively, shall have any
express or implied right or authority to assume or create any obligations on
behalf of or in the name of Juno or Editas, respectively, or to bind Juno or
Editas, respectively, to any contract, agreement, or undertaking with any Third
Party.

12.4     Assignment.

12.4.1  General.  The Parties agree that, except as expressly permitted
hereunder, neither this Agreement nor their rights and obligations under this
Agreement shall be delegated, assigned or otherwise transferred to a third
party, in whole or part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, including
by way of sale of assets, merger or consolidation, without prior written consent
of the other Party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Party may, without such
consent, assign this Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder in their
entirety (a) to an Affiliate (provided, however, that such Party will remain
fully and unconditionally liable and responsible to the other Party for the
performance and observance of all such duties and obligations by such
Affiliate),  provided that, upon written request by the other Party, such Party
will disclose to the other Party whether it has assigned this Agreement to an
Affiliate and, in such case, the identity of such Affiliate, or (b) its
successor in interest in connection with its merger, consolidation, or sale of
all or substantially all of its assets or that portion of its business
pertaining to the subject matter of this Agreement.  Subject to the foregoing,
this Agreement shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the Parties and
their permitted successors and assigns.  Any attempted delegation, assignment or
transfer in violation of this Section 12.4 shall be null and void ab initio.

12.4.2  Additional Restrictions for Institution In-Licenses.  Without limiting
the foregoing, Juno agrees that the rights granted under this Agreement pursuant
to the Harvard-Broad Licenses may not be assigned by Juno, whether by operation
of law or otherwise, without the consent of the Institutions, except that Juno
may assign or transfer this Agreement without the consent of the Institutions,
to a successor in interest of all or substantially all of Juno’s assets or
business related to the Licensed Products or this Agreement, whether by merger,
consolidation, sale of assets, or Change of Control or other transaction,
provided that (a) Juno shall provide the Institutions with a written notice of
such assignment or Change of Control including the identity of the assignee,
transferee or controlling party, and a copy of the assignment and assumption
agreement or other documentary evidence sufficient to demonstrate Juno’s
compliance with this





75




Section 12.4.2 within [**] after such assignment or Change of Control, and (b)
such assignee or transferee agrees in writing to assume the obligations to the
Institutions and HHMI that are being assigned or transferred.  Failure of an
assignee to agree to be bound by the terms hereof or failure of Juno to notify
Institutions and provide copies of assignment documentation as specified above
shall be grounds for termination of Juno’s sublicense under the applicable
Harvard-Broad License(s) with respect to Juno’s rights under the applicable
Editas Licensed Background Patent(s) that are the subject of such Harvard-Broad
License(s).

12.4.3  Additional Restrictions for MGH In-Licenses.  Juno may assign or
transfer the rights granted under this Agreement to Juno pursuant to the MGH
License: (a) without the consent of MGH, to an Affiliate of Juno or in
connection with the transfer or sale of all or substantially all of Juno’s
assets or business related to the Licensed Products and/or this Agreement,
whether by merger, consolidation, sale of assets, change in control or other
transaction, provided that Juno promptly shall provide MGH with a written notice
of such assignment including the identity of the assignee or transferee and such
assignee or transferee agrees in writing to assume the obligations to MGH that
are being assigned or transferred; and (b) in any other circumstance, only with
the prior written consent of MGH, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.  Juno shall notify MGH in writing of any such assignment
and provide a copy of the assignment and assumption agreement or other
documentary evidence sufficient to demonstrate Juno’s compliance with this
Section 12.4.3 within [**] after such assignment.  Failure of an assignee to
agree to be bound by the terms hereof or failure of Juno to notify MGH and
provide copies of assignment documentation shall be grounds for termination of
Juno’s sublicense under the MGH License with respect to Juno’s rights under the
applicable Editas Licensed Background Patent(s) that are the subject of the MGH
License.

12.4.4  Assignment to Bristol-Myers Squibb.  Editas hereby represents and
warrants that, as of the Execution Date, it has notified each of the
Institutions and MGH of the pending merger between Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
(or its affiliate) and Celgene Corporation (or its affiliate), and no further
consents on the part of the Institutions or MGH, and no further actions on the
part of Juno or its successors, are required under the Harvard-Broad Licenses or
the MGH Licenses in connection with any assignment of this Agreement as a result
thereof; provided that within [**] after the effective date of such merger,
 Juno shall provide a signed notice with respect thereto to the Institutions and
MGH.

12.5     Force Majeure.  A Party shall not be liable for delay or failure in the
performance of any of its obligations hereunder if such delay or failure is due
to a cause beyond the reasonable control of such Party, including acts of God,
fires, earthquakes, acts of war, terrorism, or civil unrest, or hurricane or
other inclement weather (“Force Majeure”); provided, however, that the affected
Party promptly notifies the other Party; provided, further, that the affected
Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to avoid or remove such
causes of non-performance and to mitigate the effect of such occurrence, and
shall continue performance in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
whenever such causes are removed.  When such circumstances arise, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith any modifications of the terms of this Agreement
that may be necessary or appropriate in order to arrive at an equitable
solution.

12.6     Right to Develop Independently.  Except as otherwise expressly set
forth in this Agreement, including ARTICLE 5, nothing in this Agreement shall
impair either Party’s right to





76




independently acquire, license, develop for itself, or have others develop for
it, IP and technology performing similar functions as the other Party’s IP or to
market and distribute products or services based on such other IP and
technology.

Agreement shall be in writing and in English and shall be (a) delivered by hand

12.8     Interpretation.

12.8.1  Generally.  This Agreement has been diligently reviewed by and
negotiated by and among the Parties, and in such negotiations each of the
Parties has been represented by competent (in house or external) counsel, and
the final agreement contained herein, including the language whereby it has been
expressed, represents the joint efforts of the Parties and their
counsel.  Accordingly, in interpreting this Agreement or any provision hereof,
no presumption shall apply against either Party as being responsible for the
wording or drafting of this Agreement or any such provision, and ambiguities, if
any, in this Agreement shall not be construed against either Party, irrespective
of which Party may be deemed to have authored the ambiguous provision.

12.8.2  Definitions; Interpretation.  The definitions of the terms herein shall
apply equally to the singular and plural forms of the terms defined and where a
word or phrase is defined herein, each of its other grammatical forms shall have
a corresponding meaning.  Whenever the context may require, any pronoun shall
include the corresponding masculine, feminine, and neuter forms.  Any
capitalized term used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning
ascribed to such term in the Master Collaboration Agreement.  The word “will”
shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word “shall”.  The
words “including”, “includes”, “include”, “for example” and “e.g.” and words of
similar import will be deemed to be followed by the words “without
limitation”.  The word “or” shall be construed as the inclusive meaning
identified with the phrase “and/or”.  The words “hereof”, “herein” and
“herewith” and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be
construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement.  Unless the context requires otherwise or as
otherwise specifically provided, (a) all references herein to Articles,
Sections, Schedules or Exhibits shall be construed to refer to Articles,
Sections, Schedules and Exhibits of this Agreement and (b) reference in any
Section to any subclauses are references to such subclauses of such Section.

12.8.3  Subsequent Events.  Unless the context requires otherwise, (a) any
definition of or reference to any agreement, instrument, or other document
herein shall be construed as referring to such agreement, instrument, or other
document as from time to time amended, supplemented, or otherwise modified
(subject to any restrictions on such amendments, supplements, or modifications
set forth herein); (b) any reference to any applicable Law herein shall be
construed as referring to such applicable Law as from time to time enacted,
repealed, or amended; and (c) any reference herein to any Person shall be
construed to include the Person’s successors and assigns (subject to Section
12.4).

12.8.4  Headings.  Headings, captions and the table of contents are for
convenience only and are not to be used in the interpretation of this Agreement.

12.8.5  Independent Significance.  Although the same or similar subject matters
may be addressed in different provisions of this Agreement, the Parties intend
that, except as reasonably apparent on the face of the Agreement or as expressly
provided in this Agreement, each such provision shall be read separately, be
given independent significance and not be construed as limiting any other
provision of this Agreement (whether or not more general or more specific in
scope, substance or content).





78




12.9     Further Assurances.  At any time or from time to time on and after the
date of this Agreement, a Party shall at the written and reasonable request of
the requesting Party: (a) deliver to the requesting Party such records, data or
other documents consistent with the provisions of this Agreement; (b) execute,
and deliver or cause to be delivered, all such consents, documents or further
instruments of transfer or license; and (c) take or cause to be taken all such
ministerial actions, as the requesting Party may reasonably deem necessary or
desirable in order for the requesting Party to obtain the full benefits of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

12.10   Severability.  If any provision, or portion thereof, in this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void, invalid or
unenforceable to any extent, such holding shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the validity or
enforceability of the invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision in any
other situation or in any other jurisdiction, and the term or provision shall be
considered severed from this Agreement solely for such situation and solely in
such jurisdiction, unless the invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision
is of such essential importance to this Agreement that it is to be reasonably
assumed that the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement without the
invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision.  If the final judgment of such
court declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid, void or
unenforceable, the Parties agree to (a) reduce the scope, duration, area or
applicability of the term or provision or to delete specific words or phrases to
the minimum extent necessary to cause such term or provision as so reduced or
amended to be enforceable; and (b) make a good faith effort to replace any
invalid, void or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable
one such that the objectives contemplated by the Parties when entering this
Agreement may be realized.

12.11   Waiver.  Any waiver, modification, release or amendment of any
obligation under or of any provision of this Agreement or of a Party’s rights or
remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure,
neglect, or delay by a Party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its
rights or remedies at any time, shall not be construed as a waiver of such
Party’s rights under this Agreement and shall not in any way affect the validity
of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such Party’s right to
take subsequent action. No exercise or enforcement by either Party of any right
or remedy under this Agreement shall preclude the enforcement by such Party of
any other right or remedy under this Agreement or that such Party is entitled by
Law to enforce.

12.12   Entire Agreement; Modification.  This Agreement, together with the
attached exhibits (including any and all Licensed Program Addendum) and
schedules, and the Master Collaboration Agreement, as well as any amendments
hereto or thereto made in accordance with the terms hereof or thereof,
constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes any and all prior and
contemporaneous negotiations, representations, agreements, and understandings,
written or oral, that the Parties may have reached with respect to the subject
matter hereof. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein this Agreement may
not be altered, amended or modified in any way except by a writing (excluding
email or similar electronic transmissions) signed by the authorized
representatives of both Parties.  In the event of a conflict between the
provisions of this Agreement, the provisions





79




of the Master Collaboration Agreement, this Agreement shall control with respect
to each Licensed Program, Licensed Program Target, Licensed RNP Complex and
Licensed Product.

12.13   No Third Party Beneficiaries.  Except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, there are no Third Party beneficiaries hereunder and the provisions
of this Agreement are for the exclusive benefit of the Parties, and no other
person or entity shall have any right or claim against either Party by reason of
these provisions or be entitled to enforce any of these provisions against
either Party.

12.14   Extension to Affiliates.  Juno shall have the right to extend the
rights, licenses, immunities and obligations granted in this Agreement to one or
more of its Affiliates.  All applicable terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall apply to any such Affiliate to which this Agreement has been extended to
the same extent as such terms and provisions apply to Juno.  Juno shall remain
fully liable for any acts or omissions of such Affiliates and for such
Affiliates’ performance and observance of all duties and obligations under this
Agreement.

12.15   Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which
together shall constitute one and the same instrument. Any such counterpart, to
the extent delivered by means of a fax machine or by .pdf, .tif, .gif, .jpeg or
similar attachment to electronic mail (any such delivery, an “Electronic
Delivery”) shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed
counterpart and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.  No Party
hereto shall raise the use of Electronic Delivery to deliver a signature or the
fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or
communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery as a defense to the
formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any such defense, except
to the extent that such defense relates to lack of authenticity.

ARTICLE 13

OTHER TERMS RELATING TO IN-LICENSE AGREEMENTS

13.1     Indemnification under the Harvard-Broad Licenses.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of ARTICLE 10 to the contrary, the provisions of this Section 13.1
shall apply to Juno’s obligation to indemnify Institution Indemnitees, MGH
Indemnitees, MIT Indemnitees and HHMI Indemnitees:

13.1.1  Juno shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and Sublicensees to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Institution Indemnitees and MIT
Indemnitees from and against any claim, suit, investigation, action, demand,
judgment, liability, cost, expense, damage, deficiency, loss or obligation of
any kind or nature (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other costs and
expenses of litigation or defense), based upon, arising out of, or otherwise
relating to Juno’s or its Affiliates’ or Designees’ activities under this
Agreement or any sublicense or subcontract by Juno hereunder, including any
cause of action relating to product liability concerning any product, process,
or service made, used, sold or performed by Juno its Affiliates or Designees
pursuant to any right or license granted under this Agreement (collectively,
“Claims”) except to the extent any such Claim results from or arises out of the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of an Institution Indemnitee or MIT
Indemnitee seeking indemnification hereunder or material breach of the





80




applicable Harvard-Broad License by an Institution.  Juno and each of its
Affiliates and Sublicensees are referred to as “Juno Indemnitor” below.

13.1.2  Notification of Editas; Editas Right to Consent.  In the event that a
Juno Indemnitor receives notice of any Claim for which indemnification may be
sought hereunder, Juno shall promptly, but no longer than [**] later, notify
Editas of such Claim and as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter provide
Editas with all documentation and information Juno Indemnitor may have in its
possession with regard thereto.  Neither Juno, nor any of its Affiliates or
Sublicensees, may settle such Claim on terms that admit any liability on the
part of Editas, impose any obligation on Editas, or diminish the rights of
Editas without Editas’ prior written consent, which may be given or withheld in
Editas’ sole discretion.

13.1.3  Procedures.  With respect to any Claim for which indemnification is
sought by an Institution Indemnitee or MIT Indemnitee pursuant to Section
13.1.1, Juno acknowledges and agrees that the provisions of such Harvard-Broad
License (as in effect as of the Execution Date) relating to the procedures for
indemnification shall apply as if such procedures were written in full herein,
with the defined terms “Company” being deemed to refer to Juno, “Indemnitor”
being deemed to refer to Juno and each of its Affiliates and Sublicensees and
“Indemnitees” being deemed to refer to Institution Indemnitees and MIT
Indemnitees.

13.1.4  HHMI Indemnity.  HHMI Indemnitees shall be indemnified, defended by
counsel acceptable to HHMI, and held harmless by Juno, from and against any
Claim.  The previous sentence shall not apply to any Claim that is determined
with finality by a court of competent jurisdiction to result solely from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of an HHMI Indemnitee.  Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, Juno’s obligation to defend, indemnify
and hold harmless the HHMI Indemnitees under this paragraph shall not be subject
to any limitation or exclusion of liability or damages or otherwise limited in
any way.

13.1.5  MGH Indemnity.  Juno shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless MGH
Indemnitees against any Claim, except to the extent any such Claim results
directly from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of an MGH
Indemnitee.  With respect to any Claim for which indemnification is sought by an
MGH Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 13.1.5, Juno acknowledges and agrees
that the provisions of such MGH License (as in effect as of the Execution Date)
relating to the procedures for indemnification shall apply as if such procedures
were written in full herein, with the defined terms “Company” being deemed to
refer to Juno, “Hospital” being deemed to refer to MGH and “Indemnitee(s)” being
deemed to refer to MGH Indemnitee(s).

13.1.6  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.1, (a) the
Juno Indemnitors shall have no obligations to defend, indemnify or hold harmless
any Institution Indemnitees, MGH Indemnitees, MIT Indemnitees and HHMI
Indemnitees, if any Juno Indemnitors would have a claim for indemnification from
Editas pursuant to Section 10.2 (in which case Editas shall be responsible for
defending, indemnifying and holding harmless any Institution Indemnitees, MGH
Indemnitees, MIT Indemnitees and HHMI Indemnitees, and the Juno Indemnitors
shall be entitled to seek indemnification in accordance with Section 10.2) and
(b) the provisions of Section 10.5 shall apply.





81




13.2     Use of Names.  Except as provided in this Section 13.2, Juno shall not,
and shall ensure that its Affiliates and Sublicensees shall not, use or register

its Affiliates and Sublicensees shall cease all use of Institution Names in
connection with this Agreement as permitted under this Agreement on the
termination or expiration of this Agreement except as required by applicable Law
or otherwise approved in writing by the applicable counterparty, as

to be disclosed to any governmental entity. In connection with this Agreement,
except as required by applicable Law, Juno shall not use or register the name
“Howard Hughes Medical Institute” or any variation, adaptation, or abbreviation
thereof (alone or as part of another name) or any logos, seals, insignia or
other words, names, symbols or devices that identify HHMI or any unit of HHMI
(“HHMI Names”) or of any HHMI employee (including [**]) in a manner that
reasonably could constitute an endorsement of a commercial product or service;
but that use for other purposes, even if commercially motivated, is permitted
provided that (1) the use is limited to accurately reporting factual events or
occurrences, and (2) any reference to an HHMI Name or any HHMI employees
(including [**]) in press releases or similar materials intended for public
release is approved by HHMI in advance.
