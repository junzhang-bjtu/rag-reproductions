Recitals
A.    Bank, Magnite, Hopper, and Bell entered into that certain Amended and
Restated Loan and Security Agreement dated as of September 26, 2018 (as amended,
the “Prior Loan Agreement”).
B.    Pursuant to a transaction permitted under the Prior Loan Agreement, CTV
became a Subsidiary of Magnite on or about December 18, 2019. Each Borrower
hereby acknowledges, confirms, and agrees that on and as of the date of this
Agreement, CTV has become a “Borrower” (as that term is defined in this
Agreement), and, along with Magnite, Hopper, and Bell, is included in the
definition of “Borrower” under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents for
all purposes thereof, and as such shall be jointly and severally liable, as
provided in the Loan Documents, for all Obligations thereunder (whether incurred
or arising prior to, on, or subsequent to the date hereof) and otherwise bound
by all of the terms, provisions and conditions thereof.
C.    Borrower has further requested, and Bank has agreed, to amend and restate
the Prior Loan Agreement in its entirety. Bank and Borrower hereby agree that
the Prior Loan Agreement is amended and restated in its entirety as follows:
•ACCOUNTING AND OTHER TERMS
Accounting terms not defined in this Agreement shall be construed following
GAAP. Calculations and determinations must be made following GAAP; provided that
if at any time any change in GAAP would affect the computation of any covenant
or requirement set forth in any Loan Document, and either Borrower or Bank shall
so request, Borrower and Bank shall negotiate in good faith to amend such
covenant or requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such
change in GAAP; provided, further, that, until so amended (a) such covenant or
requirement shall continue to be computed in accordance with GAAP prior to such
change therein and (b) Borrower shall provide Bank financial statements and
other documents required under this Agreement or as reasonably requested
hereunder setting forth a reconciliation between calculations of such ratio or
requirement made before and after giving effect to such change in GAAP.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any obligations of a Person that are or would
have been treated as operating leases for purposes of GAAP prior to the issuance
by the Financial Accounting Standards Board on February 25, 2016, of an
Accounting Standards Update (the “ASU”) shall continue to be accounted for as
operating leases for purposes of all financial definitions, calculations and
covenants for purpose of this Agreement (whether or not such operating lease
obligations were in effect on such date) notwithstanding the fact that such
obligations are required in accordance with the ASU (on a prospective or
retroactive basis or otherwise) to be treated as capitalized lease obligations
in accordance with GAAP. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined in this
Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in Section 13. All other terms
contained in this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated, shall have the meaning
provided by the Code to the extent such terms are defined therein.
•LOAN AND TERMS OF PAYMENT
#2572901v4    
233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



a.Promise to Pay. Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay Bank the
outstanding principal amount of all Credit Extensions and accrued and unpaid
interest thereon as and when due in accordance with this Agreement.
i.Revolving Line.
1.Availability. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to
deduction of Reserves, Bank shall make Advances not exceeding the Availability
Amount. Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Line may be repaid and, prior to
the Revolving Line Maturity Date, reborrowed, subject to the applicable terms
and conditions precedent herein.
2.Termination; Repayment. The Revolving Line terminates on the Revolving Line
Maturity Date, when the principal amount of all Advances, the unpaid interest
thereon, and all other Obligations relating to the Revolving Line shall be
immediately due and payable.
3.Reserves. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Bank
shall have the right (but not the obligation) to establish, increase, reduce,
eliminate, or otherwise adjust Reserves from time to time against the Borrowing
Base or the Revolving Line in such amounts, and with respect to such matters, as
Bank in its sole discretion shall deem necessary or appropriate with notice to
Borrower (provided that no notice is required if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing).
ii.Letters of Credit Sublimit.
1.As part of the Revolving Line, Bank shall issue or have issued Letters of
Credit denominated in Dollars or a Foreign Currency for Borrower’s account. The
aggregate Dollar Equivalent amount utilized for the issuance of Letters of
Credit shall at all times reduce the amount otherwise available for Advances
under the Revolving Line. The aggregate Dollar Equivalent of the face amount of
outstanding Letters of Credit (including drawn but unreimbursed Letters of
Credit and any Letter of Credit Reserve) may not exceed the lesser of (i) (x)
the Bank Services Sublimit, minus (y) the sum of all amounts used for Cash
Management Services, minus (z) the FX Reduction Amount or (ii) (A) the lesser of
the Revolving Line or the Borrowing Base, minus (B) the sum of all outstanding
principal amounts of any Advances (including any amounts used for Cash
Management Services), minus (C) the FX Reduction Amount.
2.If, on the Revolving Line Maturity Date (or the effective date of any
termination of this Agreement), there are any outstanding Letters of Credit,
then on such date Borrower shall provide to Bank cash collateral in an amount
equal to at least one hundred five percent (105.0%) for Letters of Credit
denominated in Dollars or at least one hundred ten percent (110.0%) for Letters
of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency, in each case of the aggregate
Dollar Equivalent of the face amount of all such Letters of Credit plus all
interest, fees, and costs due or estimated by Bank to become due in connection
therewith, to secure all of the Obligations relating to such Letters of Credit.
All Letters of Credit shall be in form and substance acceptable to Bank in its
sole discretion and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Bank’s
standard Application and Letter of Credit Agreement (the “Letter of Credit
Application”). Borrower agrees to execute any further documentation in
connection with the Letters of Credit as Bank may reasonably request. Borrower
further agrees to be bound by the regulations and interpretations of the issuer
of any Letters of Credit guaranteed by Bank and opened for Borrower’s account or
by Bank’s interpretations of any Letter of Credit issued by Bank for Borrower’s
account, and Borrower understands and agrees that Bank shall not be liable for
any error, negligence, or mistake, whether of omission or commission, in
following Borrower’s instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or
any modifications, amendments, or supplements thereto.
3.The obligation of Borrower to immediately reimburse Bank for drawings made
under Letters of Credit shall be absolute, unconditional, and irrevocable, and
shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such
Letters of Credit, and the Letter of Credit Application.
#2572901v4

233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



4.Borrower may request that Bank issue a Letter of Credit payable in a Foreign
Currency. If a demand for payment is made under any such Letter of Credit, Bank
shall treat such demand as an Advance to Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of
the amount thereof (plus fees and charges in connection therewith such as wire,
cable, SWIFT or similar charges).
5.To guard against fluctuations in currency exchange rates, upon the issuance of
any Letter of Credit payable in a Foreign Currency, Bank shall create a reserve
(the “Letter of Credit Reserve”) under the Revolving Line in an amount equal to
a percentage (which percentage shall be determined by Bank in its sole
discretion) of the face amount of such Letter of Credit. The amount of the
Letter of Credit Reserve may be adjusted by Bank from time to time to account
for fluctuations in the exchange rate. The availability of funds under the
Revolving Line shall be reduced by the amount of such Letter of Credit Reserve
for as long as such Letter of Credit remains outstanding.
iii.Foreign Exchange Sublimit. As part of the Revolving Line, Borrower may enter
into foreign exchange contracts with Bank under which Borrower commits to
purchase from or sell to Bank a specific amount of Foreign Currency (each, a “FX
Contract”) on a specified date (the “Settlement Date”). FX Contracts shall have
a Settlement Date of at least one (1) FX Business Day after the contract date.
The aggregate FX Reduction Amount at any one time may not exceed the lesser of
(a) (i) the Bank Services Sublimit, minus (ii) the sum of all amounts used for
Cash Management Services, minus (iii) the aggregate Dollar Equivalent of the
face amount of any outstanding Letters of Credit (including drawn but
unreimbursed Letters of Credit and any Letter of Credit Reserve) or (b) (i) the
lesser of the Revolving Line or the Borrowing Base, minus (ii) the sum of all
outstanding principal amounts of any Advances (including any amounts used for
Cash Management Services), minus (iii) the aggregate Dollar Equivalent of the
face amount of any outstanding Letters of Credit (including drawn but
unreimbursed Letters of Credit and any Letter of Credit Reserve). The amount
otherwise available for Credit Extensions under the Revolving Line shall be
reduced by the FX Reduction Amount. Any amounts needed to fully reimburse Bank
for any amounts not paid by Borrower in connection with FX Contracts will be
treated as Advances under the Revolving Line and will accrue interest at the
interest rate applicable to Advances.
iv.Cash Management Services Sublimit. Borrower may use the Revolving Line in an
aggregate amount not to exceed the lesser of (a) (i) the Bank Services Sublimit,
minus (ii) the aggregate Dollar Equivalent of the face amount of any outstanding
Letters of Credit (including drawn but unreimbursed Letters of Credit and any
Letter of Credit Reserve), minus (iii) the FX Reduction Amount, or (b) (i) the
lesser of the Revolving Line or the Borrowing Base, minus (ii) the sum of all
outstanding principal amounts of any Advances, minus (iii) the aggregate Dollar
Equivalent of the face amount of any outstanding Letters of Credit (including
drawn but unreimbursed Letters of Credit and any Letter of Credit Reserve),
minus (iv) the FX Reduction Amount, for Bank’s cash management services, which
may include merchant services, direct deposit of payroll, business credit card,
and check cashing services identified in Bank’s various cash management services
agreements (collectively, the “Cash Management Services”). Any amounts Bank pays
on behalf of Borrower for any Cash Management Services will be treated as
Advances under the Revolving Line and will accrue interest at the interest rate
applicable to Advances.
b.Overadvances. If, at any time, the sum of (a) the outstanding principal amount
of any Advances (including any amounts used for Cash Management Services), plus
(b) the face amount of any outstanding Letters of Credit (including drawn but
unreimbursed Letters of Credit and any Letter of Credit Reserve), plus (c) the
FX Reduction Amount exceeds the lesser of the Revolving Line or the Borrowing
Base, Borrower shall immediately pay to Bank in cash the amount of such excess
(such excess, the “Overadvance”). Without limiting Borrower’s obligation to
repay Bank any Overadvance, Borrower agrees to pay Bank interest on the
outstanding amount of any Overadvance, on demand, at a per annum rate equal to
the rate that is otherwise applicable to Advances plus five percent (5.00%).
c.Payment of Interest on the Credit Extensions.
1.Interest; Payment. Each Advance shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof from the date when made, continued or converted until
paid in full at a rate per annum equal to (i) for Prime Rate Advances, the
greater of (A) the Prime Rate plus the applicable Prime Rate Margin, or (B)
three and one-half
#2572901v4    
3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



percent (3.50%), and (ii) for LIBOR Advances, the greater of (A) the LIBOR Rate
plus the applicable LIBOR Rate Margin, or (B) three and one-half percent
(3.50%). On and after the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to any
LIBOR Advance outstanding on the date of occurrence of an Event of Default or
acceleration of the Obligations, the amount of such LIBOR Advance shall, during
the continuance of such Event of Default or after acceleration, bear interest at
a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate plus five percent (5.00%). Pursuant to
the terms hereof, interest on each Advance shall be paid in arrears on each
Interest Payment Date. Interest shall also be paid on the date of any prepayment
of any Advance pursuant to this Agreement for the portion of any Advance so
prepaid and upon payment (including prepayment) in full thereof. All accrued but
unpaid interest on the Advances shall be due and payable on the Revolving Line
Maturity Date.
2.Prime Rate Advances. Each change in the interest rate of the Prime Rate
Advances based on changes in the Prime Rate shall be effective on the effective
date of such change and to the extent of such change.
3.LIBOR Advances. The interest rate applicable to each LIBOR Advance shall be
determined in accordance with Section 3.6(a) hereunder. Subject to Sections 3.5
and 3.6, such rate shall apply during the entire Interest Period applicable to
such LIBOR Advance, and interest calculated thereon shall be payable on the
Interest Payment Date applicable to such LIBOR Advance.
a.Computation of Interest. Any interest hereunder will accrue from day to day
and is calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year
of 360 days. In computing interest on any Credit Extension, the date of the
making of such Credit Extension shall be included and the date of payment shall
be excluded.
b.Default Rate. Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.3(a), upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, Obligations shall
bear interest at a rate per annum which is five percent (5.00%) above the rate
that would otherwise be applicable thereto (the “Default Rate”). Payment or
acceptance of the increased interest provided in this Section 2.3(e) is not a
permitted alternative to timely payment and shall not constitute a waiver of any
Event of Default or otherwise prejudice or limit any rights or remedies of Bank.
d.Fees. Borrower shall pay to Bank:
c.Revolving Line Commitment Fee. A fully earned, non-refundable commitment fee
of Ninety Thousand Dollars ($90,000), on the Effective Date;
d.Unused Revolving Line Facility Fee. Payable monthly in arrears on the last day
of each calendar month occurring prior to the Revolving Line Maturity Date, and
on the Revolving Line Maturity Date, a fee (the “Unused Revolving Line Facility
Fee”) in an amount equal to fifteen-hundredths of one percent (0.15%) per annum
of the average unused portion of the Revolving Line, as determined by Bank,
computed on the basis of a year with the applicable number of days as set forth
in Section 2.3(d). The unused portion of the Revolving Line, for purposes of
this calculation, shall be calculated on a calendar year basis and shall equal
the difference between (i) the Revolving Line, and (ii) (A) the average for the
period of the daily closing balance of the Revolving Line outstanding (including
any amounts used for Cash Management Services), plus (B) the aggregate amount of
outstanding Letters of Credit (including drawn but unreimbursed Letters of
Credit and any Letter of Credit Reserve);
e.Letter of Credit Fee. Bank’s customary fees and expenses for the issuance or
renewal of Letters of Credit upon the issuance of such Letter of Credit, each
anniversary of the issuance during the term of such Letter of Credit, and upon
the renewal of such Letter of Credit by Bank; and
f.Bank Expenses. All Bank Expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
expenses for documentation and negotiation of this Agreement) incurred through
and after the Effective Date, when due (or, if no stated due date, upon demand
by Bank).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



g.Fees Fully Earned. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or in a
separate writing by Bank, Borrower shall not be entitled to any credit, rebate,
or repayment of any fees earned by Bank pursuant to this Agreement
notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement or the suspension or
termination of Bank’s obligation to make loans and advances hereunder. Bank may
deduct amounts owing by Borrower under the clauses of this Section 2.4 pursuant
to the terms of Section 2.5(c). Bank shall provide Borrower written notice of
deductions made from the Designated Deposit Account pursuant to the terms of the
clauses of this Section 2.4.
e.Payments; Application of Payments; Debit of Accounts.
h.All payments to be made by Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made in
immediately available funds in Dollars, without setoff or counterclaim, before
12:00 p.m. Pacific time on the date when due. Payments of principal and/or
interest received after 12:00 p.m. Pacific time are considered received at the
opening of business on the next Business Day. When a payment is due on a day
that is not a Business Day, the payment shall be due the next Business Day, and
additional fees or interest, as applicable, shall continue to accrue until paid.
i.Bank has the exclusive right to determine the order and manner in which all
payments with respect to the Obligations may be applied. Borrower shall have no
right to specify the order or the accounts to which Bank shall allocate or apply
any payments required to be made by Borrower to Bank or otherwise received by
Bank under this Agreement when any such allocation or application is not
specified elsewhere in this Agreement.
j.Bank may debit any of Borrower’s deposit accounts, including the Designated
Deposit Account, for principal and interest payments or any other amounts
Borrower owes Bank when due. These debits shall not constitute a set-off.
f.Withholding. Payments received by Bank from Borrower under this Agreement will
be made free and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or
future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, deductions, withholdings, assessments,
fees or other charges imposed by any Governmental Authority (including any
interest, additions to tax or penalties applicable thereto). Specifically,
however, if at any time any Governmental Authority, applicable law, regulation
or international agreement requires Borrower to make any withholding or
deduction from any such payment or other sum payable hereunder to Bank, Borrower
hereby covenants and agrees that the amount due from Borrower with respect to
such payment or other sum payable hereunder will be increased to the extent
necessary to ensure that, after the making of such required withholding or
deduction, Bank receives a net sum equal to the sum which it would have received
had no withholding or deduction been required, and Borrower shall pay the full
amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority. Borrower
will, upon request, furnish Bank with proof reasonably satisfactory to Bank
indicating that Borrower has made such withholding payment; provided, however,
that Borrower need not make any withholding payment if the amount or validity of
such withholding payment is contested in good faith by appropriate and timely
proceedings and as to which payment in full is bonded or reserved against by
Borrower. The agreements and obligations of Borrower contained in this Section
2.6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
•CONDITIONS OF LOANS

thereof; and provided, further that those representations and warranties

i.Covenant to Deliver. Borrower agrees to deliver to Bank each item required to

receipt by Bank of any such item shall not constitute a waiver by Bank of
#2572901v4    
6
233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Borrower’s obligation to deliver such item, and the making of any Credit
Extension in the absence of a required item shall be in Bank’s sole discretion.
j.Procedures for Borrowing.
z.Subject to the prior satisfaction of all other applicable conditions to the
making of an Advance set forth in this Agreement, an Advance shall be made upon
Borrower’s (via an individual duly authorized by an Administrator) irrevocable
written notice delivered to Bank in the form of a Notice of Borrowing or without
instructions if any Advances is necessary to meet Obligations which have become
due. The Notice of Borrowing shall be made by Borrower through Bank’s online
banking program, provided, however, if Borrower is not utilizing Bank’s online
banking program, then such Notice of Borrowing shall be in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit C and shall be executed by an Authorized Signer. For purposes
of clarification, to the extent that Bank’s online banking program does not
allow an electronic submission of a Notice of Borrowing for a LIBOR Advance then
Borrower shall be permitted to submit a Notice of Borrowing for a LIBOR Advance
by email or other means described in Section 10, using a Notice of Borrowing in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit C and executed by an Authorized Signer. Bank
shall have received satisfactory evidence that the Board has approved that such
Authorized Signer may provide such notices and request Advances. The Notice of
Borrowing must be received by Bank prior to 12:00 p.m. Pacific time, (i) at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the requested Funding Date, in the case
of any LIBOR Advance, and (ii) on the requested Funding Date, in the case of a
Prime Rate Advance, specifying: (1) the amount of the Advance; (2) the requested
Funding Date; (3) whether the Advance is to be comprised of LIBOR Advances or
Prime Rate Advances; and (4) the duration of the Interest Period applicable to
any such LIBOR Advances included in such notice; provided that if the Notice of
Borrowing shall fail to specify the duration of the Interest Period for any
Advance comprised of LIBOR Advances, such Interest Period shall be one (1)
month. Notwithstanding any terms in this Agreement to the contrary, each LIBOR
Advance shall not be less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) and shall be in
a multiple of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). In addition to such
Notice of Borrowing, Borrower must promptly deliver to Bank by electronic mail
or through Bank’s online banking program such reports and information, including
without limitation, sales journals, cash receipts journals, accounts receivable
aging reports, as Bank may request in its sole discretion.
aa.On the Funding Date, Bank shall credit proceeds of an Advance to the
Designated Deposit Account and, subsequently, shall transfer such proceeds by
wire transfer to such other account as Borrower may instruct in the Notice of
Borrowing. No Advances shall be deemed made to Borrower, and no interest shall
accrue on any such Advance, until the related funds have been deposited in the
applicable Designated Deposit Account.
k.Conversion and Continuation Elections.
ab.So long as (i) no Event of Default exists; (ii) Borrower shall not have sent
any notice of termination of this Agreement; and (iii) Borrower shall have
complied with such customary procedures as Bank has established from time to
time for Borrower’s requests for LIBOR Advances, Borrower may, upon irrevocable
written notice to Bank:
1.elect to convert on any Business Day, Prime Rate Advances into LIBOR Advances;
2.elect to continue on any Interest Payment Date any LIBOR Advances maturing on
such Interest Payment Date; or
3.elect to convert on any Interest Payment Date any LIBOR Advances maturing on
such Interest Payment Date into Prime Rate Advances.
ac.Borrower shall deliver a Notice of Conversion/Continuation by electronic mail
via Bank’s online banking program to be received by Bank prior to 12:00 p.m.
Pacific time (i) at least three (3) Business Days in advance of the Conversion
Date or Continuation Date, if any Advances are to be converted into or continued
#2572901v4    
7
233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



as LIBOR Advances; and (ii) on the Conversion Date, if any Advances are to be
converted into Prime Rate Advances, in each case specifying the:
4.proposed Conversion Date or Continuation Date;
5.aggregate amount of the Advances to be converted or continued;
6.nature of the proposed conversion or continuation; and
7.if the resulting Advance is to be a LIBOR Advance, the duration of the
requested Interest Period.
ad.If upon the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to any LIBOR
Advances, Borrower shall have timely failed to select a new Interest Period to
be applicable to such LIBOR Advances or request to convert a LIBOR Advance into
a Prime Rate Advance, Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such
LIBOR Advances into Prime Rate Advances.
ae.Any LIBOR Advances shall, at Bank’s option, convert into Prime Rate Advances
in the event that (i) an Event of Default exists and has not been cured, or (ii)
the aggregate principal amount of the Prime Rate Advances which have been
previously converted to LIBOR Advances, or the aggregate principal amount of
existing LIBOR Advances continued, as the case may be, at the beginning of an
Interest Period shall at any time during such Interest Period exceed the lesser
of the Revolving Line or the Borrowing Base, in each case, less any applicable
Reserves. Borrower agrees to pay Bank, upon demand by Bank (or Bank may, at its
option, debit the Designated Deposit Account or any other account Borrower
maintains with Bank) any amounts required to compensate Bank for any loss
(excluding loss of anticipated profits), cost, or expense incurred by Bank, as a
result of the conversion of LIBOR Advances to Prime Rate Advances pursuant to
this Section 3.5(d).
af.Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Bank shall not be
required to purchase Dollar deposits in the London interbank market or other
applicable LIBOR market to fund any LIBOR Advances, but the provisions hereof
shall be deemed to apply as if Bank had purchased such deposits to fund the
LIBOR Advances.
l.Special Provisions Governing LIBOR Advances. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the following provisions shall
govern with respect to LIBOR Advances as to the matters covered:
ag.Determination of Applicable Interest Rate. As soon as practicable on each
Interest Rate Determination Date, Bank shall determine (which determination
shall, absent manifest error in calculation, be final, conclusive and binding
upon all parties) the interest rate that shall apply to the LIBOR Advances for
which an interest rate is then being determined for the applicable Interest
Period and shall promptly give notice thereof (in writing or by telephone
confirmed in writing) to Borrower.
ah.Inability to Determine Applicable Interest Rate. In the event that Bank shall
have determined (which determination shall be final and conclusive and binding
upon all parties hereto), on any Interest Rate Determination Date with respect
to any LIBOR Advance, that by reason of circumstances affecting the London
interbank market adequate and fair means do not exist for ascertaining the
interest rate applicable to such LIBOR Advance on the basis provided for in the
definition of LIBOR, Bank shall on such date give notice (by facsimile or by
telephone confirmed in writing) to Borrower of such determination, whereupon (i)
no Advances may be made as, or converted to, LIBOR Advances until such time as
Bank notifies Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no
longer exist, and (ii) any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion/Continuation given by Borrower with respect to LIBOR Advances in
respect of which such determination was made shall be deemed to be rescinded by
Borrower.

233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



ai.Compensation for Breakage or Non-Commencement of Interest Periods. If (i) for
any reason, other than a default by Bank or any failure of Bank to fund LIBOR
Advances due to impracticability or illegality under Sections 3.7(c) and 3.7(d)
of this Agreement, a borrowing or a conversion to or continuation of any LIBOR
Advance does not occur on a date specified in a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice
of Conversion/Continuation, as the case may be, or (ii) any complete or partial
principal payment or reduction of a LIBOR Advance, or any conversion of any
LIBOR Advance, occurs on a date prior to the last day of an Interest Period
applicable to that LIBOR Advance, including due to voluntary or mandatory
prepayment or acceleration, then, in each case, Borrower shall compensate Bank,
upon written request by Bank, for all losses and expenses incurred by Bank in an
amount equal to the excess, if any, of:
i.the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount (1) not borrowed,
converted or continued as provided in clause (i) above, or (2) paid, reduced or
converted as provided in clause (ii) above, for the period from (y) the date of
such failure to borrow, convert or continue as provided in clause (i) above, or
the date of such payment, reduction or conversion as provided in clause (ii)
above, as the case may be, to (z) in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or
continue as provided in clause (i) above, the last day of the Interest Period
that would have commenced on the date of such borrowing, conversion or
continuing but for such failure, and in the case of a payment, reduction or
conversion prior to the last day of an Interest Period applicable to a LIBOR
Advance as provided in clause (ii) above, the last day of such Interest Period,
in each case at the applicable rate of interest or other return for such LIBOR
Advance(s) provided for herein (excluding, however, in each case, the LIBOR Rate
Margin included therein, if any, and any incremental interest payable as a
result of the existence of an Event of Default), over
ii.the interest which would have accrued to Bank on the applicable amount
provided in clause (A) above through the purchase of a Eurodollar deposit
bearing interest at the rate obtained pursuant to the definition of LIBOR Rate
on the date of such failure to borrow, convert or continue as provided in clause
(i) above, or the date of such payment, reduction or conversion as provided in
clause (ii) above, as the case may be, for a period equal to the remaining
period of such applicable Interest Period provided in clause (A) above.
Bank’s request shall set forth the manner and method of computing such
compensation and such determination as to such compensation shall be conclusive
absent manifest error.


aj.Assumptions Concerning Funding of LIBOR Advances. Calculation of all amounts
payable to Bank under this Section 3.6 and under Section 3.7 shall be made as
though Bank had actually funded each relevant LIBOR Advance through the purchase
of a Eurodollar deposit bearing interest at the rate obtained pursuant to the
definition of LIBOR Rate in an amount equal to the amount of such LIBOR Advance
and having a maturity comparable to the relevant Interest Period; provided,
however, that Bank may fund each of its LIBOR Advances in any manner it sees fit
and the foregoing assumptions shall be utilized only for the purposes of
calculating amounts payable under this Section 3.6 and under Section 3.7.
ak.LIBOR Advances After an Event of Default. After the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, (i) Borrower may not elect to have an
Advance be made or continued as, or converted to, a LIBOR Advance after the
expiration of any Interest Period then in effect for such Advance and (ii)
subject to the provisions of Section 3.6(c), any Notice of
Conversion/Continuation given by Borrower with respect to a requested
conversion/continuation that has not yet occurred shall, at Bank’s option, be
deemed to be rescinded by Borrower and be deemed a request to convert or
continue Advances referred to therein as Prime Rate Advances.

m.Additional Requirements/Provisions Regarding LIBOR Advances.
al.Borrower shall pay Bank, upon demand by Bank, from time to time such amounts
as Bank may determine to be necessary to compensate it for any costs incurred by
Bank that Bank determines are attributable to its making or maintaining of any
amount receivable by Bank hereunder in respect of any LIBOR Advances relating
thereto (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts receivable being
herein called “Additional Costs”), in each case resulting from any Regulatory
Change (exclusive of Regulatory Changes that are already accounted for in the
determination of LIBOR Rate) which:
1.changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to Bank under this
Agreement in respect of any LIBOR Advances (other than changes which affect
taxes measured by or imposed on the overall net income of Bank by the
jurisdiction in which Bank has its principal office);
2.imposes or modifies any reserve, special deposit or similar requirements
relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with,
or other liabilities of Bank (including any LIBOR Advances or any deposits
referred to in the definition of LIBOR); or
3.imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement (or any of such
extensions of credit or liabilities).
Bank will notify Borrower of any event occurring after the Effective Date which
will entitle Bank to compensation pursuant to this Section 3.7(a) as promptly as
practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such
compensation. Bank will furnish Borrower with a statement setting forth the
basis (including reasonable supporting detail) and amount of each request by
Bank for compensation under this Section 3.7(a). Determinations and allocations
by Bank for purposes of this Section 3.7(a) of the effect of any Regulatory
Change on its costs of maintaining its obligations to make LIBOR Advances, of
making or maintaining LIBOR Advances, or on amounts receivable by it in respect
of LIBOR Advances, and of the additional amounts required to compensate Bank in
respect of any Additional Costs, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
am.If Bank shall determine that the adoption or implementation of any applicable
law, rule, regulation, or treaty regarding capital adequacy, or any change
therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority, central bank, or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Bank (or its
applicable lending office) with any request or directive regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority, central
bank, or comparable agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of
return on capital of Bank or any person or entity controlling Bank (a “Parent”)
as a consequence of its obligations hereunder to a level below that which Bank
(or its Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption, change, or compliance
(taking into consideration policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an
amount deemed by Bank to be material, then from time to time, within five (5)
days after demand by Bank, Borrower shall pay (without duplication of amounts
contemplated by Section 3.7(a)) to Bank such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate Bank for such reduction. A statement of Bank claiming
compensation under this Section 3.7(b) and setting forth the additional amount
or amounts to be paid to it hereunder (including reasonable supporting detail in
respect thereof) shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.7, Borrower shall not
be required to compensate Bank pursuant to this Section 3.7(b) for any amounts
incurred more than nine (9) months prior to the date that Bank notifies Borrower
of Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided that if the
circumstances giving rise to such claim have a retroactive effect, then such
nine-month period shall be extended to include the period of such retroactive
effect. The obligations of Borrower arising pursuant to this Section 3.7(b)
shall survive the Revolving Line Maturity Date, the termination of this
Agreement and the repayment of all Obligations.
an.If, at any time, Bank, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that
(i) the amount of LIBOR Advances for periods equal to the corresponding Interest
Periods are not available to Bank in the offshore currency interbank markets, or
(ii) LIBOR does not accurately reflect the cost to Bank of lending the LIBOR
Advances, then Bank shall promptly give notice thereof to Borrower. Upon the
giving of such notice, Bank’s
#2572901v4    
10
233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



obligation to make the LIBOR Advances shall terminate; provided, however, LIBOR
Advances shall not terminate if Bank and Borrower agree in writing to a
different interest rate applicable to LIBOR Advances.
ao.If it shall become unlawful for Bank to continue to fund or maintain any
LIBOR Advances, or to perform its obligations hereunder, upon demand by Bank,
Borrower shall convert to Prime Rate Advances all LIBOR Advances, and in
connection therewith pay all amounts payable hereunder in connection with such
conversion pursuant to Section 3.6(c)(ii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the
extent a determination by Bank as described above relates to a LIBOR Advance
then being requested by Borrower pursuant to a Notice of Borrowing or a Notice
of Conversion/Continuation, Borrower shall have the option, subject to the
provisions of Section 3.6(c)(ii), to (i) rescind such Notice of Borrowing or
Notice of Conversion/Continuation by giving notice (by facsimile, email, or by
telephone confirmed in writing) to Bank of such rescission on the date on which
Bank gives notice of its determination as described above, or (ii) modify such
Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation to obtain a Prime Rate
Advance or to have outstanding Advances converted into or continued as Prime
Rate Advances by giving notice (by facsimile, email, or by telephone confirmed
in writing) to Bank of such modification on the date on which Bank gives notice
of its determination as described above.
•CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST
n.Grant of Security Interest. Borrower hereby grants Bank, to secure the payment
and performance in full of all of the Obligations, a continuing security
interest in, and pledges to Bank, the Collateral, wherever located, whether now
owned or hereafter acquired or arising, and all proceeds and products thereof.
Borrower acknowledges that it previously has entered, and/or may in the future
enter, into Bank Services Agreements with Bank. Regardless of the terms of any
Bank Services Agreement, Borrower agrees that any amounts Borrower owes Bank
thereunder shall be deemed to be Obligations hereunder and that it is the intent
of Borrower and Bank to have all such Obligations secured by the first priority
perfected security interest in the Collateral granted herein (subject only to
Permitted Liens that are permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to
have superior priority to Bank’s Lien in this Agreement).
If this Agreement is terminated, Bank’s Lien in the Collateral shall continue
until the Obligations (other than inchoate indemnity obligations) are repaid in
full in cash. Upon payment in full in cash of the Obligations (other than
inchoate indemnity obligations) and at such time as Bank’s obligation to make
Credit Extensions has terminated, Bank shall, at the sole cost and expense of
Borrower, release its Liens in the Collateral and all rights therein shall
revert to Borrower. In the event (a) all Obligations (other than inchoate
indemnity obligations), except for Bank Services, are satisfied in full, and (b)
this Agreement is terminated, Bank shall terminate the security interest granted
herein upon Borrower providing cash collateral acceptable to Bank in its good
faith business judgment for Bank Services, if any. In the event such Bank
Services consist of outstanding Letters of Credit, Borrower shall cash
collateralize all such Letters of Credit in accordance with Section 2.1.2(b).
o.Priority of Security Interest. Borrower represents, warrants, and covenants
that the security interest granted herein is and shall at all times continue to
be a first priority perfected security interest in the Collateral (subject only
to Permitted Liens that are permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement to
have superior priority to Bank’s Lien under this Agreement). If Borrower shall
acquire a commercial tort claim, Borrower shall promptly notify Bank in a
writing signed by Borrower of the general details thereof and grant to Bank in
such writing a security interest therein and in the proceeds thereof, all upon
the terms of this Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Bank.
p.Authorization to File Financing Statements. Borrower hereby authorizes Bank to
file financing statements, without notice to Borrower, with all appropriate
jurisdictions to perfect or protect Bank’s interest or rights hereunder,
including a notice that any disposition of the Collateral, by either Borrower or
any other Person, shall be deemed to violate the rights of Bank under the Code.
Such financing statements may indicate the Collateral as “all assets of the
Debtor” or words of similar effect, or as being of an equal or lesser scope, or
with greater detail, all in Bank’s discretion.

•REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
Borrower represents and warrants as follows:
q.Due Organization, Authorization; Power and Authority. Borrower is duly
existing and in good standing as a Registered Organization in its jurisdiction
of formation and is qualified and licensed to do business and is in good
standing in any jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or its
ownership of property requires that it be qualified except where the failure to
do so could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
Borrower’s business. In connection with this Agreement, Borrower has delivered
to Bank completed certificates signed by Borrower, entitled “Perfection
Certificate” (collectively, the “Perfection Certificate”). Borrower represents
and warrants to Bank that (a) Borrower’s exact legal name is that indicated on
the Perfection Certificate and on the signature page hereof; (b) Borrower is an
organization of the type and is organized in the jurisdiction set forth in the
Perfection Certificate; (c) the Perfection Certificate accurately sets forth
Borrower’s organizational identification number or accurately states that
Borrower has none; (d) the Perfection Certificate accurately sets forth
Borrower’s place of business, or, if more than one, its chief executive office
as well as Borrower’s mailing address (if different than its chief executive
office); (e) Borrower (and each of its predecessors) has not, in the past five
(5) years, changed its jurisdiction of formation, organizational structure or
type, or any organizational number assigned by its jurisdiction; and (f) all
other information set forth on the Perfection Certificate pertaining to Borrower
and each of its Subsidiaries is accurate and complete in all material respects
(it being understood and agreed that Borrower may from time to time update
certain information in the Perfection Certificate after the Effective Date to
the extent permitted by one or more specific provisions in this Agreement). If
Borrower is not now a Registered Organization but later becomes one, Borrower
shall promptly notify Bank of such occurrence and provide Bank with Borrower’s
organizational identification number.
The execution, delivery and performance by Borrower of the Loan Documents to
which it is a party have been duly authorized, and do not (i) conflict with any
of Borrower’s organizational documents, (ii) contravene, conflict with,
constitute a default under or violate any material Requirement of Law, (iii)
contravene, conflict or violate any applicable order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award of any Governmental Authority by
which Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their property or assets may
be bound or affected, (iv) require any action by, filing, registration, or
qualification with, or Governmental Approval from, any Governmental Authority
(except (i) such Governmental Approvals which have already been obtained and are
in full force and effect or are being obtained pursuant to Section 6.1(b), and
(ii) any filings required by the Code in connection with perfecting the security
interests granted herein), or (v) conflict with, contravene, constitute a
default or breach under, or result in or permit the termination or acceleration
of, any material agreement by which Borrower is bound. Borrower is not in
default under any agreement to which it is a party or by which it is bound in
which the default could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect
on Borrower’s business.
r.Collateral. Borrower has good title to, rights in, and the power to transfer
each item of the Collateral upon which it purports to grant a Lien hereunder,
free and clear of any and all Liens except Permitted Liens. Borrower has no
Collateral Accounts at or with any bank or financial institution other than Bank
or Bank’s Affiliates except for the Collateral Accounts described in the
Perfection Certificate delivered to Bank in connection herewith and which
Borrower has taken such actions as are necessary to give Bank a perfected
security interest therein, pursuant to the terms of Section 6.8(b). The Accounts
are bona fide, existing obligations of the Account Debtors.
The Collateral is not in the possession of any third party bailee (such as a
warehouse) except as otherwise provided in the Perfection Certificate or as
permitted pursuant to Section 7.2. None of the components of the Collateral
shall be maintained at locations other than as provided in the Perfection
Certificate or as permitted pursuant to Section 7.2.
Borrower is the sole owner of the Intellectual Property which it owns or
purports to own except for (a) non-exclusive licenses granted to its customers
in the ordinary course of business, (b) licenses permitted under clause (g) of
the definition of Permitted Liens, (c) over-the-counter software that is
commercially available to the public, and (d) material Intellectual Property
licensed to Borrower and noted on the Perfection Certificate or in written
notice to
#2572901v4    
12
233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Bank. To the best of Borrower’s knowledge, each Patent which it owns or purports
to own and which is material to Borrower’s business is valid and enforceable,
and no part of the Intellectual Property which Borrower owns or purports to own
and which is material to Borrower’s business has been judged invalid or
unenforceable, in whole or in part. To the best of Borrower’s knowledge, no
claim has been made that any part of the Intellectual Property violates the
rights of any third party except to the extent such claim would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Borrower’s business.
Except as noted on the Perfection Certificate or in written notice to Bank,
Borrower is not a party to, nor is it bound by, any Restricted License.
s.Accounts Receivable.
ap.For each Account with respect to which Advances are requested, on the date
each Advance is requested and made, such Account shall be an Eligible Account.
aq.All statements made and all unpaid balances appearing in all invoices,
instruments and other documents evidencing the Eligible Accounts are and shall
be true and correct and all such invoices, instruments and other documents, and
all of Borrower’s Books are genuine and in all respects what they purport to be.
All sales and other transactions underlying or giving rise to each Eligible
Account shall comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and
governmental rules and regulations. Borrower has no knowledge of any actual or
imminent Insolvency Proceeding of any Account Debtor whose accounts are Eligible
Accounts in any Borrowing Base Statement. To the best of Borrower’s knowledge,
all signatures and endorsements on all documents, instruments, and agreements
relating to all Eligible Accounts are genuine, and all such documents,
instruments and agreements are legally enforceable in accordance with their
terms.
t.Litigation. Except as set forth in the Perfection Certificate or in written
notice to Bank, there are no actions or proceedings pending or, to the knowledge
of any Responsible Officer, threatened in writing by or against Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries involving more than, individually or in the aggregate, Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000).
u.Financial Statements; Financial Condition. All consolidated financial
statements for Borrower and any of its Subsidiaries delivered to Bank by
submission to the Financial Statement Repository or otherwise submitted to Bank
fairly present in all material respects Borrower’s consolidated financial
condition and Borrower’s consolidated results of operations (except with respect
to unaudited financial statements, subject to normal year-end adjustments and
the absence of footnotes). There has not been any material deterioration in
Borrower’s consolidated financial condition since the date of the most recent
financial statements submitted to the Financial Statement Repository, posted on
Borrower’s website on the internet at Borrower’s website address or otherwise
submitted to Bank.
v.Solvency. The fair salable value of Borrower’s consolidated assets (including
goodwill minus disposition costs) exceeds the fair value of Borrower’s
liabilities; Borrower is not left with unreasonably small capital after the
transactions in this Agreement; and Borrower is able to pay its debts (including
trade debts) as they mature.
w.Regulatory Compliance. Borrower is not an “investment company” or a company
“controlled” by an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. Borrower is not engaged as one of its important activities in
extending credit for margin stock (under Regulations X, T and U of the Federal
Reserve Board of Governors). Borrower (a) has complied in all material respects
with all Requirements of Law, and (b) has not violated any Requirements of Law
the violation of which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on its business. None of Borrower’s or any of its Subsidiaries’
properties or assets has been used by Borrower or any Subsidiary or, to the best
of Borrower’s knowledge, by previous Persons, in disposing, producing, storing,
treating, or transporting any hazardous substance other than legally. Borrower
and each of its Subsidiaries have obtained all consents, approvals and
authorizations of, made all declarations or filings with, and given all notices
to, all Governmental Authorities that are necessary to continue their respective
businesses as
#2572901v4    
13
233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



currently conducted except where the failure to do so could not reasonably be
expected to cause a material adverse effect on Borrower’s business.
x.Subsidiaries; Investments. Borrower does not own any stock, partnership, or
other ownership interest or other equity securities except for Permitted
Investments.
y.Tax Returns and Payments; Pension Contributions. Borrower has timely filed all
required tax returns and reports, and Borrower has timely paid all foreign,
federal, state and local taxes, assessments, deposits and contributions owed by
Borrower except (a) to the extent such taxes are being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted, so long
as such reserve or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall be required in
conformity with GAAP shall have been made therefor, or (b) if such taxes,
assessments, deposits and contributions do not, individually or in the
aggregate, exceed Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000).
To the extent Borrower defers payment of any contested taxes, Borrower shall (i)
notify Bank in writing of the commencement of, and any material development in,
the proceedings, and (ii) post bonds or take any other steps required to prevent
the Governmental Authority levying such contested taxes from obtaining a Lien
upon any of the Collateral that is other than a “Permitted Lien.” Borrower is
unaware of any claims or adjustments proposed for any of Borrower’s prior tax
years which could result in additional taxes becoming due and payable by
Borrower in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000). Borrower has paid all
amounts necessary to fund all present pension, profit sharing and deferred
compensation plans in accordance with their terms, and Borrower has not
withdrawn from participation in, and has not permitted partial or complete
termination of, or permitted the occurrence of any other event with respect to,
any such plan which could reasonably be expected to result in any liability of
Borrower, including any liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or
its successors or any other governmental agency.
z.Use of Proceeds. Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Credit Extensions
solely as working capital and to fund its general business requirements and not
for personal, family, household or agricultural purposes.
aa.Full Disclosure. No written representation, warranty or other statement of
Borrower in any report, certificate, or written statement submitted to the
Financial Statement Repository or otherwise submitted to Bank, as of the date
such representation, warranty, or other statement was made, taken together with
all such written reports, written certificates and written statements submitted
to the Financial Statement Repository or otherwise submitted to Bank, contains
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements contained in the reports, certificates, or
written statements not misleading (it being recognized by Bank that the
projections and forecasts provided by Borrower in good faith and based upon
reasonable assumptions are not viewed as facts and that actual results during
the period or periods covered by such projections and forecasts may differ from
the projected or forecasted results).
ab.Definition of “Knowledge.” For purposes of the Loan Documents, whenever a
representation or warranty is made to Borrower’s knowledge or awareness, to the
“best of” Borrower’s knowledge, or with a similar qualification, knowledge or
awareness means the actual knowledge, after reasonable investigation, of any
Responsible Officer.
•AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS
Borrower shall do all of the following:
ac.Government Compliance.
ar.Maintain its and all its Subsidiaries’ legal existence and good standing in
their respective jurisdictions of formation and maintain qualification in each
jurisdiction in which the failure to so qualify would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on Borrower’s business or operations; provided
that
#2572901v4    
14
233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



nothing in this Section 6.1 shall prohibit or prevent Borrower from
discontinuing the legal existence and qualification of any Immaterial
Subsidiary, with prior written notice to Bank, if in the reasonable good faith
judgment of Borrower, such discontinuance or qualification is no longer
desirable in the conduct of its business or such Subsidiary is no longer useful
to the business of Borrower or such Subsidiary. Borrower shall comply, and have
each Subsidiary comply, in all material respects, with all laws, ordinances and
regulations to which it is subject, noncompliance with which could reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on Borrower’s business.


as.Obtain all of the Governmental Approvals necessary for the performance by

to be delivered pursuant to the terms hereof (to the extent any such documents
are included in materials otherwise filed with the SEC) may be delivered
electronically and if so delivered, shall be deemed to have been delivered on
the date on which Borrower posts such documents, or provides a link thereto, on

($500,000) or more, net of insurance contributions;
ba.prompt written notice of any changes to the beneficial ownership information
set out in items 2d, 2e, 2f, and 2g of the Perfection Certificate. Borrower

obligations to obtain, verify and record information about the beneficial owners
of its legal entity customers; and
bb.promptly, from time to time, such other information regarding Borrower or
compliance with the terms of any Loan Documents as reasonably requested by Bank.
Any submission by Borrower of a Compliance Statement, a Borrowing Base Statement
or any other financial statement submitted to the Financial Statement Repository

be a representation by Borrower that (i) as of the date of such Compliance
Statement, Borrowing Base Statement or other financial statement, the
information and calculations set forth therein are true, accurate and correct,
(ii) as of the end of the compliance period set forth in such submission,
Borrower is in complete compliance with all required covenants except as noted

ae.Accounts Receivable.
bc.Schedules and Documents Relating to Accounts. Borrower shall deliver to Bank
transaction reports and schedules of collections, as provided in Section 6.2, on
Bank’s standard forms; provided, however, that Borrower’s failure to execute and
deliver the same shall not affect or limit Bank’s Lien and other rights in all
of Borrower’s Accounts, nor shall Bank’s failure to advance or lend against a
specific Account affect or limit Bank’s Lien and other rights therein. If
requested by Bank, Borrower shall furnish Bank with copies (or, at Bank’s
request, originals) of all contracts, orders, invoices, and other similar
documents, and all shipping instructions, delivery receipts, bills of lading,
and other evidence of delivery, for any goods the sale or disposition of which
gave rise to such Accounts. In addition, Borrower shall deliver to Bank, on its

in the same form as received, with all necessary indorsements, and copies of all
credit memos.
bd.Disputes. Borrower shall promptly notify Bank of all disputes or claims
relating to Accounts in excess of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000).
Borrower may forgive (completely or partially), compromise, or settle any
Account for less than payment in full, or agree to do any of the foregoing so
long as (i) Borrower does so in good faith, in a commercially reasonable manner,
in the ordinary course of business, in arm’s-length transactions, and reports
the same to Bank in the regular reports provided to Bank; (ii) no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing; and (iii) after taking into account all
such discounts, settlements and forgiveness, the total outstanding Advances will
not exceed the lesser of the Revolving Line or the Borrowing Base.
be.Collection of Accounts. Borrower shall direct Account Debtors to deliver or
transmit all proceeds of Accounts into a lockbox account or such other “blocked
account” as specified by Bank (either such account, the “Cash Collateral
Account”). Whether or not an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Borrower shall immediately deliver all payments on and proceeds of Accounts to
the Cash Collateral Account. Subject to Bank’s right to maintain a reserve
pursuant to Section 6.3(d), all amounts received in the Cash Collateral Account
shall be transferred on a daily basis to Borrower’s operating account with Bank.
Borrower hereby

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



authorizes Bank to transfer to the Cash Collateral Account any amounts that Bank
reasonably determines are proceeds of the Accounts (provided that Bank is under
no obligation to do so and this allowance shall in no event relieve Borrower of
its obligations hereunder).
bf.Reserves. Notwithstanding any terms in this Agreement to the contrary, at
times when an Event of Default exists, Bank may hold any proceeds of the
Accounts and any amounts in the Cash Collateral Account that are not applied to
the Obligations pursuant to Section 6.3(c) above (including amounts otherwise
required to be transferred to Borrower’s operating account with Bank) as a
reserve to be applied to any Obligations regardless of whether such Obligations
are then due and payable.
bg.Verifications; Confirmations; Credit Quality; Notifications. Bank may, from
time to time with notice to Borrower (no such notice shall be required if an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), (i) verify and confirm
directly with the respective Account Debtors the validity, amount and other
matters relating to the Accounts, either in the name of Borrower or Bank or such
other name as Bank may choose, and notify any Account Debtor of Bank’s security
interest in such Account and/or (ii) conduct a credit check of any Account
Debtor to approve any such Account Debtor’s credit.
bh.No Liability. Bank shall not be responsible or liable for any shortage or
discrepancy in, damage to, or loss or destruction of, any goods, the sale or
other disposition of which gives rise to an Account, or for any error, act,
omission, or delay of any kind occurring in the settlement, failure to settle,
collection or failure to collect any Account, or for settling any Account in
good faith for less than the full amount thereof, nor shall Bank be deemed to be
responsible for any of Borrower’s obligations under any contract or agreement
giving rise to an Account. Nothing herein shall, however, relieve Bank from
liability for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.
af.Remittance of Proceeds. Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.3(c),
deliver, in kind, all proceeds arising from the disposition of any Collateral to
Bank in the original form in which received by Borrower not later than the
following Business Day after receipt by Borrower, to be applied to the
Obligations (a) prior to an Event of Default, pursuant to the terms of Section
6.3(c) hereof, and (b) after the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, pursuant to the terms of Section 9.4 hereof; provided that, if
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall not be
obligated to remit to Bank the proceeds of the sale of worn out or obsolete
Equipment disposed of by Borrower in good faith in an arm’s length transaction
for an aggregate purchase price of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) or
less (for all such transactions in any fiscal year). Borrower agrees that it
will maintain in an account with Bank proceeds of Collateral and will hold such
proceeds separate and apart from such other funds and property and in an express
trust for Bank. Nothing in this Section 6.4 limits the restrictions on
disposition of Collateral set forth elsewhere in this Agreement.
ag.Taxes; Pensions. Timely file, and require each of its Subsidiaries to timely
file, all required tax returns and reports and timely pay, and require each of
its Subsidiaries to timely pay, all foreign, federal, state and local taxes,
assessments, deposits and contributions owed by Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries, except for deferred payment of any taxes contested pursuant to the
terms of Section 5.9 hereof, and shall deliver to Bank, on demand, appropriate
certificates attesting to such payments, and pay all amounts necessary to fund
all present pension, profit sharing and deferred compensation plans in
accordance with their terms.
ah.Access to Collateral; Books and Records. At reasonable times, on three (3)
Business Days’ notice (provided no notice is required if an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing), Bank, or its agents, shall have the right to
inspect the Collateral and the right to audit and copy Borrower’s Books. The
foregoing inspections and audits shall be conducted no more often than once
every twelve (12) months (or more frequently as Bank in its sole discretion
determines that conditions warrant) unless an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing in which case such inspections and audits shall occur as often as
Bank shall determine is necessary. Borrower hereby acknowledges that the Initial
Audit shall be conducted prior to the initial Advance occurring after the
Effective Date and, in any event, not more than ninety (90) days after the
Effective Date. The foregoing inspections and audits shall be conducted at
Borrower’s expense and the charge therefor shall be One Thousand Dollars
($1,000) per person per day (or such higher amount as shall represent Bank’s
then-current standard charge
#2572901v4    
17
233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



for the same), plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. In the event Borrower and
Bank schedule an audit more than eight (8) days in advance, and Borrower cancels
or seeks to or reschedules the audit with less than eight (8) days written
notice to Bank, then (without limiting any of Bank’s rights or remedies)
Borrower shall pay Bank a fee of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000) plus any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Bank to compensate Bank for the anticipated
costs and expenses of the cancellation or rescheduling.
ai.Insurance.
bi.Keep its business and the Collateral insured for risks and in amounts
standard for companies in Borrower’s industry and location and as Bank may
reasonably request. Insurance policies shall be in a form, with financially
sound and reputable insurance companies that are not Affiliates of Borrower, and
in amounts that are satisfactory to Bank. All property policies shall have a
lender’s loss payable endorsement showing Bank as lender loss payee. All
liability policies shall show, or have endorsements showing, Bank as an
additional insured. Bank shall be named as lender loss payee and/or additional
insured with respect to any such insurance providing coverage in respect of any
Collateral.
bj.Ensure that proceeds payable under any property policy are, at Bank’s option,
payable to Bank on account of the Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(i) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Borrower
shall have the option of applying the proceeds of any casualty policy up to Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) in the aggregate for all losses under all
casualty policies in any one year, toward the replacement or repair of destroyed
or damaged property; provided that any such replaced or repaired property (A)
shall be of equal or like value as the replaced or repaired Collateral and (B)
shall be deemed Collateral in which Bank has been granted a first priority
security interest (except for Liens permitted under clause (c) of the definition
of Permitted Liens), and (ii) after the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, all proceeds payable under such casualty policy shall, at
the option of Bank, be payable to Bank on account of the Obligations.
bk.At Bank’s request, Borrower shall deliver certified copies of insurance
policies and evidence of all premium payments. Each provider of any such
insurance required under this Section 6.7 shall agree, by endorsement upon the
policy or policies issued by it or by independent instruments furnished to Bank,
that it will give Bank twenty (20) days (ten (10) days for nonpayment of
premium) prior written notice before any such policy or policies shall be
canceled. If Borrower fails to obtain insurance as required under this Section
6.7 or to pay any amount or furnish any required proof of payment to third
persons and Bank, Bank may make all or part of such payment or obtain such
insurance policies required in this Section 6.7, and take any action under the
policies Bank deems prudent.
aj.Accounts.
bl.Maintain its and all of its Material Subsidiaries’ primary domestic operating
and other deposit accounts, and the Cash Collateral Account with Bank and Bank’s
Affiliates, which accounts shall represent at least eighty-five percent (85%) of
the dollar value of Borrower’s and such Subsidiaries’ accounts at all financial
institutions.
bm.Except as set forth in clause (g) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness
herein, Borrower and all of its Material Subsidiaries shall obtain any business
credit cards and letters of credit exclusively from Bank.
bn.In addition to and without limiting the restrictions in clause (a) above,
Borrower shall provide Bank five (5) days prior written notice before
establishing any domestic Collateral Account (other than Collateral Accounts
described in clauses (i) and (ii) in the definition of Excluded Accounts below)
at or with any bank or financial institution other than Bank or Bank’s
Affiliates. For each domestic Collateral Account (other than Excluded Accounts)
that Borrower at any time maintains, Borrower shall cause the applicable bank or
financial institution (other than Bank) at or with which any Collateral Account
is maintained to execute and deliver a Control Agreement or other appropriate
instrument with respect to such Collateral Account to perfect Bank’s Lien in
such

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Collateral Account in accordance with the terms hereunder which Control
Agreement may not be terminated without the prior written consent of Bank. The
provisions of the previous sentence shall not apply to (i) deposit accounts
exclusively used for payroll, payroll taxes, and other employee wage and benefit
payments to or for the benefit of Borrower’s employees and identified to Bank by
Borrower as such, (ii) payment processing accounts for which Borrower has
provided written notice to Bank and provided that all funds in such payment
processing accounts are swept to the Designated Deposit Account on a weekly
basis and (iii) escrow or trust accounts established in connection with a merger

and Bank has approved the establishment of such escrow or trust fund prior to
the escrow or trust fund being established (“Excluded Accounts”).

validity and enforceability of its Intellectual Property material to its
business; (ii) promptly advise Bank in writing of material infringements or any
other event that could reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect

forfeited or dedicated to the public without Bank’s written consent.
br.Provide written notice to Bank within ten (10) days of entering or becoming
bound by any Restricted License (other than over-the-counter software that is
commercially available to the public). Borrower shall take such steps as Bank
requests in its reasonable discretion to obtain the consent of, or waiver by,
any person whose consent or waiver is necessary for (i) any Restricted License
to be deemed “Collateral” and for Bank to have a security interest in it that
might otherwise be restricted or prohibited by law or by the terms of any such
Restricted License, whether now existing or entered into in the future, and (ii)
Bank to have the ability in the event of a liquidation of any Collateral to

termination of this Agreement, make available to Bank, without expense to Bank,
Borrower and its officers, employees and agents and Borrower’s books and

thirty (30) days of the date that Borrower forms any direct or indirect Material
Subsidiary or acquires any direct or indirect Material Subsidiary after the
Effective Date (including, without limitation, pursuant to a Division), or if

shall (a) cause such Material Subsidiary to provide to Bank a joinder to this
Agreement to become a co-borrower hereunder, together with such appropriate

be cured within the ten (10) day period or cannot after diligent attempts by
Borrower be cured within such ten (10) day period, and such default is likely to
be cured within a reasonable time, then Borrower shall have an additional period

Guarantor is a party with a third party or parties, (a) any default resulting in
a right by such third party or parties, whether or not exercised, to accelerate
the maturity of any Indebtedness in an amount individually or in the aggregate
in excess of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000); or (b) any breach or
default by Borrower or Guarantor, the result of which could have a material
adverse effect on Borrower’s or any Guarantor’s business; provided, however,
that the Event of Default under this Section 8.6 caused by the occurrence of a
breach or default under such other agreement shall be cured or waived for
purposes of this Agreement upon Bank receiving written notice from the party

business judgment of Bank be materially less advantageous to Borrower or any
Guarantor;

or decrees for the payment of money in an amount, individually or in the
aggregate, of at least One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) (not covered by

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



and pay such amounts, and (ii) pay in advance all letter of credit fees
scheduled to be paid or payable over the remaining term of any Letters of
Credit;
cc.terminate any FX Contracts;
cd.verify the amount of, demand payment of and performance under, and collect
any Accounts and General Intangibles, settle or adjust disputes and claims
directly with Account Debtors for amounts on terms and in any order that Bank
considers advisable, and notify any Person owing Borrower money of Bank’s
security interest in such funds. Borrower shall collect all payments in trust
for Bank and, if requested by Bank, immediately deliver the payments to Bank in
the form received from the Account Debtor, with proper endorsements for deposit;
ce.make any payments and do any acts it considers necessary or reasonable to
protect the Collateral and/or its security interest in the Collateral. Borrower
shall assemble the Collateral if Bank requests and make it available as Bank
designates. Bank may enter premises where the Collateral is located, take and
maintain possession of any part of the Collateral, and pay, purchase, contest,
or compromise any Lien which appears to be prior or superior to its security
interest and pay all expenses incurred. Borrower grants Bank a license to enter
and occupy any of its premises, without charge, to exercise any of Bank’s rights
or remedies;
cf.apply to the Obligations any (i) balances and deposits of Borrower it holds,
or (ii) amount held by Bank owing to or for the credit or the account of
Borrower;
cg.ship, reclaim, recover, store, finish, maintain, repair, prepare for sale,
advertise for sale, and sell the Collateral. Bank is hereby granted a
non-exclusive, royalty-free license or other right to use, without charge,
Borrower’s labels, Patents, Copyrights, mask works, rights of use of any name,
trade secrets, trade names, Trademarks, and advertising matter, or any similar
property as it pertains to the Collateral, in completing production of,
advertising for sale, and selling any Collateral and, in connection with Bank’s
exercise of its rights under this Section 9.1, Borrower’s rights under all
licenses and all franchise agreements inure to Bank’s benefit;
ch.place a “hold” on any account maintained with Bank and/or deliver a notice of
exclusive control, any entitlement order, or other directions or instructions
pursuant to any Control Agreement or similar agreements providing control of any
Collateral;
ci.demand and receive possession of Borrower’s Books; and
cj.exercise all rights and remedies available to Bank under the Loan Documents
or at law or equity, including all remedies provided under the Code (including
disposal of the Collateral pursuant to the terms thereof).
bm.Power of Attorney. Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints Bank as its lawful
attorney-in-fact, exercisable following the occurrence of an Event of Default,
to: (a) endorse Borrower’s name on any checks, payment instruments, or other
forms of payment or security; (b) sign Borrower’s name on any invoice or bill of
lading for any Account or drafts against Account Debtors; (c) demand, collect,
sue, and give releases to any Account Debtor for monies due, settle and adjust
disputes and claims about the Accounts directly with Account Debtors, and
compromise, prosecute, or defend any action, claim, case, or proceeding about
any Collateral (including filing a claim or voting a claim in any bankruptcy
case in Bank’s or Borrower’s name, as Bank chooses); (d) make, settle, and
adjust all claims under Borrower’s insurance policies; (e) pay, contest or
settle any Lien, charge, encumbrance, security interest, or other claim in or to
the Collateral, or any judgment based thereon, or otherwise take any action to
terminate or discharge the same; and (f) transfer the Collateral into the name
of Bank or a third party as the Code permits. Borrower hereby appoints Bank as
its lawful attorney-in-fact to sign Borrower’s name on any documents necessary
to perfect or continue the perfection of Bank’s security interest in the
Collateral regardless of whether an Event of Default has occurred until all
Obligations (other than inchoate indemnity obligations) have been satisfied in
full and the Loan Documents have been terminated. Bank’s foregoing appointment
as Borrower’s attorney in fact, and all of Bank’s rights and powers, coupled
with an interest, are irrevocable until all Obligations (other than
#2572901v4    
25
233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



inchoate indemnity obligations) have been fully repaid and performed and the
Loan Documents have been terminated.
bn.Protective Payments. If Borrower fails to obtain the insurance called for by
Section 6.7 or fails to pay any premium thereon or fails to pay any other amount
which Borrower is obligated to pay under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or which may be required to preserve the Collateral, Bank may obtain
such insurance or make such payment, and all amounts so paid by Bank are Bank
Expenses and immediately due and payable, bearing interest at the then highest
rate applicable to the Obligations, and secured by the Collateral. Bank will
make reasonable efforts to provide Borrower with notice of Bank obtaining such
insurance at the time it is obtained or within a reasonable time thereafter. No
payments by Bank are deemed an agreement to make similar payments in the future
or Bank’s waiver of any Event of Default.
bo.Application of Payments and Proceeds. Bank shall have the right to apply in
any order any funds in its possession, whether from Borrower account balances,
payments, proceeds realized as the result of any collection of Accounts or other
disposition of the Collateral, or otherwise, to the Obligations. Bank shall pay
any surplus to Borrower by credit to the Designated Deposit Account or to other
Persons legally entitled thereto; Borrower shall remain liable to Bank for any
deficiency. If Bank, directly or indirectly, enters into a deferred payment or
other credit transaction with any purchaser at any sale of Collateral, Bank
shall have the option, exercisable at any time, of either reducing the
Obligations by the principal amount of the purchase price or deferring the
reduction of the Obligations until the actual receipt by Bank of cash therefor.
bp.Bank’s Liability for Collateral. So long as Bank complies with reasonable
banking practices regarding the safekeeping of the Collateral in the possession
or under the control of Bank, Bank shall not be liable or responsible for: (a)
the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b) any loss or damage to the Collateral; (c)
any diminution in the value of the Collateral; or (d) any act or default of any
carrier, warehouseman, bailee, or other Person. Borrower bears all risk of loss,
damage or destruction of the Collateral.
bq.No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. Bank’s failure, at any time or times, to
require strict performance by Borrower of any provision of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document shall not waive, affect, or diminish any right of Bank
thereafter to demand strict performance and compliance herewith or therewith. No
waiver hereunder shall be effective unless signed by the party granting the
waiver and then is only effective for the specific instance and purpose for
which it is given. Bank’s rights and remedies under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents are cumulative. Bank has all rights and remedies provided under
the Code, by law, or in equity. Bank’s exercise of one right or remedy is not an
election and shall not preclude Bank from exercising any other remedy under this
Agreement or other remedy available at law or in equity, and Bank’s waiver of
any Event of Default is not a continuing waiver. Bank’s delay in exercising any
remedy is not a waiver, election, or acquiescence.
br.Demand Waiver. Borrower waives demand, notice of default or dishonor, notice
of payment and nonpayment, notice of any default, nonpayment at maturity,
release, compromise, settlement, extension, or renewal of accounts, documents,
instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees held by Bank on which Borrower is
liable.
bs.Borrower Liability. Any Borrower may, acting singly, request Credit
Extensions hereunder. Each Borrower hereby appoints each other as agent for the
other for all purposes hereunder, including with respect to requesting Credit
Extensions hereunder. Each Borrower hereunder shall be jointly and severally
obligated to repay all Credit Extensions made hereunder, regardless of which
Borrower actually receives said Credit Extension, as if each Borrower hereunder
directly received all Credit Extensions. Each Borrower waives (a) any suretyship
defenses available to it under the Code or any other applicable law, including,
without limitation, the benefit of California Civil Code Section 2815 permitting
revocation as to future transactions and the benefit of California Civil Code
Sections 1432, 2809, 2810, 2819, 2839, 2845, 2847, 2848, 2849, 2850, and 2899
and 3433, and (b) any right to require Bank to: (i) proceed against any Borrower
or any other person; (ii) proceed against or exhaust any security; or (iii)
pursue any other remedy. Bank may exercise or not exercise any right or remedy
it has against any Borrower or any security it holds (including the right to
foreclose by judicial or non-judicial sale) without affecting any Borrower’s
liability. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or other
related document, each
#2572901v4    
26
233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Borrower irrevocably waives all rights that it may have at law or in equity
(including, without limitation, any law subrogating Borrower to the rights of
Bank under this Agreement) to seek contribution, indemnification or any other
form of reimbursement from any other Borrower, or any other Person now or
hereafter primarily or secondarily liable for any of the Obligations, for any
payment made by Borrower with respect to the Obligations in connection with this
Agreement or otherwise and all rights that it might have to benefit from, or to
participate in, any security for the Obligations as a result of any payment made
by Borrower with respect to the Obligations in connection with this Agreement or
otherwise. Any agreement providing for indemnification, reimbursement or any
other arrangement prohibited under this Section 9.8 shall be null and void. If
any payment is made to a Borrower in contravention of this Section 9.8, such
Borrower shall hold such payment in trust for Bank and such payment shall be
promptly delivered to Bank for application to the Obligations, whether matured
or unmatured.

•CHOICE OF LAW, VENUE, JURY TRIAL WAIVER AND JUDICIAL REFERENCE
Except as otherwise expressly provided in any of the Loan Documents, California
law governs the Loan Documents without regard to principles of conflicts of law.
Borrower and Bank each submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State and
Federal courts in California; provided, however, that nothing in this Agreement
shall be deemed to operate to preclude Bank from bringing suit or taking other
legal action in any other jurisdiction to realize on the Collateral or any other
security for the Obligations, or to enforce a judgment or other court order in
favor of Bank. Borrower expressly submits and consents in advance to such
jurisdiction in any action or suit commenced in any such court, and Borrower
hereby waives any objection that it may have based upon lack of personal
jurisdiction, improper venue, or forum non conveniens and hereby consents to the
granting of such legal or equitable relief as is deemed appropriate by such
court. Borrower hereby waives personal service of the summons, complaints, and
other process issued in such action or suit and agrees that service of such
summons, complaints, and other process may be made by registered or certified
mail addressed to Borrower at the address set forth in, or subsequently provided
by Borrower in accordance with, Section 10 of this Agreement and that service so
made shall be deemed completed upon the earlier to occur of Borrower’s actual
receipt thereof or three (3) days after deposit in the U.S. mails, proper
postage prepaid.
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BORROWER AND BANK EACH WAIVE
THEIR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING
#2572901v4    
27
233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT, THE LOAN DOCUMENTS OR ANY CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTION, INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF DUTY AND ALL OTHER CLAIMS. THIS
WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR BOTH PARTIES TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.
EACH PARTY HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS COUNSEL.
WITHOUT INTENDING IN ANY WAY TO LIMIT THE PARTIES’ AGREEMENT TO WAIVE THEIR
RESPECTIVE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY, if the above waiver of the right to a trial
by jury is not enforceable, the parties hereto agree that any and all disputes
or controversies of any nature between them arising at any time shall be decided
by a reference to a private judge, mutually selected by the parties (or, if they
cannot agree, by the Presiding Judge of the Santa Clara County, California
Superior Court) appointed in accordance with California Code of Civil Procedure
Section 638 (or pursuant to comparable provisions of federal law if the dispute
falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts), sitting without
a jury, in Santa Clara County, California; and the parties hereby submit to the
jurisdiction of such court. The reference proceedings shall be conducted
pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of California Code of Civil
Procedure Sections 638 through 645.1, inclusive. The private judge shall have
the power, among others, to grant provisional relief, including without
limitation, entering temporary restraining orders, issuing preliminary and
permanent injunctions and appointing receivers. All such proceedings shall be
closed to the public and confidential and all records relating thereto shall be
permanently sealed. If during the course of any dispute, a party desires to seek
provisional relief, but a judge has not been appointed at that point pursuant to
the judicial reference procedures, then such party may apply to the Santa Clara
County, California Superior Court for such relief. The proceeding before the
private judge shall be conducted in the same manner as it would be before a
court under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings. The
parties shall be entitled to discovery which shall be conducted in the same
manner as it would be before a court under the rules of discovery applicable to
judicial proceedings. The private judge shall oversee discovery and may enforce
all discovery rules and orders applicable to judicial proceedings in the same
manner as a trial court judge. The parties agree that the selected or appointed
private judge shall have the power to decide all issues in the action or
proceeding, whether of fact or of law, and shall report a statement of decision
thereon pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 644(a). Nothing
in this paragraph shall limit the right of any party at any time to exercise
self-help remedies, foreclose against collateral, or obtain provisional
remedies. The private judge shall also determine all issues relating to the
applicability, interpretation, and enforceability of this paragraph.
This Section 11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
•GENERAL PROVISIONS
bt.Termination Prior to Maturity Date; Survival. All covenants, representations
and warranties made in this Agreement shall continue in full force until this
Agreement has terminated pursuant to its terms and all Obligations have been
satisfied (other than inchoate indemnity obligations). So long as Borrower has
satisfied the Obligations (other than inchoate indemnity obligations, and any
other obligations which, by their terms, are to survive the termination of this
Agreement, and any Obligations under Bank Services Agreements that are cash
collateralized in accordance with Section 4.1 of this Agreement), this Agreement
may be terminated prior to the Revolving Line Maturity Date by Borrower,
effective three (3) Business Days after written notice of termination is given
to Bank. Those obligations that are expressly specified in this Agreement as
surviving this Agreement’s termination shall continue to survive notwithstanding
this Agreement’s termination.
bu.Successors and Assigns. This Agreement binds and is for the benefit of the
successors and permitted assigns of each party. Borrower may not assign this
Agreement or any rights or obligations under it without Bank’s prior written
consent (which may be granted or withheld in Bank’s discretion). Bank has the
right, without the consent of or notice to Borrower, to sell, transfer, assign,
negotiate, or grant participation in all or any part of, or any interest in,
Bank’s obligations, rights, and benefits under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.
bv.Indemnification. Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Bank and its
directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, or any other Person
affiliated with or representing Bank (each, an “Indemnified Person”) harmless
against: (i) all obligations, demands, claims, and liabilities (collectively,
“Claims”) claimed or
#2572901v4    
28
233773760 v5

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



asserted by any other party in connection with the transactions contemplated by
the Loan Documents; and (ii) all losses or expenses (including Bank Expenses) in
any way suffered, incurred, or paid by such Indemnified Person as a result of,
following from, consequential to, or arising from transactions between Bank and
Borrower (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses), except for Claims
and/or losses directly caused by such Indemnified Person’s gross negligence or
willful misconduct.
This Section 12.3 shall survive until all statutes of limitation with respect to
the Claims, losses, and expenses for which indemnity is given shall have run.
bw.Time of Essence. Time is of the essence for the performance of all
Obligations in this Agreement.
bx.Severability of Provisions. Each provision of this Agreement is severable
from every other provision in determining the enforceability of any provision.
by.Correction of Loan Documents. Bank may correct patent errors and fill in any
blanks in the Loan Documents consistent with the agreement of the parties, so
long as Bank provides Borrower with written notice of such correction and allows
Borrower at least ten (10) days to object to such correction. In the event of
such objection, such correction shall not be made except by an amendment signed
by both Bank and Borrower.
bz.Amendments in Writing; Waiver; Integration. No purported amendment or
modification of any Loan Document, or waiver, discharge or termination of any
obligation under any Loan Document, shall be enforceable or admissible unless,
and only to the extent, expressly set forth in a writing signed by the party
against which enforcement or admission is sought. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no oral promise or statement, nor any action,
inaction, delay, failure to require performance or course of conduct shall
operate as, or evidence, an amendment, supplement or waiver or have any other
effect on any Loan Document. Any waiver granted shall be limited to the specific
circumstance expressly described in it, and shall not apply to any subsequent or
other circumstance, whether similar or dissimilar, or give rise to, or evidence,
any obligation or commitment to grant any further waiver. The Loan Documents
represent the entire agreement about this subject matter and supersede prior
negotiations or agreements. All prior agreements, understandings,
representations, warranties, and negotiations between the parties about the
subject matter of the Loan Documents merge into the Loan Documents.
ca.Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts
and by different parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed
and delivered, is an original, and all taken together, constitute one Agreement.
cb.Confidentiality. In handling any confidential information, which shall
include all information about Borrower provided by Borrower to Bank hereunder
and any other information the nature of which should reasonably be understood to
be confidential, Bank shall exercise the same degree of care that it exercises
for its own proprietary information, but disclosure of information may be made:
(a) to Bank’s Subsidiaries or Affiliates (such Subsidiaries and Affiliates,
together with Bank, collectively, “Bank Entities”); (b) to prospective
transferees or purchasers of any interest in the Credit Extensions (provided,
however, Bank shall use its best efforts to obtain any prospective transferee’s
or purchaser’s agreement to the terms of this provision); (c) as required by
law, regulation, subpoena, or other order; (d) to Bank’s regulators or as
otherwise required in connection with Bank’s examination or audit; (e) as Bank
considers appropriate in exercising remedies under the Loan Documents; and (f)
to third-party service providers of Bank so long as such service providers have
executed a confidentiality agreement with Bank with terms no less restrictive
than those contained herein. Confidential information does not include
information that is either: (i) in the public domain or in Bank’s possession
when disclosed to Bank, or becomes part of the public domain (other than as a
result of its disclosure by Bank in violation of this Agreement) after
disclosure to Bank; or (ii) disclosed to Bank by a third party, if Bank does not
know that the third party is prohibited from disclosing the information.
Bank Entities may use anonymous forms of confidential information for aggregate
datasets, for analyses or reporting, and for any other uses not expressly
prohibited in writing by Borrower. The provisions of the immediately preceding
sentence shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

cc.Attorneys’ Fees, Costs and Expenses. In any action or proceeding between
Borrower and Bank arising out of or relating to the Loan Documents, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys’ fees and
other costs and expenses incurred, in addition to any other relief to which it
may be entitled.
cd.Electronic Execution of Documents. The words “execution,” “signed,”
“signature” and words of like import in any Loan Document shall be deemed to
include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each
of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a
manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping systems,
as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law,
including, without limitation, any state law based on the Uniform Electronic
Transactions Act.
ce.Right of Setoff. Borrower hereby grants to Bank a Lien and a right of setoff
as security for all Obligations to Bank, whether now existing or hereafter
arising upon and against all deposits, credits, collateral and property, now or
hereafter in the possession, custody, safekeeping or control of Bank or any
entity under the control of Bank (including a subsidiary of Bank) or in transit
to any of them. At any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default, without demand or notice, Bank may setoff the same or any
part thereof and apply the same to any liability or Obligation of Borrower even
though unmatured and regardless of the adequacy of any other collateral securing
the Obligations. ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO REQUIRE BANK TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS OR
REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER COLLATERAL WHICH SECURES THE OBLIGATIONS,
PRIOR TO EXERCISING ITS RIGHT OF SETOFF WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DEPOSITS, CREDITS
OR OTHER PROPERTY OF BORROWER, ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY
WAIVED.
cf.Captions. The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and
shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement.
cg.Construction of Agreement. The parties mutually acknowledge that they and
their attorneys have participated in the preparation and negotiation of this
Agreement. In cases of uncertainty this Agreement shall be construed without
regard to which of the parties caused the uncertainty to exist.
ch.Relationship. The relationship of the parties to this Agreement is determined
solely by the provisions of this Agreement. The parties do not intend to create
any agency, partnership, joint venture, trust, fiduciary or other relationship
with duties or incidents different from those of parties to an arm’s-length
contract.
ci.Third Parties. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, is
intended to: (a) confer any benefits, rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement on any persons other than the express parties to it and their
respective permitted successors and assigns; (b) relieve or discharge the
obligation or liability of any person not an express party to this Agreement; or
(c) give any person not an express party to this Agreement any right of
subrogation or action against any party to this Agreement.
cj.No Novation. Nothing contained herein shall in any way impair the Prior Loan
Agreement and the other Loan Documents now held for the Obligations, nor affect
or impair any rights, powers, or remedies under the Prior Loan Agreement or any
Loan Document, it being the intent of the parties hereto that this Agreement
shall not constitute a novation of the Prior Loan Agreement or an accord and
satisfaction of the Obligations. Except as expressly provided for in this
Agreement, the Loan Documents are hereby ratified and reaffirmed and shall
remain in full force and effect. Borrower hereby ratifies and reaffirms the
validity and enforceability of all of the liens and security interests
heretofore granted pursuant to the Loan Documents, as collateral security for
the Obligations, and acknowledges that all of such liens and security interests,
and all Collateral heretofore pledged as security for the Obligations, continues
to be and remains in full force and effect as Collateral for the Obligations
from and after the date of this Agreement.

EXHIBIT A - COLLATERAL DESCRIPTION


The Collateral consists of all of Borrower’s right, title and interest in and to
the following personal property:
All goods, Accounts (including health-care receivables), Equipment, Inventory,
contract rights or rights to payment of money, leases, license agreements,
franchise agreements, General Intangibles (except as provided below), commercial
tort claims, documents, instruments (including any promissory notes), chattel
paper (whether tangible or electronic), cash, deposit accounts, certificates of
deposit, fixtures, letters of credit rights (whether or not the letter of credit
is evidenced by a writing), securities, and all other investment property,
supporting obligations, and financial assets, whether now owned or hereafter
acquired, wherever located; and
all Borrower’s Books relating to the foregoing, and any and all claims, rights
and interests in any of the above and all substitutions for, additions,
attachments, accessories, accessions and improvements to and replacements,
products, proceeds and insurance proceeds of any or all of the foregoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Collateral does not include any of the
following: (a) more than 65% of the presently existing and hereafter arising
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock owned by Borrower of any Foreign
Subsidiary which shares entitle the holder thereof to vote for directors or any
other matter, (b) more than 65% of the presently existing and hereafter arising
issued and outstanding shares of capital stock owned by Borrower of any Domestic
Subsidiary that is a disregarded entity for United States federal income tax
purposes substantially all of the assets of which consist of equity securities
in one or more Foreign Subsidiaries, (c) rights held under a license that are
not assignable by their terms without the consent of the licensor thereof (but
only to the extent such restriction on assignment is enforceable under
applicable law); (d) any interest of Borrower as a lessee under an Equipment
lease if Borrower is prohibited by the terms of such lease from granting a
security interest in such lease or under which such an assignment or Lien would
cause a default to occur under such lease; provided, however, that upon
termination of such prohibition, such interest shall immediately become
Collateral without any action by Borrower or Bank, and (e) Intellectual
Property; provided, however, the Collateral shall include all Accounts and all
proceeds of Intellectual Property. If a judicial authority (including a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court) would hold that a security interest in the underlying
Intellectual Property is necessary to have a security interest in such Accounts
and such property that are proceeds of Intellectual Property, then the
Collateral shall automatically, and effective as of the Effective Date, include
the Intellectual Property to the extent necessary to permit perfection of Bank’s
security interest in such Accounts and such other property of Borrower that are
proceeds of the Intellectual Property.
Pursuant to the terms of a certain negative pledge arrangement with Bank,
Borrower has agreed not to encumber any of its Intellectual Property without
Bank’s prior written consent.
