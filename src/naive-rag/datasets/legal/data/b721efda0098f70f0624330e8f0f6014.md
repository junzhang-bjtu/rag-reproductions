outstanding approximate as closely as possible the principal amount of
Indebtedness which would be outstanding at such time under the Permitted

agreement rather than an agreement providing for the sale, conveyance,
contribution to capital, transfer or pledge of such assets or interests
therein).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.03(b) below), applied in a manner consistent with that used in preparing the
Audited Financial Statements and without giving effect to any changes in GAAP
occurring after the Closing Date, the effect of which would be to cause leases
which would be treated as operating leases under GAAP as of the Closing Date to
be treated as capital leases under GAAP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for
purposes of determining compliance with any covenant (including the computation
of any financial covenant) contained herein, Indebtedness of the Borrower and

Lenders and the Borrower shall negotiate in good faith to amend such ratio or
requirement to preserve the original intent thereof in light of such change in

and Exchange Commission or reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent;

(ii) For each period of four fiscal quarters of the Borrower ending next
following the date of each Acquisition, Consolidated Interest Charges shall

amounts shall be determined on a historical pro forma basis to the extent
information in sufficient detail concerning such historical results of such

expense accrued during such period on any Indebtedness repaid in connection with
such Acquisition and (ii) include interest expense on any Indebtedness
(including Indebtedness hereunder) incurred, acquired or assumed in connection
with such Acquisition (“Incremental Debt”) calculated (A) as if all such

fiscal quarters and (B) at the following interest rates: (I) for all periods
subsequent to the date of the Acquisition and for Incremental Debt assumed or
acquired in the Acquisition and in effect prior to the date of Acquisition, at

actually applicable to such Incremental Debt hereunder or under other financing
documents applicable thereto as at the end of each affected period of such four
fiscal quarters, as the case may be.

(d) With respect to any Material Disposition consummated on or after the Closing
Date, for each period of four fiscal quarters of the Borrower ending next

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.04 Rounding. Any financial ratios required to be maintained by the Borrower
pursuant to this Agreement shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate
component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the
number of places by which such ratio is expressed herein and rounding the result
up or down to the nearest number (with a rounding-up if there is no nearest
number).

1.05 References to Agreements and Laws. Unless otherwise expressly provided
herein, (a) references to agreements (including the Loan Documents) and other

liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a
different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the
original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into
existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized and acquired
on the first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at
such time.

1.08 Specified Cap Modifications. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the parties hereto agree that, if Lenders constituting Required
Lenders hereunder agree in writing in their capacity as lenders under the
Existing Credit Agreement (or in connection with an amendment and replacement or
refinancing of the Existing Credit Agreement) to amend or otherwise modify the
limitations under the Existing Credit Agreement that are equivalent to the
Secured Debt Cap or Subsidiary Debt Cap, and the effect of such amendment or
modification is to increase, reduce or otherwise modify such equivalent
limitation in any material respect (as reasonably determined by the Company and
evidenced by notice to the Administrative Agent) (any such amendment or
modification of the Existing Credit Agreement, a “Specified Cap Modification”),
then, without any further action on the part of the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent or any of the Lenders, the Secured Debt Cap or the Subsidiary Debt Cap, as
the case may be, will unconditionally be deemed on the date of effectiveness of
any such Specified Cap Modification to be automatically amended to include such
Specified Cap Modification, together with all definitions relating thereto, and
any event of default in respect of any such Specified Cap Modification so
included therein shall be deemed to be an Event of Default under
Section 8.01(b), subject to all applicable terms and provisions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, all rights and remedies exercisable by
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereunder. At the request of the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent will enter into an amendment to this
Agreement necessary to reflect such Specified Cap Modification, which shall be
effective following execution by the Administrative Agent and Borrower (and
which shall not require a separate consent by the Required Lenders).

ARTICLE II

THE COMMITMENTS AND BORROWINGS

2.01 Loans. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, each Lender
severally agrees to make a term loan (each such loan, a “Loan”) to the Borrower
in Dollars in a single drawing on the Closing Date in an aggregate amount equal
to the amount of such Lender’s Commitment. Amounts repaid or prepaid in respect
of Loans may not be reborrowed. Loans may be Base Rate Loans or LIBOR Rate Loans
as further provided herein.

2.02 Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans.

(a) Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans. Each Borrowing, each
conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of Loans
shall be made upon the Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Administrative
Agent, which may be given by (A) telephone or (B) a Loan Notice; provided that
any telephonic notice must be confirmed immediately by delivery to the
Administrative Agent of a Loan Notice (provided that the lack of such prompt
confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such
telephonic notice). Each such Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative
Agent not later than 12:00 noon (i) three Business Days (or, in the case of any
Borrowing of LIBOR Rate Loans to be made on the Closing Date, two Business Days)
prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation
of LIBOR Rate Loans and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate
Loans or of any conversion of LIBOR Rate Loans to Base Rate Loans; provided,
however, that if the Borrower wishes to request LIBOR Rate Loans having an
Interest Period other than one, two, three or six months in duration as provided
in the definition of “Interest Period”, the applicable notice must be received
by the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon three Business Days prior
to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation of LIBOR
Rate Loans, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the
Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is
acceptable to all of them. Not later than 1:00 p.m. three Business Days before
the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation of LIBOR Rate
Loans, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower (which notice may be
by telephone) whether or not the requested Interest Period has been consented to
by all the Lenders. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of LIBOR
Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof. Each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans
shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in
excess thereof. Each Loan Notice shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is
requesting a Borrowing, a conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a
continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing
(which shall be the Closing Date), conversion or continuation, as the case may
be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be
borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to
which existing Loans are to be converted, and (v) if applicable, the duration of
the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a
Type of Loan in a Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice
requesting a conversion or continuation of a LIBOR Rate Loan, then the
applicable Loans shall be made as or converted to a Base Rate Loan and the
Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details thereof. If the
Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of LIBOR Rate
Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will
be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.

(b) Following receipt of a Loan Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify each Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable
Loans. In the case of a Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan
available to the Administrative Agent in Dollars in immediately available funds
at the Administrative Agent’s Office not later than 1:00 p.m. on the Closing
Date; provided that, each Lender may, at its option, make any Borrowing
available to the Borrower by causing any Lending Office of such Lender to make
such Loan; provided, further, that any exercise of

 

21



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

such option shall not affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay such
Borrowing. Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01, the
Administrative Agent shall make all funds so received available to the Borrower
in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent either by (i) crediting
the account of the Borrower on the books of Bank of America with the amount of
such funds or (ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance with
instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the Administrative Agent
by the Borrower.

(c) Except as otherwise provided herein, a LIBOR Rate Loan may be continued or
converted only on the last day of the Interest Period for such LIBOR Rate Loan.
During the existence of an Event of Default, no Loans may be requested as,
converted into or continued as LIBOR Rate Loans without the consent of the
Required Lenders, and the Required Lenders may demand that any or all of the
then outstanding LIBOR Rate Loans be converted immediately to Base Rate Loans.

(d) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders
of the LIBOR Rate applicable to any Interest Period for any LIBOR Rate Loan upon
determination of such LIBOR Rate in accordance with the definition thereof.

(e) After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans from one
Type to the other, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall
not be more than seven (7) Interest Periods in effect with respect to Loans.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may
exchange, continue or rollover all of the portion of its Loans in connection
with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction
permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement
mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and such Lender.

2.03 Prepayments. The Borrower may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent
(which notice may, at the Borrower’s election, be conditioned upon the
effectiveness of other transactions, provided the Borrower shall compensate each
Lender for any additional amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05 suffered as
a result of the revocation of any conditional notice), at any time or from time
to time voluntarily prepay Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty;
provided that: (i) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not
later than 12:00 noon (A) two Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of
LIBOR Rate Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans; (ii) any
prepayment of LIBOR Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof; and (iii) any prepayment of Base
Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $5,000,000 or a whole multiple of
$1,000,000 in excess thereof, or, in each case, if less, the entire principal
amount thereof then outstanding. Each such notice shall specify the date and
amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, if LIBOR
Rate Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each
such notice, and of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If
such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment
and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the
date specified therein. Any prepayment of a LIBOR Rate Loan shall be accompanied
by all accrued interest thereon, together with any additional amounts required
pursuant to Section 3.05. Subject to Section 2.12, each such prepayment shall be
applied to the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective
Applicable Percentages.

2.04 Termination of Commitments. The Aggregate Commitments shall irrevocably and
permanently terminate in full upon the earlier of (a) the funding of the Loans
on the Closing Date (immediately after giving effect to any such funding) and
(b) 3:00 p.m. on the Closing Date.

2.05 Repayment of Loans. The Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity
Date the aggregate principal amount of Loans made to the Borrower outstanding on
such date.

 

22



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.06 Interest.

(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) below, (i) each LIBOR Rate Loan
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each
Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the LIBOR Rate for such Interest
Period plus the Applicable Margin; and (ii) each Base Rate Loan shall bear
interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable
Borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable
Margin.

(b) If any amount of principal on any Loan is not paid when due (after giving
effect to all applicable grace periods) or if any interest, fee or other amount
payable by the Borrower under any Loan Document is not paid when due (after
giving effect to all applicable grace periods), in each case, whether at stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, then such amount shall thereafter bear
interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the
Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws. Accrued and
unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest)
shall be due and payable upon demand.

(c) Except as provided in clause (b) above, interest on each Loan shall be due
and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable thereto and at
such other times as may be specified herein. Interest hereunder shall be due and
payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and
before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.

2.07 Fees.

(a) Agency Fees. The Borrower shall pay an agency fee to the Administrative
Agent for the Administrative Agent’s own account, in the amount and at the time
specified in the letter agreement, dated as of the Closing Date (the “Agent Fee
Letter”), between the Borrower and Bank of America. Such fee shall be fully
earned when paid and shall be nonrefundable for any reason whatsoever.

(b) Lenders’ Upfront Fee. On the Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the Lenders in accordance with their
respective pro rata share of the Aggregate Commitments, an upfront fee in the
amount and at the time specified in the letter agreement, dated as of the
Closing Date (the “Upfront Fee Letter”), among the Borrower, Bank of America,
Bank of America Securities, Inc., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. Such upfront fees are for the credit facility
committed by the Lenders under this Agreement and are fully earned on the date
paid. The upfront fee paid to each Lender is solely for its own account and is
nonrefundable for any reason whatsoever.

2.08 Computation of Interest and Fees. Interest on Base Rate Loans shall be
calculated on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and
the actual number of days elapsed. Computation of all other types of interest
and all fees shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 360 days and the
actual number of days elapsed, which results in a higher yield to the payee
thereof than a method based on a year of 365 or 366 days. Interest shall accrue
on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and, subject to
Section 2.10(a), shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day
on which the Loan or such portion is paid; provided that any Loan that is repaid
on the same day on which it is made shall bear interest for one day. Each
determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder
shall be presumptively correct, absent manifest error.

2.09 Evidence of Debt. The Borrowings made by each Lender shall be evidenced by
one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the
Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records
maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be presumptively
correct absent manifest error of the amount of the Borrowings made by the
Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so
record or any error in doing so

 

23



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower
hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event
of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and
the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters,
the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall be presumptively
correct in the absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender to the
Borrower made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and
deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) a Note, which shall
evidence such Lender’s Loans to the Borrower in addition to such accounts or
records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the
date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of the applicable Loans and
payments with respect thereto.

2.10 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback.

(a) General. All payments to be made by the Borrower of principal, interest,
fees and other amounts required to be made hereunder or under any other Loan
Document shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
Dollars and shall be made without condition or deduction for any counterclaim,
defense, recoupment or set-off. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative
Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed,
at the Administrative Agent’s Office not later than 12:00 noon on the date
specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each
Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein)
of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s
Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 12:00
noon shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any
applicable interest or fee shall in each case continue to accrue. If any payment
to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day,
payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of
time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.

(b) (i) Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
proposed date of any Borrowing of LIBOR Rate Loans (or, in the case of any
Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on the date of such Borrowing)
that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such
Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
Section 2.02 (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, that such
Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required
by Section 2.02) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact
made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative
Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand (or, in the case of the Borrower only,
one Business Day following demand) such corresponding amount in Dollars in
immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and
including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of
a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate, plus any
administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the
Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a
payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate
Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the
Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative
Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by
the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable
Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute
such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall
be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that
shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

 

24



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the
date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of
the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the
Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such
date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption,
distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not
in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to
the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such
Lender in Dollars in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each
day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight
Rate.

A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect
to any amount owing under this subsection (b) shall be presumptively correct,
absent manifest error.

(c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Lender makes available to
the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender to the
Borrower as provided in the foregoing provisions of this Article II, and such
funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because
the conditions to the applicable Borrowing set forth in Article IV are not
satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative
Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to
such Lender, without interest.

(d) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to
make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 10.04(c) are several and not
joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under
Section 10.04(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other
Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or
to make its payment under Section 10.04(c).

(e) Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to
obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute
a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for
any Loan in any particular place or manner.

2.11 Sharing of Payments. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of
set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal
of or interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such Lender’s
receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans or
participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share
thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion
shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for
cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make
such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such
payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate
amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other
amounts owing them; provided that:

(a) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any
portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or
subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the
extent of such recovery, without interest; and

(b) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (y) any
payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the
existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (z) any payment obtained by a Lender as
consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its
Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any
Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).

 

25



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Borrower, subject to Section 10.08, rights of set-off and counterclaim with
respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor
of the Borrower in the amount of such participation.

2.12 Defaulting Lenders. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following
provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender to the
extent permitted by applicable Law:

(a) the Commitment of such Defaulting Lender and such Defaulting Lender’s
Applicable Percentage of the Total Outstandings shall not be included in
determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action
hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification
pursuant to, but subject to, Section 10.01); and

(b) any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether
voluntary or mandatory, at maturity or otherwise) or received by the
Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 10.08 shall be
applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent
as follows: first, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender
to the Administrative Agent hereunder; second, as the Borrower may request (so
long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in
respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof
as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent; third,
to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment
of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such
Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its
obligations under this Agreement; fourth, so long as no Default or Event of
Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result
of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower
against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of
its obligations under this Agreement; and fifth, to such Defaulting Lender or as
otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that if
(x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of
which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and
(y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 4.01
were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans
of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the
payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are
held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Applicable
Percentages.

In the event that each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower agrees in
writing that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused
such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then such Lender shall cease to be a
Defaulting Lender for all purposes hereof and on such date such Lender shall
purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders as the Administrative
Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold such
Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage; provided that no adjustments
will be made retroactively for fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of
the Borrower while such Lender was a Defaulting Lender; provided, further, that,
except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no
change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to non-Defaulting Lender will constitute
any waiver or release of any claim hereunder resulting from such Lender having
been a Defaulting Lender.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTICLE III

TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY

3.01 Taxes.

(a) Any and all payments by the Borrower to or for the account of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender under any Loan Document shall be made free
and clear of and without deduction for any and all present or future taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar
charges, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding, in the case of the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, (i) taxes imposed on or measured by its
net income (however denominated), franchise taxes imposed on it (in lieu of net
income taxes) and branch profits taxes imposed by the United States and any
similar taxes imposed on it, by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision
thereof) under the Laws of which the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the
case may be, is organized or the principal office or applicable Lending Office
is maintained or is otherwise treated as doing business in such jurisdiction,
(ii) taxes as a result of a failure of the Lender or the Administrative Agent to
provide any required forms or exemption certificate or other documentation it
was legally entitled to provide or a failure to comply with any of its covenants
and agreements herein, including, without limitation, Section 10.15, (iii) in
the case of a Lender, any withholding tax that is imposed on amounts payable to
or for the account of such Lender with respect to an applicable interest in a
Loan pursuant to a law in effect on the date on which such Lender becomes a
party hereto or designates a new lending office, except in each case to the
extent that amounts with respect to such Taxes were payable either to such
Lender’s assignor immediately before such Lender acquired the applicable
interest in a Loan or to such Lender immediately before it changed its lending
office, (iv) any U.S. backup withholding taxes, (v) any U.S. Federal withholding
taxes imposed by FATCA (including taxes on passthru payments made by the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Participant or any of their
respective successors or assigns), (vi) any other taxes imposed as a result of
the Administrative Agent’s or any Lender’s gross negligence or willful
misconduct and (vii) taxes and special assessments of any kind imposed solely as
a result of a present or former connection between such recipient and the
jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or special
assessment (other than any such connection arising solely from such recipient
having executed, delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment
under, or enforced, any of the Loan Documents) (all such non-excluded taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar
charges, and liabilities being hereinafter referred to as “Taxes”). If the
Borrower shall be required by any Laws to deduct any Taxes from or in respect of
any sum payable under any Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or any
Lender, (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making
all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section), the Administrative Agent and such Lender receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been
made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions, (iii) the Borrower shall pay
the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance
with applicable Laws, and (iv) within 30 days after the date of such payment,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Administrative Agent (which shall forward the
same to such Lender) the original or a certified copy of a receipt evidencing
payment thereof.

(b) In addition, the Borrower agrees to pay any and all present or future stamp,
court or documentary taxes and any other similar excise or property taxes or
charges or levies which arise from any payment made under any Loan Document or
from the execution, delivery, performance, enforcement or registration of, or
otherwise with respect to, any Loan Document, excluding, however, such amounts
imposed as a result of an assignment or a grant of a participation (hereinafter
referred to as “Other Taxes”).

(c) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Lender and the
Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes and Other Taxes payable or
paid by such Lender and the Administrative Agent in the full amount (including
any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this Section 3.01, but in all cases, without duplication) that are
necessary to preserve the after-tax yield (taking into account and giving effect
to any tax benefits afforded such Lender or the Administrative Agent in
connection with or directly as a result of the imposition of such Taxes or Other
Taxes) such Lender would have received if such Taxes or Other

 

27



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Taxes, as the case may be, had not been imposed, and any liability (including
penalties, interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, except with respect to any Lender or the Administrative Agent,
as the case may be, for such Taxes, Other Taxes or a liability arising from such
Lender’s or the Administrative Agent’s, as the case may be, willful misconduct
or gross negligence. Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30
days after the date the applicable Lender or Agent makes written demand therefor
specifying in reasonable detail the basis therefor. Failure or delay on the part
of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 3.01 shall not
constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this
Section 3.01 for any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed on such Lender more than 60
days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of such Taxes or
Other Taxes and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided, further, that, if the imposition of such Taxes or Other Taxes is
retroactive, then the 60-day period referred to above shall be extended to
include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

(d) Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative
Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender,
or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or
deducted from the funds paid for the account of such Lender, as the case may be.
If the Administrative Agent or any Lender in good faith determines that it has
received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been
indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid
additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay to the Borrower an
amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made,
or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section with respect to
the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be, and without interest (other than any interest paid
by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided
that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender,
agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties,
interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the
Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or
such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.
This subsection shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or
any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating
to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.

(e) If the Borrower is required to pay any amount to any Lender or the
Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 3.01, then such Lender or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall use reasonable efforts
(consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to change the jurisdiction
of its applicable Lending Office so as to eliminate, or reduce the amount of,
any such additional payment by the Borrower which may thereafter accrue, if such
change in the reasonable judgment of such Lender or the Administrative Agent, as
the case may be, is not otherwise materially disadvantageous to such Person.

(f) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 30
days after demand therefor, for (i) any Taxes or Other Taxes attributable to
such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already
indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Taxes or Other Taxes and without
limiting the obligation of the Borrower, if any, to do so), (ii) any Taxes
attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of
Section 10.06(d) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and
(iii) any excluded taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments,
fees, withholdings or similar charges and liabilities attributable to such
Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in
connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom
or with respect thereto, whether or not such taxes, duties, levies, imposts,
deductions, assessments, fees, withholdings or similar charges and liabilities
were correctly or legally

 

28



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to
the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the
Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender
hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all
amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise
payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against
any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 3.01(f).

3.02 Illegality. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or
that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender
or its applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund LIBOR Rate Loans, as
it would otherwise be obligated hereunder to make, maintain or fund, or
materially restricts the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell, or to
take deposits of, Dollars in the London interbank market, or to determine or
charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate, then, on notice thereof by such
Lender to the Borrower through the Administrative Agent, (i) any obligation
existing hereunder of such Lender to make or continue LIBOR Rate Loans or to
convert Base Rate Loans to LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended and (ii) if such
notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate
Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the LIBOR Rate
component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such
Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be reasonably determined by
the Administrative Agent without reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the
Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer
exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from
such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable,
convert all LIBOR Rate Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest
rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such
illegality, be reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent without
reference to the LIBOR Rate component of the Base Rate), either on the last day
of the Interest Period thereof, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain
such LIBOR Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not
lawfully continue to maintain such LIBOR Rate Loans, and (y) if such notice
asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates
based upon the LIBOR Rate, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of
such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without
reference to the LIBOR Rate component thereof until the Administrative Agent is
advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender
to determine or charge interest rates based upon the LIBOR Rate. Upon any such
prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued and unpaid
interest on the amount so prepaid or converted. Each Lender agrees to designate
a different Lending Office if such designation will avoid the need for such
notice and will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be
materially disadvantageous to such Lender or make it impracticable for such
Lender to fund Loans within the time periods required under this Agreement.

3.03 Inability to Determine Rates; LIBOR Successor Rate.

(a) If in connection with any request for a LIBOR Rate Loan or a conversion to
or continuation thereof, (i) the Administrative Agent determines that (A) Dollar
deposits are not being offered to banks in the London interbank market for the
applicable amount and Interest Period of such LIBOR Rate Loan, or (B) (x)
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the LIBOR Rate for
any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan or in
connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan and (y) the circumstances
described in Section 3.03(c)(i) do not apply (in each case with respect to this
clause (i), “Impacted Loans”), or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required
Lenders determine that for any reason the LIBOR Rate for any requested Interest
Period with respect to a proposed LIBOR Rate Loan does not adequately and fairly
reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such LIBOR Rate Loan, the
Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender.
Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate
Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans or
Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of

 

29



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the LIBOR
Rate component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the LIBOR Rate component in
determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the
Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Lenders
described in clause (ii) above, until the Administrative Agent upon instruction
of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or
continuation of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans
or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such
request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount
specified therein.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Administrative Agent has made the
determination described in clause (i) of Section 3.03(a), the Administrative
Agent, in consultation with the Borrower and the Required Lenders, may establish
an alternative interest rate for the Impacted Loans, in which case, such
alternative rate of interest shall apply with respect to the Impacted Loans
until (i) the Administrative Agent revokes the notice delivered with respect to
the Impacted Loans under clause (i) of the first sentence of Section 3.03(a),
(ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders notify the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower that such alternative interest rate does not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding the Impacted Loans, or
(iii) any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any
Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for such Lender or its
applicable Lending Office to make, maintain or fund Loans whose interest is
determined by reference to such alternative rate of interest or to determine or
charge interest rates based upon such rate or any Governmental Authority has
imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to do any of the
foregoing and provides the Administrative Agent and the Borrower written notice
thereof.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan
Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or the Required Lenders
notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a
copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or the Required Lenders (as applicable)
have determined, that:

(i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBOR Rate
for any requested Interest Period or any other tenors of the LIBOR Rate,
including, without limitation, because the LIBOR Screen Rate is not available or
published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be
temporary; or

(ii) the administrator of the LIBOR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority
having jurisdiction over such administrator has made a public statement
announcing that all Interest Periods and other tenors of the LIBOR Rate are no
longer representative; or

(iii) the administrator of the LIBOR Screen Rate or a Governmental Authority
having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or such administrator has made
a public statement identifying a specific date after which the LIBOR Rate or the
LIBOR Screen Rate shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the
interest rate of loans, provided that, at the time of such statement, there is
no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent,
that will continue to provide the LIBOR Rate after such specific date (such
specific date, the “Scheduled Unavailability Date”); or

 

30



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(iv) syndicated loans currently being executed, or that include language similar
to that contained in this Section 3.03, are being executed or amended (as
applicable) to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace the
LIBOR Rate, then, in the case of clauses (i)-(iii) above, on a date and time
determined by the Administrative Agent (any such date, the “LIBOR Replacement
Date”), which date shall be at the end of an Interest Period or on the relevant
interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and shall occur
reasonably promptly upon the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances
under clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above and, solely with respect to clause
(ii) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, the LIBOR Rate will
be replaced hereunder and under any Loan Document with, subject to the proviso
below, the first available alternative set forth in the order below for any
payment period for interest calculated that can be determined by the
Administrative Agent, in each case, without any amendment to, or further action
or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document (the
“LIBOR Successor Rate”; and any such rate before giving effect to the Related
Adjustment, the “Pre-Adjustment Successor Rate”):

(x) Term SOFR plus the Related Adjustment; and

(y) SOFR plus the Related Adjustment;

and, in the case of clause (iv) above, the Borrower and Administrative Agent may
amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing the LIBOR Rate under
this Agreement and under any other Loan Document in accordance with the
definition of “LIBOR Successor Rate” and such amendment will become effective at
5:00 p.m., on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall
have notified all Lenders and the Borrower of the occurrence of the
circumstances described in clause (iv) above unless, prior to such time, Lenders
comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent
written notice that such Required Lenders object to the implementation of a
LIBOR Successor Rate pursuant to such clause;

provided that, if the Administrative Agent determines that Term SOFR has become
available, is administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent and would
have been identified as the Pre-Adjustment Successor Rate in accordance with the
foregoing if it had been so available at the time that the LIBOR Successor Rate
then in effect was so identified, and the Administrative Agent notifies the
Borrower and each Lender of such availability, then from and after the beginning
of the Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period for
interest calculated, in each case, commencing no less than thirty (30) days
after the date of such notice, the Pre-Adjustment LIBOR Successor Rate shall be
Term SOFR and the LIBOR Successor Rate shall be Term SOFR plus the relevant
Related Adjustment.

The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the
Borrower and each Lender of (x) any occurrence of any of the events, periods or
circumstances under clauses (i) through (iii) above, (y) a LIBOR Replacement
Date and (z) the LIBOR Successor Rate.

Any LIBOR Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market
practice; provided that, to the extent such market practice is not
administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such LIBOR Successor
Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the
Administrative Agent.

Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any LIBOR Successor Rate as
so determined would otherwise be less than zero, the LIBOR Successor Rate will
be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.

In connection with the implementation of a LIBOR Successor Rate, the
Administrative Agent will have the right to make LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming
Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such LIBOR Successor
Rate Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or
consent of any other party to this Agreement; provided that, with respect to any
such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment
implementing such LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes to the Borrower and
the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.

 

31



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the events or circumstances of the type described in Section 3.03(c)(i)-(iii)
have occurred with respect to the LIBOR Successor Rate then in effect, then the
successor rate thereto shall be determined in accordance with the definition of
“LIBOR Successor Rate.”

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) after any such
determination by the Administrative Agent or receipt by the Administrative Agent
of any such notice described under Section 3.03(c)(i)-(iii), as applicable, if
the Administrative Agent determines that none of the LIBOR Successor Rates is
available on or prior to the LIBOR Replacement Date, (ii) if the events or
circumstances described in Section 3.03(c)(iv) have occurred but none of the
LIBOR Successor Rates is available, or (iii) if the events or circumstances of
the type described in Section 3.03(c)(i)-(iii) have occurred with respect to the
LIBOR Successor Rate then in effect and the Administrative Agent determines that
none of the LIBOR Successor Rates is available, then in each case, the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the
purpose of replacing the LIBOR Rate or any then current LIBOR Successor Rate at
the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or payment period
for interest calculated, as applicable, in accordance with this Section 3.03
with another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving
or then existing convention for similar Dollar denominated syndicated credit
facilities for such alternative benchmarks and, in each case, including any
Related Adjustments and any other mathematical or other adjustments to such
benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention
for similar Dollar denominated syndicated credit facilities for such benchmarks,
which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on
an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time
in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated. For the avoidance
of doubt, any such proposed rate and adjustments shall constitute a LIBOR
Successor Rate. Any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the
fifth (5th) Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such
proposed amendment to all Lenders and the Borrower unless, prior to such time,
Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative
Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.

(e) If, at the end of any Interest Period, relevant interest payment date or
payment period for interest calculated, no LIBOR Successor Rate has been
determined in accordance with clauses (c) or (d) of this Section 3.03 and the
circumstances under clauses (c)(i) or (c)(iii) above exist or the Scheduled
Unavailability Date has occurred (as applicable), the Administrative Agent will
promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation
of the Lenders to make or maintain LIBOR Rate Loans shall be suspended (to the
extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans, Interest Periods, interest payment
dates or payment periods), and (y) the LIBOR Rate component shall no longer be
utilized in determining the Base Rate, until the LIBOR Successor Rate has been
determined in accordance with clauses (c) or (d). Upon receipt of such notice,
the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a conversion to or continuation
of LIBOR Rate Loans (to the extent of the affected LIBOR Rate Loans, Interest
Periods, interest payment dates or payment periods) or, failing that, will be
deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base
Rate Loans (subject to the foregoing clause (y)) in the amount specified
therein.

For purposes hereof:

“ISDA Definitions” means the 2006 ISDA Definitions published by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. or any successor thereto,
as amended or supplemented from time to time, or any successor definitional
booklet for interest rate derivatives published from time to time by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. or such successor thereto.

“LIBOR Successor Rate Conforming Changes” means, with respect to any proposed
LIBOR Successor Rate, any conforming changes to the definition of Base Rate,
Interest Period, timing and frequency of determining rates and making payments
of interest and other technical, administrative or operational matters
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the definition of Business Day, timing
of borrowing requests or prepayment, conversion or continuation notices and
length of lookback periods) as may be appropriate, in the discretion of the
Administrative Agent, to reflect the adoption and implementation of such LIBOR
Successor Rate and to permit the administration thereof by the Administrative
Agent in a manner substantially consistent with market practice (or, if the
Administrative Agent determines that adoption of any portion of such market
practice is not administratively feasible or that no market practice for the
administration of such LIBOR Successor Rate exists, in such other manner of
administration as the Administrative Agent determines is reasonably necessary in
connection with the administration of this Agreement and any other Loan
Document).

adjustment, that has been selected or recommended by the Relevant Governmental
Body for the relevant Pre-Adjustment Successor Rate (taking into account the
interest period, interest payment date or payment period for interest calculated
and/or tenor thereto) and which adjustment or method (x) is published on an
information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in
its reasonable discretion or (y) solely with respect to Term SOFR, if not
currently published, which was previously so recommended for Term SOFR and
published on an information service acceptable to the Administrative Agent; or

(B) the spread adjustment that would apply (or has previously been applied) to
the fallback rate for a derivative transaction referencing the ISDA Definitions
(taking into account the interest period, interest payment date or payment
period for interest calculated and/or tenor thereto).

“Relevant Governmental Body” means the FRB and/or the Federal Reserve Bank of
New York, or a committee officially endorsed or convened by the FRB and/or the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

“SOFR” with respect to any Business Day, means the secured overnight financing

selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable
discretion.

3.04 Increased Cost and Reduced Return; Capital Adequacy; Reserves on LIBOR Rate
Loans.

(a) If the Administrative Agent or any Lender reasonably determines (which
determination shall be made in good faith (and not on an arbitrary or capricious
basis) and consistent with similarly situated customers of the applicable Lender
or the Administrative Agent under agreements having provisions similar to this
Section 3.04 after consideration of such factors as such Lender or the
Administrative Agent then reasonably determines to be relevant) that as a result
of any Change in Law there shall be any increase in the cost to such Lender of
agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining Loans or (as the case may
be), or a reduction in the amount received or receivable by such Lender in
connection with any of the foregoing including, without limitation, as a result
of the Administrative Agent or such Lender becoming subject to any taxes,
duties, levies, imposts, deductions, assessments, fees, reserves, special
deposits, liquidity or similar requirements (including any compulsory loan
requirement, insurance charge or other assessment), withholdings or similar
charges and liabilities on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit,
commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities
or capital attributable thereto (excluding for purposes of this subsection
(a) any such increased costs or reduction in amount resulting from (v) any taxes
described in clauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (vi) and (vii) of Section 3.01(a), (w)
any taxes imposed by FATCA (including taxes on any passthru payments made by the
Borrower, the Administrative Agent, any Lender, any Participant or any of their
respective successors or assigns), (x) Taxes imposed on payments hereunder or
Other Taxes (as to which Section 3.01 shall govern), (y) changes in the basis of
taxation of overall net income or overall gross income by the United States or
any foreign jurisdiction or any political subdivision of either thereof under
the Laws of which such Lender is organized or has its Lending Office or is
otherwise treated as doing business in such jurisdiction and (z) reserve
requirements contemplated by Section 3.04(f)), then from time to time upon
demand of the Administrative Agent or such Lender (with a copy of such demand to
the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent or
such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate the Administrative Agent
or such Lender for such increased cost or reduction.

(b) If any Lender reasonably determines (which determination shall be made in
good faith (and not on an arbitrary or capricious basis) and consistent with
similarly situated customers of the applicable Lender under agreements having
provisions similar to this Section 3.04 after consideration of such factors as
such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant) that any Change in Law
regarding capital adequacy or liquidity, or compliance by such Lender (or its
Lending Office) therewith, has the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
capital of such Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender as a
consequence of such Lender’s obligations hereunder (taking into consideration
its policies with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity and such Lender’s
desired return on capital), then from time to time upon demand of such Lender
(with a copy of such demand to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower shall pay
to such Lender such additional amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
reduction.

(c) If any Lender requests compensation by the Borrower under the foregoing
provisions of this Section 3.04, the Borrower may, by notice to such Lender
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such Lender
to make or continue Loans of the Type with respect to which such compensation is
requested, or to convert Loans of any other Type into Loans of such Type, until
the event or condition giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect;
provided, such suspension shall not affect the right of such Lender to receive
the compensation so requested.

 

34



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant
to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.04 shall not constitute a waiver
of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Borrower
shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 3.04 for any increased costs or reductions incurred
more than 60 days prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of
the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such
Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor; provided, further, that, if
the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is
retroactive, then the 60-day period referred to above shall be extended to
include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

(e) Each Lender agrees to designate a different Lending Office if such
designation will avoid the need for compensation under this Section 3.04 and
will not, in the good faith judgment of such Lender, otherwise be materially
disadvantageous to such Lender.

(f) The Borrower shall, to the extent not provided for in the calculation of the
LIBOR Rate, pay to each Lender, (i) as long as such Lender shall be required to
maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or
including Eurocurrency funds or deposits (currently known as “Eurocurrency
liabilities”), additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each LIBOR
Rate Loan equal to the actual costs of such reserves allocated to such Loan by
such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination
shall be conclusive), and (ii) as long as such Lender shall be required to
comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any other
central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the
maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the LIBOR Rate Loans, such
additional costs (expressed as a percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if
necessary, to the nearest five decimal places) equal to the actual costs
allocated to such Commitment or Loan by such Lender (as determined by such
Lender in good faith, which determination shall be conclusive), which in each
case shall be due and payable on each date on which interest is payable on such
Loan; provided the Borrower shall have received at least 10 days’ prior notice
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional interest or costs
from such Lender. If a Lender fails to give notice 10 days prior to the relevant
Interest Payment Date, such additional interest or costs shall be due and
payable 10 days from receipt of such notice.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.04 to the contrary, no Lender
shall receive compensation pursuant to this Section 3.04, unless such Lender is
generally seeking compensation from other borrowers in the United States loan
market with respect to similarly affected loans under agreements with such
borrowers having provisions similar to this Section 3.04. Any demand for
increased amounts pursuant to Section 3.04(a) or (b) shall be deemed a
representation as to the foregoing.

3.05 Funding Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) from time to time, the Borrower shall promptly compensate
such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense
reasonably incurred by it as a result of:

(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any LIBOR Rate Loan
on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether
voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);

(b) any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such
Lender to make a Loan) to repay, prepay, borrow, continue or convert any LIBOR
Rate Loan on the date required hereunder or the date or in the amount specified
in a notice given by the Borrower; or;

(c) the assignment of any LIBOR Rate Loan other than on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 10.16; including any loss or expense arising from the
liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or
from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained.

 

35



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Lenders under
this Section 3.05, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each LIBOR Rate
Loan made by it at the rate used in determining the LIBOR Rate for such Loan by
a matching deposit or other Borrowing in the London interbank market for a
comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such LIBOR Rate
Loan was in fact so funded.

3.06 Survival. All of the Borrower’s obligations under Sections 3.01, 3.02 and
3.04 shall survive termination of the Aggregate Commitments, repayment,
satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations hereunder, resignation or
replacement of the Administrative Agent and any assignment of rights by, or the
replacement of, a Lender.

therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

inaccuracies, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely
to have a Material Adverse Effect; provided that with respect to projected
financial information, the Borrower represents only that such information was

(c) promptly such additional information regarding the business, financial or
corporate affairs of the Borrower or any Subsidiary as the Administrative Agent,
at the reasonable request of any Lender, may from time to time request; and

(d) promptly following any request therefor, provide information and
documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or any Lender for
purposes of compliance with applicable “know your customer” and
anti-money-laundering rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the
Patriot Act and the Beneficial Ownership Regulation.

Documents required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6.01(a) or (b) or
Section 6.02(b) may be delivered electronically and if so delivered, shall be
deemed to have been delivered on the earlier of the date (i) on which the
Borrower posts such documents, or provides a link thereto on the Borrower’s
website on the Internet at the website address listed on Schedule 10.02; (ii) on
which such documents are posted to the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov) or (iii) on
which such documents are posted on the Borrower’s behalf on
IntraLinks/IntraAgency or any other Internet or intranet website, if any, to
which each Lender and the Administrative Agent have access (whether a
commercial, third-party website or whether sponsored by the Administrative
Agent); provided that, in the case of documents required to be delivered
pursuant to Section 6.01(a) or (b), the Borrower shall deliver electronic copies
of such documents to the Administrative Agent if any Lender requests that the
Borrower deliver such copies until a request to cease delivering copies is given

it or maintaining its copies of such documents.

The Borrower hereby acknowledges that (a) the Administrative Agent and/or an
Arranger will make available to the Lenders materials and/or information
provided by or on behalf of the Borrower hereunder (collectively, “Borrower
Materials”) by posting the Borrower Materials on IntraLinks, Syndtrak, ClearPar,
or a substantially similar electronic transmission system (the “Platform”) and
(b) certain of the Lenders (each, a “Public Lender”) may have personnel who do
not wish to receive material non-public information with respect to the Borrower
or its Affiliates, or the respective securities of any of the foregoing, and who
may be engaged in investment and other market-related activities with respect to
such Persons’ securities. The Borrower hereby agrees that (w) no Borrower
Materials shall be made available by the Administrative Agent or an Arranger to
Public Lenders unless the Borrower has clearly and conspicuously marked such
Borrower Materials “PUBLIC” which, at a minimum, shall mean that the word
“PUBLIC” shall appear prominently on the first page thereof; (x) by marking
Borrower Materials “PUBLIC,” the Borrower shall be deemed to have authorized the
Administrative Agent, the Arrangers and the Lenders to treat such Borrower
Materials as not containing any material non-public information with respect to
the Borrower or its securities for purposes of United States Federal and state
securities laws (provided, however, that to the extent such Borrower Materials
constitute Information, they shall be treated as set forth in Section 10.07);
(y) all Borrower Materials marked “PUBLIC” are permitted to be made available
through a portion of the Platform designated “Public Side Information;” and
(z) the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers shall be entitled to treat any
Borrower Materials that are not marked “PUBLIC” as being suitable only for
posting on a portion of the Platform not designated “Public Side Information.”

mark any Borrower Materials “PUBLIC.”

shall become delinquent or in default, except where (a) the validity or amount
thereof is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings, (b) the
Borrower or such Subsidiary has set aside on its books adequate reserves with
respect thereto in accordance with GAAP and (c) the failure to make payment

permit representatives and independent contractors of the Administrative Agent,
upon reasonable prior notice, at reasonable times and at reasonable intervals,
to visit and inspect any of its properties, to examine its corporate, financial

ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. It is understood and agreed

market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative
relationship between contracting parties.

any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person
serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity as a
Lender. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to,
own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory
capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or
any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the
Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the
Lenders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.03 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties
or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent:

(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties in connection
with the arranging and other services regarding this Agreement and the
administration of the Loan Documents and the transactions contemplated thereby,
regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing (it being
understood that, for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not apply with
respect to any transactions other than the transactions under this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, other
corporate transactions, other financial matters and custodial relationships
between the Person acting as Administrative Agent (and not in its capacity as
Administrative Agent), the Borrower or the Borrower’s Affiliates, and except as
otherwise agreed to in writing by such Persons);

(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any
discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly
contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent
is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for
herein or in the other Loan Documents); provided that the Administrative Agent
shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of
its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is
contrary to any Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of
doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor
Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of
property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and

(c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
disclose, any information relating to the Borrower or any of its Affiliates that
is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent
or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken
by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the
Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the
circumstances as provided in Sections 10.01 and 8.02) except, in each case for
this clause (i), to the extent of its gross negligence or willful misconduct or
(ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable
judgment. The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any
Default unless and until notice describing such Default is given to the
Administrative Agent by the Borrower or a Lender.

The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the
contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction
of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to
confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.

9.04 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any
written notice, request, certificate, consent,

 

51



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic
message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) reasonably
believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise
authenticated by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon
any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been
made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying
thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of
a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender, the
Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such
Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the
contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative
Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower),
independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be
liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of
any such counsel, accountants or experts.

9.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and all of
its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan
Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent or
Affiliate may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and
powers by or through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory
provisions of this Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and Affiliate and
to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent and
Affiliate, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities
as Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for
the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court
of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that
the Administrative Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in
the selection of such sub-agents.

9.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may at any
time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon
receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the
right, with the consent of the Borrower (so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with
an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office
in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the
Required Lenders with the consent of the Borrower (if required) and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent
gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the
Required Lenders and, to the extent the consent of the Borrower is required for
such appointment, the Borrower) (the “Resignation Effective Date”), then the
retiring Administrative Agent may on behalf of the Lenders appoint a successor
Administrative Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above; provided that
if the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Lenders that no
qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then such resignation shall
nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice and (1) the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (except that in the case of any
collateral security held by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Lenders
under any of the Loan Documents, the retiring Administrative Agent shall
continue to hold such collateral security until such time as a successor
Administrative Agent is appointed) and (2) except for any indemnity payments or
other amounts then owed to the retiring Administrative Agent, all payments,
communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the
Administrative Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender directly, until
such time as the Required Lenders, with the consent of the Borrower (so long as
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), appoint a successor
Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the acceptance
of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor
shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent (other than as
provided in Section 3.06 and other than any rights to indemnity payments or
other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent as of the
Resignation Effective Date), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the

 

52



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in
this Section). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative
Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise
agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring
Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents,
the provisions of this Article and Section 10.04 shall continue in effect for
the benefit of such retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent was acting as
Administrative Agent.

9.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each Lender
acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also
acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and
based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

9.08 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none
of the Arrangers or the Syndication Agent listed on the cover page hereof shall
have any powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as a Lender
hereunder. None of the Arrangers or the Syndication Agent listed on the cover
page hereof shall have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any
Lender.

9.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency of
any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding
relative to the Borrower, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the
principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by
declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent
shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by
intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest
owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are
owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or
advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative
Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their
respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 10.04) allowed in such judicial
proceeding; and

(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable
on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the
Administrative Agent under Sections 2.07 and 10.04.

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent
to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan
of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Obligations or the rights of any Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to
vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

ARTICLE X

MISCELLANEOUS

10.01 Amendments, Etc. Subject to Section 1.08, Section 3.03 and Section 6.12,
no amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, and no consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom, shall be
effective unless in a writing signed by the Required Lenders (or the
Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) and the Borrower,
and delivered to the Administrative Agent, and each such waiver or consent shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given; provided, however, that no such amendment, waiver or consent shall:

(a) waive any condition set forth in Section 4.01(d) or (e), without the written
consent of each Lender;

(b) extend or increase the Commitment of any Lender (or reinstate any Commitment
of any Lender terminated pursuant to Section 2.04 or 8.02(i)) without the
written consent of such Lender;

(c) extend or postpone any date fixed by this Agreement or any other Loan
Document for any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts due to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (including the Maturity Date)
or under any other Loan Document without the written consent of such Lender (or,
in the case of the Administrative Agent, such Person);

(d) reduce the principal of, or the rate of interest specified herein on, any
Loan owed to any Lender, or (subject to clause (iv) of the proviso below) any
fees or other amounts payable hereunder or under any other Loan Document to any
Lender without the written consent of such Lender; provided, however, that only
the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to amend the definition
of “Default Rate” or to waive any obligation of the Borrower to pay interest at
the Default Rate;

(e) change any provision of Section 1.08 or this Section or the definition of
“Required Lenders” or any other provision hereof specifying the number or
percentage of Lenders required to amend, waive or otherwise modify any rights
hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the
written consent of each Lender;

(f) amend Section 8.03 or the definition of “Applicable Percentage” in a manner
that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby or otherwise
under this Agreement without the written consent of each Lender; or

(g) amend Section 2.02(a) (solely with respect to funding procedures relating to
LIBOR Rate Loans);

and, provided, further, that (i) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless
in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the Required
Lenders or each directly-affected Lender, as the case may be, directly affect
the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document; and (ii) each Fee Letter may be amended, or rights or
privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed only by the respective
parties thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting
Lender shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms
requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with
the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except
that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or
extended nor

 

54



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the principal amount owed to such Lender reduced or the final maturity thereof
extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or
modification requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that
by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected
Lenders or any modification of this sentence shall require the consent of such
Defaulting Lender.

For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding any provision herein to the
contrary, this Agreement (including, without limitation, this Section 10.01) may
be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required
Lenders (or the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Required Lenders) and the
Borrower (i) to add one or more additional tranches of loans (including
additional revolving credit or term loan facilities) to this Agreement and to
permit the extensions of credit from time to time outstanding hereunder (or
under such amended and restated agreement) and the accrued interest and fees in
respect thereof to share ratably (or on a basis subordinated to the existing
facilities hereunder) in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents with the then-outstanding obligations of the Borrower hereunder, and
(ii) in connection with the foregoing, to include, as appropriate, the Lenders
providing such additional tranches of loans in any required vote or action
required to be approved by the Required Lenders or by any other number,
percentage or class of Lenders hereunder.

Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower acting together identify any ambiguity, omission,
mistake, typographical error or other defect in any provision of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document (including the schedules and exhibits thereto), then
the Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall be permitted to amend, modify or
supplement such provision to cure such ambiguity, omission, mistake,
typographical error or other defect, and such amendment shall become effective
without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.

10.02 Notices; Effectiveness; Electronic Communication.

(a) Notices Generally. Except in the case of notices and other communications
expressly permitted to be given by telephone (and except as provided in

mailed by certified or registered mail or sent by telecopier or electronic
communication as follows, and all notices and other communications expressly
permitted hereunder to be given by telephone shall be made to the applicable

Borrower).

Notices and other communications sent by hand or overnight courier service, or
mailed by certified or registered mail, shall be deemed to have been given when
received; notices and other communications sent by telecopier shall be deemed to
have been given when sent (except that, if not given during normal business
hours for the recipient, shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of
business on the next Business Day for the recipient). Notices and other
communications delivered through electronic communications to the extent
provided in subsection (b) below, shall be effective as provided in such
subsection (b).

 

55



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b) Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the Lenders
hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including
e-mail FpML messaging, and Internet or intranet websites) pursuant to the
procedures approved by the Administrative Agent and notified to the Borrower;
provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to
Article II if such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that it is
incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication.
Each of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower agrees to accept notices and
other communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to
procedures approved by it, provided that approval of such procedures may be
limited to particular notices or communications.

Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other
communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the
sender’s receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by
the “return receipt requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other
written acknowledgement), and (ii) notices or communications posted to an
Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the deemed receipt by
the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in the foregoing
clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is available and
identifying the website address therefor; provided that, for both clauses
(i) and (ii), if such notice, email or other communication is not sent during
the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice, email or communication
shall be deemed to have been sent at the opening of business on the next
business day for the recipient.

(c) The Platform. THE PLATFORM IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” THE AGENT
PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE
BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM
LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD
PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT
PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event
shall the Administrative Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the
“Agent Parties”) have any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other
Person for losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether
in tort, contract or otherwise) arising out of the Borrower’s or the
Administrative Agent’s transmission of Borrower Materials or notices through the
Platform, any other electronic platform or electronic messaging service, or
through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by a
final judgment, with respect to which all appeals have been exhausted or
abandoned, to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
such Agent Party; provided, however, that in no event shall any Agent Party have
any liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other Person for indirect,
special, incidental, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or
actual damages).

(d) Change of Address, Etc. Each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent
may change its address, telecopier, e-mail address or telephone number for
notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the other parties
hereto. Each other Lender may change its address, telecopier, e-mail address or
telephone number for notices and other communications hereunder by notice to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent. In addition, each Lender agrees to notify
the Administrative Agent from time to time to ensure that the Administrative
Agent has on record (i) an effective address, contact name, telephone number,
telecopier number and e-mail address to which notices and other communications
may be sent and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such Lender. Furthermore,
each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on behalf of
such Public Lender to at all times have selected the “Private Side Information”
or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the Platform in
order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance with such
Public Lender’s compliance procedures and applicable Law, including United
States Federal and state

 

56



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

securities Laws, to make reference to Borrower Materials that are not made
available through the “Public Side Information” portion of the Platform and that
may contain material non-public information with respect to the Borrower or its
securities for purposes of United States Federal or state securities laws.

(e) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative Agent and
the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices (including
telephonic notices and Loan Notices) purportedly given by the Borrower even if
(i) such notices were not made in a manner specified herein, were incomplete or
were not preceded or followed by any other form of notice specified herein, or
(ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the recipient, varied from any
confirmation thereof. The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent,
each Lender and the Related Parties of each of them from all losses, costs,
expenses and liabilities resulting from the reliance by such Person on each
notice purportedly given by the Borrower. All telephonic notices to and other
telephonic communications with the Administrative Agent may be recorded by the
Administrative Agent, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents to such
recording.

10.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies; Enforcement. No failure by any Lender or
the Administrative Agent to exercise, and no delay by any such Person in
exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive
of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges provided by law.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan
Document, the authority to enforce rights and remedies hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents against the Borrower shall be vested exclusively in, and
all actions and proceedings at law in connection with such enforcement shall be
instituted and maintained exclusively by, the Administrative Agent in accordance
with Section 8.02 for the benefit of all the Lenders; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not prohibit (a) the Administrative Agent from exercising on
its own behalf the rights and remedies that inure to its benefit (solely in its
capacity as Administrative Agent) hereunder and under the other Loan Documents,
(b) any Lender from exercising set-off rights in accordance with Section 10.08
(subject to the terms of Section 2.11) or (c) any Lender from filing proofs of
claim or appearing and filing pleadings on its own behalf during the pendency of
a proceeding relative to the Borrower under any Debtor Relief Law; and provided,
further, that if at any time there is no Person acting as Administrative Agent
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, then (i) the Required Lenders
shall collectively have the rights otherwise ascribed to the Administrative
Agent pursuant to Section 8.02 and (ii) in addition to the matters set forth in
clauses (b) and (c) of the preceding proviso and subject to Section 2.11, any
Lender may, with the consent of the Required Lenders, enforce any rights and
remedies available to it and as authorized by the Required Lenders.

10.04 Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.

(a) Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall pay (i) all reasonable and documented
out of pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates
(including the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of
counsel for the Administrative Agent), in connection with the preparation,
negotiation, execution, delivery and administration (including, without
limitation, the exercise of the Administrative Agent’s rights under
Section 6.10) of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments,
modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof to the extent
requested by the Borrower (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby shall be consummated) and (ii) all reasonable and documented out of
pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Lender (including
the reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for
the Administrative Agent or any Lender), if an Event of Default exists, in
connection with the enforcement of its rights or remedies (A) under this
Agreement and the other

 

57



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Loan Documents, including its rights under this Section or (B) in connection
with the Loans made hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the costs and
expenses of counsel required to be paid by the Borrower in connection with the
preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and
occurring on or before the Closing Date shall be limited as set forth in the
applicable Fee Letter. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions on this Section 10.04(a), no payment shall be required for
costs and expenses that are taxes, duties, levies, imposts, deductions,
assessments, fees or similar charges or liabilities with respect thereto other
than amounts that represent losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related
expenses arising from any claim other than for taxes, duties, levies, imposts,
deductions, assessments, fees or similar charges or liabilities with respect
thereto.

(b) Indemnification by the Borrower. The Borrower shall indemnify the
Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and each Lender, and each
Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
“Indemnitee”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses (including the
reasonable and documented fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any
Indemnitee), incurred by any Indemnitee or asserted against any Indemnitee by
any third party or by the Borrower arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the
performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or
thereunder, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
or, in the case of the Administrative Agent (and any sub-agent thereof) and its
Related Parties only, the administration of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents (including in respect of any amounts required to be paid by the
Borrower pursuant to Section 3.01), (ii) any Loan or the use or proposed use of
the proceeds therefrom, or (iii) any actual or prospective claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on
contract, tort or any other theory, whether brought by a third party or by the
Borrower, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto, IN ALL
CASES, WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY OR ARISING, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, OUT OF THE
COMPARATIVE, CONTRIBUTORY OR SOLE NEGLIGENCE OF THE INDEMNITEE; provided that
such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses (x) are determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment, with respect to which
all appeals have been exhausted or abandoned, to have resulted from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee, (y) result from a claim
brought by the Borrower against an Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such
Indemnitee’s obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document, if the
Borrower has obtained a final judgment, with respect to which all appeals have
been exhausted or abandoned, in its favor on such claim as determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction or (z) result from any dispute solely among
Indemnitees (not arising as a result of any act or omission by the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries) other than claims against the Administrative Agent, the
Syndication Agent or any Arranger in its capacity as, or in fulfilling its role
as, the Administrative Agent, the Syndication Agent or an Arranger or any
similar role under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 10.04(b), no indemnity
shall be available to any Indemnitee to the extent that any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related expenses are taxes, duties, levies, imposts,
deductions, assessments, fees or similar charges, or liabilities with respect
thereto (collectively, “Applicable Taxes”) other than any Applicable Taxes that
represent losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses arising from
any non-Applicable Tax claim.

(c) Reimbursement by Lenders. To the extent that the Borrower for any reason
fails to indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) or (b) of
this Section to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent
thereof) or any Related Party of any of the foregoing, each Lender severally
agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) or such
Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage
(determined as of the time that the

 

58



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid
amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim,
damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or
asserted against the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in its
capacity as such, or against any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting
for the Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in connection with such
capacity. The obligations of the Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject
to the provisions of Section 2.10(d).

(d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. The Borrower agrees that no Indemnitee
shall have any liability (whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or
otherwise) to it or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or to its or their respective
equity holders or creditors arising out of, or related to or in connection with
any aspect of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or
instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof, except to the extent of
direct, as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or punitive, damages
determined in a final judgment, with respect to which all appeals have been
exhausted or abandoned, by a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted
from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or any of its
officers, directors, employees, agents or advisors or such Indemnitee’s breach
in bad faith of its obligations under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents. No Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for
any damages arising from the use by unintended recipients of any information or
other materials distributed to such unintended recipients by such Indemnitee
through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems
in connection with this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby other than for direct or actual
damages resulting from (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnitee or its Related Parties as determined by a final judgment, with
respect to which all appeals have been exhausted or abandoned, by a court of
competent jurisdiction or (ii) a claim brought by the Borrower against such
Indemnitee for breach in bad faith of such Indemnitee’s obligations hereunder or
under any other Loan Document, if the Borrower has obtained a final judgment,
with respect to which all appeals have been exhausted or abandoned, in its favor
on such claim as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction.

(e) Payments. All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than
ten Business Days after demand therefor.

(f) Survival. The agreements in this Section 10.04 shall survive the resignation
of the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of
the Aggregate Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all
the other Obligations.

10.05 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of the
Borrower is made to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, or the
Administrative Agent or any Lender exercises its right of set-off, and such
payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof is subsequently
invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Administrative Agent
or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or
otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part
thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had
not occurred, and (b) each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so
recovered from or repaid by the Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from
the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum
equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, in the
applicable currency of such recovery or payment. The obligations of the Lenders
under clause (b) of the preceding sentence shall survive the payment in full of
the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

10.06 Successors and Assigns.

(a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that the Borrower may not assign
or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender (except that
the Borrower may effect or enter into transactions not prohibited by
Section 7.03) and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights
or obligations hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the
provisions of subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in
accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section, or (iii) by
way of pledge or assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions
of subsection (f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or
transfer by any party hereto shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement,
expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than
the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby,
Participants to the extent provided in subsection (d) of this Section and, to
the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or
claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

(b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more
assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to
it); provided that any such assignment shall be subject to the following
conditions:

(i) Minimum Amounts.

(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an
assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum
amount need be assigned; and

(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the
aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans
outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the
principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to
each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption
with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if
“Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade
Date, shall not be less than $5,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent
and, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Borrower
otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members of an
Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a
single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee
Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining
whether such minimum amount has been met.

(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an
assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and
obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment
assigned.

(iii) Required Consents.

(A) the consent of the Borrower (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, it being understood that the Borrower may withhold its approval if it
reasonably believes that an assignment would result in the incurrence of
increased costs payable by

 

60



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the Borrower under this Agreement) shall be required unless (1) an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or
(2) such assignment is to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved
Fund; provided that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to any such
assignment unless it shall object thereto by written notice to the
Administrative Agent within five (5) Business Days after having received notice
thereof; and

(B) the consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to a Person that is
not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund with respect to
such Lender.

(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with
a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however,
that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such
processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment; and provided,
further, that the Borrower shall not in any event be required to pay any portion
of such fee unless the Borrower requests that a Lender be replaced pursuant to
the provisions of Section 10.16. The assignee, if it is not a Lender, shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

(v) No Assignment to Certain Persons. No such assignment shall be made (A) to
the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries, or (B) to any
Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a
Lender hereunder, would constitute any of the foregoing Persons described in
this clause (B), or (C) to a natural person (or to a holding company, investment
vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural
Person).

(vi) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights
and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be
effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set
forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments
to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution
thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee
of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including
funding, at the request of the Borrower, the applicable pro rata share of Loans
previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which
the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and
satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to
the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon)
and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans
in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender
hereunder shall become effective under applicable Law without compliance with
the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be
deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such
compliance occurs.

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant
to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to
this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease

 

61



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.01, 3.04, 3.05, and 10.04 with respect to facts and circumstances
occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment; provided that, except
to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no assignment
by a Defaulting Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any
party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender. Upon
request, the Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and deliver a Note to the
assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations
under this Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated
for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in
such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (d) of this Section.

(c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a
non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax
purposes), shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office a copy of each
Assignment and Assumption delivered to it (or the equivalent thereof in
electronic form) and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses
of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated
interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from
time to time (the “Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive
absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant
to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement,
notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice. This Section 10.06(c) shall be construed
so that all Loans are at all times maintained in “registered form” within the
meaning of Section 163(f), 871(h)(2), and 881(c)(2) of the Code and Sections
5f.103-1(c) and 1.871-14 of the United States Treasury Regulations.

(d) Participations. Any Lender may at any time, without the consent of, or
notice to, the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any
Person (other than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or
trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of a natural Person, a
Defaulting Lender or the Borrower or any of the Borrower’s Affiliates or
Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s
rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of
its Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Lender’s
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations, (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement and (iv) such Lender
shall remain the holder of its Loans and owner of its interest in this Agreement
for all purposes hereunder.

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 10.01 that directly affects such Participant. Subject to subsection
(e) of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be (without
duplication of amounts paid to a participating Lender) entitled to the benefits
of Sections 3.01, 3.04 and 3.05 (subject to the requirements and limitations
with respect thereto) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired
its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section; provided
that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections
3.04 and 10.16 as if it were an assignee under paragraph (b) of this Section and
(B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 3.01 or
3.04, with respect to any participation, than the Lender from whom it acquired
the applicable participation would have been entitled to receive, except to the
extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment which (i) would accrue to
such Participant if it were deemed to be a “Lender” under Sections 3.01 or 3.04
(and subject to the requirements and limitations with respect thereto)

 

62



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and (ii) results from a Change in Law for which a Participant would be entitled
to compensation under Sections 3.01 or 3.04 (in accordance with the immediately
preceding clause (i)) that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable
participation. Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrower’s
request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to
effectuate the provisions of Section 3.04 with respect to any Participant. To
the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
benefits of Section 10.08 as though it were a Lender; provided such Participant
agrees to be subject to Section 2.11 as though it were a Lender. Each Lender
that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a
non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower (and such agency being solely for tax
purposes), maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each
Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each
Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan
Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Lender shall have any
obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including
the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s
interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under any Loan
Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary
to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is in registered
form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations. The
entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error,
and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the
Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this
Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall
have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. This
Section 10.06(d) shall be construed so that all Loans are at all times
maintained in “registered form” within the meaning of Section 163(f), 871(h)(2),
and 881(c)(2) of the Code and Sections 5f.103-1(c) and 1.871-14 of the United
States Treasury Regulations.

(e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant that would be a Foreign
Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.01
unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant
and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with
Section 10.15 as though it were a Lender.

(f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including
under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other
central banking authority; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall
release such Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such
pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

10.07 Treatment of Certain Information; Confidentiality. Each of the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders agrees to maintain the confidentiality of
the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed
(a) on a confidential, need-to-know basis, to its Affiliates and to its and its
Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants,
legal counsel and other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom
such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such
Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the
extent required or requested by any regulatory authority purporting to have
jurisdiction over it (including any self-regulatory authority, such as the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by
applicable Laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process,
(d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in connection with the exercise of
any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the
enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement
containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to
(i) any Eligible Assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective Eligible
Assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to
any swap or derivative transaction (including, without limitation, credit
insurance providers) relating to the Borrower and its obligations, (g)

 

63



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

with the consent of the Borrower, or (h) to the extent such Information
(x) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this
Section or (y) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any
of their respective Affiliates on a nonconfidential basis from a source other
than the Borrower. In addition, the Administrative Agent and the Lenders may
disclose the existence of this Agreement and information about this Agreement to
market data collectors, similar service providers to the lending industry, and
service providers to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders in connection with
the administration and management of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents,
the Commitments and the Borrowings. For purposes of this Section, “Information”
means all information received from the Borrower relating to the Borrower or any
of its businesses, other than any such information that is available to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis prior to
disclosure by the Borrower. Any Person required to maintain the confidentiality
of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied
with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of
care to maintain the confidentiality of such Information as such Person would
accord to its own confidential information.

Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders acknowledges that (a) the
Information may include material non-public information concerning the Borrower,
(b) it has developed compliance procedures regarding the use of material
non-public information and (c) it will handle such material non-public
information in accordance with applicable Law, including United States Federal
and state securities Laws.

10.08 Set-off. In addition to any other rights and remedies that such Lender may
have, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any
time and from time to time, without prior notice to the Borrower, any such
notice being waived by the Borrower, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special,
time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held and
other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing by such Lender to or
for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and all of the
obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document to such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan
Document and although such obligations of the Borrower may be contingent or
unmatured or are owed to a branch or office of such Lender different from the
branch or office holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness;
provided that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such
right of set-off hereunder, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over
immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance
with the provisions of Section 2.12 and, pending such payment, shall be
segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in
trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the
Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement
describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender
as to which it exercised such right of set-off. Each Lender agrees promptly to
notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such set-off and
application made by such Lender; provided, however, that the failure to give
such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

10.09 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in any Loan Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the
Loan Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest
permitted by applicable Law (the “Maximum Rate”). If the Administrative Agent or
any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate,
the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it
exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether
the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or
a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an
expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments
and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in
equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated
term of the Obligations.

 

64



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.10 Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be executed
in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts),
each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together
shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents,
and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the
Administrative Agent, constitute the entire contract among the parties relating
to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and
understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except
as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall
have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent
shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the
signatures of each of the other parties hereto. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy or other
electronic imaging means shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart of this Agreement.

10.11 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All representations and
warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith
shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof. Such
representations and warranties have been or will be relied upon by the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, regardless of any investigation made by
the Administrative Agent or any Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of
any Default or Event of Default at the time of any Borrowing, and shall survive
in full force and effect until payment in full of all Obligations (other than
indemnification and other contingent obligations).

10.12 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality,
validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or impaired thereby and (b) the
parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal,
invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of
which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular
jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any
other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
Section 10.12, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in
this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief
Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such
provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.

10.13 No advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all aspects of
each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with any
amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan Document),
the Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges its Affiliates’
understanding, that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services regarding this
Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Arrangers
are arm’s-length commercial transactions between the Borrower and its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Arrangers, on
the other hand, (B) the Borrower has consulted its own legal, accounting,
regulatory and tax advisors to the extent it has deemed appropriate, and (C) the
Borrower is capable of evaluating, and understands and accepts, the terms, risks
and conditions of the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan
Documents; (ii) (A) in connection with the arranging and other services
regarding this Agreement and the administration of the Loan Documents and the
transactions contemplated thereby, the Administrative Agent, each Lender and
each Arranger, as applicable, each is and has been acting solely as a principal
and has not been, is not and will not be acting as an advisor, agent or
fiduciary for the Borrower or any of its Affiliates or any other Person (it
being understood that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to any other
transactions, including, without limitation, other corporate transactions, other
financial matters and custodial relationships between such parties, and except

 

65



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

as otherwise agreed to by the relevant parties) and (B) neither the
Administrative Agent nor any Lender nor any Arranger has any obligation to the
Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby except those obligations expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents; and (iii) the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Arrangers and
their respective Affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that
involve interests that differ from those of the Borrower and its Affiliates, and
neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender nor any Arranger has any
obligation to disclose any of such interests to the Borrower or its Affiliates.
To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Borrower hereby waives and releases
any claims that it may have against the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and
the Arrangers with respect to any breach or alleged breach of agency or
fiduciary duty in connection with any aspect of any transaction contemplated
hereby except to the extent provided otherwise in clause (ii) above.

10.14 Electronic Execution of Assignments and Certain Other Documents. This
Agreement and any document, amendment, approval, consent, information, notice,
certificate, request, statement, disclosure or authorization related to this
Agreement (each a “Communication”), including Communications required to be in
writing, may be in the form of an Electronic Record and may be executed using
Electronic Signatures. The Borrower agrees that any Electronic Signature on or
associated with any Communication shall be valid and binding on the Borrower to
the same extent as a manual, original signature, and that any Communication
entered into by Electronic Signature, will constitute the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Borrower enforceable against such in accordance with
the terms thereof to the same extent as if a manually executed original
signature was delivered. Any Communication may be executed in as many
counterparts as necessary or convenient, including both paper and electronic
counterparts, but all such counterparts are one and the same Communication. For
the avoidance of doubt, the authorization under this paragraph may include,
without limitation, use or acceptance by the Administrative Agent and each of
the Lenders of a manually signed paper Communication which has been converted
into electronic form (such as scanned into PDF format), or an electronically
signed Communication converted into another format, for transmission, delivery
and/or retention. The Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders may, at its
option, create one or more copies of any Communication in the form of an imaged
Electronic Record (“Electronic Copy”), which shall be deemed created in the
ordinary course of the such Person’s business, and destroy the original paper
document. All Communications in the form of an Electronic Record, including an
Electronic Copy, shall be considered an original for all purposes, and shall
have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative
Agent is under no obligation to accept an Electronic Signature in any form or in
any format unless expressly agreed to by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
procedures approved by it; provided, further, without limiting the foregoing,
(a) to the extent the Administrative Agent has agreed to accept such Electronic
Signature, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to
rely on any such Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of the
Borrower without further verification and (b) upon the request of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly
followed by such manually executed counterpart. For purposes hereof, “Electronic
Record” and “Electronic Signature” shall have the meanings assigned to them,
respectively, by 15 USC §7006, as it may be amended from time to time.

10.15 Tax Forms.

(a) Any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of
withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies
as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but
only if such Foreign Lender is legally entitled to do so), whichever of the
following is applicable:

 

66



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E claiming
eligibility for exemption from United States Federal withholding tax under an
income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,

(ii) duly completed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI,

(iii) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for
portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate to the
effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of
section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower
within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled
foreign corporation” described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) duly
completed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN or IRS Form W-8BEN-E,

(iv) IRS Form W-8IMY and all required supporting documentation, or

(v) any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming
exemption from United States Federal withholding tax duly completed together
with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to
permit the Borrower to determine the withholding or deduction required to be
made.

Without limiting the obligations of the Lenders set forth above regarding
delivery of certain forms and documents to establish each Lender’s status for
U.S. withholding tax purposes, each Lender agrees promptly to deliver to the
Administrative Agent or the Borrower, as the Administrative Agent or the
Borrower shall reasonably request, on or prior to the Closing Date, and in a
timely fashion thereafter, such other documents and forms required by any
relevant taxing authorities under the Laws of any other jurisdiction, duly
executed and completed by such Lender to the extent that it may legally do so,
as are required under such Laws to confirm such Lender’s entitlement to any
available exemption from, or reduction of, applicable withholding taxes in
respect of all payments to be made to such Lender outside of the U.S. by the
Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such Lender’s
status for withholding tax purposes in such other jurisdiction.

(b) Upon the request of the Administrative Agent, each Lender that is a “United
States person” within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall
deliver to the Administrative Agent two duly signed completed copies of IRS Form
W-9. If such Lender fails to deliver such forms, then the Administrative Agent
may withhold from any interest payment to such Lender an amount equivalent to
the applicable back-up withholding tax imposed by the Code, without reduction.

(c) If a payment made to a Lender or a Participant under any Loan Document would
be subject to U.S. Federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were
to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including
those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such
Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or
times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the
Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable
Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such
additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative
Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such
Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine
the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this
Section 10.15(c), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the
date of this Agreement.

10.16 Replacement of Lenders. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04, or if the Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any
Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.01, or if any Lender gives notice under Section 3.02, or if any Lender
is a Restricted Lender (as defined below), or if any Lender is a Defaulting
Lender, or if any other circumstance exists hereunder that gives the Borrower
the right to replace a Lender as a party hereto, then the Borrower may, at its
sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative
Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in
accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents
required by, Section 10.06), all of its interests, rights and obligations under
this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall
assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender
accepts such assignment); provided that:

(a) the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee
specified in Section 10.06(b);

(b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to 100% of the
outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and
all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
(including any amounts under Section 3.05) from the assignee (to the extent of
such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in
the case of all other amounts);

(c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation
under Section 3.04 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.01,
such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments
thereafter;

(d) in the case of any such assignment by a Restricted Lender, the assignee must
have approved in writing the substance of the amendment, waiver or consent which
caused the assignor to be a Restricted Lender; and

(e) such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws.

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if,
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation
cease to apply. Each party hereto agrees that an assignment required pursuant to
this Section 10.16 may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption
executed by the Borrower and the assignee and acknowledged by the Administrative
Agent, and that the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party
thereto.

For the purposes of this Section 10.16, a “Restricted Lender” means a Lender
that fails to approve an amendment, waiver or consent requested by the Borrower
pursuant to Section 10.01 that has received the written approval of not less
than the Required Lenders but also requires the approval of such Lender.

Solely to the extent any Lender that is an Affected Financial Institution is a
party to this Agreement and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan

Powers of the Relevant Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and
acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:

10.22 Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs. To the extent that the Loan
Documents provide support, through a guarantee or otherwise, for any Swap
Contract or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “QFC
Credit Support”, and each such QFC, a “Supported QFC”), the parties acknowledge
and agree as follows with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the
regulations promulgated thereunder, the “U.S. Special Resolution Regimes”) in
respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below
applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in
fact be stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the
United States or any other state of the United States):

 

70



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(a) In the event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a
“Covered Party”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution
Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit
Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such
QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or
such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same
extent as the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution
Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest,
obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United
States or a state of the United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC
Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S.
Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might
otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be
exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater
extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special
Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by
the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without
limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that rights and
remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event
affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any
QFC Credit Support.

(b) As used in this Section 10.22, the following terms have the following
meanings:

“BHC Act Affiliate” of a party means an “affiliate” (as such term is defined
under, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 1841(k)) of such party.

“Covered Entity” means any of the following: (i) a “covered entity” as that term
is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 252.82(b); (ii) a
“covered bank” as that term is defined in, and interpreted in accordance with,
12 C.F.R. § 47.3(b); or (iii) a “covered FSI” as that term is defined in, and
interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. § 382.2(b).

“Default Right” has the meaning assigned to that term in, and shall be
interpreted in accordance with, 12 C.F.R. §§ 252.81, 47.2 or 382.1, as
applicable.

“QFC” has the meaning assigned to the term “qualified financial contract” in,
and shall be interpreted in accordance with, 12 U.S.C. 5390(c)(8)(D).
