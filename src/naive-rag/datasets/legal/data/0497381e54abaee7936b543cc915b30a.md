2.4 Non-Assignment of Assumed Contracts; Wrong Pockets; Objections to
Assignment; Identification of Assumed Contracts.


(a)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Assumed Contract which, after
giving effect to the provisions of Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and the
Sale Order, is not assignable or transferable without the consent of any Person,
other than the Sellers, any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or
Buyer, to the extent that such consent shall not have been given prior to the
Closing; provided, however, that (i) the Sellers shall use, whether before or
after the Closing, their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary
consents (each, a “Necessary Consent”) to the assignment and transfer thereof,
it being understood that, to the extent the foregoing shall require any action
by the Sellers that would, or would continue to, have an adverse effect on the
business of Buyer or any of its Affiliates after the Closing, such action shall
require the prior written consent of Buyer, and (ii) in the event that any
Assumed Contract is deemed not to be assigned pursuant to clause (i) of this
Section 2.4(a), the Sellers shall (A) use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain such Necessary Consents as promptly as practicable after the Closing and
(B) cooperate in good faith in any lawful and commercially reasonable
arrangement reasonably proposed by Buyer, including subcontracting, licensing or
sublicensing to Buyer any or all of any Seller’s rights and obligations with
respect to any such Assumed Contract, under which Buyer shall obtain (without
infringing upon the legal rights of such third party or violating any Law) the
economic rights and benefits under such Assumed Contract with respect to which
such Necessary Consent has not been obtained. Upon satisfying any requisite
consent requirement applicable to such Assumed Contract after the Closing, such
Assumed Contract shall promptly be transferred and assigned to Buyer in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and such transfer and assignment
shall be without any additional payment by Buyer. These commercially reasonable
efforts shall not require any material payment or other material consideration
from the Sellers or the Buyer (other than the Cure Costs), and any such consent
shall contain terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the Parties, and
nothing in this Section 2.4(a) or otherwise shall prevent any Seller that is a
Debtor from terminating, dissolving, liquidating, or winding up. For the
avoidance of doubt, the term “material” in the prior sentence means material in
the context of the relevant Assumed Contract.


(b)Subject to Section 2.4(a), if after the Closing (i) Buyer or any of its
Affiliates holds any Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities or (ii) any Seller
or any of their Affiliates holds any Acquired Assets or Assumed Liabilities,
Buyer or the applicable Seller, will promptly transfer (or cause to be
transferred) such assets or
13

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



assume (or cause to be assumed) such Liabilities to or from (as the case may be)
the other party. Prior to any such transfer, the party receiving or possessing
any such asset will hold it in trust for such other party.


(c)If the assumption and assignment of any Assumed Contract is objected to by
any Person, including any Contract counterparty, then Buyer and the applicable
Seller shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts to seek to
resolve such objection, including potentially the defense of any such assumption
and assignment in the Bankruptcy Court.


2.5 Assumption and Assignment of Contracts and Leases.


(a)Sellers shall assume and, to the extent assignable, assign the Material
Contracts listed on Schedule 2.5(a) to Buyer, effective on and as of the Closing

Contracts set forth on Schedule 2.5(a)(i), Buyer may at any time prior to five
(5) Business Days prior to the Sale Hearing, by written notice to Sellers, add
or remove Material Contracts from Schedule 2.5(a); provided further, that
Sellers shall not be required to assume and assign any (i) leases or other
Contracts for Vehicles or other equipment used by any Comcar Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, other than Sellers, or otherwise not Related to the Business, and
(ii) Contracts pursuant to which any goods or services are provided to any
Comcar Subsidiaries or Affiliates, other than Sellers, or otherwise not Related
to the Business.


(b)At the Closing, Sellers shall, pursuant to the Sale Order and the Bill of
Sale and Assignment and Assumption Agreement, sell, and assume and assign to
Buyer (the consideration for which is included in the Purchase Price), all
Assumed Contracts that may be assigned by any such Seller to Buyer pursuant to
Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, as applicable, subject to provision
by Buyer of adequate assurance as may be required under Section 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code and payment by Buyer of the Cure Costs in accordance with
Section 6.10 in respect of Assumed Contracts pursuant to and in accordance with
Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, as applicable, and the Sale Order. At the
Closing, Buyer shall assume, and thereafter in due course and in accordance with
its respective terms (as may be amended) pay, fully satisfy, discharge and
perform all of the obligations under each Assumed Contract that are Assumed
Liabilities, pursuant to Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, as applicable.


2.6 Rejection of Contracts. Until after the Closing, Sellers will not reject or
seek to reject any Contract of the Business, any Assumed Contract or any
Contract set forth on Schedule 2.6, in each case without Buyer’s prior written
consent (in its sole discretion).


2.7 Withholding. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
they reasonably determine that they are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code and any provision of state,
local or non-U.S. Tax Laws. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid
over to the applicable Tax Authorities, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person entitled to
receipt of such payment. Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate in good faith and
provide any executed documents or take any action, as reasonably requested, to
reduce or eliminate withholding with respect to any amounts payable pursuant to
this Agreement.


2.8 Abandoned Vehicles. Sellers reserve the right, in their reasonable
discretion, to abandon any Vehicles being repaired by a third party if the cost,
or estimated cost, of such repair exceeds the market value of such Vehicle.
Sellers shall notify Buyer in writing of any such abandoned Vehicles prior to
Closing. Any such abandoned Vehicles shall not be Acquired Assets.

Buyer or any Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Tax Authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation, and neither Buyer nor
any Seller shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Tax Authority challenging such Allocation. Buyer

period prior to the Closing Date, and Buyer shall be responsible for amounts
relating from the Closing Date. Property taxes on Acquired Assets will be

applicable
16

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

among other things, approval to conduct the Transactions as a private direct
sale to Buyers without an auction. The Sale Motion shall be served by Sellers’

reasonably requests in writing be served. Sellers shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to schedule a Sale Hearing on or before 30 days after the
Petition Date.


(c)Beginning with the Petition Date and continuing until the Closing, Sellers
shall cooperate and assist Buyer in the process of transitioning the Business

(d)Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to have the
Bankruptcy Court enter the Sale Order as promptly as practicable after the Sale
Hearing.


(e)Sellers shall consult with Buyer and its Representatives concerning the
approval of this Agreement, the Sale Order, any other Orders of the Bankruptcy
Court relating to the Transactions, and the bankruptcy proceedings in connection
therewith, and use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer with
copies of applications, pleadings, notices, proposed Orders and other documents
relating to such proceedings as soon as reasonably practicable prior to filing.
In furtherance of the foregoing, Sellers shall provide Buyer with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all material motions to be filed in the
Chapter 11 Cases that relate to the Transactions, to the extent practicable,
prior to their filing with the Bankruptcy Court.


(f)In the event reconsideration is sought, leave to appeal is sought, an appeal
is taken or a stay pending appeal is requested with respect to the Sale Order,
Sellers shall notify Buyer as promptly as practicable of such leave to appeal,
appeal or stay request and shall provide to Buyer as promptly as practicable a

25

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(g)From and after the date hereof, Sellers shall not take any action that is
intended to result in, or fail to take any action the intent of which failure to
act would result in, the reversal, voiding, modification or staying of the Sale
Order. Buyer has not colluded in connection with its offer or negation of this
Agreement. From and after the date hereof, Buyer shall not take any action that
is intended to result in, or fail to take any action the intent of which failure
to act would result in, the reversal, voiding, modification or staying of the
Sale Order or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.


(h)Buyer agrees that it will promptly take such actions as are reasonably
requested by Sellers to assist in obtaining entry of the Sale Order, including
furnishing affidavits or other documents or information for filing with the
Bankruptcy Court for the purposes, among others, of demonstrating that Buyer is
a “good faith” purchaser under section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code; provided,
however, in no event shall Buyer or Sellers be required to agree to any
amendment of this Agreement.


(i)Sellers further covenant and agree that, after the entry of the Sale Order,
the terms of any reorganization or liquidation plan Sellers submit to the
Bankruptcy Court, or any other court for confirmation or sanction, shall not be
intended to (or reasonably likely to) supersede, abrogate, nullify or restrict
the terms of this Agreement in any material respect, or prevent the consummation
or performance of the Transactions.


6.8 Exclusivity. Subject to Section 8.1(g) and Section 9.20, during the Interim
Period, Sellers shall not solicit or market the Business for sale, provided that
Buyers acknowledge and agree that Sellers will provide notice of the
Transactions to interested parties, but only to the extent such notice is
required by the Bankruptcy Code and applicable Bankruptcy Rules, and may engage
in discussions with such parties regarding the sale of the Business; provided
that before Sellers enter into any definitive agreement for an Alternative
Transaction in the exercise of its fiduciary obligations, Sellers shall give
Buyers a reasonable opportunity to make a higher, or otherwise better, offer for
the Business, as determined by Sellers in Sellers’ business judgment in the
exercise of their fiduciary obligations.


6.9 Break-Up Fee. Upon the consummation of any Alternative Transaction following
any such termination, Buyer shall be deemed to have earned the Break-Up Fee,
which shall be paid in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by Buyer, out of the proceeds of such Alternative
Transaction, without further order of the Bankruptcy Court, contemporaneously
with the consummation of such Alternative Transaction. The Break-Up Fee shall be
a super-priority administrative expense priority obligation under Section
364(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code with priority over all expenses of the kind
specified in Sections 503(b) and 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Sellers hereby
acknowledges that the obligation to pay the Break-Up Fee (to the extent due
hereunder) shall survive the termination of this Agreement and shall have
super-priority administrative status against Sellers and their estate.


6.10 Cure Costs. Sellers shall sell, transfer and assign all Assumed Contracts
to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and assume all Assumed Contracts from
Sellers, as of the Closing Date pursuant to sections 363 and 365 of the
Bankruptcy Code and the Sale Order. In connection with the assignment and
assumption of the Assumed Contracts, Buyer shall cure any monetary defaults
under the Assumed Contracts by payment of any Cure Costs as determined in
accordance with the Sale Order. Buyer shall be responsible for demonstrating and
establishing adequate assurance of future performance before the Bankruptcy
Court with respect to the Assumed Contracts.

(a)For a period of three (3) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide
to Sellers and their respective Affiliates and Representatives (after reasonable
notice and during normal business hours and without undue interference to the
business operations of Buyer, and at Sellers’ sole cost and expense) reasonable
access to, including the right to make copies of, all books and records included
in and otherwise related to the Acquired Assets, to the extent reasonably
necessary to permit Seller to determine any matter relating to its rights and
obligations hereunder or to any period ending on or before the Closing Date (for
example, for purposes of any Tax or accounting audit or any claim or litigation
matter, but not for any dispute or claim between Buyer and Sellers in connection
with this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or otherwise), for periods prior
to the Closing and shall preserve such books and records until the later of (i)
such period as shall be consistent with Buyer’s records retention policy in
effect from time to time, (ii) the retention period required by applicable Law,
(iii) the conclusion
26

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



of all bankruptcy proceedings relating to the Chapter 11 Cases, or (iv) such
three (3) period. Such access shall include access to any information in
electronic form to the extent reasonably available. Buyer acknowledges that
Sellers have the right to retain originals or copies of all of books and records
included in or related to the Acquired Assets for periods prior to the Closing.

Chapter 11 Cases (if occurring earlier), Sellers shall provide to Buyer (after
reasonable notice and during normal business hours and without undue
interference to the business operations of Sellers, and at Buyer’s sole cost and
expense) reasonable access to, including the right to make copies of, all books
and records related to the Acquired Assets but not transferred to Buyer as part
of the Closing, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Buyer to determine
any matter relating to its rights and obligations hereunder or to any period
ending on or after the Closing Date (for example, for purposes of any Tax or
accounting audit or any claim or litigation matter, but not for any dispute or
claim between Buyer and Sellers in connection with this Agreement, the
Transaction Documents or otherwise), for periods after the Closing. Such access
shall include access to any information in electronic form to the extent
reasonably available.


6.12 Notification of Certain Matters. Sellers will promptly notify Buyer of: (i)
any written notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including with respect to the transfer of
Personal Information); (ii) any written notice or other communication from any
Governmental Entity (other than the Chapter 11 Cases) related to or in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii)
promptly upon discovery thereof, any material variances from, or the existence
or occurrence of any event, fact or circumstance arising after the execution of
this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to cause any of the
representations and warranties contained in Article 4 to be untrue or inaccurate
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to cause the conditions set forth
in Section 7.1 not to be satisfied.


6.13 Confidentiality.


(a)Upon and for a period of one (1) year following the Closing (or indefinitely
in the case of trade secrets), Sellers shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates and Representatives to, keep confidential all
non-public information regarding the Acquired Assets, except for (i) such public
disclosure as Sellers and their counsel may reasonably determine to be required
under any applicable Law, regulation, stock exchange requirement or Order
(provided that Sellers will provide Buyer with prior written notice of any such
disclosure to the extent permitted by applicable Law and, where applicable and
reasonably requested by Buyer and at Buyer’s sole cost and expense, Sellers will
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer to obtain a
protective order or other confidential treatment or otherwise limit the scope of
information that is required to be disclosed, and Sellers shall only disclose
that portion of such information as Sellers is advised by its in counsel in
writing is required to be disclosed) and (ii) disclosure to its representatives
(including any prospective or actual financing sources, whether debt or equity)
solely to the extent that such parties need to know such information and agree
to be bound by confidentiality obligations no less protective than those set
forth in this Section 6.13(a). Sellers will be responsible for any breach of the
terms hereof by any of their respective Affiliates and representatives with
respect to any non-public information regarding the Acquired Assets to the same
degree as if such breach were made by Sellers.


(b)The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that that the Confidentiality
Agreement is enforceable in accordance with its terms, it being understood and
agreed, however, that such Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate
automatically effective as of the Closing.


6.14 Employees. Buyer shall make commercially reasonable efforts to offer
employment to all of the Employees. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Sellers a list of any Employees that Buyer
would like to make an offer of employment. Any such offer of employment will be
effective as of the Closing Date and contingent upon the Closing, and with
respect to each of the Employees who is then employed by Sellers or their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, Buyer shall make commercially reasonable
efforts to keep such employment at the same location, at the same base wage or
hourly rate, with employee benefits which are substantially comparable in the
aggregate and on the same terms and conditions of employment as in effect
27

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



immediately prior to the Closing. Buyer shall give drivers credit for years of
service with Sellers for purposes of determining compensation time under new
employment with Buyer.


6.15 No Solicitation.


(a)Unless consented to by Sellers in writing, during the Interim Period and the
one (1) year period thereafter, Buyer shall not, and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or any Representative thereof, to directly or
indirectly, hire or solicit (a) any employee of Seller or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, except for employees of CTL, or (b) any employee of Seller or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates providing Shared Services, (including any employee
who has terminated his or her employment); provided that nothing in this Section
6.15(a) shall prevent Buyer or any of its Affiliates from hiring (i) any person
whose employment has been terminated by a Seller or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates; or (ii) after 180 days from the date of termination of employment
with Seller or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any employee whose employment has
been terminated by the employee.


(b)Unless consented to by Buyer in writing, during the Interim Period and the
one (1) year period thereafter, Sellers shall not, and shall not permit any of
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, to directly or indirectly, hire or solicit (a)
any employee of Buyer or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including any employee
who has terminated his or her employment); provided that nothing in this Section
6.15(b) shall prevent Sellers or any of theirs Affiliates from hiring (i) any
person whose employment has been terminated by a Buyer or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates; or (ii) after 180 days from the date of termination of employment
with Buyer or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any employee whose employment has
been terminated by the employee.


6.16 Facility Leases. Concurrently with the Closing, the Parties shall enter
into leases for the Owned Real Property located in (a) St. Gabriel, Louisiana,

Closing, Buyer will enter into an agreement with Comcar for the rental of
parking spaces at a drop yard in Atlanta, Georgia, containing customary terms
and rental amount equal to the amount CTL is obligated to pay under its current
agreement for the spaces. Concurrently with the Closing, the Parties shall, to
the extent permitted by the master lease, enter into a sublease for the leased
facility located in Angleton, Texas, for 30 days and containing customary terms.
The Parties shall negotiate the definitive documents for the foregoing leases in
good faith.


6.17  Vehicle Titles, Plates and Permits. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
the Owned Vehicles will need to be re-titled and re-plated by Buyer following
the Closing and that in order for Buyer to conduct operations immediately upon
the Closing, it is necessary for Buyer to operate for a period of time with the
existing Vehicle registrations/license plates and associated fuel permits of the
Sellers. In furtherance of the foregoing, Sellers hereby authorizes Buyer to
utilize the existing Vehicle registrations/license plates and fuel permits of
Sellers for a period of up to ninety (90) days following the Closing; provided,
however, if Buyer is using commercially reasonable efforts to re-title, re-plate
and permit the Vehicles but cannot accomplish the same because of applicable
office shutdowns or slowdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, Buyer shall have
an additional reasonable period of time to re-title, re-plate and permit the
Vehicles.

ARTICLE 8
TERMINATION


8.1 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Transactions abandoned at any time prior to the Closing:


(a)by written agreement of Sellers and Buyer;


(b)by either Sellers or Buyer:


(i) if there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the Transactions
illegal or otherwise prohibited, or if any Order permanently restraining,
prohibiting or enjoining Buyer or Sellers from consummating the Transactions is
entered and such Order shall become final, provided, however, that no
termination may be made by a Party under this Section 8.1(b)(i) if the issuance
of such Order was caused by the material breach of any representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement by such Party;
or


(ii) upon Sellers consummating an Alternative Transaction.


(c)by Buyer by giving written notice to each Seller if there has been a breach
by any Seller of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement contained
in this Agreement that would prevent the satisfaction of the conditions to the
obligations of Buyer at Closing set forth in Section 7.1(a) and Section 7.1(b),
and such breach has not been waived by Buyer, or, if such breach is curable,
cured by such Seller prior to the earlier to occur of (A) twenty (20) days after
receipt of Buyer’s notice of such breach, and (B) the Outside Date; provided,
that Buyer shall not have a right of termination pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)
if Sellers could, at such time, terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1(f);


(d)by Buyer if Sellers consummate an Alternative Transaction;


(e)by Buyer or Sellers if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before the
Outside Date, provided, however that no termination may be made a Party under

agreements contained in this Agreement by such Party;


(f)by Sellers by giving written notice to Buyers if there has been a breach by
any Buyer of any representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement contained in
this Agreement that would prevent the satisfaction of the conditions to the
obligations of Sellers at Closing set forth in Section 7.2(a) and Section
7.2(b), and such breach has not been waived by Sellers, or, if such breach is
curable, cured by such Buyer prior to the earlier to occur of (A) twenty (20)
days after receipt of Sellers’ notice of such breach, and (B) the Outside Date;
30

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



provided, that Sellers shall not have a right of termination pursuant to this
Section 8.1(f) if Buyers could, at such time, terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.1(c); or


(g)by Sellers if the governing body of Sellers determines, upon advice from
outside legal counsel, that proceeding with the Transactions or failing to
terminate this Agreement would violate its or such governing body’s fiduciary
obligations under applicable Law, including to pursue an Alternative
Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, and subject to the terms and conditions

Termination) and Article 9 (Miscellaneous) and to the extent applicable in

Transactions shall be abandoned without further action or Liability of any of
the Parties hereto, except that such termination shall not relieve any Party of
any Liability for Fraud or willful breach of this Agreement; provided that,
subject to Sellers’ rights to seek specific performance in accordance with
Section 9.10(c), the sole remedy of any Seller against Buyer, any of its
Affiliates or any of its or their Representatives with respect to any breach of

that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the maximum Liability of
Sellers under this Agreement shall be payment of the Break-Up Fee to the extent
payable.

order of the Bankruptcy Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive
jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Agreement and to decide any Claims or
disputes which may arise or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement,
any breach or default hereunder, or the Transactions, and (ii) any and all
Proceedings related to the foregoing shall be filed and maintained only in the
Bankruptcy Court, and the Parties hereby consent to and submit to the

9.10 shall not apply to any Claims that Buyer or its Affiliates may have against
any third party following the Closing.


(b)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event the Chapter 11
Cases of Sellers are closed or dismissed, the Parties hereby agree that all
Claims or disputes which may arise or result from, or be connected with, this
Agreement, any breach or default hereunder, or the Transactions, shall be heard
and determined exclusively in any federal court sitting in the District of
Delaware or, if that court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in any
state court located in the City of Wilmington and County of New, Delaware (and,
in each case, any appellate court thereof), and the Parties hereby consent to
and submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.


(c)Buyer acknowledges that Sellers would be damaged irreparably in the event
that the terms of this Agreement are not performed by Buyer in accordance with
its specific terms or otherwise breached or Buyer fails to consummate the
Closing and that, in addition to any other remedy that Sellers may have under
law or equity, Sellers shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent
breaches of the terms of this Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof that are required to be performed by Buyer. Buyer
further agrees that Sellers shall not be required to obtain, furnish or post any
bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this Section 9.10, and irrevocably waives any right it may
have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument.

the terms of this Agreement are not performed by Sellers in accordance with its
specific terms or otherwise breached or Sellers fail to consummate the Closing
and that, in addition to any other remedy that Buyer may have under law or
equity, Buyer shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent breaches of
the terms of this Agreement and to seek to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof that are required to be performed by Sellers. Sellers further
agree that Buyer shall not be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this Section 9.10, and irrevocably waives any right it may have
to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument.


9.11 Right to Setoff. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, if Buyer has a good faith Claim for amounts that may be due and owing
from Sellers to Buyer hereunder, including pursuant to Section 3.5, or with
respect to a breach by Sellers of any other Transaction Document, in addition to
any of Buyer’s other rights and remedies, Buyer may enforce such Claim for any
such amounts by an appropriate setoff against, or deduction from, any amounts
due to Sellers pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or any of
the other Transaction Documents, including the Deposit.

CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER

SECTION 9.12 SHALL NOT APPLY TO ANY CLAIMS THAT BUYER OR ITS AFFILIATES MAY HAVE
AGAINST ANY THIRD PARTY FOLLOWING THE CLOSING.


9.13 Survival. Each and every representation and warranty contained in this
Agreement shall expire and be of no further force and effect as of the Closing.
Each and every covenant and agreement contained in this Agreement (other than

of the Closing. Each Post-Closing Covenant shall survive the Closing until the
earlier of (a) performance of such Post-Closing Covenant in accordance with this
Agreement or, (b) (i) if time for performance of such Post-Closing Covenant is
specified in this Agreement, sixty (60) days following the expiration of the
time period for such performance or (ii) if time for performance of such
Post-Closing Covenant is not specified in this Agreement, sixty (60) days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect
to any claim for any failure to perform such Post-Closing Covenant; provided
that if a written notice of any claim with respect to any Post-Closing Covenant
is given prior to the expiration thereof then such Post-Closing Covenant shall
survive until, but only for purposes of, the resolution of such claim by final,
non-appealable judgment or settlement.


9.14 Computation of Time. In computing any period of time prescribed by or
allowed with respect to any provision of this Agreement that relates to Seller
or the Chapter 11 Cases, the provisions of rule 9006(a) of the Federal Rules of

under this Agreement or for any Claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of
the Transactions. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Claim,
action (including in the Chapter 11 Case), suit, Proceeding or investigation
based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement may only be brought
against, the Persons that are expressly named as parties to this Agreement.
9.17 Disclosure Schedules. Except as set forth in this Agreement, the inclusion
of any information (including dollar amounts) in Disclosure Schedules shall not
be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by any Party that such
information is required to be listed on such section of the relevant schedule or
is material to or outside the Ordinary Course of Business of any Person. The
information contained in this Agreement, the exhibits hereto and the Disclosure
Schedules is disclosed solely for purposes of this Agreement, and no information
contained herein or therein shall be deemed to be an admission by any Party to
any third party of any matter whatsoever (including any violation of any Law or
breach of contract). Unless the context otherwise requires, all capitalized
terms used in the Disclosure Schedules shall have the respective meanings
assigned in this Agreement. The Disclosure Schedules set forth items of
disclosure with specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of
this Agreement to which the information in the Disclosure Schedules relates;
provided, however, that any information set forth in one Section of the
Disclosure Schedules will be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection
thereof to which its relevance is reasonably apparent on its face.


9.18 Sellers’ Representative; Dealings Among Sellers. By its execution and
delivery of this Agreement, each Seller hereby irrevocably constitutes and
appoints Comcar as its true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact (the “Sellers’
Representative”), with full power of substitution to act in such Seller’s name,
place and stead with respect to all Transactions and all terms and provisions of
this Agreement, and to act on such Seller’s behalf in any Proceeding, and to do
or refrain from doing all such further acts and things, and execute all such
documents as Sellers’ Representative shall deem necessary or appropriate in
connection with the Transactions. The appointment of Sellers’ Representative
shall be deemed coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable, and Buyer,
its Affiliates and any other Person may conclusively and absolutely rely,
without inquiry, upon any action of Sellers’ Representative on behalf of Sellers
in all matters referred to herein or contemplated hereby including any direction
regarding the amount of any payment to any Seller. Buyer shall have no
obligation of any nature whatsoever for
34

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



determining any allocation of any payments among Sellers. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, absent specific direction by Sellers’
Representative, Buyer shall be deemed to have fulfilled its obligations
hereunder absolutely with respect to any amounts payable by it under or pursuant
to this Agreement or the delivery of any instruments if Buyer shall pay any such
amounts or deliver such instruments to Sellers’ Representative. All Notices
delivered by Buyer (whether prior to or following the Closing) to Sellers’
Representative (whether pursuant hereto or otherwise) for the benefit of Sellers
shall constitute valid and timely Notice to all of Sellers.


9.19 Mutual Drafting. This Agreement is the result of the joint efforts of Buyer
and Sellers, and each provision hereof has been subject to the mutual
consultation, negotiation and agreement of the Parties and there is to be no
construction against any Party based on any presumption of that Party’s
involvement in the drafting thereof.


9.20 Fiduciary Obligations. Nothing in this Agreement, or any document related
to the Transactions contemplated hereby, without limiting in any way Buyer’s
rights and remedies set forth in this Agreement, will require Sellers or any of
its governing bodies, directors, officers or members, in each case, in their
capacity as such, to take any action, or to refrain from taking any action, to
the extent inconsistent with their fiduciary obligations.
