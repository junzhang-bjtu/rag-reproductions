ARTICLE II

CONVEYANCE OF TRANSFERRED ASSETS

SECTION 2.1 Conveyance of Transferred Assets.

In consideration of the Issuer’s sale and delivery to, or upon the order of, the
Seller of all of the Notes and the Certificate on the Closing Date, the Seller
does hereby irrevocably sell, transfer, assign and otherwise convey to the
Issuer without recourse (subject to the obligations herein) all right, title and
interest of the Seller, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and
under the Transferred Assets, as evidenced by an assignment substantially in the
form of Exhibit A delivered on the Closing Date. The sale, transfer, assignment
and conveyance made hereunder does not constitute and is not intended to result
in an assumption by the Issuer of any obligation of the Seller or the Originator
to the Obligors, the Dealers, insurers or any other Person in connection with
the Receivables or the other assets and properties conveyed hereunder or any
agreement, document or instrument related thereto.

SECTION 2.2 Custody of Receivable Files.

(a) Custody. The Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, not in its individual
capacity but solely as Indenture Trustee, upon the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, hereby revocably appoint the Servicer, and the Servicer hereby
accepts such appointment, to act as the agent of the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee as custodian of the Receivable Files, which are hereby or will hereby be
constructively delivered to the Indenture Trustee (or its agent or designee), as
pledgee of the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture. “Receivable File” means, with
respect to each Receivable, the following documents or instruments (but only to
the extent applicable to such Receivable), which may be held in tangible paper
form or electronic form:

 

  (i)

the fully executed original, electronically authenticated original or
authoritative copy of the Contract (in each case within the meaning of the UCC)
related to such Receivable, including any written amendments or extensions
thereto;

 

  (ii)

the original Certificate of Title or, if not yet received, evidence that an
application therefor has been submitted with the appropriate authority, a
guaranty of title from a Dealer or such other document (electronic or otherwise,
as used in the applicable jurisdiction) that the Servicer keeps on file, in
accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices, evidencing the security
interest of the Originator in the Financed Vehicle; provided, however, that in
lieu of being held in the Receivable File, the Certificate of Title may be held
by a third party service provider engaged by the Servicer to obtain and/or hold
Certificates of Title; and

 

            2    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  (iii)

any and all other documents that the Servicer or the Seller keeps on file, in
accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices, relating to a Receivable, an
Obligor or a Financed Vehicle.

(b) Safekeeping. The Servicer, in its capacity as custodian, shall hold the
Receivable Files for the benefit of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee, as
pledgee of the Issuer. In performing its duties as custodian, the Servicer shall
act in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices. The Servicer will
promptly report to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee any failure on its part
to hold a material portion of the Receivable Files or to maintain its accounts,
records, and computer systems as herein provided and shall promptly take
appropriate action to remedy any such failure. Nothing herein will be deemed to
require an initial review or any periodic review by the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee of the Receivable Files. The Servicer may, in accordance with its
Customary Servicing Practices: (i) maintain all or a portion of the Receivable
Files in electronic form and (ii) maintain custody of all or any portion of the
Receivable Files with one or more of its agents or designees.

(c) Maintenance of and Access to Records. The Servicer will maintain each
Receivable File in the United States (it being understood that the Receivable
Files, or any part thereof, may be maintained at the offices of any Person to
whom the Servicer has delegated responsibilities in accordance with
Section 6.5). The Servicer will make available to the Issuer and the Indenture
Trustee or their duly authorized representatives, attorneys or auditors a list
of locations of the Receivable Files upon request. The Servicer will provide
access to the Receivable Files, and the related accounts records, and computer
systems maintained by the Servicer at such times as the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee direct, but only upon reasonable notice and during the normal business
hours at the respective offices of the Servicer.

(d) Release of Documents. Upon written instructions from the Indenture Trustee,
the Servicer will release or cause to be released any document in the Receivable
Files to the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee’s agent or the Indenture
Trustee’s designee, as the case may be, at such place or places as the Indenture
Trustee may designate, as soon thereafter as is practicable. Any document so
released will be handled by the Indenture Trustee with reasonable care and
returned to the Servicer for safekeeping as soon as the Indenture Trustee or its
agent or designee, as the case may be, has no further need therefor.

(e) Instructions; Authority to Act. All instructions from the Indenture Trustee
will be in writing and signed by an Authorized Officer of the Indenture Trustee,
and the Servicer will be deemed to have received proper instructions with
respect to the Receivable Files upon its receipt of such written instructions.

(f) Custodian’s Indemnification. Subject to Section 6.2, the Servicer as
custodian will indemnify the Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee
for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, compensatory damages,
payments, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses
and court costs and any losses incurred in connection with a successful defense,
in whole or part, of any claim that the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee
breached its standard of care and legal fees and expenses incurred in actions
against the indemnifying party) of any kind whatsoever that may be imposed on,
incurred by or asserted against the Issuer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee as the result of any improper act or

 

            3    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

omission in any way relating to the maintenance and custody by the Servicer as
custodian of the Receivable Files or the enforcement of the Issuer’s, the Owner
Trustee’s or the Indenture Trustee’s rights (including indemnification rights)
under the Transaction Documents; provided, however, that the Servicer as
custodian will not be liable (i) to the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee or
the Issuer for any portion of any such amount resulting from the willful
misconduct, bad faith or negligence of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee
or the Issuer, respectively, or (ii) to the Indenture Trustee for any portion of
any such amount resulting from the failure of the Indenture Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee’s agent or the Indenture Trustee’s designee to handle with
reasonable care any Certificate of Title or other document released to the
Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee’s agent or the Indenture Trustee’s
designee pursuant to Section 2.2(d). The provisions of this Section 2.2(f) shall
survive the termination or assignment of this Agreement and the resignation or
removal of the Indenture Trustee or the Servicer, in its capacity as custodian.
The Servicer shall not be responsible for any loss occasioned by the failure of
the Indenture Trustee or its agent or designee to return any documents or any
delay in doing so.

(g) Effective Period and Termination. The Servicer’s appointment as custodian
will become effective as of the Cut-Off Date and will continue in full force and
effect until terminated pursuant to this Section. If Santander Consumer resigns
as Servicer in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or if all of the
rights and obligations of the Servicer have been terminated under Section 7.1,
the appointment of the Servicer as custodian hereunder may be terminated by the
Indenture Trustee, or by the Noteholders of Notes evidencing not less than a
majority of the Note Balance of the Controlling Class (or, if the Notes are no
longer Outstanding, by the Majority Certificateholders), in the same manner as
the Indenture Trustee or such Noteholders (or Certificateholders) may terminate
the rights and obligations of the Servicer under Section 7.1. As soon as
practicable after any termination of such appointment, the Servicer will deliver
to the Indenture Trustee (or, at the direction of the Indenture Trustee, to its
agent) the Receivable Files and the related accounts and records maintained by
the Servicer at such place or places as the Indenture Trustee may reasonably
designate; provided, however, that with respect to authoritative copies of the
Receivables constituting electronic chattel paper, the Servicer, in its sole
discretion, shall either (i) continue to hold any such authoritative copies on
behalf of the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee or the Indenture Trustee’s agent
(provided that the Servicer has not been terminated in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.2(g)) or (ii) deliver copies of such authoritative
copies and destroy the authoritative copies maintained by the Servicer prior to
its termination such that the copy delivered to the Indenture Trustee or the
Indenture Trustee’s agent becomes the authoritative copy of the Receivable
constituting electronic chattel paper.

(h) Liability of Indenture Trustee. The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable
for the acts or omissions of the Servicer, in its capacity as custodian of the
Receivable Files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTICLE III

ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF

RECEIVABLES AND TRUST PROPERTY

SECTION 3.1 Duties of Servicer.

(a) The Servicer is hereby appointed by the Issuer and authorized to act as
agent for the Issuer and in such capacity shall manage, service, administer and
make collections on the Receivables in accordance with its Customary Servicing
Practices, using the degree of skill and attention that the Servicer exercises
with respect to all comparable motor vehicle receivables that it services for
itself or others. The Servicer’s duties will include collection and posting of
all payments, responding to inquiries of Obligors on such Receivables, pursuing
delinquencies, providing invoices or other payment information (which may be in
electronic form) to Obligors, reporting any required tax information to
Obligors, accounting for Collections and furnishing monthly and annual
statements to the Indenture Trustee with respect to distributions and performing
the other duties specified herein. The Servicer is not required under the
Transaction Documents to make any disbursements via wire transfer or otherwise
on behalf of an Obligor. There are no requirements under the Receivables or the
Transaction Documents for funds to be, and funds shall not be, held in trust for
an Obligor. There are no requirements under the Receivables or the Transaction
Documents for payments or disbursements to be made by the Servicer on behalf of
the Obligor. The Servicer hereby accepts such appointment and authorization and
agrees to perform the duties of Servicer with respect to the Receivables set
forth herein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document, the Servicer shall not be liable for any failure or
delay in the performance of its obligations or the taking of any action
hereunder or under any other Transaction Document (and such failure or delay
shall not constitute a breach of any Transaction Document or a Servicer
Replacement Event) if such failure or delay arises from compliance by the
Servicer with any law or court order, the direction of a regulatory authority or
regulatory guidance.

(b) The Servicer will follow its Customary Servicing Practices and will have
full power and authority to do any and all things in connection with such
managing, servicing, administration and collection that it may deem necessary or
desirable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer is
hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of itself, the
Issuer, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee, the Noteholders, the
Certificateholders, or any of them, any and all instruments of satisfaction or
cancellation, or partial or full release or discharge, and all other comparable
instruments, with respect to the Receivables or to the Financed Vehicles
securing such Receivables. The Servicer is hereby authorized to commence, in its
own name or in the name of the Issuer, a Proceeding to enforce a Receivable or
an Insurance Policy or to commence or participate in any other Proceeding
(including a bankruptcy proceeding) relating to or involving a Receivable, an
Obligor, a Financed Vehicle or an Insurance Policy. If the Servicer commences a
Proceeding to enforce a Receivable or an Insurance Policy, the Issuer will
thereupon be deemed to have automatically assigned such Receivable or its rights
under such Insurance Policy to the Servicer solely for purposes of commencing or
participating in any such Proceeding as a party or claimant, and the

 

            5    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Servicer is authorized and empowered by the Issuer to execute and deliver in the
Servicer’s name any notices, demands, claims, complaints, responses, affidavits
or other documents or instruments in connection with any such Proceeding. If in
any enforcement suit or Proceeding it is held that the Servicer may not enforce
a Receivable or Insurance Policy on the ground that it is not a real party in
interest or a holder entitled to enforce the Receivable or Insurance Policy, the
Issuer will, at the Servicer’s expense and direction, take steps to enforce the
Receivable or Insurance Policy, including bringing suit in its name or the name
of the Indenture Trustee. The Issuer will furnish the Servicer with any powers
of attorney and other documents reasonably necessary or appropriate to enable
the Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties hereunder. The
Servicer, at its expense, will obtain on behalf of the Issuer all licenses, if
any, required by the laws of any jurisdiction to be held by the Issuer in
connection with ownership of the Receivables, and will make all filings and pay
all fees as may be required in connection therewith during the term hereof.

(c) The Servicer hereby agrees that upon its resignation and the appointment of
a successor Servicer hereunder, the Servicer will terminate its activities as
Servicer hereunder in accordance with Section 7.1, and, in any case, in a manner
which the Indenture Trustee reasonably determines will facilitate the transition
of the performance of such activities to such successor Servicer, and the
Servicer shall cooperate with and assist such successor Servicer.

(d) The Servicer shall not be required to monitor whether Obligors maintain an
Insurance Policy on the Financed Vehicles.

SECTION 3.2 Collection of Receivable Payments.

(a) The Servicer will make reasonable efforts to collect all payments called for
under the terms and provisions of the Receivables as and when the same become
due in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices. The Servicer may grant
extensions, rebates, deferrals, amendments, modifications, temporary reductions
in payments or adjustments with respect to any Receivable in accordance with its
Customary Servicing Practices. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Servicer
(i) extends the date for final payment by the Obligor of any Receivable beyond
the last day of the Collection Period immediately prior to the Class D Final
Scheduled Payment Date or (ii) reduces the Contract Rate or Principal Balance
with respect to any Receivable other than (A) as required by applicable law or
court order, (B) in connection with a modification, adjustment or settlement in
the event the Receivable becomes a Severely Distressed Receivable, (C) in
connection with a Cram Down Loss relating to such Receivable, (D) in connection
with the application by the Servicer of payments received from a Dealer and
applied to reduce the Principal Balance of such Receivable, (E) at the direction
of a regulatory authority or in accordance with regulatory guidance or (F) if
the related Obligor is an SCRA Obligor, it will either correct such action or
promptly purchase such Receivable in the manner provided in Section 3.6. The
Servicer may in its discretion waive any late payment charge or any other fees
that may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing a Receivable. The
Servicer shall not be required to make any advances of funds or guarantees
regarding collections, cash flows or distributions. Payments on the Receivables,
including payoffs, made in accordance with the related documentation for such
Receivables, shall be posted to the Servicer’s Obligor records in accordance
with the Servicer’s Customary Servicing Practices. Such payments shall be
allocated to principal, interest or other items in accordance with the related
documentation for such Receivables.

 

            6    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b) Subject to the third sentence of Section 3.2(a), the Servicer and its
Affiliates may engage in any marketing practice or promotion or any sale of any
products, goods or services to Obligors with respect to the Receivables so long
as such practices, promotions or sales are offered to obligors of comparable
motor vehicle receivables serviced by the Servicer for itself and others,
whether or not such practices, promotions or sales might result in a decrease in
the aggregate amount of payments on the Receivables, prepayments or faster or
slower timing of the payment of the Receivables.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Servicer may
refinance any Receivable and deposit the full outstanding Principal Balance of
such Receivable into the Collection Account. The receivable created by such
refinancing shall not be property of the Issuer. The Servicer and its Affiliates
may also sell insurance or debt cancellation products, including products which
result in the cancellation of some or all of the amount of a Receivable upon the
death or disability of the Obligor or any casualty with respect to the Financed
Vehicle.

(d) Records documenting collection efforts shall be maintained during the period
a Receivable is delinquent in accordance with the Servicer’s Customary Servicing
Practices. Such records shall be maintained on at least a periodic basis that is
not less frequent than as prescribed by the Servicer’s Customary Servicing
Practices, and describe the entity’s activities in monitoring delinquent pool
assets including, for example, phone calls, letters and payment rescheduling
plans in cases where delinquency is deemed temporary (e.g., illness or
unemployment) in accordance with the Servicer’s Customary Servicing Practices.

(e) The Servicer shall not be required to maintain a fidelity bond or errors and
omissions policy.

SECTION 3.3 Repossession of Financed Vehicles; Sales of Deficiency Balances. On
behalf of the Issuer, the Servicer will use commercially reasonable efforts,
consistent with its Customary Servicing Practices, to repossess or otherwise
convert the ownership of and liquidate the Financed Vehicle securing any
Receivable as to which the Servicer has determined eventual payment in full is
unlikely; provided, however, that the Servicer may elect not to repossess a
Financed Vehicle if in its sole discretion it determines that repossession will
not increase the aggregate Liquidation Proceeds or that the proceeds ultimately
recoverable with respect to such Receivable would be increased by forbearance or
that repossessing such Financed Vehicle would otherwise not be consistent with
the Servicer’s Customary Servicing Practices. The Servicer is authorized as it
deems necessary or advisable, consistent with its Customary Servicing Practices,
to make reasonable efforts to realize upon any recourse to any Dealer and to
sell the related Financed Vehicle at public or private sale. The foregoing will
be subject to the provision that, in any case in which the Financed Vehicle has
suffered damage, the Servicer shall not be required to expend funds in
connection with the repair or the repossession of such Financed Vehicle. In
addition, the Servicer, in its sole discretion, may in accordance with its
Customary Servicing Practices sell any Receivable’s Deficiency Balance. To
facilitate any such sale the Servicer may, in accordance with its Customary
Servicing Practices, purchase from the Issuer such Receivable’s Deficiency
Balance for a purchase price equal to the proceeds received by the

 

            7    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Servicer in an arm’s-length transaction for the sale of such Receivable’s
Deficiency Balance. Net proceeds of any such sale allocable to the Receivable
will constitute Liquidation Proceeds, and the sole right of the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee with respect to any such sold Receivables will be to receive
such Liquidation Proceeds. Upon such sale, the Servicer will mark its computer
records indicating that any such receivable sold is no longer a Receivable. The
Servicer is authorized to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate on
behalf of the Issuer to evidence the sale of the Financed Vehicle at a public or
private sale or the sale of the Receivable to the Servicer to facilitate a
Deficiency Balance sale pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, in each
case, free from any Lien or other interest of the Issuer or the Indenture
Trustee.

SECTION 3.4 Maintenance of Security Interests in Financed Vehicles. The Servicer
will, in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices, take such steps as
are necessary to maintain perfection of the security interest created by each
Receivable in the related Financed Vehicle. The provisions set forth in this
Section are the sole requirements under the Transaction Documents with respect
to the maintenance of collateral or security on the Receivables. It is
understood that the Financed Vehicles are the collateral and security for the
Receivables, but that the Certificate of Title with respect to a Financed
Vehicle does not constitute collateral for that Receivable and merely evidences
such security interest. The Issuer hereby authorizes the Servicer to take such
steps as are necessary to re-perfect such security interest created by the
Receivable in the event of the relocation of a Financed Vehicle or for any other
reason.

SECTION 3.5 Covenants of Servicer. Unless required by law or court order, or at
the direction of a regulatory authority or in accordance with regulatory
guidance, the Servicer will not release the Financed Vehicle securing any
Receivable from the security interest granted by such Receivable in whole or in
part except (i) in the event of payment in full by or on behalf of the Obligor
thereunder or payment in full less a deficiency which the Servicer would not
attempt to collect in accordance with its Customary Servicing Practices, (ii) in
connection with repossession or (iii) as may be required by an insurer in order
to receive proceeds from any Insurance Policy covering such Financed Vehicle.

SECTION 3.6 Purchase of Receivables Upon Breach. Upon discovery by any party
hereto of a breach of any of the covenants set forth in Section 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 or
3.5 with respect to any Receivable which materially and adversely affects the
interests of the Issuer or the Noteholders in any Receivable, the party
discovering or receiving written notice of such breach shall give prompt written
notice thereof to the other parties hereto; provided, (i) that the delivery of a
Servicer’s Certificate which identifies that Receivables are being or have been
repurchased shall be deemed to constitute prompt notice by the Servicer and the
Issuer of such breach and (ii) the Servicer or the Indenture Trustee shall be
deemed to have knowledge of such breach only if a Responsible Officer thereof
has actual knowledge thereof, including without limitation upon receipt of
written notice; provided, further, that the failure to give such notice shall
not affect any obligation of the Servicer under this Section 3.6. If the breach
materially and adversely affects the interests of the Issuer or the Noteholders
in such Receivable, or if the Servicer is required to purchase a Receivable
pursuant to Section 3.2, then the Servicer shall either (a) correct or cure such
breach, if applicable, or (b) purchase such Receivable from the Issuer, in
either case on or before the Business Day before the Payment Date following the
end of the Collection Period

 

            8    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

which includes the 60th day (or, if the Servicer elects, an earlier date) after
the date the Servicer became aware or was notified of such breach. Any such
breach or failure will be deemed not to have a material and adverse effect if
such breach or failure has not affected the ability of the Issuer to receive and
retain timely payment in full on such Receivable. Any such purchase by the
Servicer shall be at a price equal to the related Repurchase Price. In
consideration for such purchase, the Servicer shall make (or shall cause to be
made) a payment to the Issuer equal to the Repurchase Price by depositing such
amount into the Collection Account prior to noon, New York City time, on such
date of purchase (or, if the Servicer elects, an earlier date). Upon payment of
such Repurchase Price by the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee, on behalf of the
Noteholders, and the Issuer shall release and shall execute and deliver such
instruments of release, transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse or
representation, as may be reasonably requested by the Servicer to evidence such
release, transfer or assignment or more effectively vest in the Servicer or its
designee all of the Issuer’s and Indenture Trustee’s rights in any Receivable
and related Transferred Assets purchased pursuant to this Section 3.6. It is
understood and agreed that the obligation of the Servicer to purchase any
Receivable as described above shall constitute the sole remedy respecting such
breach available to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee.

SECTION 3.7 Servicing Fee. On each Payment Date, the Indenture Trustee on behalf
of the Issuer shall pay to the Servicer the Servicing Fee in accordance with
Section 4.4 for the immediately preceding Collection Period as compensation for
its services. In addition, the Servicer will be entitled to retain all
Supplemental Servicing Fees. The Servicer also will be entitled to receive
investment earnings (net of investment losses and expenses) on funds on deposit
in the Collection Account and the Reserve Account during each Collection Period.

SECTION 3.8 Servicer’s Certificate. On or before the Determination Date
preceding each Payment Date, the Servicer shall deliver to the Indenture
Trustee, the Owner Trustee and each Paying Agent, with a copy to each of the
Rating Agencies, a Servicer’s Certificate executed by an Authorized Officer of
the Servicer containing all information necessary to make the payments,
transfers and distributions pursuant to Sections 4.3 and 4.4 on such Payment
Date, together with the written statements to be furnished by the Indenture
Trustee to the Noteholders pursuant to Section 4.6 hereof and Section 6.6 of the
Indenture. At the sole option of the Servicer, each Servicer’s Certificate may
be delivered in electronic format or hard copy format. No disbursements shall be
made directly by the Servicer to a Noteholder or a Certificateholder, and the
Servicer shall not be required to maintain any investor record relating to the
posting of disbursements or otherwise.

SECTION 3.9 Annual Officer’s Certificate; Notice of Servicer Replacement Event.

(a) The Servicer will deliver to the Issuer, with a copy to the Indenture
Trustee, on or before March 30th of each year, beginning on March 30, 2021, an
Officer’s Certificate, dated as of December 31 of the immediately preceding

Trustee within five (5) Business Days after having obtained knowledge thereof
written notice in an Officer’s Certificate of any event which with the giving of
notice or lapse of time, or both, would become a Servicer Replacement Event.
Except to the extent set forth in this Section 3.9(b), Section 7.2 and
Section 9.22 of this Agreement and Section 3.12 and Section 6.5 of the
Indenture, the Transaction Documents do not require any policies or procedures
to monitor any performance or other triggers and events of default.

(c) The Servicer will deliver to the Issuer, on or before March 30th of each
year, beginning on March 30, 2021, a report regarding the Servicer’s assessment
of compliance with the Servicing Criteria specified in Exhibit C as applicable
to the Servicer during the immediately preceding calendar year, including

Exchange Act and Item 1122 of Regulation AB, or such other criteria as mutually
agreed upon by the Seller and the Servicer.

SECTION 3.10 Annual Registered Public Accounting Firm Attestation.

(a) On or before March 30th of each year, beginning March 30, 2021, the Servicer
shall cause a registered public accounting firm, which may also render other
services to the Servicer or to its Affiliates, to furnish to the Issuer, with a

compliance with the Servicing Criteria with respect to the Servicer or any
Affiliate thereof during the related fiscal year delivered by such accountants
pursuant to paragraph (c) of Rule 13a-18 or Rule 15d-18 of the Exchange Act and
Item 1122 of Regulation AB. The certification required by this paragraph may be
replaced by any similar certification using other procedures or attestation
standards which are now or in the future in use by servicers of comparable
assets, or which otherwise comply with any rule, regulation, “no action” letter
or similar guidance promulgated by the Commission.

(b) The Servicer, however, shall not be obligated to deliver any report
described above to any Person who does not comply with or agree to the required
procedures of such firm of independent certified public accountants, including
but not limited to execution of engagement letters or access letters regarding
such reports.

(c) The Indenture Trustee shall not be liable for any claims, liabilities or
expenses relating to such accountants’ engagement or any report issued in
connection with such engagement, and the dissemination of any such report other
than pursuant to the Transaction Documents or applicable law is subject to the
written consent of the accountants.

SECTION 3.11 Servicer Expenses. The Servicer will be required to pay all

the Seller, or either of them, to prepare, sign, certify and file any and all
reports, statements and information respecting the Issuer and/or the Notes
required to be filed pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder.

SECTION 3.13 Noteholder Communication. A Noteholder (if the Notes are
represented by Definitive Notes) or a Note Owner (if the Notes are represented
by Book-Entry Notes) may send a request to the Seller at any time notifying the
Seller that such Noteholder or Note Owner, as applicable, would like to
communicate with other Noteholders or Note Owners, as applicable, with respect
to an exercise of their rights under the terms of the Transaction Documents. If
the requesting party is not a Noteholder as reflected on the Note Register, the

Each request must include (i) the name of the requesting Noteholder or Note
Owner, as applicable and (ii) a description of the method by which other
Noteholders or Note Owners, as applicable, may contact the requesting Noteholder
or Note Owner. A Noteholder or Note Owner, as applicable, that delivers a
request under this Section 3.13 will be deemed to have certified to the Issuer
and Santander Consumer that its request to communicate with other Noteholders or
Note Owners, as applicable, relates solely to a possible exercise of rights
under the Indenture or the other Transaction Documents, and will not be used for
other purposes. In each monthly distribution report on Form 10-D under the
Exchange Act with respect to the Issuer, the Seller shall include disclosure
regarding any request that complies with the requirements of this Section 3.13
received during the related Collection Period from a Noteholder or Note Owner to
communicate with other Noteholders or Note Owners, as applicable, related to the
Noteholders or Note Owners exercising their rights under the terms of the
Transaction Documents. The disclosure in such Form 10-D regarding the request to

description of the method other Noteholders or Note Owners, as applicable, may
use to contact the requesting Noteholder or Note Owner. The Seller and the

Santander, S.A. ceases to directly or indirectly own at least 50% of the voting
stock or voting power of Santander Consumer (an “Ownership Trigger Event”),

consistent with Moody’s published ratings criteria at the time of the Ratings
Trigger Event or Ownership Trigger Event, as applicable, within 90 days of such
Ratings Trigger Event or Ownership Trigger Event, respectively, unless it shall

THE SELLER

SECTION 5.1 Representations and Warranties of Seller. The Seller makes the
following representations and warranties as of the Closing Date on which the
Issuer will be deemed to have relied in acquiring the Transferred Assets. The
representations and warranties speak as of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and will survive the conveyance of the Transferred Assets to the
Issuer and the pledge thereof by the Issuer to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to
the Indenture:

(a) Existence and Power. The Seller is a Delaware limited liability company
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of
organization and has, in all material respects, full power and authority to own
its assets and operate its business as presently owned or operated, and to
execute, to deliver and to perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party. The Seller has obtained all necessary licenses
and approvals in each jurisdiction where the failure to do so would materially
and adversely affect the ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under
the Transaction Documents or affect the enforceability or collectability of the
Receivables or any other part of the Transferred Assets.

(b) Authorization and No Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Seller of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party have been duly
authorized by all necessary limited liability company action on the part of the
Seller and do not contravene or constitute a default under (i) any applicable
law, rule or regulation, (ii) its organizational documents or (iii) any
indenture or agreement to which the Seller is a party or by which its properties
are bound (other than violations of such laws, rules, regulations, indentures or
agreements which do not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any
of such agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by, or the
Seller’s ability to perform its obligations under, the Transaction Documents).

 

            20    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c) No Consent Required. No approval or authorization by, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance by the Seller of any Transaction Document other than (i) UCC
filings, (ii) approvals and authorizations that have previously been obtained
and filings that have previously been made and (iii) approvals, authorizations
or filings which, if not obtained or made, would not have a material adverse
effect on the enforceability or collectability of the Receivables or any other
part of the Transferred Assets or would not materially and adversely affect the
ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents.

(d) Binding Effect. Each Transaction Document to which the Seller is a party
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Seller enforceable
against the Seller in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
receivership, conservatorship or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally and, if applicable, the rights of creditors of
limited liability companies from time to time in effect or by general principles
of equity.

(e) Lien Filings. The Seller is not aware of any material judgment, ERISA or tax
lien filings against the Seller.

(f) No Proceedings. There are no actions, orders, suits, investigations or
Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of the Seller, threatened against the
Seller before or by any Governmental Authority that (i) assert the invalidity or
unenforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents,
(ii) seek to prevent the issuance of the Notes or the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents, (iii) seek any determination or ruling that would materially and
adversely affect the performance by the Seller of its obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or the collectability or
enforceability of the Receivables, or (iv) relate to the Seller that would
materially and adversely affect the federal or Applicable Tax State income,
excise, franchise or similar tax attributes of the Notes.

(g) Investment Company Act. The Seller is not an “investment company” that is
registered or required to be registered under, or otherwise subject to the
restrictions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

(h) Assignment. The Receivables and the other Transferred Assets have been
validly assigned by the Seller to the Issuer.

 

            21    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i) Security Interests. The Seller has not authorized the filing of and is not
aware of any financing statements against the Seller that includes a description
of collateral covering any Receivable other than any financing statement
relating to security interests granted under the Transaction Documents or that
have been or, prior to the assignment of such Receivables hereunder, will be
terminated, amended or released. This Agreement creates a valid and continuing
security interest in the Receivables (other than the Related Security with
respect thereto, to the extent that an ownership interest therein cannot be
perfected by the filing of a financing statement) in favor of the Issuer which
security interest is prior to all other Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and
is enforceable as such against all other creditors of and purchasers and
assignees from the Seller.

(j) Creation, Perfection and Priority of Security Interests. The representations
and warranties regarding creation, perfection and priority of security interests
in the Transferred Assets, which are attached to this Agreement as Exhibit B,
are true and correct.

SECTION 5.2 Liability of Seller; Indemnities. The Seller shall be liable in
accordance herewith only to the extent of the obligations specifically
undertaken by the Seller under this Agreement, and hereby agrees to the
following:

(a) The Seller shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee and the Indenture Trustee (including when performing its duties as
Relevant Trustee) from and against any loss, liability or expense (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses and court costs and any losses incurred
in connection with a successful defense, in whole or part, of any claim that the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee breached its standard of care and legal
fees and expenses incurred in actions against the indemnifying party) incurred
by reason of the Seller’s violation of federal or State securities laws in
connection with the registration or the sale of the Notes.

(b) Indemnification under this Section 5.2 will survive the resignation or
removal of the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee and the termination of
this Agreement and will include, without limitation, reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel and expenses of litigation including those incurred in
connection with the enforcement of the Owner Trustee’s or the Indenture
Trustee’s respective rights (including indemnification rights) under the
Transaction Documents. If the Seller has made any indemnity payments pursuant to
this Section 5.2 and the Person to or on behalf of whom such payments are made
thereafter collects any of such amounts from others, such Person will promptly
repay such amounts to the Seller, without interest.

(c) The Seller’s obligations under this Section 5.2 are obligations solely of
the Seller and will not constitute a claim against the Seller to the extent that
the Seller does not have funds sufficient to make payment of such obligations.
In furtherance of and not in derogation of the foregoing, the Issuer, the
Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee, by entering into or
accepting this Agreement, acknowledge and agree that they have no right, title
or interest in or to the Other Assets of the Seller. To the extent that,
notwithstanding the agreements and provisions contained in the preceding
sentence, the Issuer, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee
either (i) asserts an interest or claim to, or benefit from, Other Assets, or
(ii) is deemed to have any such interest, claim to, or benefit in or from Other
Assets, whether by operation of law, legal process, pursuant to applicable
provisions of insolvency laws or otherwise (including by virtue of
Section 1111(b) of the Bankruptcy Code or any successor provision having similar
effect under the Bankruptcy Code), then the Issuer, the Servicer, the Indenture
Trustee or the Owner Trustee, as applicable, further acknowledges and agrees
that any such

 

            22    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

interest, claim or benefit in or from Other Assets is and will be expressly
subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full of the other obligations and
liabilities, which, under the terms of the relevant documents relating to the
securitization or conveyance of such Other Assets, are entitled to be paid from,
entitled to the benefits of, or otherwise secured by such Other Assets (whether
or not any such entitlement or security interest is legally perfected or
otherwise entitled to a priority of distributions or application under
applicable law, including insolvency laws, and whether or not asserted against
the Seller), including the payment of post-petition interest on such other
obligations and liabilities. This subordination agreement will be deemed a
subordination agreement within the meaning of Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy
Code. The Issuer, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee each
further acknowledges and agrees that no adequate remedy at law exists for a
breach of this Section 5.2(c) and the terms of this Section 5.2(c) may be
enforced by an action for specific performance. The provisions of this
Section 5.2(c) will be for the benefit of those entitled to rely thereon and
will survive the termination or assignment of this Agreement, and the
resignation or removal of any indemnified party.

SECTION 5.3 Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption of the Obligations of,
Seller. Any entity (i) into which the Seller may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, to which it may sell or transfer its business and
assets as a whole or substantially as a whole or any entity resulting from any
merger, sale, transfer, conversion or consolidation to which the Seller shall be
a party, or any entity succeeding to the business of the Seller or (ii) more
than 50% of the voting stock or voting power and 50% or more of the economic
equity of which is owned directly or indirectly by Banco Santander, S.A. and
which executes an agreement of assumption to perform every obligation of the
Seller under this agreement, shall be the successor to the Seller under this
Agreement, in each case, without the execution or filing of any additional paper
or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to
the contrary notwithstanding. Within thirty days following the consummation of
any of the foregoing transactions in which the Seller is not the surviving
entity, the Seller shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
either (A) stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, all financing
statements and continuation statements and amendments thereto have been executed
and filed that are necessary to preserve and protect the interest of the Issuer
in the Receivables and the other Transferred Assets or (B) stating that, in the
opinion of such counsel, no such action shall be necessary to preserve and
protect such interest.

SECTION 5.4 Limitation on Liability of Seller and Others. The Seller and any
officer or employee or agent of the Seller may rely in good faith on the advice
of counsel or on any document of any kind, prima facie properly executed and
submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising hereunder. The Seller
will not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal
action that is not incidental to its obligations under this Agreement and that
in its opinion may involve it in any expense or liability.

SECTION 5.5 Seller May Own Notes. The Seller, and any Affiliate of the Seller,
may in its individual or any other capacity become the owner or pledgee of Notes
with the same rights as it would have if it were not the Seller or an Affiliate
thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the other
Transaction Documents. Except as set forth herein or in the other Transaction
Documents, Notes so owned by the Seller or any such Affiliate will have

 

            23    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

an equal and proportionate benefit under the provisions of this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents, without preference, priority, or distinction as
among all of the Notes. Unless all Notes are owned by the Issuer, the Seller,
any Certificateholder, the Servicer, the Administrator or any of their
respective Affiliates, any Notes owned by the Issuer, the Seller, any
Certificateholder, the Servicer, the Administrator or any of their respective
Affiliates shall be disregarded with respect to the determination of any
request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, vote or waiver
hereunder or under any other Transaction Document.

SECTION 5.6 Sarbanes-Oxley Act Requirements. To the extent any documents are
required to be filed or any certification is required to be made with respect to
the Issuer or the Notes pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Issuer hereby
authorizes the Servicer and the Seller, or either of them, to prepare, sign,
certify and file any such documents or certifications on behalf of the Issuer.

SECTION 5.7 Compliance with Organizational Documents. The Seller shall comply
with its limited liability company agreement and other organizational documents.

THE SERVICER

SECTION 6.1 Representations of Servicer. The Servicer makes the following
representations and warranties as of the Closing Date, on which the Issuer will

existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of organization and
has, in all material respects, full power and authority to own its assets and
operate its business as presently owned or operated, and to execute, to deliver
and to perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is a
party. The Servicer has obtained all necessary licenses and approvals in each

Documents or affect the enforceability or collectability of the Receivables or
any other part of the Transferred Assets.

(b) Authorization and No Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance
by the Servicer of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party have been
duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of the Servicer and do not

regulation, (ii) its organizational documents or (iii) any material indenture or
material agreement to which the Servicer is a party or by which its properties
are bound, in each case, other than violations of such laws, rules, regulations,
organizational documents, indentures or agreements which do not affect the
legality, validity or enforceability of any of such agreements and which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not materially and adversely affect the
transactions contemplated by, or the Servicer’s ability to perform its
obligations under, the Transaction Documents.

 

            24    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c) No Consent Required. No approval or authorization by, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the execution, delivery
and performance by the Servicer of any Transaction Document other than (i) UCC
filings, (ii) approvals and authorizations that have previously been obtained
and filings that have previously been made or approvals, authorizations or
filings that will be made on a timely basis and (iii) approval, authorizations
or filings that, if not obtained or made, would not have a material adverse
effect on the enforceability or collectability of the Receivables or would not
materially and adversely affect the ability of the Servicer to perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents.

(d) Binding Effect. Each Transaction Document to which the Servicer is a party
constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the Servicer enforceable
against the Servicer in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability
may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium,
receivership, conservatorship or other similar laws affecting creditors’ rights
generally and, if applicable, the rights of creditors of corporations from time
to time in effect or by general principles of equity.

(e) No Proceedings. There are no actions, suits, investigations or Proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of the Servicer, threatened against the Servicer
before or by any Governmental Authority that (i) assert the invalidity or
unenforceability of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents,
(ii) seek to prevent the issuance of the Notes or the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents, (iii) seek any determination or ruling that would materially and
adversely affect the performance by the Servicer of its obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or (iv) relate to the
Servicer that would materially and adversely affect the federal or Applicable
Tax State income, excise, franchise or similar tax attributes of the Notes.

SECTION 6.2 Indemnities of Servicer. The Servicer and the Issuer will be liable
in accordance herewith only to the extent of the obligations specifically
undertaken by the Servicer and the Issuer, respectively, under this Agreement,
and hereby agrees to the following:

(a) The Servicer will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee (including when performing its duties as Relevant
Trustee) and the Seller from and against any and all costs, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses and court costs and any losses incurred
in connection with a successful defense, in whole or part, of any claim that the
Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee breached its standard of care and legal
fees and expenses incurred in actions against the indemnifying party), losses,
damages, claims and liabilities, arising out of or resulting from the use,
ownership or operation by the Servicer or any Affiliate thereof or any
sub-contractor hired by the Servicer or such Affiliate of a Financed Vehicle.

(b) The Issuer, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee (including when
performing its duties as Relevant Trustee) shall be indemnified, defended and
held harmless from and against any taxes that may at any time be asserted
against any such Person with respect to the transactions contemplated herein or
in the other Transaction Documents, if any, including, without limitation, any
sales, gross receipts, general corporation, tangible personal property,
privilege, or license taxes (but, in the case of the Issuer, not including any
taxes asserted with

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

respect to, and as of the date of, the conveyance of the Receivables to the
Issuer or the issuance and original sales of the Notes, or asserted with respect
to ownership of the Receivables, or federal or other Applicable Tax State income
taxes arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents) and costs and expenses in defending against the
same. For the avoidance of doubt, the Servicer will not indemnify for any costs,
expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities due to the credit risk of the
Obligors and for which reimbursement would constitute recourse for uncollectible
Receivables. Amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.2(b) shall be payable
(i) to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 4.4(a)
hereof or Section 5.4(b) of the Indenture, as applicable (to the extent of
Available Funds available therefor), and, to the extent not paid thereunder, by
the Servicer, and (ii) to the Issuer by the Servicer.

(c) The Servicer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Issuer, the Owner
Trustee, the Indenture Trustee (including when performing its duties as Relevant
Trustee) and the Seller from and against any and all costs, expenses, losses,
claims, damages, and liabilities to the extent that such cost, expense, loss,
claim, damage, or liability arose out of, or was imposed upon any such Person
through, the negligence, willful misfeasance, or bad faith (other than errors in
judgment) of the Servicer in the performance of its duties under this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document to which it is a party, or by reason of its
failure to perform its obligations or of reckless disregard of its obligations
and duties under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document to which it is
a party; provided, however, that the Servicer will not indemnify for any costs,
expenses, losses, claims, damages or liabilities arising from its breach of any
covenant for which the purchase of the affected Receivables is specified as the
sole remedy pursuant to Section 3.6.

(d) The Issuer or, if applicable, the Servicer will compensate and indemnify the
Indenture Trustee (including when performing its duties as Relevant Trustee) and
the Owner Trustee to the extent and subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 6.7 of the Indenture and Section 8.2 of the Trust Agreement, as
applicable, except, with respect to the Indenture Trustee, to the extent that
any cost, expense, loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is incurred
in connection with the performance by the Indenture Trustee of the duties of a
successor Servicer hereunder.

(e) Indemnification under this Section 6.2 by Santander Consumer (or any
successor thereto pursuant to Section 7.1) as Servicer, with respect to the
period such Person was the Servicer, will survive the termination or assignment
of such Person as Servicer or a resignation by such Person as Servicer as well
as the termination or assignment of this Agreement or the resignation or removal
of the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee (including when performing its
duties as Relevant Trustee) and will include reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel and expenses of litigation. If either the Issuer or the Servicer has
made any indemnity payments pursuant to this Section 6.2 and the Person to or on
behalf of whom such payments are made thereafter collects any of such amounts
from others, such Person will promptly repay such amounts to such party, without
interest.

SECTION 6.3 Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption of the Obligations of,
Servicer. Any entity (i) into which the Servicer may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated, to which it may sell or transfer its business
and assets as a whole or substantially as a whole or any entity resulting from
any merger, sale, transfer, conversion or consolidation to which the Servicer
shall be a party, or any entity succeeding to the business of the Servicer or
(ii) of which more than 50% of the voting stock or voting power and 50% or more
of the economic equity is owned directly or indirectly by Banco Santander, S.A.
and which executes an agreement of assumption to perform every obligation of the
Servicer under this Agreement, shall be the successor to the Servicer under this
Agreement, in each case, without the execution or filing of any paper or any
further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding.

SECTION 6.4 Limitation on Liability of Servicer and Others.

(a) Neither the Servicer nor any of the directors or officers or employees or
agents of the Servicer will be under any liability to the Issuer, the Indenture
Trustee, the Owner Trustee, the Noteholders or the Certificateholders, except as
provided under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, for any action
taken or for refraining from the taking of any action pursuant to this Agreement
or for errors in judgment; provided, however, that this provision will not
protect the Servicer or any such Person against any liability that would
otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance or bad faith in the
performance of duties or by reason of its failure to perform its obligations or
of reckless disregard of obligations and duties under this Agreement, or by
reason of negligence in the performance of its duties under this Agreement
(except for errors in judgment). The Servicer and any director, officer or
employee or agent of the Servicer may rely in good faith on any Opinion of
Counsel or on any Officer’s Certificate of the Seller or certificate of auditors
believed to be genuine and to have been signed by the proper party in respect of
any matters arising under this Agreement.

(b) Except as provided in this Agreement, the Servicer will not be under any
obligation to appear in, prosecute, or defend any legal action that is not
incidental to its duties to service the Receivables in accordance with this
Agreement, and that in its opinion may involve it in any expense or liability;
provided, however, that the Servicer may undertake any reasonable action that it
may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement and the rights and
duties of the parties to this Agreement and the interests of the Noteholders and
the Certificateholders under this Agreement. In such event, the legal expenses
and costs of such action and any liability resulting therefrom will be expenses,
costs and liabilities of the Servicer.

SECTION 6.5 Delegation of Duties. The Servicer may, at any time without notice
or consent, delegate (a) any or all of its duties (including, without
limitation, its duties as custodian) under the Transaction Documents to any of
its Affiliates or (b) specific duties (including, without limitation, its duties
as custodian) to sub-contractors who are in the business of performing such
duties; provided, that no such delegation shall relieve the Servicer of its
responsibility with respect to such duties and the Servicer shall remain
obligated and liable to the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and, to the extent it
is acting as Relevant Trustee, the Certificate Paying Agent for its duties
hereunder as if the Servicer alone were performing such duties. For any
servicing activities delegated to third parties in accordance with this
Section 6.5, the Servicer shall follow such policies and procedures to monitor
the performance of such third parties and compliance with such servicing
activities as the Servicer follows with respect to comparable motor vehicle
receivables serviced by the Servicer for its own account.

provisions of Sections 6.3 and 6.5, Santander Consumer will not resign from the
obligations and duties hereby imposed on it as Servicer under this Agreement
except upon determination that the performance of its duties under this
Agreement is no longer permissible under applicable law. Notice of any such
determination permitting the resignation of Santander Consumer will be
communicated to the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee at the earliest practicable
time (and, if such communication is not in writing, will be confirmed in writing
at the earliest practicable time) and any such determination will be evidenced
by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Issuer and the
Indenture Trustee concurrently with or promptly after such notice. No such
resignation will become effective until a successor Servicer has assumed the
responsibilities and obligations of Santander Consumer as Servicer.

SECTION 6.7 Servicer May Own Notes. The Servicer, and any Affiliate of the
Servicer, may, in its individual or any other capacity, become the owner or
pledgee of Notes with the same rights as it would have if it were not the
Servicer or an Affiliate thereof, except as otherwise expressly provided herein
or in the other Transaction Documents. Except as set forth herein or in the
other Transaction Documents, Notes so owned by or pledged to the Servicer or
such Affiliate will have an equal and proportionate benefit under the provisions

the Notes.

ARTICLE VII

TERMINATION OF SERVICER

SECTION 7.1 Termination and Replacement of Servicer.

(a) If a Servicer Replacement Event shall have occurred and be continuing, the
Indenture Trustee shall, at the direction of the Noteholders representing at
least a majority of the Note Balance of the Controlling Class (or, if no Notes
are Outstanding, the Relevant Trustee shall, at the direction of the Majority
Certificateholders), by notice given to the Servicer, the Owner Trustee, the
Issuer, the Administrator and the Noteholders, terminate the rights and
obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement with respect to the
Receivables. In the event the Servicer is removed or resigns as Servicer with
respect to servicing the Receivables, the Indenture Trustee shall, at the
direction of the Noteholders representing at least a majority of the Note
Balance of the Controlling Class, appoint a successor Servicer. Upon the
Servicer’s receipt of notice of termination, such Servicer will continue to
perform its functions as Servicer under this Agreement only until the date
specified in such termination notice or, if no such date is specified in such
termination notice, until receipt of such notice. If a successor Servicer has
not been appointed at the time when the outgoing Servicer ceases to act as
Servicer after resigning or being removed in accordance with this Section, the
Indenture Trustee without further action will automatically be appointed the
successor Servicer. Notwithstanding the above, the Indenture Trustee, if it is
legally unable or is unwilling to so act, will appoint, or petition a court of
competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor Servicer. Any successor Servicer
shall be an established institution whose regular business includes the
servicing of comparable motor vehicle receivables. Any expenses incurred by the
Indenture Trustee in connection with the appointment of and transition to any
successor Servicer will be indemnified pursuant to Section 6.7 of the Indenture.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b) Noteholders holding not less than a majority of the Note Balance of the
Controlling Class (or, if no Notes are Outstanding, the Majority
Certificateholders) may waive any Servicer Replacement Event. Upon any such
waiver, such Servicer Replacement Event shall cease to exist and be deemed not
to have occurred, and any Servicer Replacement Event arising therefrom shall be
deemed not to have occurred for every purpose of this Agreement, but no such
waiver shall extend to any prior, subsequent or other Servicer Replacement Event
or impair any right consequent thereto.

(c) If replaced, the Servicer agrees that it will use commercially reasonable
efforts at its own expense to effect the orderly and efficient transfer of the
servicing of the Receivables to a successor Servicer.

(d) Upon the effectiveness of the assumption by the successor Servicer of its
duties pursuant to this Section 7.1, the successor Servicer shall be the
successor in all respects to the Servicer in its capacity as Servicer under this
Agreement with respect to the Receivables, and shall be subject to all the
responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto, except with respect
to the obligations of the predecessor Servicer that survive its termination as
Servicer, including indemnification obligations as set forth in Section 6.2(e).
In such event, the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee are hereby authorized
and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the predecessor Servicer, as
attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and
to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect
the purposes of such termination and replacement of the Servicer, whether to
complete the transfer and endorsement of the Receivables and related documents,
or otherwise. No Servicer shall resign or be relieved of its duties under this
Agreement, as Servicer of the Receivables, until a newly appointed Servicer for
the Receivables shall have assumed the responsibilities and obligations of the
resigning or terminated Servicer under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
else herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Indenture Trustee be liable
for any Servicing Fee or for any differential in the amount of the Servicing Fee
paid hereunder and the amount necessary to induce any successor Servicer to act
as successor Servicer under this Agreement and the transactions set forth or
provided for herein.

(e) In connection with such appointment, the Indenture Trustee may make such
arrangements for the compensation of the successor Servicer out of Available
Funds as it and such successor Servicer will agree; provided, however, that no
such compensation will be in excess of the amount paid to the predecessor
Servicer under this Agreement (unless otherwise amended in accordance with
Section 9.1).

SECTION 7.2 Notification to Noteholders. Upon any termination of, or appointment
of a successor to, the Servicer pursuant to this Article VII, the Indenture
Trustee (or the Relevant Trustee if no Notes are Outstanding) will give prompt
written notice thereof to the Owner Trustee, the Issuer, the Administrator, the
Asset Representations Reviewer and to the Noteholders and the Certificateholders
at their respective addresses of record.

OPTIONAL PURCHASE

SECTION 8.1 Optional Purchase of Trust Estate. The Servicer shall have the right
at its option (the “Optional Purchase”) to purchase (and/or to designate one or
more other parties to purchase) the Trust Estate (other than the Reserve
Account) from the Issuer on any Payment Date if both of the following conditions
are satisfied: (i) as of the last day of the related Collection Period, the Pool
Balance has declined to 10% or less of the Pool Balance as of the Cut-Off Date,

expenses and indemnities owed to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee and
not previously paid, (C) interest then due on the Notes and (D) the aggregate

provided that, at the Servicer’s option, any Collections deposited into the
Collection Account after the last day of the Collection Period immediately
preceding the Redemption Date may either be applied to reduce the amount of such
deposit or remitted to the Servicer (or its designee) following the exercise of
the Optional Purchase. The Servicer shall furnish written notice of its election
to exercise the Optional Purchase to the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee
not later than ten days prior to the date of the Optional Purchase. If the
Servicer (or its designee) exercises the Optional Purchase, the Notes shall be
redeemed and in each case in whole but not in part on the related Payment Date
for the Redemption Price.

its computer systems so that, from time to time after the conveyance under this

has been pledged to the Indenture Trustee on behalf of the Noteholders pursuant
to the Indenture. Indication of the Issuer’s and the Indenture Trustee’s
interest in a Receivable shall not be deleted from or modified on such computer

SECTION 9.4 Transfers Intended as Sale; Security Interest.

or warranty (express or implied) by, the Seller, except as otherwise

obligations of the Seller hereunder;

purchaser, for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to the New
York UCC and the UCC of any other applicable jurisdiction; and

 

  (iv)

Notifications to persons holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts or

(c) The Indenture Trustee shall, to the extent the Indenture Trustee has
received any repurchase or replacement request with respect to any Receivable,
no later than the fifth Business Day after the last day of each calendar month,
provide notice to the Seller and Santander Consumer (each, a “Santander Party”
and, collectively, the “Santander Parties”), in a form to be mutually agreed
upon by Santander Consumer and the Indenture Trustee, of (i) all demands
communicated to a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee for the
repurchase or replacement of any Receivable for breach of the representations
and warranties concerning such Receivable and (ii) any actions taken by the
Indenture Trustee with respect to such demand communicated to the Indenture
Trustee in respect of any Receivables. In addition, the Indenture Trustee shall,
upon written request of either Santander Party, at any time such Santander Party
reasonably feels necessary, provide notification to the Santander Parties with
respect to any actions taken by the Indenture Trustee as soon as practicable and
in any event within five Business Days of receipt of such request. In no event
shall the Indenture Trustee be deemed to

 

            39    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

be a “securitizer” as defined in Section 15G(a) of the Exchange Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents, nor shall it have
any responsibility for making any filing to be made by a securitizer under the
Exchange Act or Regulation AB with respect to the transactions contemplated by
the Transaction Documents.

SECTION 9.22 Form 8-K Filings. Each of the Indenture Trustee and the Servicer
shall promptly notify the Seller, but in no event later than two (2) Business
Days after its occurrence, of any Reportable Event of which the Servicer or a
Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee has actual knowledge (other than a
Reportable Event described in clause (a) or (b) of the definition thereof as to
which the Seller or the Servicer has actual knowledge). Each Person shall be
deemed to have actual knowledge of any such event to the extent that it relates
to such Person or any action or failure to act by such Person.

SECTION 9.23 Relevant Trustee. Following the payment in full of principal of,
and interest on, the Notes, the Certificate Paying Agent shall assume the role
of Relevant Trustee hereunder and shall perform the obligations of the Relevant
Trustee set forth herein. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the final
payment in full of principal of, and interest on, the Notes, the Servicer shall
deliver a written notification to the Certificate Paying Agent, which notice
shall set forth the date upon which the Certificate Paying Agent will assume the
role of Relevant Trustee (the “Assumption Date”). For the avoidance of doubt,
the obligations and duties of the Certificate Paying Agent as Relevant Trustee
under the Transaction Documents shall be limited to the express duties of the
Relevant Trustee, and shall not be deemed to include any duty or obligation of
the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer, or any other Person. In the performance of
its obligations as Relevant Trustee, the Certificate Paying Agent shall be
entitled to all of the same rights, protections, indemnities and immunities as
the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture, which rights, protections,
indemnities and immunities are incorporated herein by reference. The parties
hereby agree to amend the Transaction Documents prior to the Assumption Date to
provide for such terms and conditions as may be necessary or desirable in
connection with the assumption of the role of Relevant Trustee by the
Certificate Paying Agent.

SECTION 9.24 Dispute Resolution.

(a) If the Seller, the Issuer, the Owner Trustee (in its discretion or at the
direction of a Certificateholder pursuant to the Trust Agreement) or the
Indenture Trustee (in its discretion or at the direction of a Requesting
Investor pursuant to Section 7.5 of the Indenture) (the “Requesting Party”)
requests that Santander Consumer repurchase any Receivable pursuant to
Section 3.4 of the Purchase Agreement and the repurchase request has not been
fulfilled or otherwise resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Requesting
Party within 180 days of the receipt of notice of the request by Santander
Consumer, the Requesting Party will have the right to refer the matter, at its
discretion, to either mediation (including nonbinding arbitration) or
arbitration pursuant to this Section 9.24; provided, however, that (i) if the
Indenture Trustee declines to act in accordance with this Section 9.24 at the
direction of a Noteholder or Note Owner due to the failure of such Noteholder or
Note Owner to offer the Indenture Trustee security or indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee against the reasonable costs, expenses,
disbursement, advances and liabilities that might be incurred by it, its agents
and its counsel in connection with such act, such Noteholder or Note Owner shall
be deemed to be a “Requesting Party” or (ii) if the Owner Trustee declines to
act in accordance with this Section

 

            40    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.24 at the direction of a Certificateholder due to the failure of such
Certificateholder to offer the Owner Trustee security or indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to the Owner Trustee against the reasonable costs, expenses,
disbursement, advances and liabilities that might be incurred by it, its agents
and its counsel in connection with such act, such Certificateholder shall be
deemed to be a “Requesting Party.” If the Requesting Party is the Indenture
Trustee or the Owner Trustee acting at the direction of a Noteholder, Note Owner
or Certificateholder, as applicable, the Indenture Trustee or Owner Trustee, as
applicable, as Requesting Party, will act solely at the direction of such
Noteholder, Note Owner, or Certificateholder in making all decisions related to
mediation or arbitration. Santander Consumer will inform the Requesting Party in
writing upon a determination by Santander Consumer that a Receivable subject to
a demand to repurchase will be repurchased and the monthly distribution report
filed by the Seller on Form 10-D for the Collection Period in which such
Receivables were repurchased shall include disclosure of such repurchase. A
failure of Santander Consumer to inform the Requesting Party that a Receivable
subject to a demand will be repurchased within 180 days of the receipt of notice
of the request shall be deemed to be a determination by Santander Consumer that
no repurchase of that Receivable due to a breach of Section 3.3 of the Purchase
Agreement is required. The monthly distribution report filed by the Seller on
Form 10-D for the Collection Period in which a repurchase demand is made and for
each subsequent Collection Period until such repurchase demand is resolved or
the related Receivable is repurchased, shall include disclosure regarding the
date of the repurchase demand as well as the status of such repurchase demand
for each applicable Receivable. If both the Owner Trustee (on behalf of one or
more Certificateholders) and the Indenture Trustee (on behalf of one or more
Noteholders or Note Owners) are Requesting Parties, then the Indenture Trustee
as Requesting Party shall have the right to make the selection of mediation
(including nonbinding arbitration) or arbitration. If more than one Noteholder
or Note Owner has directed the Indenture Trustee in connection with a request to
pursue dispute resolution pursuant to this Section 9.24, the Indenture Trustee
shall act at the direction of the Noteholders or Note Owners, as applicable,
holding a majority of the Note Balance of the Notes held by such directing
Noteholders and/or Note Owners. If more than one Certificateholder has directed
the Owner Trustee in connection with a request to pursue dispute resolution
pursuant to this Section 9.24, the Owner Trustee shall act at the direction of
the Certificateholders holding the majority of the voting interests of such
directing Certificateholders. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Indenture
Trustee nor the Owner Trustee is required to, nor intends to, exercise
discretion with respect to any action pursuant to this Section 9.24(a).

(b) The Requesting Party will provide notice in accordance with the provisions
of Section 9.6 of its intention to refer the matter to mediation (including
nonbinding arbitration) or arbitration, as applicable, to Santander Consumer,
with a copy to the Issuer, the Seller, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee. Santander Consumer agrees that it will participate in the resolution
method selected by the Requesting Party. Santander Consumer shall provide notice
to the Seller, the Issuer, the Owner Trustee, and the Indenture Trustee that
Santander Consumer has received a request to mediate or arbitrate a repurchase
request. Upon receipt of such notice, the Seller, the Issuer, the Owner Trustee
(acting at the direction of a Certificateholder), and the Indenture Trustee
(acting at the direction of a Noteholder or Note Owner) shall advise the
Requesting Party and Santander Consumer of an intent to join in the mediation or
arbitration, which shall result in their being joined as a Requesting Party in
the

 

            41    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proceeding. A Requesting Party may not initiate a mediation (including
nonbinding arbitration) or arbitration pursuant to this Section 9.24 with
respect to a Receivable that is, or has been, the subject of an ongoing or
previous mediation or arbitration (whether by that Requesting Party or another
Requesting Party) but will have the right, subject to a determination by the
parties to the existing mediation or arbitration that such joinder would not
prejudice the rights of the participants to such existing mediation or
arbitration or unduly delay such Proceeding, to join an existing mediation or
arbitration with respect to that Receivable if the mediation or arbitration has
not yet concluded. In the case of any such joinder, if the initial Requesting
Party is (i) the Indenture Trustee (on behalf of one or more Noteholders or Note
Owners), any decisions related to the mediation or arbitration will be made by
the Indenture Trustee at the written direction of the Requesting Investor
holding a majority of the Note Balance of all of the Notes held by such
directing Noteholders and/or Note Owners, and (ii) the Owner Trustee (on behalf
of one or more Certificateholders), any decisions related to the mediation or
arbitration will be made by the Owner Trustee on behalf of the
Certificateholders holding the majority of the voting interests of the directing
Certificateholders.

(c) If the Requesting Party selects mediation (including nonbinding arbitration)
as the resolution method, the following provisions will apply:

(i) The mediation will be administered by a nationally recognized arbitration
and mediation association selected by the Requesting Party pursuant to such
association’s mediation procedures in effect at such time.

(ii) The fees and expenses of the mediation will be allocated as mutually agreed
by the parties as part of the mediation.

(iii) The mediator will be impartial, knowledgeable about and experienced with
the laws of the State of New York that are relevant to the repurchase dispute
and will be appointed from a list of neutrals maintained by the American
Arbitration Association (the “AAA”).

(d) If the Requesting Party selects arbitration as the resolution method, the
following provisions will apply:

(i) The arbitration will be administered by a nationally recognized arbitration
and mediation association jointly selected by the parties, and if the parties
are unable to agree on an association, by the AAA, and conducted pursuant to
such association’s arbitration procedures in effect at such time.

(ii) The arbitrator will be impartial, knowledgeable about and experienced with
the laws of the State of New York that are relevant to the dispute hereunder and
will be appointed from a list of neutrals maintained by AAA.

(iii) The arbitrator will make its final determination no later than 90 days
after appointment or as soon as practicable thereafter. The arbitrator will
resolve the dispute in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and may not
modify or change this Agreement in any way. The arbitrator will not have the
power to award punitive

 

            42    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

damages or consequential damages in any arbitration conducted by it, and
Santander Consumer shall not be required to pay more than the applicable
Repurchase Price with respect to any receivable which Santander Consumer is
required to repurchase under the terms of the Purchase Agreement or this
Agreement, as applicable. In its final determination, the arbitrator will
determine and award the costs of the arbitration (including the fees of the
arbitrator, cost of any record or transcript of the arbitration, and
administrative fees) and reasonable attorneys’ fees to the parties as determined
by the arbitrator in its reasonable discretion. The determination of the
arbitrator will be in writing and counterpart copies will be promptly delivered
to the parties. The determination may be enforced in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

(iv) No person may bring a putative or certified class action to arbitration.

(e) The following provisions will apply to both mediations (including nonbinding
arbitration) and arbitrations:

(i) Any mediation or arbitration will be held in New York, New York or such
other location mutually agreed to by the Requesting Party and Santander
Consumer;

(ii) Notwithstanding this dispute resolution provision, the parties will have
the right to seek provisional relief from a competent court of law, including a
temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or attachment order,
provided such relief would otherwise be available by law; and

(iii) The details and/or existence of any unfulfilled repurchase request, any
meetings or discussions regarding any unfulfilled repurchase request, mediations
or arbitration proceedings conducted under this Section 9.24, including all
offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the
course of the parties’ attempt to resolve an unfulfilled repurchase request, any
information exchanged in connection with any mediation, and any discovery taken
in connection with any arbitration (collectively, “Confidential Information”),
shall be and remain confidential and inadmissible (except disclosures required
by applicable law) for any purpose, including impeachment, in any mediation,
arbitration or litigation, or other proceeding (including any proceeding under
this Section 9.24) other than as required to be disclosed in accordance with
applicable law, regulatory requirements, or court order or to the extent that
Santander Consumer, in its sole discretion, elects to disclose such information.
Such information will be kept strictly confidential and will not be disclosed or
discussed with any third party, except that a party may disclose such
information to its own attorneys, experts, accountants and other agents and
representatives (collectively “Representatives”), as reasonably required in
connection with any resolution procedure under this Section 9.24, and to the
Asset Representations Reviewer, if an Asset Review has been conducted, if the
disclosing party (a) directs such Representatives to keep the information
confidential, (b) is responsible for any disclosure by its Representatives of
such information and (c) takes at its sole expense all reasonable measures to
restrain such Representatives from disclosing such information. If any party
receives a subpoena or other request for information from a third party (other
than a governmental regulatory body) for Confidential Information, the recipient
will promptly notify the other party and

 

            43    Sale and Servicing Agreement (SDART 2020-1)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

will provide the other party with the opportunity to object to the production of
its Confidential Information or seek other appropriate protective remedies,
consistent with the applicable requirements of law and regulation. If, in the
absence of a protective order, such party or any of its representatives are
compelled as a matter of law, regulation, legal process or by regulatory
authority to disclose any portion of the Confidential Information, such party
may disclose to the party compelling disclosure only the part of such
Confidential Information that is required to be disclosed. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the Indenture Trustee is the Requesting Party, the Indenture Trustee
may disclose Confidential Information with respect to an Asset Review to the
Requesting Investor which directed the Indenture Trustee in connection with such
Asset Review.

SECTION 9.25 Cooperation with Voting. Each of Santander Consumer, the Seller and
the Issuer hereby acknowledges and agrees that it shall cooperate with the
Indenture Trustee to facilitate any vote by the Instituting Noteholders pursuant
to the terms of Section 7.6 of the Indenture.

SECTION 9.26 European Securitization Rules. Santander Consumer hereby covenants
and agrees, in connection with the European Securitization Rules, in each case
as in effect and applicable on the Closing Date, on an ongoing basis, so long as
any Notes remain Outstanding:

(a) Santander Consumer, as “originator” (as such term is defined for the
purposes of the European Securitization Regulation), will retain upon issuance
of the Notes and on an ongoing basis a material net economic interest (the
“European Retained Interest”) of not less than 5% in the securitization
transaction described in the Prospectus, in the form of retention of a first
loss tranche, in accordance with the text of option (d) of Article 6(3) of the
European Securitization Regulation, by holding all the membership interest in
the Seller (or one or more other wholly-owned special purpose subsidiaries of
Santander Consumer), which in turn will retain a portion of the aggregate
Percentage Interests in the Certificates, such portion representing at least 5%
of the aggregate nominal value of the Receivables;

(b) Santander Consumer will not (and will not permit the Seller or any of its
other affiliates to) subject the European Retained Interest to any credit risk
mitigation or hedging, or sell, transfer or otherwise surrender all or part of
the rights, benefits or obligations arising from the European Retained Interest,
except, in each case, to the extent permitted in accordance with those European
Securitization Rules;

(c) Santander Consumer will not change the manner in which it retains the
European Retained Interest while any of the Notes are outstanding, except under
exceptional circumstances in accordance with those European Securitization
Rules; and

(d) Santander Consumer will provide ongoing confirmation of Santander Consumer’s
continued compliance with its obligations described in the foregoing clauses
(a), (b) and (c), (i) in or concurrently with the delivery of each Servicer’s
Certificate, (ii) on the occurrence of any Event of Default and (iii) from time
to time upon request by any Noteholder in connection with (x) any change in the
structural features of the securitization transaction described in the
Prospectus that could materially impact the performance of the Notes, (y) any
change in the

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

performance of the securitization transaction described in the Prospectus or of

the Notes, or (z) any material breach of the Transaction Documents.

For value received, in accordance with the Sale and Servicing Agreement
(the “Agreement”), dated as of April 22, 2020, by and between Santander Drive
Auto Receivables Trust 2020-1, a Delaware statutory trust (the “Issuer”),
Santander Drive Auto Receivables LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
“Seller”), Santander Consumer USA Inc., an Illinois corporation (“Santander
Consumer”), and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, a national banking
association (the “Indenture Trustee”), on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in the Agreement, the Seller does hereby irrevocably sell,
transfer, assign and otherwise convey to the Issuer on the Closing Date, without
recourse (subject to the obligations in the Agreement) all right, title and
interest of the Seller, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in, to and
under the Receivables set forth on the schedule of Receivables delivered by the
Seller to the Issuer on the date hereof, the Collections after the Cut-Off Date,
the Receivable Files and the Related Security relating thereto, together with
all of the Seller’s rights under the Purchase Agreement and all proceeds of the
foregoing, which sale shall be effective as of the Cut-Off Date.

The foregoing sale does not constitute and is not intended to result in an
assumption by the Issuer of any obligation of the Seller or the Originator to
the Obligors, the Dealers, insurers or any other Person in connection with the
Receivables or the other assets and properties conveyed hereunder or any
agreement, document or instrument related thereto.

PERFECTION REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

In addition to the representations, warranties and covenants contained in the
Agreement, the Seller hereby represents, warrants, and covenants to the Issuer
and the Indenture Trustee as follows on the Closing Date:

General

1. The Sale and Servicing Agreement creates a valid and continuing security
interest (as defined in the applicable UCC) in the Receivables and the other
Transferred Assets in favor of the Issuer, which security interest is prior to
all other Liens, and is enforceable as such as against creditors of and
purchasers from the Seller.

2. The Receivables constitute “tangible chattel paper” “electronic chattel
paper,” “accounts,” “instruments” or “general intangibles,” within the meaning
of the UCC.

3. Each Receivable is secured by a first priority validly perfected security
interest in the related Financed Vehicle in favor of the Originator (or its
assignee), as secured party, or all necessary actions with respect to such
Receivable have been taken or will be taken to perfect a first priority security
interest in the related Financed Vehicle in favor of the Originator (or its
assignee), as secured party.

Creation

4. Immediately prior to the sale, transfer, assignment and conveyance of a
Receivable by the Seller to the Issuer, the Seller owned and had good and
marketable title to such Receivable free and clear of any Lien created by
Santander Consumer (except any Lien which will be released prior to assignment
of such Receivable under the Sale and Servicing Agreement), and immediately
