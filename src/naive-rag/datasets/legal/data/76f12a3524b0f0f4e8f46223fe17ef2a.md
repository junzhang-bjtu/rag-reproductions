Certificate as filed with the



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assets are located in connection with the formation and continuation of the
Company and the commencement and carrying on of its business. Subject to the

Managing Member reasonably shall deem necessary, customary, convenient or
advisable.

1.2    Name. The name of the Company shall be MGP BREIT Venture 1 LLC. The

to perform all other activities necessary, customary, convenient or incidental
to the furtherance of the foregoing (collectively, the “Business”).

1.5    Powers. In furtherance of its Business, but subject to all of the
provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall, have and may exercise, all of
the powers and rights that can be conferred upon limited liability companies
formed pursuant to the Act, and may also engage in such other lawful business
purposes or activity in which a limited liability company may be engaged under

agreement or other undertaking, in each case, which the Managing Member deems

incidental to the furtherance of the Business.

Agreement.

foreign limited liability company statutes, or assumed or fictitious name
statutes or similar laws, in any jurisdiction in which the Company owns property
or transacts business to the extent, in the judgment of the Managing Member,

property or transact business. Each Person designated by the Managing Member as
an authorized person within the meaning of Section 18-204(a) of the Act shall
have the power and authority to execute, file and publish any certificates,
notices, statements or other documents (and any amendments and/or restatements

liability company in each jurisdiction where the Company elects to do business.
At the request of the Managing Member, each Member shall execute and deliver all
certificates and other instruments conforming with this Agreement that are
necessary or appropriate to qualify, register, continue and terminate the
Company as a foreign limited liability company in all such jurisdictions in
which the Company may reasonably be expected to conduct business; provided that

to qualify as a foreign corporation, limited liability company, partnership or
other entity in any jurisdiction in which it is not already so qualified.

Sponsor Member shall be permitted to deliver a Capital Call Notice to the
Members immediately upon reasonably determining that Non-Discretionary Capital
is required by the Company and without satisfying the requirements of clause
(i) or (ii) of the foregoing. The Members shall make, on or prior to the Due
Date, all Additional Capital Contributions pursuant to this Section 3.2.2 and
Section 3.2.3 in proportion to their then respective Percentage Interests. No
Member shall have any liability for failing to fund any Additional Capital
Contributions (including to fund any Non-Discretionary Capital) other than the
remedies provided in Section 3.3 and any such Member which fails to fund
Additional Capital Contributions shall not be in default of its obligations
under this Agreement.

3.2.3    Any Capital Call Notice shall contain a due date, which shall not be
fewer than ten (10) Business Days after the date such notice is delivered (the
“Due Date”), and each Member shall contribute to the Company its Additional
Capital Contributions in immediately available funds (United States dollars) by
such Due Date. The Managing Member shall cause the Company’s books and records
to be updated to reflect such Additional Capital Contributions and any
corresponding changes to the Members’ Capital Account balances as a result
thereof.

3.3    Optional Loans and Dilutive Contributions.

3.3.1    If a Member (in such capacity, a “Non-Contributing Member”) does not
advance in immediately available funds (United States dollars) to the Company
all or any portion of any Additional Capital Contributions required by it
pursuant to Section 3.2 (a “Failed Contribution”) by 5:00 p.m. local time in New
York, New York, on the Due Date therefor, a funding Member may (in such
capacity, a “Lending Eligible Member”), deliver, at any time within thirty
(30) days after the Due Date, a notice to the Non-Contributing Member (an
“Optional

 

-21-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contribution Notice”) that it may elect to fund such Failed Contribution. At any
time: (a) after the fifth Business Day following the date on which an Optional
Contribution Notice is delivered (such fifth Business Day, an “Outside
Contribution Date”), and (b) prior to such Non-Contributing Member making such
Failed Contribution, a Lending Eligible Member may, but shall not be obligated
to, advance to the Company an amount equal to the Failed Contribution and to
treat such advance as a loan (an “Optional Loan”) to the Non-Contributing
Member, which Optional Loan shall be recourse only to the Non-Contributing
Member’s Interest. The Lending Eligible Member that makes the Optional Loan is
referred to herein as the “Lending Member.” Any Lending Member shall be entitled
to structure such Optional Loan in a manner it reasonably deems necessary to
satisfy all applicable REIT requirements (including, without limitation, all
REIT income and asset requirements), including (1) by electing to provide such
capital in the form of preferred equity of the Company rather than debt,
(2) subject to compliance with all Credit Arrangements, by making the Optional
Loan (or preferred equity investment) directly to (or in) the Company or one or
more Subsidiaries (including the Property Owners), (3) having the Optional Loan
secured by the Non-Contributing Member’s interest in the Company, or (4) by
having an Affiliate of such Lending Member provide the Optional Loan (or
preferred equity investment); provided that the economic terms and substantive
rights of such Lending Member, the Non-Contributing Member, the Company and any
Subsidiary pursuant to any such alternative structure shall be the same in all
material respects as if such Lending Member had made an Optional Loan pursuant
to the express provisions of this Section 3.3.1.

3.3.2    If an Optional Loan(s) shall be made in accordance with this
Section 3.3, the Lending Member shall notify the Non-Contributing Member and the
Company of the amount and date of the Optional Loan(s), and the Capital Account
balance of the Non-Contributing Member shall be credited to reflect the payment
of the proceeds of the Optional Loan to the Company. Each Optional Loan that is
treated as a loan to the Non-Contributing Member after taking into account the
REIT considerations described in Section 3.3.1 above shall be deemed to be made
to the Non-Contributing Member, with the proceeds of each Optional Loan
delivered by the Lending Member to the Company in immediately available funds
(United States dollars) on such Non-Contributing Member’s behalf and the full
amount of such Optional Loan shall be deemed a Capital Contribution by the
Non-Contributing Member for all purposes of this Agreement. An Optional Loan
shall be deemed to have been advanced on the date actually advanced by the
Lending Member to the Company. Optional Loans shall earn interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof at a rate equal to the Optional Loan Rate
from the date actually advanced by the Lending Member to the Company until the
date the same is repaid in full, compounding quarterly.

3.3.3    Optional Loans shall only be repayable by and collectible from the
Non-Contributing Member as set forth in this Section 3.3. An Optional Loan
(together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon) may be repaid by a
Non-Contributing Member at any time. If an Optional Loan is made, the
Non-Contributing Member shall not receive any distributions pursuant to
Articles 4 and 8 while the Optional Loan remains unpaid. Instead, the
Non-Contributing Member’s share of all such distributions or such other proceeds
shall (until all Optional Loans made to such Non-Contributing Member plus all
accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, shall have been paid in full) first
be paid to the Lending Member. Such payments shall be applied first to the
payment of any accrued and unpaid interest on such Optional Loans and then to
the repayment of the principal amounts thereof, but shall be considered, for all
other

 

-22-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

purposes of this Agreement, to have been distributed to the Non-Contributing
Member. Such Non-Contributing Member’s right to receive distributions shall be
immediately reinstated prospectively upon the full repayment of an Optional
Loan, including all accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the Lending Member.

3.3.4    Intentionally Omitted.

3.3.5    Intentionally Omitted.

3.3.6    If (a) a Lending Eligible Member provides an Optional Contribution
Notice to the Non-Contributing Member as provided in Section 3.3.1 above,
(b) the Non-Contributing Member does not make the Additional Capital
Contribution on or before the Outside Contribution Date, and (c) no other
Lending Eligible Member elects to make an Optional Loan on or before the Outside
Contribution Date, then each Lending Eligible Member may elect, in lieu of
making an Optional Loan, at any time within thirty (30) days after the Outside
Contribution Date, by notice to the Company and the Non-Contributing Member, to
have the Company return the Additional Capital Contribution advanced by such
Lending Eligible Member and, promptly following the Company’s receipt of such
notice, the Company shall return such corresponding Additional Capital
Contribution to the Lending Eligible Member (with a corresponding debit to such
Lending Eligible Member’s Capital Account and Capital Contribution balances).

3.3.7    A Lending Eligible Member may fund a Failed Contribution as an
Additional Capital Contribution from such Lending Eligible Member to the Company
(a “Dilutive Contribution”) in lieu of making an Optional Loan, in which case:

(a)     the Percentage Interest of such Lending Eligible Member shall be
adjusted and shall be amended in order to reflect an increase in such Member’s
Percentage Interest by adding thereto a percentage amount equal to the product
of (A) 1.5 times (B) the quotient (expressed as a percentage) of (I) the amount
of the applicable Dilutive Contribution made by such Lending Eligible Member
divided by (II) the sum of the total Capital Contributions made by all of the
Members (including the applicable Dilutive Contribution and all other Dilutive
Contributions) through and including the date that the Lending Eligible Member
made the Dilutive Contribution; and

(b)    the Percentage Interest of the Non-Contributing Member shall be reduced
by the percentage amount added to the Percentage Interest of the Lending
Eligible Member pursuant to clause (a) above.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Percentage Interest of any
Member be greater than 100% or reduced by more than 10 percentage points in
total as a result of the foregoing dilution (whether as a result of one or more
Dilutive Contributions).

3.4    Capital Accounts. A Capital Account shall be established and maintained
for each Member in accordance with Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and
1.704-2 and the terms of this Agreement to the extent such terms are consistent
with the applicable Regulations.

3.5    Return of Capital. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement: (a) no
Member shall demand or be entitled to receive a return of or interest on its
Capital Contributions

 

-23-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

or Capital Account balance, (b) no Member shall withdraw any portion of its
Capital Contributions or receive any distributions from the Company as a return
of capital on account of such Capital Contributions, (c) the Company shall not
redeem or repurchase the Interest of any Member, and (d) no Member shall be
personally liable for the return of all or any part of any Capital Contribution
of the other Members.

3.6    Liability of Members. Except as otherwise required by any non-waivable
provision of the Act or other applicable law: (a) no Member shall be personally
liable in any manner whatsoever for any debt, liability or other obligation of
the Company (including all Credit Arrangements), whether such debt, liability or
other obligation arises in contract, tort, or otherwise; (b) no Member shall in
any event have any personal liability whatsoever in excess of the amount of any
wrongful distribution to such Member, except if, and only to the extent, such
Member has actual knowledge (at the time of the distribution) that such
distribution is made in violation of the Act; and (c) no Member shall have any
liability for failing to fund any Capital Contributions other than the remedies
provided in Section 3.3.

3.7     Member Loans.

3.7.1    No Member shall be required to make any loans or otherwise lend any
funds to the Company or its Subsidiaries.

3.7.2    No loans made by any Member to the Company shall have any effect on
such Member’s Capital Account balance, Capital Contributions or Percentage
Interest, such loans representing a debt of the Company payable or collectible
solely from the assets of the Company in accordance with the terms and
conditions upon which such loans were made.

3.8    Credit Arrangements.

3.8.1    The Members acknowledge that, as of the Effective Date, the Company and
its Subsidiaries have entered into the financings described on Schedule 1
attached hereto (the “Initial Financing”) and MGP Guarantor and Sponsor
Guarantor have each delivered the Permitted Carveout Guaranty described in
Schedule 1 attached hereto and MGM has delivered the MGM Guaranty in accordance
with the terms of the MTA.

3.8.2     Subject to the terms of this Section 3.8, the Managing Member may,
from time to time, cause the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to borrow
funds or enter into any financing or refinancing arrangements (collectively,
“Credit Arrangements”) with one or more lenders (a “Lender”) for any purpose
consistent with the purpose of the Company, and to pledge, enter into a negative
pledge or otherwise secure Credit Arrangements with or with respect to any
Company Assets; provided, (i) except as expressly provided in Section 3.8.4, no
Member or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be required to incur any personal
liability in connection with any Credit Arrangement, and (ii) no such Credit
Arrangements shall restrict any Transfer in or by any Member which is otherwise
permitted by the terms of this Agreement without the consent of such Member,
provided that each Member acknowledges that Credit Arrangements may require that
certain specified Transfers comply with customary ministerial, administrative
and prohibited person requirements (e.g., completed KYC forms, the delivery of
required notices, etc.).

 

-24-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.8.3    MGP Member and Sponsor Member shall be jointly responsible for
pursuing, approving and obtaining Credit Arrangements; provided that, Sponsor
Member shall have the authority to manage the day to day pursuit of the Credit
Arrangement (subject to the last sentence in this Section). The Sponsor Member
agrees to begin to diligently pursue a refinancing of each Credit Arrangement no
earlier than twelve (12) months and no later than six (6) months prior to the
maturity of such Credit Arrangement. With respect to each refinancing of a
Credit Arrangement, the Sponsor Member shall pursue a refinancing that is a
Targeted Financing. The Sponsor Member shall consult with the MGP Member and
keep the MGP Member reasonably informed on a current basis and in reasonable
detail of the status of its efforts to arrange each refinancing of a Credit
Arrangement. Except as provided in the last sentence in this Section, so long as
the Sponsor Member is diligently pursuing each such refinancing, the MGP Member
shall refrain from simultaneously pursuing a refinancing of a Credit
Arrangement. In the event the Sponsor Member is successful in arranging a
proposed Credit Arrangement that is a Targeted Financing that can be obtained by
the Company within the six (6) month period prior to the maturity of the
existing Credit Arrangement it is intended to refinance (subject to the last
sentence in this Section), each of MGP Member and Sponsor Member agree to be
reasonable and cooperate in causing the Company to complete such Credit
Arrangement; provided, that the definitive terms of any such Credit Agreement
shall be subject to the prior approval of the MGP Member, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. In the event that the Sponsor Member (i) has
not finalized arranging a proposed Credit Arrangement that is a Targeted
Financing at least three (3) months prior to the maturity of the Credit
Arrangement it is intended to refinance or (ii) has arranged for but has failed
to close a proposed Credit Arrangement that is a Targeted Financing at least two
(2) months prior to the maturity of the Credit Arrangement it is intended to
refinance, then upon notice from the MGP Member, the Sponsor Member shall cease
pursuing such refinancing and the MGP Member shall diligently pursue such
refinancing of such Credit Arrangement with a Targeted Financing in order to
refinance such Credit Arrangement.

3.8.4    Further, each of the Members agrees, at the expense of and subject to
reimbursement from the Company, to provide and to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their respective officers, employees and advisors to
provide reasonable cooperation as reasonably required for the completion of any
such Credit Arrangement that has been arranged in accordance with Section 3.8.2
and Section 3.8.3, including (i) executing and delivering (or causing to be
delivered) such organizational documents, opinions, certificates and similar
documents as are reasonably requested in connection with any such Credit
Arrangement, (ii) making available financial information regarding the
Properties, the Company and the Carveout Guarantors in the same manner as what
was provided in connection with the Initial Financing, and (iii) using
reasonable efforts to obtain estoppel certificates and nondisturbance agreements
from tenants and subtenants of the Properties and the counterparties under other
material agreements affecting the Properties.

3.8.5    In connection with any Credit Arrangements, if a Lender requires (i) an
MGP Guarantor to enter into a Permitted Carveout Guaranty in connection with
such Credit Arrangement, the MGP Member shall cause the MGP Guarantor to execute
and deliver such Permitted Carveout Guaranty, upon such terms as shall be
reasonably approved by the MGP Member and (ii) a Sponsor Guarantor to enter into
a Permitted Carveout Guaranty in connection with such Credit Arrangement, the
Sponsor Member shall cause the Sponsor Guarantor to execute and deliver such
Permitted Carveout Guaranty, upon such terms as shall be reasonably approved

 

-25-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

by the Sponsor Member. In connection with the execution and delivery of the
Permitted Carveout Guaranties with respect to the Initial Financing, the Members
and the Carevout Guarantors have executed and delivered the Carveout
Contribution Agreement. In the event one or more Permitted Carveout Guaranties
are executed and delivered with respect to any other Credit Arrangements, the
Members and the Carevout Guarantors, (and, in the event there is not a Sponsor
Guarantor under any such Credit Agreement, BREIT OP or such other Affiliate of
the Sponsor Member reasonably acceptable to MGP Member) shall execute and
deliver a contribution agreement on substantially the same terms as the Carveout
Contribution Agreement with respect to such Permitted Carveout Guaranties.

3.8.6    To the extent that any amounts are actually paid under any Permitted
Carveout Guaranty (a “Guaranty Payment”), then (i) the applicable Member which
is Affiliated with the guarantor which made such Guaranty Payment shall be
deemed to have made an Additional Capital Contribution equal to its Percentage
Interest of such Guaranty Payment and (ii) the Managing Member shall send an
Additional Capital Contribution notice as required by Section 3.2.2 hereof, to
the Member who is not Affiliated with such guarantor to make an Additional
Capital Contribution in the amount of its Percentage Interests of such Guaranty
Payment; provided, however, that any Guaranty Payment shall not be deemed to be
an Additional Capital Contribution if the obligation to make such payment was
due to any Bad Act committed by the Member Affiliated with such guarantor and
the amount paid pursuant to such Guaranty Payment did not fully reduce the
principal amount of debt outstanding. To the extent that such non-Affiliated
Member makes such contribution, the Company shall distribute it to the Member
which is Affiliated with the guarantor which made such Guaranty Payment. To the
extent that such non-Affiliated Member fails to make such contribution, the
Affiliated Member shall be deemed a Lending Eligible Member under Section 3.3
which funded such amount, at its option, as either an Optional Loan or a
Dilutive Contribution.

3.8.7    At any time the Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into a Credit
Arrangement (other than the Initial Financing), the Member which completed such
Credit Arrangement on behalf of the Company pursuant to Section 3.8.3 shall
provide prompt written notice to the other Member and copies of the final loan
documents entered into in connection with such Credit Arrangement.

ARTICLE 4

DISTRIBUTIONS

4.1    Distributions of Cash Available for Distribution.

4.1.1    Generally. Except as expressly provided in this Article 4 and
Article 8, no Member shall be entitled to receive distributions from the
Company.

4.1.2    Timing of Distributions. The Managing Member shall cause the Company to
distribute (a) all Capital Proceeds within twenty (20) Business Days of a
Capital Event and (b) all other Cash Available for Distribution for each
calendar month no later than the Monthly Payment Date for the relevant month, in
each case excluding distributions in conjunction with the final liquidation of
the Company which shall be governed by Section 4.2 and Article 8.

 

-26-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.1.3    Debt Financing Distribution. The Managing Member shall cause the
Company to distribute the Debt Financing Distribution (as defined in the MTA)
solely to MGP Member.

4.1.4    Distributions of Cash Available for Distribution. Cash Available for
Distribution (if any) (excluding distributions in conjunction with the final
liquidation of the Company which shall be governed by Section 4.2 and Article 8)
shall be apportioned between the Members, pari passu in proportion to their
respective Percentage Interests at the time of such Distribution.

4.2    Distributions Upon Liquidation. Distributions made in conjunction with
the final liquidation of the Company (including as a result of the Capital
Events described in Section 8.2(b)) shall be applied or distributed as provided
in Article 8.

4.3    Withholding. The amount of any federal, state, local or foreign taxes
paid by or withheld from receipts of the Company (or any entity in which the
Company invests) pursuant to any applicable rule, regulation or law that the
Managing Member reasonably determines is distributable or allocable to a Member
pursuant to this Agreement, including pursuant to Code Section 6225 (“Tax
Advances”) shall be treated as having been distributed to such Member as an
advance against the next distributions that would otherwise be made to such
Member, and such amount shall be satisfied by setoff from such next
distributions. Each Member will furnish the Managing Member with such
information as may reasonably be requested by the Managing Member from time to
time to determine whether withholding is required, and each Member will promptly
notify the Managing Member if such Member determines at any time that it is
subject to withholding. Each Member hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Company and the Managing Member and any partner or officer of the Managing
Member and the Members from and against any liability, claim or expense with
respect to Tax Advances made or required to be made on behalf of or with respect
to such Member. In the event the Company is liquidated and a liability or claim
is asserted against, or expense borne by, the Managing Member or any partner or
officer of the Managing Member for Tax Advances made or required to be made, the
Managing Member shall have the right to be reimbursed from the Member on whose
behalf such Tax Advance was made or required to be made. The obligations of a
Member set forth in this Section 4.3 shall survive the withdrawal of any Member
from the Company or any transfer of a Membership Interest.

4.4    Distributions in Kind. No right is given to any Member to demand or
receive property other than cash as provided in this Agreement. The Managing
Member may make a distribution-in-kind of Company Assets to the Members. In the
event of such a distribution-in-kind, such Company Assets shall be distributed
in such a fashion as to ensure that the fair market value thereof is distributed
and allocated in accordance with this Article 4, Article 5 and Article 8 hereof;
provided, however, that except upon a dissolution and winding up of the Company
(i) no Member shall be compelled to accept a distribution consisting, in whole
or in part, of any Company Assets in kind unless the ratio that the fair market
value of such distribution-in-kind bears to such Member’s total distribution
does not exceed the ratio that the fair market value of similar
distributions-in-kind bears to the total distributions of other Members
receiving distributions concurrently therewith (if any), and (ii) any such
distribution-in-kind to the Members shall be of the same type and character
(i.e., if the distribution to one Member is made in specific securities,

 

-27-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

then any distribution made to the other Members shall be made in the same
securities), and no Member shall be required to accept any distribution-in-kind
that is not the same type and character as the distribution-in-kind being
offered to the other Members.

4.5    Limitations on Distributions. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither the Company nor the Managing
Member, on behalf of the Company, shall make a distribution to any Person in
violation of the Act or other applicable law.

4.6    Carveout Contribution Agreement. The Members acknowledge and agree that
pursuant to the terms of Section 1(d) of the Carveout Contribution Agreement,
certain distributions which are payable to a Member under this Agreement may
instead be paid pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Section 1(d) of
the Carveout Contribution Agreement.

ARTICLE 5

ALLOCATIONS OF NET PROFITS AND NET LOSSES

5.1    General Allocations of Net Profits and Losses. After giving effect to the
special allocations set forth in Section 5.2, Net Profits and Net Losses of the
Company, including each item of income, gain, loss credit and deduction, for
each fiscal year or other applicable period, shall be allocated among the
Members in a manner such that the Capital Account of each Member immediately
after giving effect to such allocation is, as nearly as possible, equal
(proportionately) to the amount of the distributions that would have been made
to such Member during such fiscal year or other applicable period if: (i) the
Company were dissolved and terminated; (ii) its affairs were wound up and each
Company Asset was sold for cash equal to its Gross Asset Value; (iii) all
Company liabilities were satisfied (limited with respect to each nonrecourse
liability to the Gross Asset Value of the assets securing such liability); and
(iv) the net assets of the Company were distributed in accordance with
Section 4.1 to such Members immediately after giving effect to such allocation,
minus such Member’s share of Company Minimum Gain and Member Minimum Gain, each
computed immediately prior to the hypothetical sale of the Company’s Assets.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Managing Member may make such allocations as
it deems reasonably necessary to give economic effect to the provisions of this
Agreement, taking into account facts and circumstances as the Managing Member
deems reasonably necessary for this purpose.

5.2     Regulatory Allocations. The following special allocations shall be made
in the following order of priority:

5.2.1    If there is a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during a Company
taxable year, then each Member shall be allocated items of Company income and
gain for such taxable year (and, if necessary, for subsequent years) in an
amount equal to such Member’s share of the net decrease in Company Minimum Gain,
determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)(2). This
Section 5.2.1 is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement
of Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.

5.2.2    If there is a net decrease in Member Minimum Gain attributable to a
Member Nonrecourse Debt during any Company taxable year, each Member who has a
share of the Member Minimum Gain attributable to such Member Nonrecourse Debt,
determined in

 

-28-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially allocated
items of Company income and gain for such taxable year (and, if necessary,
subsequent years) in an amount equal to such Member’s share of the net decrease
in Member Minimum Gain attributable to such Member Nonrecourse Debt, determined
in a manner consistent with the provisions of Regulations Section 1.704-2(g)(2).
This Section 5.2.2 is intended to comply with the partner nonrecourse debt
minimum gain chargeback requirement of Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) and
shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

5.2.3    If any Member unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation, or
distribution of the type contemplated by
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6), items of income and
gain shall be allocated to all such Members (in proportion to the amounts of
their respective Adjusted Capital Account Deficits) in an amount and manner
sufficient to eliminate the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of such Member as
quickly as possible. It is intended that this Section 5.2.3 qualify and be
construed as a “qualified income offset” within the meaning of
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d).

5.2.4    If the allocation of income, gain, loss or deduction (or an item
thereof) to a Member as provided in Section 5.1 would create or increase an
Adjusted Capital Account Deficit, there shall be allocated to such Member only
that amount of income, gain, loss or deduction (or an item thereof) as will not
create or increase an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit. The allocated item that
would, absent the application of the preceding sentence, otherwise be allocated
to such Member shall be allocated to the other Members in accordance with their
relative Percentage Interests, subject to the limitations of this Section 5.2.4.

5.2.5    To the extent that an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any
Company Asset pursuant to Code Section 734(b) or Code Section 743(b) is
required, pursuant to Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4), to be taken into account in
determining Capital Accounts as the result of a distribution to a Member in
complete liquidation of its Interest, the amount of such adjustment to the
Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment
increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such
basis), and such gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Members in
accordance with their interests in the Company in the event that
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) applies, or to the Members to whom
such distribution was made in the event that
Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) applies.

5.2.6    The Nonrecourse Deductions for each taxable year of the Company shall
be allocated among the Members in proportion to their relative Percentage
Interests or in any other way determined by the Managing Member to be consistent
with the applicable Regulations.

5.2.7    The Member Nonrecourse Deductions for each taxable year of the Company
shall be allocated in a manner consistent with applicable law, as reasonably
determined by Managing Member.

5.2.8    The allocations set forth in Sections 5.2.1, 5.2.2, 5.2.3, 5.2.4,
5.2.5, 5.2.6 and 5.2.7 (the “Regulatory Allocations”) are intended to comply
with certain requirements of Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2(i).
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1, the Regulatory Allocations shall
be taken into account in allocating other items of income, gain,

 

-29-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

loss and deduction among the Members so that, to the extent possible, the net
amount of such allocations of other items and the Regulatory Allocations to each
Member shall be equal to the net amount that would have been allocated to each
such Member if the Regulatory Allocations had not occurred.

5.3    Allocations in Connection with Liquidations. Notwithstanding the
allocation provisions set forth in Section 5.1, but subject to Section 5.2, all
Net Profits or Net Losses realized in connection with the dissolution of the
Company in accordance with Article 8 shall be allocated to the Members in a
manner so that the distributions to each Member pursuant to Section 4.2 and
Article 8 shall, to the greatest extent possible, be equal to that amount that
each such Member would receive under Section 4.1 if the amounts to be
distributed by the Company in connection with such dissolution were instead
distributed under such Section 4.1.

5.4    Tax Allocations.

5.4.1    Except as provided in Section 5.4.2, for income tax purposes under the
Code and the Regulations, each Company item of income, gain, loss and deduction
shall be allocated between the Members as its correlative item of “book” income,
gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to this Article 5.

5.4.2    Tax items with respect to the Properties with a Gross Asset Value that
varies from their basis in the hands of the MGP Member immediately preceding the
date of such contribution, shall be allocated between the Members for income tax
purposes in accordance with Section 9.6.5(d). Allocations pursuant to this
Section 5.4.2 are solely for purposes of federal, state and local taxes and
shall not affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing, any Member’s
Capital Account or share of Net Profits, Net Losses and any other items or
distributions pursuant to any provision of this Agreement.

5.5    Other Provisions.

5.5.1    For any fiscal year or other period during which any part of a
Membership Interest or Economic Interest is Transferred between the Members or
to another Person, the portion of the Net Profits, Net Losses and other items of
income, gain, loss, deduction and credit that are allocable with respect to such
part of a Membership Interest or Economic Interest shall be apportioned between
the transferor and the transferee under the “interim closing of the books”
method pursuant to Code Section 706 and the applicable Regulations.

5.5.2    In the event that the Code or any Regulations require allocations of
items of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit different from those set forth
in this Article 5, the Managing Member is hereby authorized to make new
allocations in reliance on the Code and such Regulations, and no such new
allocation shall give rise to any claim or cause of action by any Member;
provided that the Managing Member shall, to the extent possible and consistent
with applicable law, make such new allocations in a manner consistent with the
provisions of this Agreement as if such new allocation was not required.

5.5.3    The Members acknowledge and are aware of the income tax consequences of
the allocations made by this Article 5 and hereby agree to be bound by the
provisions of this Article 5 in reporting their shares of Net Profits, Net
Losses and other items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit for federal,
state and local income tax purposes.

ARTICLE 6

OPERATIONS

6.1    Management.

6.1.1    Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Managing
Member shall have sole and complete charge and management of all the affairs and
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in all respects and in all matters
and shall have full, exclusive and complete discretion to manage and control the
business and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to make all decisions
affecting the business and affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to
take all such actions as it deems necessary or appropriate to accomplish the
purposes and direct the affairs of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

6.1.2    Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Managing Member
shall have the sole power and authority to bind the Company, except and to the
extent that such power is expressly delegated in writing to any other Person by
the Managing Member (including, without limitation, through the appointment of
officers of the Company).

6.1.3    The Managing Member may appoint one or more individuals to manage the
day-to-day business affairs of the Company (the “Officers”). The Officers shall
serve at the pleasure of the Managing Member. To the extent delegated by the
Managing Member, the Officers shall have the authority to act on behalf of, and
bind, execute and deliver documents in the name and on behalf of, the Company.
Unless otherwise specified by the Managing Member, such Officers shall have such
authority and responsibility in respect of the Company as is generally
attributable to the holders of such offices in corporations incorporated under
the laws of Delaware. In addition, the Managing Member may designate such other
Persons to act as agents of the Company’s business as the Managing Member shall
determine in its sole and absolute discretion, and the actions of such other
Persons taken in such capacity and in accordance with this Agreement shall bind
the Company to the same extent the Managing Member is authorized to bind the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.1.3, in no
event shall the Managing Member be permitted to delegate any authority to an
Officer or otherwise, unless the Managing Member has first obtained any required
approval for the actions underlying such delegation in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. Any delegation by the Managing Member to an
Officer or otherwise shall not relieve the Managing Member of its duties or
obligations under this Agreement.

6.1.4    Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or as the
Managing Member may delegate, the other Members shall not participate in the
management of the Company, and shall have no right, power or authority to act
for or on behalf of, or otherwise bind, the Company. Except as expressly
provided in this Agreement or required by any non-waivable provisions of
applicable law, Members shall have no right to vote on or consent to any other
matter, act, decision, or document involving the Company or its business. No
Member shall take any action in the name of or on behalf of the Company,
including, without limitation, assuming any obligation or responsibility on
behalf of the Company, unless such action, and the taking thereof by such
Member, shall have been expressly authorized by the Managing Member or shall be
expressly and specifically authorized by this Agreement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.1.5    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this
Section 6.1, but subject to the other express limitations and provisions of this
Agreement requiring the consent of the Sponsor Member, or, if MGP Member has
been removed as Managing Member, MGP Member, including Section 6.3, in
furtherance of the Company’s purpose as set forth in Section 1.4, the Managing
Member (on behalf of the Company) shall have full and complete power and
authority, without the approval of any Member:

(a)    to take all actions necessary to fulfill the Company’s purpose set forth
in Section 1.4;

(b)    to negotiate, enter into, perform, modify, extend, terminate, amend,
waive, renegotiate, and/or carry out any contracts and agreements of any kind
and nature, including, without limitation, contracts and agreements with any
Person, including any Member or Assignee, or any Affiliate thereof, or any other
agent of the Company, as the Managing Member deems necessary or advisable;

(c)    to, from time to time, employ, engage, hire, or otherwise secure the
services of such Persons, including any Member or Assignee, or any Affiliate
thereof, as the Managing Member may deem necessary or advisable for the
administration of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries;

(d)    to exercise or waive any and all rights on behalf of the Company or its
Subsidiaries;

Subsidiaries for any general purpose of the Company or its Subsidiaries in
accordance with the terms of Sections 3.8; and

(h)    to control all other aspects of the business and operations of the
Company that the Managing Member elects to so control.

6.1.6    The Managing Member is authorized to retain an Affiliate of the
Managing Member, to provide corporate services, tax advisory, accounting and
related back-office functions to the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided,
that such services are on terms no less favorable than that which could be
obtained in an arm’s-length, market-rate transaction with a Third Party
unaffiliated with Managing Member.

6.1.7    The Managing Member shall cause the Company to make each of the
Required Tax Elections.

 

-32-

6.2    Enforcement of the Lease.

6.2.1    Managing Member shall cause the Company to cause each of its
Subsidiaries that is party to a Lease Document to enforce the obligations of
each Tenant Party under each Lease Document in all material respects, provided
if exercising or refraining from exercising any such Subsidiaries’ rights would
constitute a Major Decision, MGP Member shall first obtain the consent of the
Sponsor Member in accordance with Section 6.3 to such action.

6.2.2    If (i) any Tenant Party commits a breach or default in the performance
of any of its material obligations under a Lease Document, (ii) such breach or
default continues beyond the expiration of any applicable notice and cure period
provided therein (provided that, subject to obtaining any consent of the Sponsor
Member required in accordance with Section 6.3, the Managing Member shall be
obligated to promptly provide any required notice to the applicable Tenant Party
under such Lease Document with respect to such breach or default as and when
required under such Lease Document, and promptly deliver a copy of any such
notice to the Sponsor Member) and (iii) subject to obtaining any consent of the
Sponsor Member required in accordance with Section 6.3, the Managing Member
shall fail to cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to take commercially
reasonable steps to enforce against the applicable Tenant Party the terms of
such Lease Document, then the Sponsor Member may notify the Managing Member of
such failure. If such failure shall continue for ten (10) Business Days after
the date on which such notice is delivered, or if the Company or applicable
Subsidiary that is party to such Lease Document shall otherwise become entitled
to terminate such Lease Document pursuant to the terms thereof, then the Sponsor
Member shall thereafter have the right (but not the obligation) to exercise, on
behalf of the Company or the applicable Subsidiary, all rights of the Company or
the applicable Subsidiary, as the case may be, as a party to such Lease
Document, including the right to terminate such Lease Document (if and to the
extent such Lease Document provides for such termination as a remedy under such
circumstances) and/or to institute litigation against such Tenant Party, in each
case, upon and subject to the applicable provisions of the applicable Lease
Document (including, without limitation, any notice requirements and cure
periods provided for therein to the extent such cure periods shall not
theretofore have expired).

6.2.3    In the event of a Bankruptcy of any Tenant or MGM, Sponsor Member shall
have the authority on behalf of the Company and the Property Owners to exercise
any rights or remedies in respect of such Bankruptcy available to the Company
and the Property Owners and the Managing Member shall not take any such actions
without the prior consent of Sponsor Member.

favorable than that which could be obtained in an arm’s length, market-rate

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any request for consent to or

its request for such approval through a written notice in accordance with this
Agreement to the extent Sponsor Member otherwise receives a copy

 

-36-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of all such requests from the Tenant (including all required follow-up requests)
in accordance with the delivery requirements set forth in the Lease. If Sponsor
Member does not notify Managing Member of any objection to any such notices
delivered by the Tenant under the Lease prior to such Item Subject to Deemed
Consent being deemed approved by the “Landlord” under the Lease in accordance
with the terms of the Lease, then Managing Member shall no longer be required to
obtain the approval or consent of Sponsor Member to approve, consent to or waive
such action and Sponsor Member shall be deemed to have approved the applicable
Lease Document Major Decision as of such time.

In the event Sponsor Member believes MGP Member, as Managing Member has taken or
caused the Company to take or implement any action considered a Major Decision
without the prior written consent of Sponsor Member, Sponsor Member shall
provide notice to MGP Member detailing what action was taken and what Major
Decision it relates to, and in the event (i) such action was taken by MGP Member
without knowingly and willfully breaching Section 6.3.1, and (ii) can be
reversed or rescinded at no cost or liability to the Company, then the MGP
Member shall then have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice from
Sponsor Member to cure any such action taken by reversing or rescinding such
action at no liability to the Company, provided that if such action cannot
reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period and MGP Member shall have
commenced to cure such action within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter
diligently and expeditiously proceeds to cure the same, such thirty (30) day
period shall be extended for up to an additional sixty (60) day period. In the
event MGP Member timely cures a breach of Section 6.3.1 in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence, such breach shall not be the basis for a For
Cause Removal Event under clause (ii) of the definition thereof. Nothing in this
paragraph shall limit the Sponsor Member from challenging any Major Decision
taken without the prior written consent of Sponsor Member as being unauthorized
and void ab initio.

6.3.2    Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, the Managing
Member shall have no authority to: (a) do any act in contravention of this
Agreement; or (b) knowingly perform any act that would subject any Member or any
of its Affiliates to liability for the debts, liabilities or obligations of the
Company or another Member (provided, the foregoing shall in no way restrict the
execution of a Permitted Carveout Guarantee in accordance with Section 3.8.5).

6.3.3    Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, in the event
that the applicable Property Owner is required to sell a Property subject to the
Lease in accordance with Section 8.2(b) of the Lease, the MGP Member and the
Sponsor Member shall jointly approve the terms of any such sale.

6.3.4    The Company and the Members acknowledge and agree that MGP REIT is the
indirect parent of MGP Member and BREIT is the indirect parent of the Sponsor
Member, and each of MGP REIT, BREIT and Sponsor Member has elected to be treated
as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is
therefore subject to the requirements set forth in Code Sections 856 through
859. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Member acknowledges
and agrees that, for so long as MGP REIT, BREIT or Sponsor Member directly or
indirectly owns interests in the Company, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to operate, and the Managing Member is hereby authorized and
directed to cause the Company to be operated, in a manner (and, in accordance
therewith, make

 

-37-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

timely distributions of Cash Available for Distribution to the Members in
accordance with the terms of Article 4) so that MGP REIT, BREIT and/or Sponsor
Member can continue to so qualify and avoid federal income and excise tax
liability to the extent permitted under the Code.

6.4    Removal of Managing Member.

6.4.1     Upon a Removal Event (other than a Removal Event arising out of a
Bankruptcy of MGP Member), Sponsor Member may elect (in its sole discretion) to
immediately remove MGP Member as Managing Member, in which event Sponsor Member
may appoint a new Managing Member (in its sole discretion) which may be Sponsor
Member, an Affiliate of Sponsor Member or a Third Party (the “New Managing
Member”) and thereafter, MGP Member shall immediately cease to have any rights
as Managing Member and New Managing Member shall succeed to all the rights and
obligations of the former Managing Member (in its capacity as Managing Member)
hereunder. In the event of a Removal Event arising out of a Bankruptcy of MGP
Member, MGP Member shall automatically, and without the need for notice or
action by any Member, cease to have any rights as Managing Member and Sponsor
Member shall automatically, and without the need for notice or action by any
Member, become the New Managing Member and succeed to all the rights and
obligations of the former Managing Member (in its capacity as Managing Member)
hereunder.

6.4.2    In the event of the removal of the Managing Member pursuant to
Section 6.4.1, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit or otherwise
prevent the Sponsor Member on behalf of itself, or on behalf of the Company or
any Subsidiary, from exercising any other right of Company or any Subsidiary,
against the MGP Member or any Affiliate thereof, whether at law or in equity;
provided, however, that following the removal of the Managing Member pursuant to
Section 6.4.1, the MGP Member shall continue to be entitled to indemnification
hereunder pursuant to Section 6.8 in its capacity as Managing Member with
respect to the time period prior to such removal, and the MGP Member shall still
have all of its rights as a Member and as the MGP Member (as opposed to in its
capacity as the Managing Member), including (i) its right to receive
distributions, (ii) its approval rights as modified by Section 6.4.4, and
(iii) its rights to indemnification hereunder pursuant to Section 6.8.

6.4.3    In the event MGP Member is removed as Managing Member, MGP Member shall
promptly (i) deliver all books of account records, files and bank statements of
the Company to New Managing Member, (ii) execute, acknowledge and/or deliver
such other instruments as may be reasonably requested in order to effectuate an
orderly transition to New Managing Member, and (iii) otherwise cooperate with
the reasonable requests of Sponsor Member in order to effectuate an orderly
transition to New Managing Member. In the event that the consent of a lender
under a Credit Arrangement is necessary to remove the Managing Member, to
appoint New Managing Member, or both, then MGP Member shall, as requested by New
Managing Member, cooperate and take all action and execute all documents
reasonably necessary or appropriate to obtain such consent or to satisfy such
condition.

6.4.4    In the event MGP Member is removed as Managing Member as a result of an
occurrence described under clauses (i) or (iii) of the definition of “Removal
Event”, the New Managing Member shall not (nor permit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to) take any action which would constitute a Major Decision without
the consent of MGP Member, other

 

-38-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

than a Lease Document Major Decision or New Lease Major Decision which New
Managing Member shall be permitted to take (or cause the Company or its
Subsidiaries to take) such actions without the consent or approval of MGP Member
so long as such action is taken in good faith, does not adversely affect MGP
Member in a manner disproportionate to the other Members (and without regard to
any affiliation between the MGP Member and MGM or the Other MGM/MGP
Arrangements) and is not a transaction with an Affiliate of the New Managing
Member. In the event MGP Member is removed as Managing Member as a result of a
For Cause Removal Event, New Managing Member is expressly permitted to take (or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take) any action which would
constitute Major Decisions, other than the actions set forth in Sections
6.3.1(a), 6.3.1(b), 6.3.1(c), 6.3.1(d), 6.3.1(e), 6.3.1(g), 6.3.1(h), 6.3.1(i),
6.3.1(j) 6.3.1(m), 6.3.1(o) (assuming it stated “MGP Member” as opposed to
“Sponsor Member” therein), 6.3.1(r), 6.3.1(t), and 6.3.1(gg) (solely to the
extent that MGP Member otherwise has the right to approve the applicable Major
Decision in accordance with this Section 6.4.4) which shall require the approval
of MGP Member.

6.5    Reimbursement and Remuneration Generally. The Managing Member shall not
be compensated for acting in such capacity, but shall be entitled to
reimbursement for actual and commercially reasonable Third Party out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in furtherance of the business or management of the Company.
Distributions received by the Members pursuant to Articles 4 and 8 are not, and
shall not be deemed to be, remuneration within the meaning of this Section 6.5.

6.6    Reliance by Third Parties. Any Person dealing with the Company or the
Managing Member may rely upon a certificate signed by the Managing Member (or
any one or more of its agents designated by the Managing Member for such purpose
or given such authority) as to:

6.6.1    The identity of the Managing Member, any Member of the Company or any
Officer;

6.6.2    The existence or non-existence of any facts which constitute a
condition precedent to acts by the Managing Member or in any other manner
germane to the affairs of the Company;

6.6.3    The Persons who are authorized to execute and deliver any instrument or
document for or on behalf of the Company; or

6.6.4    Any act or failure to act by the Company or as to any other matter
whatsoever involving the Company or any Member.

6.7    Records and Reports.

6.7.1    The Managing Member shall cause to be kept (and made available to each
Member), at the principal place of business of the Company, or at such other
location as the Managing Member shall reasonably deem appropriate, full and
proper ledgers, other books of account, and records of all receipts and
disbursements, other financial activities, and the internal affairs of the
Company for at least the current and past seven (7) fiscal years; provided,
however, that the Managing Member shall further retain all of the foregoing for
any given fiscal year for so long as any applicable federal and/or applicable
state income tax statute of limitations remains open with respect to such year.

 

-39-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.7.2    The Members agree that the books of the Company shall be kept for
accounting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting

Company shall end on December 31 of each year.

financial information related to the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of the
Properties delivered to any Lender in accordance with the terms of any Credit
Arrangements, and (vi) promptly provide copies of all notices, reports,
statements, certificates and other information or deliverables provided to the
Company under the Lease. Upon the request of a Member (or its permitted
transferee), the Company shall provide such Member (or its permitted
transferee), as applicable, with information necessary to determine that the
Company’s income and assets satisfy the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2)
through (4) of the Code (including responding to questionnaires identifying and
describing services provided to tenants of the Properties) within twenty-five
(25) days following the end of each calendar quarter, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide, as soon as reasonably practicable, any other
information requested by such Member and reasonably necessary for such Member
(or any of its direct or indirect owners) to determine its compliance with the
REIT requirements under Sections 856 and 857 of the Code. In furtherance of the
foregoing, the Managing Member shall, on request of a Member, provide quarterly
taxable income projections to the Members within forty-five (45) days after the
end of each fiscal quarter; and

(b)    within one hundred eighty days (180) days after the end of each fiscal
year, the Company shall deliver to each Member a copy of the Company’s federal,

portion thereof, such Member’s Schedule K-1, and such other information, if any,

by the Company of a satisfactory written commitment by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be determined that such Indemnitee
is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Section 6.8.

6.8.3    The indemnification provided by this Section 6.8 shall be in addition

satisfied solely out of the Company Assets. No Member shall be subject to
personal liability by reason of these indemnification provisions.

6.8.5    No Indemnitee shall be denied indemnification in whole or in part under
this Section 6.8 by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee had an interest in
the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the
transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

6.8.6    Except as set forth in Section 6.8.3, the provisions of this
Section 6.8 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees only and shall not be deemed
to create any rights for the benefit of any other Person.

6.8.7    None of the officers, directors, members or partners of the Company, of

available to Indemnitee in law and equity. No payments made pursuant to this
Section 6.8.9 shall be treated as a Capital Contribution hereunder.

6.9    Duties and Conflicts.

6.9.1     The Members, in connection with their respective duties,
responsibilities, rights and obligations hereunder, shall at all times have a
duty to act in good faith, but recognizing that each Member may act in its own
economic self-interest and in accordance with such tax and business objectives
as it deems appropriate or desirable for such Member and shall not have any
fiduciary duties to the Company, any other Member or any other Person bound by
this Agreement. So long as a Member acts in good faith and with the express
provisions of this Agreement, such Member shall not be in breach of any duties
(including any fiduciary duties that may otherwise be imposed by law) or have
any Liabilities to the Company, any other Member or any other Person bound by
this Agreement, whether at law or in equity. The provisions of this Agreement,
to the extent that they expand, restrict or eliminate the duties and Liabilities
of a Member otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Members to
replace fully and completely such other duties and Liabilities of each Member.
Subject to the foregoing, but notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary or otherwise applicable law, whenever a Member or the Members are
required or permitted to make a decision, take or approve

 

-42-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

an action, or omit to do any of the foregoing: (a) “in its discretion,” under a
similar grant of authority or latitude, or without an express standard of
behavior (including, without limitation, standards such as “reasonable”), then
each Member shall be entitled to consider only such interests and factors,
including its own, as it desires, and shall, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, have no duty or obligation to consider any other interests or factors
whatsoever (other than the duty to act in good faith), or (b) with an express
standard of behavior (including, without limitation, standards such as
“reasonable”), then each Member shall comply with such express standard but
shall not be subject to any other, different or additional standard (other than
the standard of good faith). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, there are no restrictions on any acts or omissions by MGP related to MGM
which are unrelated to this Agreement, the Company or the Properties.

6.9.2    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.8.1, each Member and its
Affiliates may engage or invest in, and devote its and their time to, any other
business venture or activity of any nature and description, whether or not such
activities are considered competitive with the Company, its Subsidiaries or the
businesses of any of them (the “Right to Compete”), and neither the Company nor
any other Member shall have any right by virtue of this Agreement or the
relationship created hereby in or to such other venture or activity of any
Member (or to the income or proceeds derived therefrom), and the pursuit of such
other venture or activity shall not be deemed wrongful or improper. The Right to
Compete of each Member and its Affiliates does not require notice to, approval
from, or other sharing with, any of the other Members or the Company. The legal
doctrines of “corporate opportunity,” “business opportunity” and similar
doctrines shall not be applied to any such competitive venture or activity of a
Member or its Affiliates. No Member or its Affiliates shall have any obligation
to the Company or its other Members with respect to any opportunity. Sponsor
Member acknowledges that MGP and/or its Affiliates have entered into, or may in
the future enter into, transactions or arrangements with MGM and/or its
Affiliates related to the ownership, leasing and operating of real estate other
than the Properties and to which the Company and its Subsidiaries are not a
party (the “Other MGM/MGP Arrangements”), and Sponsor Member agrees that this
Agreement shall in no way restrict MGP and/or its Affiliates with respect to the
Other MGM/MGP Arrangements or require MGP and/or its Affiliates to take any
action, or omit to take an action, with respect to the Other MGM/MGP
Arrangements.

6.10    REOC Management Rights. At any time upon request to the Company, any
Property Owner shall enter into a letter agreement substantially in the form of
Exhibit B with Sponsor Member or any of its Affiliates that is intended to
qualify as a “real estate operating company” for purposes of the United States
Department of Labor Regulation published at 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101(d)(3).

6.11    REIT Compliance. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary (including Section 6.3.1), but subject to the other provisions of this
Section 6.11, the Company, the Members and the Managing Member agree to use
reasonable best efforts to (i) exercise their rights and perform their
obligations under this Agreement and (ii) manage the business and affairs of the
Company in a manner that if the Company were a real estate investment trust for
purposes of Section 856 of the Code (a “REIT”), it would satisfy the
requirements of Sections 856(c)(2), 856(c)(3) and 856(c)(4) of the Code (the
“REIT Requirements”), assuming for this purpose that the Company is not a
corporation for purposes of applying Sections 856(d)(2)(B)

 

-43-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and 856(d)(5) of the Code. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company may form
one or more subsidiaries which may jointly elect with any Member (or any of its
direct or indirect owners) to be “taxable REIT subsidiaries” within the meaning
of Section 856(l) of the Code (each, a “TRS”), and may engage in transactions
with such TRSs (or any other TRS of any Member (or any of its direct or indirect
owners)) consistent with satisfying the requirements of this Section 6.11;
provided, further, the Company shall provide the Members with reasonable notice
and opportunity to effect such joint election.

6.12    Sale of Properties.

6.12.1    Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary (other than
Section 6.11), from and after the Lockout Date, MGP Member and the Sponsor
Member each shall have the right to cause the Company or the applicable
Subsidiary, to sell, exchange or transfer one or both of the Properties for all
cash consideration in an arms-length transaction with a Third Party (an “Asset
Disposition”) subject to first providing a right of first offer pursuant to this
Section 6.12 (“Asset ROFO”); provided, however, if the Lease is still in full
force and effect, any Asset Disposition must include all the Properties then
demised under the Lease. If either MGP Member or Sponsor Member desires to cause
an Asset Disposition (in such capacity, the “Triggering Member”), the Triggering
Member shall be required to give written notice (the “Asset ROFO Notice”) to the
other Member (in such capacity, the “Asset Responding Member”) of such desire to
sell such Property or Properties (the “Offered Assets”). The Asset ROFO Notice
shall set forth (i) the Triggering Member’s determination of the gross fair
market value of the Offered Assets (the “Asset ROFO Gross Valuation”), (ii) a
list of no more than ten (10) potential purchasers of the Offered Assets (the
“Asset Potential Purchasers”) selected in the Triggering Member’s sole
discretion, (iii) an initial determination of whether any Credit Arrangement
secured by the Offered Assets will be repaid by the Company or assumed by the
purchaser, and (iv) the methodology pursuant to which Triggering Member expects
all prorations, credits, deductions and adjustments to the sale price (the
“Asset Disposition PP Adjustments”) and the allocation of closing costs,
transfer and similar taxes and title premiums between the seller and purchaser
(the “Asset Disposition CC Allocation”). The Asset ROFO Notice shall be deemed a
binding irrevocable offer from the Triggering Member to the Asset Responding
Member whereby the Asset Responding Member (or an Affiliate it designates) shall
have the right to elect to purchase prior to the expiration of the Asset ROFO
Offer Period (1) if the Offered Assets include all of the Properties then owned
by the Company (an “Aggregate Sale”), the entire Triggering Member’s Interest in
the Company (which shall include any Optional Loans made by the Triggering
Member) for the Asset ROFO Purchase Price, and (2) if the Offered Assets do not
include all of the Properties then owned by the Company (an “Individual Sale”),
the Offered Assets for the Asset ROFO Gross Valuation, in each case, on the
terms and conditions specified in the Asset ROFO Notice. At any time within the
sixty (60) day period (the “Asset ROFO Offer Period”) commencing on the day the
Triggering Member delivers the Asset ROFO Notice to the Asset Responding Member,
the Asset Responding Member shall either (A) deliver to the Triggering Member
written notice electing to purchase the Offered Assets (the “Asset ROFO Election
Notice”) or (B) deliver to Triggering Member written notice rejecting the offer
contained in the Asset ROFO Offer (an “Asset ROFO Rejection Notice”). If the
Asset Responding Member fails to deliver an Asset ROFO Election Notice or Asset
ROFO Rejection Notice within the Asset ROFO Offer Period, the Asset Responding
Member shall be deemed to have delivered an Asset ROFO Rejection Notice and
shall be deemed to have waived its right to purchase the Offered Assets.

 

-44-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.12.2    If the Asset Responding Member delivers an Asset ROFO Election Notice,
then within ten (10) days after the date thereof (or, if such date is not a
Business Day, the immediately following Business Day), the Asset Responding
Member shall deposit in escrow with a reputable title insurance company
authorized to do business in the State of New York (the “Asset ROFO Escrow
Agent”) pursuant to escrow instructions consistent with this Section 6.12, a
non-refundable cash down payment in immediately available funds in an aggregate
amount equal to 10% of the Asset ROFO Gross Valuation (in the event of an
Individual Sale) or 5% of the Asset ROFO Gross Valuation (in the event of an
Aggregate Sale) (as applicable, the “Asset ROFO Down Payment”). If the Asset
Responding Member fails to timely deliver the Asset ROFO Down Payment, the Asset
Responding Member shall be deemed to have failed to deliver an Asset ROFO
Election Notice and Asset ROFO Rejection Notice and the terms of the last
sentence of Section 6.12.1 above shall apply.

6.12.3    If the Asset Responding Member timely delivers the Asset ROFO Down
Payment, then the Asset Responding Member, as purchaser, and the applicable
Property Owner (in the event of an Individual Sale) or the Triggering Member (in
the event of an Aggregate Sale), as seller, shall proceed to close the sale of
the applicable Property or interests in the applicable Subsidiary for the Asset
ROFO Gross Valuation (in the event of an Individual Sale) or the entire
Triggering Member’s Interests in the Company at the Asset ROFO Purchase Price
(in the event of an Aggregate Sale) (as applicable, the “Asset ROFO Closing”) on
a mutually acceptable closing date (the “Asset ROFO Closing Date”), but in any
event not later than sixty (60) days after the Asset Responding Member delivered
the Asset ROFO Down Payment to the Asset ROFO Escrow Agent, through a mutually
satisfactory escrow arrangement with the Asset ROFO Escrow Agent. On the Asset
ROFO Closing Date, (x) (1) in the event of an Individual Sale, the applicable
Property Owner shall sell to Asset Responding Member the applicable Property
pursuant to a customary deed, subject to all liens, claims, encumbrances of
record other than any lien securing a Credit Arrangement which shall be
discharged by the applicable Property Owner at the Asset ROFO Closing (unless
the applicable Asset ROFO Notice included a determination that such Credit
Arrangement would be assumed by the purchaser), or (2) in the event of an
Aggregate Sale, the Triggering Member shall sell to the Asset Responding Member
the entire Triggering Member’s Interests in the Company, in each case, free and
clear of all liens, claims, encumbrances, options and rights of any kind by
execution and delivery of documents substantially in the form of the Interest
ROFO Sale Documents, (y) the Asset ROFO Escrow Agent shall deliver the Asset
ROFO Down Payment in immediately available funds to the Property Owner (in the
event of an Individual Sale) or Triggering Member (in the event of an Aggregate
Sale) and (z) the Asset Responding Member shall pay to the Company or Property
Owner, as applicable, the Asset ROFO Gross Valuation (in the event of an
Individual Sale) or to Triggering Member (in the event of an Aggregate Sale) the
Asset ROFO Purchase Price (in each case, less a credit for the Asset ROFO Down
Payment) in immediately available funds, as adjusted by Asset Disposition PP
Adjustments. None of the Triggering Member, the Company or any Subsidiary shall
be required to make any representations or warranties with respect to the
Triggering Member, the Company, any Subsidiary or the Property in connection
with such sale (but shall make customary warranties regarding the Company’s or
Triggering Member’s, as applicable, due authority, execution and delivery and
lien-free title to the Triggering Member’s Interests in the case of an Aggregate
Sale). Each party shall pay its own closing costs in connection with such sale,
provided that any costs specified in the Asset Disposition CC Allocation shall
be paid in accordance with such allocation. If the Asset ROFO Closing fails to
occur by reason of a default

 

-45-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of the Asset Responding Member, the Asset Responding Member’s Asset ROFO rights
under this Section 6.12 (including the right to be the Triggering Member) shall
be deemed forever extinguished and shall thereafter be null and void and of no
further force and effect, the Company or Property Owner or the Triggering
Member, as applicable, shall be entitled to retain the Asset ROFO Down Payment
as liquidated damages and the Triggering Member shall thereafter be free, at any
time and from time to time, to cause a sale of the Offered Assets in an
arms-length transaction with a third-party unaffiliated with the Triggering
Member at such price as the Triggering Member determines in its sole discretion.
If the Asset ROFO Closing hereunder fails to occur by reason of default of the
Triggering Member, the Asset Responding Member shall have the right, as its sole
and exclusive remedy (other than as specifically provided below), to either
(A) demand that the Asset ROFO Down Payment be returned to the Asset Responding
Member (and the Triggering Member shall reimburse the Asset Responding Member’s
reasonable and actual third party costs incurred in connection with the failed
Asset ROFO Closing), or (B) seek specific performance within forty-five
(45) days of such failure to close, and Triggering Member shall be prohibited
from initiating the Asset ROFO for a period of two (2) years from the date on
which the Asset ROFO Down Payment is returned to the Asset Responding Member in
accordance with the foregoing.

6.12.4    If the Asset Responding Member delivers an Asset ROFO Rejection Notice
(or is deemed to have delivered an Asset ROFO Rejection Notice), then the
Triggering Member shall a period of 270 days from expiration of the Asset ROFO
Offer Period to cause the Company or any applicable Subsidiary (or Subsidiaries)
to enter into a contract of sale with a third party unaffiliated with the
Triggering Member (the “Asset ROFO Purchase Agreement”) to complete the sale of
the Offered Assets for a purchase price of not less than 95% of the Asset ROFO
Gross Valuation (without regard to customary prorations) and to a purchaser who
must be among the Asset Potential Purchasers or their respective Affiliates. The
Asset ROFO Purchase Agreement must provide for a closing thereunder on a date
not later than 365 days after expiration of the Asset ROFO Offer Period. If
(i) the Asset ROFO Purchase Agreement is not executed within 270 days from
expiration of the Asset ROFO Offer Period, (ii) the closing thereunder does not
occur within 365 days of the expiration of the Asset ROFO Offer Period, or
(iii) the Triggering Member desires to sell the Offered Asset either (x) to a
Person other than an Asset Potential Purchaser or its Affiliates or (y) for less
than 95% of the Asset ROFO Gross Valuation (without regard to customary
prorations), the Triggering Member must again comply with the ROFO procedures in
this Section 6.12 prior to causing a sale of the Offered Assets and the other
Member shall have all the rights available to it under this Section 6.12 in
connection with any such sale. If any Member has triggered the Asset ROFO
pursuant to this Section 6.12 or the Interest ROFO pursuant to Section 7.1.4,
then the Asset Responding Member shall not be entitled to commence the Asset
ROFO process set forth in this Section 6.12, until such Asset ROFO process
commenced under this Section 6.12 or Interest ROFO process under Section 7.1.4
has expired.

6.12.5    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for
purposes of this Section 6.12, in the event that Sponsor Member is the
Triggering Member and MGP Member has elected to purchase the Interests in the
Company of the Sponsor Member, at the discretion of Sponsor Member, rather than
convey the direct Interests in the Company, the ownership interests in Sponsor
Member (or in the direct or indirect owner of Sponsor Member that owns no assets
other than 100% of the direct or indirect ownership interests in Sponsor Member)
shall be conveyed to the Asset Responding Member at the Asset ROFO Closing and
the Asset

 

-46-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ROFO Sale Documents shall be modified accordingly; provided, that any sale of
direct or indirect interest in Sponsor Member shall be conditioned on Sponsor
Member or its credit worthy Affiliate indemnifying MGP Member in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to MGP Member for all liabilities of Sponsor Member (and
any direct or indirect owner of Sponsor Member being acquired by MGP Member as
part of such sale, if any) relating to or resulting from the period prior to the
consummation of the Asset ROFO Closing.

6.13    Gaming Laws and Authorities. The Sponsor Entity and the MGP Entity
hereby acknowledges that each of the MGP Entity, the Company and the Sponsor
Entity are subject to Gaming Laws and are under the jurisdiction of Gaming
Authorities. In this regard, the Sponsor Entity and the MGP Entity agree to
provide information to Gaming Authorities, as required by Gaming Laws, and to
respond promptly to any request for information from any Gaming Authority.

(“Interest ROFO”). The Member desiring to sell its Interests (“Selling Member”)
shall be required to give written notice (the “Interest ROFO Notice”) to the
other Member (the “Interest Responding Member”) of the Selling Member’s desire
to sell all or a portion its Interests (collectively, the “ROFO Offered
Interest”). The Interest ROFO Notice shall set forth (i) a description of the

or a specified percentage), (ii) the cash price (“Interest ROFO Purchase Price”)
that the Selling Member is willing to accept for a sale of the ROFO Offered
Interests, (ii) a list of no more than ten (10) potential purchasers of the ROFO

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

credits, deductions and adjustments to the sale price (the “Interest ROFO PP
Adjustments”) and the allocation of closing costs, transfer and similar taxes
and title premiums between the seller and purchaser (the “Interest ROFO CC
Allocation”). The Interest ROFO Notice shall be deemed a binding irrevocable
offer from the Selling Member to the Interest Responding Member whereby the
Interest Responding Member (or an Affiliate it designates) shall have the right
to elect to purchase prior to the expiration of the Interest ROFO Offer Period
the entire ROFO Offered Interest (which shall include the pro rata share (based
on the ROFO Offered Interest over the total Membership Interest of the Selling
Member) of any Optional Loans made by the Selling Member) for the Interest ROFO
Purchase Price, subject to the Interest ROFO PP Adjustments and ROFO CC
Allocation specified in the Interest ROFO Notice. At any time within the sixty
(60) day period (the “Interest ROFO Offer Period”) commencing on the day the

written notice electing to purchase the ROFO Offered Interests for the Interest
ROFO Purchase Price (an “Interest ROFO Election Notice”) or (B) deliver to
Selling Member a written notice rejecting the offer contained in the Interest
ROFO Notice (an “Interest ROFO Rejection Notice”). If the Interest Responding
Member fails to deliver an Interest ROFO Election Notice or Interest ROFO
Rejection Notice within the Interest ROFO Offer Period, the Interest Responding
Member shall be deemed to have delivered an Interest ROFO Rejection Notice
rejecting the offer contained in the Interest ROFO Notice and shall be deemed to
have waived its right to purchase the ROFO Offered Interest. During the Interest
ROFO Offer Period, the Selling Member shall not sell or offer for sale its ROFO
Offered Interest unless the Interest Responding Member delivers an Interest ROFO
Rejection Notice. In the case of any Transfer of Interests pursuant to
Section 7.1.2(c) or (d) which consists of direct or indirect interests in the
Selling Member, the ROFO Offered Interest that the Interest Responding Member
shall have the right to purchase pursuant to the rights described in this
Section 7.1.4 shall consist of the applicable corresponding portion of the
direct Interest of the Selling Member.

(b)    If the Interest Responding Member delivers an Interest ROFO Election
Notice, then within ten (10) days after the date thereof (or, if such date is
not a Business Day, the immediately following Business Day), the Interest
Responding Member shall deposit in escrow with a reputable title insurance
company authorized to do business in the State of New York (the “Interest ROFO
Escrow Agent”) pursuant to escrow instructions consistent with this
Section 7.1.4(b), a non-refundable cash down payment in immediately available
funds in an aggregate amount equal to 10% of the Interest ROFO Purchase Price
(the “Interest ROFO Down Payment”). If the Interest Responding Member fails to
timely deliver the Interest ROFO Down Payment, the Interest Responding Member
shall be deemed to have failed to deliver an Interest ROFO Election Notice and
the terms of the third from last sentence of clause (a) above shall apply.

(c)    If the Interest Responding Member timely delivers the Interest ROFO Down
Payment, the Selling Member, as seller, and the Interest Responding Member, as
purchaser, shall proceed to close the sale of the ROFO Offered Interest at the
Interest ROFO Purchase Price (the “Interest ROFO Closing”) on a mutually
acceptable closing date (the “Interest ROFO Closing Date”), but in any event not
later than sixty (60) days after the Interest Responding Member delivered the
Interest ROFO Down Payment to the Interest ROFO Escrow Agent, through a mutually
satisfactory escrow arrangement with the Interest ROFO Escrow Agent. On the
Interest ROFO Closing Date, (x) the Selling Member shall sell to the Interest
Responding

Member the ROFO Offered Interest free and clear of all liens, claims,
encumbrances, options and rights of any kind by execution and delivery of the
documents attached hereto as Exhibit C (the “Interest ROFO Sale Documents”), (y)
the Interest ROFO Escrow Agent shall deliver the Interest ROFO Down Payment in
immediately available funds to the Selling Member and (z) the Interest
Responding Member shall pay to the Selling Member the Interest ROFO Purchase
Price (less a credit for the Interest ROFO Down Payment) in immediately
available funds, as adjusted by the Interest ROFO PP Adjustments. None of the
Selling Member, the Company or any Subsidiary shall be required to make any
representations or warranties with respect to the Company or the Properties in
connection with such sale (but shall make customary warranties regarding the
Selling Member’s due authority, execution and delivery and lien-free title to
the ROFO Offered Interest). Each party shall pay its own closing costs in
connection with such sale; provided that any costs specified in the Interest
ROFO CC Allocation shall be paid in accordance with such allocation. If the
Interest ROFO Closing fails to occur by reason of a default of the Interest
Responding Member, the Interest Responding Member’s Interest ROFO rights under
this Section 7.1.4(c) shall be deemed forever extinguished and shall thereafter
be null and void and of no further force and effect, the Selling Member shall be
entitled to retain the Interest ROFO Down Payment as liquidated damages and the
Selling Member shall thereafter be free, at any time and from time to time, to
cause a sale of the ROFO Offered Interest at such price as the Selling Member
determines in its sole discretion. If the Interest ROFO Closing hereunder fails
to occur by reason of default of the Selling Member, the Interest Responding
Member shall have the right, as its sole and exclusive remedy, to either
(A) demand that the Interest ROFO Down Payment be returned to the Interest
Responding Member (and the Selling Member shall reimburse the Interest
Responding Member’s reasonable and actual Third Party costs in connection with
such failed Interest ROFO Closing), or (B) seek specific performance within
forty-five (45) days of such failure to close, and the Selling Member shall be
prohibited from initiating the Interest ROFO for a period of two (2) years from
the date on which the Interest ROFO Down Payment is returned to the Interest
Responding Member in accordance with the foregoing.

(d)    If the Interest Responding Member delivers an Interest ROFO Rejection
Notice (or is deemed to have delivered an Interest ROFO Rejection Notice), then
the Selling Member shall have a period of 270 days from expiration of the
Interest ROFO Offer Period to enter into a contract of sale with a third party
unaffiliated with Selling Member (the “Interest Purchase Agreement”) for the
sale of the ROFO Offered Interest at a purchase price of not less than 95% of
the Interest ROFO Purchase Price (without regard to adjustments or prorations)
and to a purchaser who must be among the Interest Potential Purchasers or their
respective Affiliates. The Selling Member shall deliver a copy of the Interest
Purchase Agreement (together with all schedules and exhibits thereto) to the
Interest Responding Member promptly following execution. The Interest Purchase
Agreement must provide for a closing thereunder on a date not later than 365
days after expiration of the Interest ROFO Offer Period. If (i) the Interest
Purchase Agreement is not executed within 270 days from expiration of the
Interest ROFO Offer Period, (ii) the closing thereunder does not occur within
365 days of the expiration of the Interest ROFO Offer Period, or (iii) Selling
Member desires to sell the ROFO Offered Interest either (x) to a Person other
than an Interest Potential Purchaser or its Affiliates or (y) for less than 95%
of the Interest ROFO Purchase Price (without regard to adjustments or
prorations), Selling Member must again comply with the ROFO procedures in this
Section 7.1.4(d) prior to any sale of its Interests and the other Member shall
have all the rights available to it under this Section 7.1.4 in connection with
any such sale. If any Member has triggered the Asset ROFO pursuant to
Section 6.12

 

-50-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

or the Interest ROFO pursuant to this Section 7.1.4, then the Interest
Responding Member shall not be entitled to commence the Interest ROFO process
set forth in this Section 7.1.4, until such Asset ROFO process commenced under
Section 6.12 or Interest ROFO process commenced under this Section 7.1.4 has
expired.

(e)    In the event that Interest Responding Member has elected to purchase all
of Selling Member’s Interests in the Company pursuant to the exercise of the
Interest ROFO under this Section 7.1.4, the Interest Responding Member shall be
obligated at the Interest ROFO Closing to either (i) cause any Credit
Arrangement secured by any Permitted Carveout Guaranty to be refinanced or
otherwise repaid in full, or (ii) cause any Permitted Carveout Guaranty that has
been delivered by the Carveout Guarantor Affiliated with the Selling Member to
be terminated and/or replaced, and such Carveout Guarantor released from
liability with respect thereto in connection with any such replacement, as of
the date of such Interest ROFO Closing, except for any liability under any such
Permitted Carveout Guaranty arising from any actions that occurred, or
circumstances that existed, prior to the Interest ROFO Closing (collectively,
the “Retained Guarantee Liabilities”); provided, with respect to the Retained
Guarantee Liabilities, the Company shall indemnify the applicable Carveout
Guarantor other than those Retained Guarantee Liabilities which arose out of Bad
Acts of the Selling Member or any Affiliate thereof.

(f)    Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, for purposes
of this Section 7.1.4, in the event that Sponsor Member is the Selling Member,
at the discretion of Sponsor Member, the ROFO Offered Interest may be the
ownership interests in Sponsor Member (or in the direct or indirect owner of
Sponsor Member that owns no assets other than 100% of the direct or indirect
ownership interests in Sponsor Member) and the Interest ROFO Sale Documents
shall be modified accordingly.

7.2    Further Restrictions. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in this
Agreement, any otherwise permitted Transfer of an Interest to any Person shall
be null and void if the Managing Member determines that:

(a)    after consultation with a nationally recognized accounting firm selected
in good faith by the Managing Member, such Transfer may cause the Company to
cease to be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal or state income tax
purposes; provided, however, that if, as a result of such Transfer, one Member
(for purposes of this Section 7.2(a), the “Acquiring Member”) would own one
hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding Interests, and following such Transfer
the Company would constitute a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax
purposes with respect to the Acquiring Member, such Transfer shall be a
permitted Transfer;

(b)    after consultation with a nationally recognized accounting firm selected
in good faith by the Managing Member, such Transfer would cause a material risk
that MGP REIT, BREIT or any other direct or indirect Member of the Company will
fail to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes;

(c)    such Transfer may require the registration of such Transferred Interest
pursuant to any applicable federal or state securities laws;

 

-51-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d)    after consultation with a nationally recognized accounting firm selected
in good faith by the Managing Member, such Transfer may cause the Company to
become a “Publicly Traded Partnership,” as such term is defined in Code
Sections 469(k)(2) or 7704(b) that is taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal
income tax purposes;

(e)    such Transfer may subject the Company, the Members or their Affiliates,
partners, stockholders or members, as applicable, to regulation under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, each as amended;

(f)    such Transfer is made to any Person who lacks the legal right, power or
capacity to own such Interest;

(g)    with respect to the Transfer of a direct Interest in the Company only,
the Company does not receive written instruments (including, without limitation,
copies of any instruments of Transfer and such Assignee’s consent to be bound by
this Agreement as an Assignee) that are in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Members other than the Member effecting such Transfer; or

(h)    such Transfer would result in a documentary transfer tax liability to the
Company or any Subsidiary, unless the transferring Member agrees to bear the
entire amount of such documentary transfer tax liability without any right to
reimbursement by the Company or any Member.

7.3    Rights of Assignees. Until such time, if any, as the transferee of a
direct interest in the Company in any permitted Transfer pursuant to this
Article 7 is admitted to the Company as a Substitute Member pursuant to
Section 7.5: (a) such transferee shall be an Assignee only, and only shall
receive, to the extent Transferred, the distributions and allocations of income,
gain, loss, deduction, credit, or similar items to which the Member that
Transferred its Interest would be entitled, and (b) such Assignee shall not be
entitled or enabled to exercise any other rights or powers of a Member, such
other rights remaining with the transferring Member. In such a case, the
transferring Member shall remain a Member, and shall remain liable for the
satisfaction of all obligations contained herein as a Member, even if such
transferring Member has Transferred its entire Economic Interest to one or more
Assignees (subject to Section 7.5). In the event any Assignee desires to make a
further assignment of any Economic Interest, such Assignee shall be subject to
all of the provisions of this Agreement relating to restrictions on Transfer to
the same extent as any Member desiring to make such an assignment.

7.4    Admissions, Withdrawals and Removals. No Person shall be admitted to the
Company as a Member except in accordance with Section 7.5 (in the case of
transferees of a permitted Transfer of an Interest from another Person). No
Member shall be entitled to retire or withdraw from being a Member of the
Company except (a) in accordance with Section 7.7, or (b) with the consent of
each other Member, which consent may be given or withheld in each such Member’s
sole and absolute discretion. Subject to Section 6.4, no Member shall be subject
to removal. No admission, withdrawal or removal of a Member shall cause the
dissolution of the Company. Any purported admission, withdrawal or removal which
is not in accordance with this Agreement shall be null and void.

 

-52-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7.5    Admission of Assignees as Substitute Members.

7.5.1    An Assignee shall become a Substitute Member only if and when each of
the following conditions are satisfied:

(a)    The assignor of the Interests transferred sends written notice to the
Managing Member requesting the admission of the Assignee as a Substitute Member
and setting forth the name and address of the Assignee, the Capital Account
transferred, the Percentage Interests transferred, and the effective date of the
Transfer;

(b)    Intentionally omitted; and

(c)    The Managing Member receives from the Assignee (i) such information
concerning the Assignee’s financial capacity and investment experience as the
Managing Member may reasonably request, and (ii) written instruments (including,
without limitation, copies of any instruments of Transfer and such Assignee’s
consent to be bound by this Agreement as a Substitute Member) that are in a form
satisfactory to the Managing Member (as determined in the Managing Member’s
reasonable discretion).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the Transfer by any Member of all (but not
less than all) of its Interest in accordance with Section 7.1.2, the transferee
shall automatically become a Substitute Member without having to comply with
Section 7.5.1(c)(i).

7.5.2    Upon the admission of any Substitute Member, the books and records of
the Company shall be amended by the Managing Member to reflect the name,
address, Capital Contributions, Capital Account balance and Percentage Interest
of such Substitute Member and to eliminate or adjust, if necessary, the name,
address, Capital Contributions, Capital Account balance and Percentage Interest
of the predecessor of such Substitute Member. In the event Sponsor Entity or MGP
Entity transfers, in accordance with Section 7.1.2, all of its Interests to a
Person which is not a Transfer Affiliate, the Members (including any Substitute
Member) shall enter into such amendments to this Agreement as are reasonably
necessary to update the definition of Sponsor Member or MGP Member, as
applicable, and Transfer Affiliate and to otherwise reflect the ultimate
ownership of such Substitute Member.

7.6    Withdrawal of Members. If a Member has transferred all of its Interests
to one or more Assignees, then such Member shall withdraw from the Company if
and when all such Assignees have been admitted as Substitute Members in
accordance with this Agreement.

7.7    Conversion of Membership Interest. Upon the Incapacity of a Member or the
rejection by a Member of this Agreement in a Bankruptcy of such Member, such
Member’s Membership Interest shall automatically be converted to an Economic
Interest only, and such Member (or its executor, administrator, trustee, or
receiver, as applicable) shall thereafter be deemed an Assignee for all purposes
hereunder, with the same Economic Interest as was held by such Member prior to
its Incapacity or its rejection of this Agreement, but without any other rights
of a Member unless the holder of such Economic Interest is admitted as a
Substitute Member pursuant to Section 7.5 above.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ARTICLE 8

DISSOLUTION, LIQUIDATION AND TERMINATION OF THE COMPANY

8.1    Limitations. The Company may be dissolved, liquidated and terminated only
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 8, and the parties hereto do hereby
irrevocably waive any and all other rights they may have to cause a dissolution
of the Company or a sale or partition of any or all of the Company Assets.

8.2    Exclusive Causes. Notwithstanding the Act, the following and only the
following events shall cause the Company to be dissolved, liquidated, and
terminated:

(a)    the joint election by the MGP Member and the Sponsor Member;

(b)    The Transfer of all or substantially all of the Company Assets and the
receipt of all consideration therefor, except that if non-monetary consideration
is received upon such disposition the Company shall not be dissolved pursuant to
this clause until such consideration is converted into money or money
equivalent;

(c)    Judicial dissolution; or

(d)    At any time that there are no Members, unless the business of the Company
is continued in accordance with the Act.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, any dissolution of the Company other
than as provided in this Section 8.2 shall be a dissolution in contravention of
this Agreement.

8.3    Effect of Dissolution. The dissolution of the Company shall be effective
on the day on which the event occurs giving rise to the dissolution, but the
Company shall not terminate until it has been wound up and its assets have been
distributed as provided in Section 8.5 of this Agreement and the Certificate has
been cancelled by the filing of a certificate of cancellation with the office of
the Delaware Secretary of State. Notwithstanding the dissolution of the Company,
prior to the termination of the Company, the business of the Company and the
affairs of the Members, as such, shall continue to be governed by this
Agreement.

8.4    No Capital Contribution Upon Dissolution. Each Member shall look solely
to the assets of the Company for all distributions with respect to the Company,
its Capital Contributions thereto, its Capital Account, and its share of Net
Profits or Net Losses, and shall have no recourse therefor (upon dissolution or
otherwise) against any other Member. Accordingly, if any Member has a deficit
balance in its Capital Account (after giving effect to all contributions,
distributions and allocations for all taxable years, including the year during
which the liquidation occurs), then such Member shall have no obligation to make
any Capital Contribution with respect to such deficit, and such deficit shall
not be considered a debt owed to the Company or to any other Person for any
purpose whatsoever.

 

-54-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8.5    Liquidation.

8.5.1    Upon dissolution of the Company, the Company shall thereafter engage in
no further business other than that which is necessary to wind up the business,
and the Managing Member (or such other Person as the Managing Member may
determine) shall act as the “Liquidator” of the Company. A reasonable time shall
be allowed for the winding up of the affairs of the Company in order to minimize
any losses attendant upon such a winding up. In the event the Liquidator
reasonably believes that it is prudent to do so, cash or other assets held in
reserve may be placed in a liquidating trust or other escrow immediately prior
to the termination of the Company in order to ensure that any and all
obligations of the Company are satisfied. After allocating (pursuant to
Article 5 of this Agreement) all income, gain, loss, deductions and credit
resulting from the liquidation of the Company Assets, the Liquidator shall apply
and distribute the cash proceeds thereof as follows (it being understood that
any amounts to be paid to a Lending Member pursuant to Section 3.3 shall be paid
to such Lending Member out of the following distributions that would otherwise
be made to the Non-Contributing Member, but that such amounts shall be deemed to
have been distributed to the Non-Contributing Member and immediately repaid by
the Non-Contributing Member to the Lending Member):

(a)    First, to the payment of (i) the debts and liabilities of the Company
(including any outstanding amounts due under any Credit Arrangements encumbering
the Company Assets (or any part thereof) and, to the extent permitted by law, to
Members who are creditors) and (ii) the expenses of liquidation; then

(b)    Second, to the establishment of any Reserves which the Liquidator shall
determine in its commercially reasonable judgment to be reasonably necessary for
contingent, unliquidated or unforeseen Liabilities or obligations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries or the Members arising out of or in connection with the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Such Reserves may, in the commercially reasonable
discretion of the Liquidator, be paid over to a national bank or national trust
company selected by the Liquidator and authorized to conduct business as an
escrowee to be held by such bank or trust company as escrowee for the purposes
of disbursing such Reserves to satisfy the Liabilities and obligations described
above, and at the expiration of such period distributing any remaining balance
as provided hereinafter in this Section 8.5.1; then

(c)    Third, to the Members in accordance with the terms of Section 4.1.4.

8.5.2    Notwithstanding Section 8.5.1, in the event that the Liquidator
determines that an immediate sale of all or any portion of the Company Assets
would cause undue loss to the Members, the Liquidator, in order to avoid such
loss to the extent not then prohibited by the Act, may either defer liquidation
of and withhold from distribution for a reasonable time any Company Assets
except those necessary to satisfy, including the provision of reasonable
Reserves for, the Company’s debts and obligations, or distribute the Company
Assets to the Members in kind in a manner otherwise in accordance with the
distribution procedure of Section 8.5.1.

-57-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(i)    Such Member is acquiring its Interest for its own account and not for the
account of any other Person. Such Member is acquiring its Interest solely for
investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the
distribution or other disposition thereof either currently or after the passage
of a fixed or determinable period of time or upon the occurrence or
non-occurrence of any predetermined event or circumstance in violation of the
Securities Act. Such Member understands that the sale and issuance of the
Interests has not been registered under the Securities Act, applicable state
securities laws or the securities or similar law of any other jurisdiction
whatsoever, and, therefore, the Interests cannot be Transferred or otherwise
disposed of unless they are registered under the securities laws of each
applicable jurisdiction, or exemptions from such registration requirements are
available. Such Member understands that Transfers and dispositions of its
Interest can be made only (i) as explicitly permitted or contemplated under the
terms of this Agreement and (ii) in compliance with the Securities Act and the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated
thereunder and all applicable state securities and “blue sky” laws; and such
Member understands that the Company is under no obligation to register the offer
or sale of any Interests in any jurisdiction whatsoever or to assist such Member
in complying with any exemption from registration under the securities laws of
any jurisdiction whatsoever.

(j)    Such Member understands and is able to bear the economic risk of an
investment in the Company and can afford to sustain a total loss on such
investment. Such Member further acknowledges that there are substantial risks in
the investment (including loss of the entire amount of such investment), that
such Member is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in
the Company and such Member has evaluated such risks and determined that the
Interest is a suitable investment for such Member. Such Member has such
knowledge and experience in business, financial and tax matters, including
experience in investing in non-listed and non-registered securities, and is a
sophisticated investor capable of utilizing the information made available to it
in connection with its investment in the Interest to evaluate the merits and
risks of its investment in the Company, to make an informed investment decision
with respect thereto and to protect its interests in connection with such
investment.

(k)    Such Member, or each beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 501 of
Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act (“Regulation D”)) of such
Member, (i) is an “accredited investor” as such term is defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D and (ii) has not been formed for the specific purpose of acquiring
the Interest unless each beneficial owner of such entity is qualified as an
accredited investor within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D.

(l)    Such Member and its legal, tax, accounting and financial advisers have
been provided an opportunity to ask questions of and receive information from a
Person or Persons acting on behalf of the Company concerning the investment in
the Company, the Company Assets, the Company, and such other matters as such
Member and any of its advisors have deemed necessary or desirable. All such
questions have been answered to the full satisfaction of such Member and any
such advisors, and such Member has received all such information requested, but
such Member has in all events relied upon its own due diligence in evaluating
this Agreement, the Interests, the Properties and the other Company Assets.

 

-58-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(m)    Such Member has consulted and been advised by its own legal counsel and
tax advisor in connection with, and acknowledges that no representations as to
potential profit, tax consequences of any sort (including the tax consequences
resulting from forming or operating the Company, conducting the business of the
Company, executing this Agreement, consummating the transactions provided for
herein, making a Capital Contribution, being admitted to the Company, receiving
or not receiving distributions from the Company, or being allocated Net Profits
and Net Losses), cash flows or funds from operations or yield, if any, in
respect of the Company have been made by the Company, any Member or any
Affiliate of any Member or any employee or representative thereof, and that
projections and any other financial information and documentation that may have
been in any manner submitted to such Member from any source shall not constitute
any representation or warranty of any kind or nature, express or implied and
such Member is not relying on any representations or warranties of any other
Person in connection therewith, including the Company or any other Member.

(n)    On the date hereof, each Member is deemed to have made to the other
Member the Anti-Corruption Representations set forth on Exhibit D hereto.

benefit plan” (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”)) which is subject to Title I
of ERISA, (ii) a plan, individual retirement account or other arrangement which
is subject to Section 4975 of the Code or any Similar Law (as defined below) or
(iii) an entity which is deemed to hold the assets of any of the described in
clauses (i) and (ii), pursuant to ERISA or applicable Similar Law. “Similar Law”
means any federal, state, local, non-U.S. or other law or regulation that would
cause the underlying assets of the Company to be treated as assets of the Member
by virtue of its interest in the Company and thereby subject the Company (and/or
other persons responsible for the investment and operation of the Company’s
assets) to laws or regulations that are similar to the fiduciary responsibility
or prohibited transaction provisions contained in Title I of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code.

9.2.3    Member Indemnity. Each Member agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Company, the other Member, each officer, director, agent and
Affiliate of the Company and the other Member from and against any and all
Liabilities arising out of or based upon any false representation or warranty
made by such Member herein.

the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and fully supersedes
any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings between the
parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

9.4    Further Assurances. Each of the parties hereto does hereby covenant and
agree on behalf of itself, its successors, and its assigns, without further
consideration, to prepare, execute, acknowledge, file, record, publish, and
deliver such other instruments, documents and statements, and to take such other
action as may be required by law or reasonably necessary to effectively carry

registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid,
addressed as follows: if to the Company, to the Company at the address set forth
in Section 1.3 hereof, or to such other address as the Company may from time to
time specify by notice to the Members; if to a Member, to such Member at the
address set forth in Exhibit A, or to such other address as such Member may from
time to time specify by notice to the Company. Any such notice shall be deemed
to be delivered, given and received for all purposes as of: (i) the date so
delivered, if delivered personally, (ii) upon receipt, if sent by electronic
email, or (iii) on the date of receipt or refusal indicated on the return
receipt, if sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested,

representative” (within the meaning of Section 6223 of the Code as amended by

taxation of the Company (the “Partnership Representative”). The Partnership
Representative shall perform his, her, or its duties under the direction and
guidance of the Managing Member and shall be authorized and required to
represent the Company (at the Company’s expense), subject to the restrictions
set forth in this Section 9.6.1, in connection with all examinations of the
Company’s affairs by tax authorities, including any resulting administrative and
judicial proceedings, and to expend Company funds for professional services
reasonably incurred in connection therewith. Subject to Section 6.3.1(k), the
Managing Member shall have the authority to remove and designate a replacement
Partnership Representative. Each Member and former Member that held an Interest
during the Reviewed Year (each, an “Interested Member”) agrees to reasonably
cooperate with the Company and to do or refrain from doing any or all things
reasonably requested by the Company with respect to the conduct of such
proceedings. The Partnership Representative shall keep the Interested Members
reasonably informed of the initiation and progress of any examinations, audits
or other proceedings. Subject to the approval of the Managing Member, the
Partnership Representative shall (i) determine whether any partnership
adjustment to each Interested Member shall be made through the application of
the procedures established pursuant to Code Section 6225(c) or through an
election and the furnishing of statements pursuant to Code Section 6226; (ii)
determine whether to make the election “out” of subchapter C, chapter 63 of the
Code under Section 6221(b) of the Code if such an election is available; and
(iii) determine whether to make any other elections available under subchapter
C, chapter 63 of the Code. The Partnership Representative shall timely designate
an individual to serve as the sole individual through whom the Partnership
Representative will act as required by Regulations Section 301.6223-1. The
designated individual must agree in writing to be bound by the same obligations
and restrictions imposed on the Partnership Representative under this
Section 9.6.1 prior to and as condition of such designation. References herein
to the Partnership Representative are deemed to include the designated
individual.

(b)    The Company shall indemnify and reimburse the Partnership Representative
for all losses suffered and all reasonable expenses (including reasonable legal
and accounting fees) incurred by it in the performance of its duties and
responsibilities as the Partnership Representative.

(c)    Tax audits, controversies and litigations shall be conducted under the
direction of the Partnership Representative, provided that the Partnership
Representative shall regularly meet and confer with the Managing Member, the MGP
Member and the Sponsor Member concerning the prosecution and status of such tax
audits, controversies and litigations. The Partnership Representative shall
submit to the Managing Member, the MGP Member and the Sponsor Member, for their
review and approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), any settlement or compromise offer with respect to any disputed
item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of the Company and shall not
enter into any such settlement or compromise offer until such approval (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) is received
from the Managing Member, the MGP Member and the Sponsor Member. The Company may
permit the Interested Members to participate in one of the procedures set forth
in Section 6225(c)(2) of the Code. If so permitted, any number of Interested
Members may participate, and no Interested Member shall be obligated to
participate. Any economic benefit or burden associated with participating in
such procedure will inure to the benefit of or be borne by each Interested
Member participating in the procedure to the extent attributable

 

-61-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

to such Interested Member. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall not
have the right to require any Interested Member to amend a tax return or
participate in any alternative procedure pursuant to Section 6225(c)(2) of the
Code nor prevent any Interested Member from doing so.

(d)    If a governmental authority makes a final determination (or the Company
agrees to accept a non-final determination by the Internal Revenue Service) that
adjusts the income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit of the Company (or any
Interested Member’s distributive share thereof) and to the extent the “push out”
election under Section 6226 of the Code is not available or made or one of the
procedures set forth in Section 6225(c)(2) of the Code are not undertaken, the
Interested Members shall bear the economic benefits and burdens of the
adjustment (including any interest and penalties), and the cost of contesting
any such adjustment, in the same manner (to the maximum extent possible) in
which the economic benefits and burdens of the adjustment would have been borne
had the Company elected “out” under Section 6221(b) of the Code for the Reviewed
Year (whether or not the Company is eligible to elect out under Section 6221(b)
of the Code). In determining the extent to which and the manner in which any
Interested Member bears the economic benefits and burdens of an adjustment, the
Managing Member shall consult with all Interested Members and thereafter use its
reasonable efforts to modify the financial burden of any Company adjustment to
each Interested Member holding an Interest during the Reviewed Year, by taking
into account the Interested Member’s actions and status (including those
described in Section 6225(c) of the Code). After consultation with the
Interested Members, the Company shall divide any adjustment and/or Imputed
Underpayment into such categories and shall determine the amounts in each
category attributable to each Interested Member in the manner the Company
reasonably determines best gives effect to the principles of this
Section 9.6.1(d) (the amount of an Imputed Underpayment in any category
attributable to an Interested Member, the Interested Member’s “BBA Share”).

(e)    The Managing Member may (1) require an Interested Member who is liable
under Section 9.6.1(d) to pay its BBA Share to the Company within ten (10) days
after the date on which the Company notifies the Interested Member (and in the
manner required by the notice) and/or (2) reduce the Interested Member’s Capital
Account or future distributions to the Interested Member under Article IV, such
that the cumulative amount under clauses (1) and (2) equals the Interested
Member’s BBA Share (plus the amount of any interest determined pursuant to the
next sentence). Any amounts under clause (1) that are not paid within the time
set forth in clause (1), and any amounts under clause (2), shall be increased to
reflect interest calculated at a rate equal to 3% per annum, compounded as of
the last day of each year (but not in excess of the highest rate per annum
permitted by applicable law). The Company may make appropriate adjustments to an
Interested Member’s Capital Account and may treat any payment described in
clause (1) in any manner reasonably determined by the Managing Member, including
as a Capital Contribution or distribution. Without duplication of amounts
otherwise paid or reimbursed by it, each Interested Member shall, at the
Company’s request, indemnify and hold harmless the Company for any liabilities
of the Company for such Interested Member’s BBA Share.

(f)    The Partnership Representative shall receive no compensation for its
services. All third-party costs and expenses reasonably incurred by the
Partnership Representative in performing its duties as such (including legal and
accounting fees) shall be paid by the Company. Nothing herein shall be construed
to restrict the Company from

 

-62-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

engaging an accounting firm and a law firm to assist the Partnership
Representative in discharging its duties hereunder, so long as the compensation
paid by the Company for such services is reasonable. The provisions of this
Section 9.6.1 shall survive (i) the termination of the Company, this Agreement,
and the termination of any Interested Member’s Interest in the Company, and
(ii) the transfer of all or a part of a Interested Member’s Interest in the
Company. Each Interested Member agrees that as a condition to any transfer of an
Interest as permitted under this Agreement, the transferor Interested Member
continues to be bound by all of the provisions of this Section 9.6.1.

(g)    Each Interested Member agrees that such Interested Member shall not treat
any Company item inconsistently on such Interested Member’s federal, state,
foreign, or other income tax return with the treatment of the item on the
Company’s return. Each Interested Member further agrees to cooperate in taking
such actions as may be required to cause any election made by the Company to be
effective and to provide the Partnership Representative with documentation of
its compliance with the provisions of this Section 9.6.1.

(h)    The Interested Members waive any fiduciary duty of the Partnership
Representative to any of them. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing waiver
shall not limit any duties to the Company.

9.6.2    Tax Elections. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.6.3, subject
to Section 6.3.1(j), the Partnership Representative may make all elections for
federal income and all other tax purposes in accordance with this Agreement.

9.6.3    Tax Elections. Prior to making any tax election other than a Required
Tax Election or an election under subchapter C, chapter 63 of the Code (which
shall be governed by Section 9.6.1) with respect to the Company or its
Subsidiaries for federal, state or local tax purposes, the Partnership
Representative and the Company shall permit the MGP Member and the Sponsor
Member to review, provide comments on and discuss in advance, and shall consider
in good faith any comments made by such Members in relation to, such election.

9.6.4    Intentionally Omitted.

9.6.5    Operating Tax Covenants. The Managing Member, the MGP Member, the
Sponsor Member and the Company covenant the following:

(a)    For purposes of Regulations Section 1.752-2, 1.752-3 and 1.707-5(a)(2),
the Company shall allocate liabilities of the Company amongst the properties of
the Company and among the members of the Company in a manner consistent with
applicable law as reasonably determined by the Managing Member; provided that
the “excess nonrecourse liabilities” (as defined in Regulations
Section 1.752-3(a)(3)) of the Company, if any, shall be allocated (i) first to
the MGP Member in accordance with the “additional method” (as defined in
Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3)) up to the maximum amount permitted by such
method under applicable law but not in excess of the sum of the amount of
built-in gain that is allocable to the MGP Member on Code Section 704(c)
property (as defined under Regulations Section 1.704-3(a)(3)(ii)) or property
with respect to which reverse Section 704(c) allocations are applicable (as
described in Regulations Section 1.704-3(a)(6)(i)) and (ii) thereafter in
accordance with

 

-63-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3), based on allocations of projected taxable
income of the Company . In the event of a change in law or interpretation
thereof, the Parties shall use reasonable efforts to apply such changed law or
interpretation thereof in accordance with applicable law in the manner that
minimizes the recognition of income or gain by the MGP Member as reasonably
determined by the Managing Member, but, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the Company be required to modify the economic arrangements of the
Members and the Company shall have no obligation or liability to the MGP Member
to the extent that the Company’s inability to comply with the provisions of this
Section 9.6.5(a) are attributable to such change in the tax laws or
interpretation thereof. The Managing Member shall consult with MGM, the MGP
Member and the Sponsor Member when conducting any computations and allocations
pursuant to this Section 9.6.5(a) and shall consider in good faith all
reasonable comments of MGM, the MGP Member and the Sponsor Member.

(b)    If the Company has in effect a Code Section 754 election and recognizes
any Code Section 734(b) adjustment to the tax basis of any of the Properties
(including all subsequent replacements pursuant to Section 1031, Section 1033,
or any other nonrecognition provision of the Code) in any taxable year, the
Company shall not file any income tax return reporting such Code Section 734(b)
adjustment as giving rise to additional gain recognized under Code Section 731
to a Member in the same taxable year (i.e., because of a reduction in the
liabilities allocated to the Member pursuant to Regulations Section 1.752-3);
provided that, if the Sponsor Member is the Managing Member, the obligations of
the Members and the Company under this Section 9.6.5(b) shall be conditioned on
the Company’s receipt of written advice level from tax advisors reasonably
satisfactory to the Sponsor Member with a conclusion at least at a “more likely
than not” level that such position is consistent with applicable law.

(c)    The Company shall not make a Code Section 754 election; provided,
however, such election may be made in the tax year in which a Member (including
any of its Affiliates that hold an Interest, if applicable) has Transferred an
Interest constituting at least 10% of the total Economic Interests in the
Company in a taxable disposition to a Third Party.

(d)    For purposes of making Code Section 704(c) allocations with respect to a
Property, the Company shall apply the “traditional method” pursuant to
Regulations Section 1.704-3(b).

(e)    If the Company transfers any interest in a Property to a Subsidiary in a
transaction treated as a Code Section 721 exchange, the transferee partnership
shall make Code Section 704(c) allocations with respect to such interest in such
Property in the same manner as the Company.

9.6.6    Tax Returns. Preparation of the tax returns and statements, if any, of
the Company shall be the responsibility of the Managing Member. If the Managing
Member engages a certified public accountant for the preparation and or review
of any or all of the income tax returns, the expense shall be a Company Expense.

9.6.7    Member Information. In the event any Member makes any tax election that
requires the Company to furnish information to such Member to enable such Member
to compute its own tax liability, or requires the Company to file any tax return
or report with any

 

-64-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

tax authority, in either case that would not be required in the absence of such
election made by such Member, the Managing Member may, as a condition to
furnishing such information or filing such return or report, require such Member
to pay to the Company any incremental expenses incurred in connection therewith;
provided no Member shall be required to pay to the Company for any incremental
expenses incurred in connection with any information the Managing Member is
required to provide to any Member under Section 6.7.3. Promptly upon request,
each Member shall provide the Company with any information related to such
Member necessary (A) to allow the Company to comply with any tax reporting, tax
withholding or tax payment obligations of the Company or (B) to establish the
Company’s legal entitlement to an exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
or other taxes or similar payments, including U.S. federal withholding tax under
Sections 1471 and 1472 of the Code.

9.6.8    Tax Protection Claims. If the Company receives (i) any claim that
damages are due as a result of a Breach (as defined in the Tax Protection
Agreement) or (ii) any notice of an actual, threatened or impending Company Tax
Audit (as defined in the Tax Protection Agreement), the Managing Member shall
promptly notify the Members of such claim or audit and provide the Members with
such additional information as the Members reasonably request. The Managing
Member shall keep the MGP Member and the Sponsor Member reasonably informed of
the progress of any such claim or audit.

9.7    Governing Law. This Agreement, including its existence, validity,
construction, and operating effect, and the rights of each of the parties
hereto, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware without regard to otherwise governing principles of choice of
law or conflicts of law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge

respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and all other Persons
hereafter holding, having or receiving a Membership Interest or Economic
Interest, whether as Assignees, Substitute Members or otherwise.

9.11    Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement as
applied to any party or to any circumstance, shall be adjudged by a court to be
void, unenforceable or inoperative as a matter of law, then the same shall in no
way affect any other provision in this Agreement, the application of such
provision in any other circumstance or with respect to any other party, or the
validity or enforceability of the Agreement as a whole.

9.17    Submission to Jurisdiction. Each Member hereby irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Chancery Court (or, if the Delaware
Chancery Court shall be unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware)
or, in the case of claims to which the federal courts have jurisdiction, the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware for the purposes of
any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any
transaction contemplated hereby. Each Member further agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such party’s
respective address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any
action, suit or proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it
has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding

-67-



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

from any further violation of this Agreement and to exercise such remedies
cumulatively or in conjunction with all other rights and remedies provided by
law. Each Member acknowledges that money damages for any breach by such Member
of the provisions of this Agreement would not be a sufficient remedy for any
breach of this Agreement by such Member and that in addition to all other
remedies the Company and the non-breaching Members shall be entitled to seek
specific performance and injunctive or other equitable relief for any such
breach.

9.20    Intentionally Omitted.
