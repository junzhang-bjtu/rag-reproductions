and not jointly, to purchase from the Issuers on the Closing Date the respective

of Securities purchased by each Initial Purchaser in the proportions that the
principal amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names in
Schedule 1 hereto bear to the aggregate principal amount of Securities set forth
opposite the names of all such Initial Purchasers.  The Issuers will not be
obligated to deliver any of the Securities except upon payment for all the
Securities to be purchased as provided herein.

 

(b)           The Issuers understand that the Initial Purchasers intend to offer
the Securities for resale on the terms set forth in the Time of Sale
Information.  Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, represents,
warrants and agrees that:

 

(i)                 it is a qualified institutional buyer within the meaning of

Initial Purchaser is acting solely in the capacity of an arm’s length
contractual counterparty to the Partnership Parties with respect to the offering
of Securities contemplated hereby (including in connection with determining the
terms of the offering) and not as a financial advisor or a fiduciary to, or
agent of, the Partnership Parties or any other person and (ii) the several
Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad
range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the
Partnership Parties, and the several Initial Purchasers have no obligation to
disclose any of such interests by virtue of any fiduciary or advisory
relationship.  Additionally, neither the Representative nor any other Initial
Purchaser is advising the Partnership Parties or any other person as to any
legal, tax, investment, accounting or regulatory matters in any jurisdiction. 
The Partnership Parties shall consult with their own advisors concerning such
matters and shall be responsible for making their own independent investigation
and appraisal of the transactions contemplated hereby, and neither the
Representative nor any other Initial Purchaser shall have any responsibility or
liability to the Partnership Parties with respect thereto.  Any review by the
Representative or any Initial Purchaser of the Partnership Parties and the
transactions contemplated hereby or other matters relating to such transactions
will be performed solely for the benefit of the Representative or such Initial
Purchaser, as the case may be, and shall not be on behalf of the Partnership
Parties or any other person and does not constitute a recommendation, investment
advice, or solicitation of any action by the Representative or any Initial
Purchaser.

Parties, taken as a whole, is not less than the total amount required to pay the
liability of the Partnership Parties, taken as a whole, on their total existing
debts and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as they become absolute
and matured; (ii) the Partnership Parties, taken as a whole, are able to realize
upon their assets and pay their debts and other liabilities, contingent
obligations and commitments as they mature and become due in the normal course
of business; (iii) assuming consummation of the issuance of the Securities and
the Guarantees as contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information
and the Offering Memorandum, the Partnership Parties, taken as a whole, are not
incurring debts or liabilities beyond their ability to pay as such debts and
liabilities mature; (iv) the Partnership Parties, taken as a whole, are not
engaged in any business or transaction, and do not propose to engage in any
business or transaction, for which their property would constitute unreasonably
small capital after giving due consideration to the prevailing practice in the
industry in which the Partnership Parties, taken as a whole, are engaged; and
(v) the Partnership Parties, taken as a whole, are not a defendant in any civil
action that would result in a judgment that the Partnership Parties, taken as a
whole, are or would become unable to satisfy.

(eee)        Rule 144A Eligibility.  The Securities are eligible for resale
pursuant to Rule 144A and, on the Closing Date, will not be of the same class as
securities listed on a national securities exchange registered under Section 6
of the Exchange Act or quoted in an automated inter-dealer quotation system; and
each of the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Offering Memorandum, as of

Securities Act.

 

(fff)           No General Solicitation or Directed Selling Efforts.  None of

sold, the Securities by means of any form of general solicitation or general
advertising within the meaning of Rule 502(c) of Regulation D or in any manner

the Trust Indenture Act.

 

(hhh)       No Broker’s Fees.  None of the Partnership Parties is a party to any
contract, agreement or understanding with any person (other than this Agreement)
that would give rise to a valid claim against any of them or any Initial
Purchaser for a brokerage commission, finder’s fee or like payment in connection
with the offering and sale of the Securities.

 

(iii)            Margin Rules.  Neither the issuance, sale and delivery of the
Securities nor the application of the proceeds thereof by the Partnership as

United States and, in connection therewith, the Offering Memorandum will contain
the disclosure required by Rule 902.  The Partnership is a “reporting issuer,”
as defined in Rule 902 under the Securities Act.

 



 20

 

 

Any certificate signed by any officer of the Partnership Parties and delivered
to the Representative or counsel for the Initial Purchasers in connection with

thereby, to each Initial Purchaser.

 

4.                  Further Agreements of the Partnership Parties.  Each of the
Partnership Parties jointly and severally covenants and agrees with each of the
Initial Purchasers that:

 

(a)               Preparation of Offering Memorandum; Delivery of Copies.  The

Representative may reasonably request.

 

(b)               Offering Memorandum, Amendments or Supplements.  Before
finalizing the Offering Memorandum or making or distributing any amendment or

review, and will not distribute any such proposed Offering Memorandum, amendment
or supplement or file any such document with the Commission to which the
Representative reasonably objects.

communication to which the Representative reasonably objects.

 

(d)               Notice to the Representative.  The Partnership Parties will
advise the Representative promptly, and confirm such advice in writing, (i) of
the issuance by any governmental or regulatory authority of any order preventing
or suspending the use of any of the Time of Sale Information, any Issuer Written
Communication or the Offering Memorandum or the initiation or threatening of any
proceeding for that purpose; (ii) of the occurrence of any event at any time
prior to the completion of the initial offering of the Securities and the
Guarantees as a result of which any of the Time of Sale Information, any Issuer
Written Communication or the Offering Memorandum as then amended or supplemented
would include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances existing when such Time of Sale Information, Issuer Written
Communication or the Offering Memorandum is delivered to a purchaser, not
misleading; and (iii) of the receipt by the Partnership Parties of any notice
with respect to any suspension of the qualification of the Securities and the
Guarantees for offer and sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or
threatening of any proceeding for such purpose; and the Partnership Parties will
use their commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any such
order preventing or suspending the use of any of the Time of Sale Information,
any Issuer Written Communication or the Offering Memorandum or suspending any
such qualification of the Securities and the Guarantees and, if any such order
is issued, will obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.

 

 21

 



 

(e)               Time of Sale Information.  If at any time prior to the Closing
Date (i) any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of which any
of the Time of Sale Information as then amended or supplemented would include
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading or (ii) it is necessary
to amend or supplement the Time of Sale Information to comply with law, the
Issuers will immediately notify the Initial Purchasers thereof and forthwith
prepare and, subject to Section 4(b), furnish to the Initial Purchasers such
amendments or supplements to the Time of Sale Information (or any document to be
filed with the Commission and incorporated by reference therein) as may be
necessary so that the statements in any of the Time of Sale Information as so
amended or supplemented (including such documents to be incorporated by
reference therein) will not, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, be misleading or so that any of the Time of Sale Information will
comply with law.

 

(f)                Ongoing Compliance of the Offering Memorandum.  If at any
time prior to the completion of the initial offering of the Securities and the
Guarantees (i) any event shall occur or condition shall exist as a result of
which the Offering Memorandum as then amended or supplemented would include any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
existing when the Offering Memorandum is delivered to a purchaser, not
misleading or (ii) it is necessary to amend or supplement the Offering
Memorandum to comply with law, the Issuers will immediately notify the Initial
Purchasers thereof and forthwith prepare and, subject to Section 4(b), furnish
to the Initial Purchasers such amendments or supplements to the Offering
Memorandum (or any document to be filed with the Commission and incorporated by
reference therein) as may be necessary so that the statements in the Offering
Memorandum as so amended or supplemented (including such document to be
incorporated by reference therein) will not, in the light of the circumstances
existing when the Offering Memorandum is delivered to a purchaser, be misleading
or so that the Offering Memorandum will comply with law.

 

(g)               Blue Sky Compliance.  The Partnership Parties will qualify the
Securities and the Guarantees for offer and sale under the securities or Blue
Sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Representative shall reasonably request
and will continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the
offering and resale of the Securities and the Guarantees; provided that in
connection therewith none of the Partnership Parties shall be required to
(i) qualify as a foreign limited partnership, limited liability company or
corporation or other entity or as a dealer in securities in any such
jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to so qualify, (ii) file
any general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction or (iii) subject
itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction if it is not otherwise so subject.

 

(h)               Clear Market.  During the period from the date hereof through
and including the date that is 90 days after the date hereof, each of the
Partnership Parties will not, without the prior written consent of the
Representative, offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt
securities issued or guaranteed by any of the Partnership Parties and having a
term of more than one year.

 

 22

 



 

(i)                 Use of Proceeds.  The Partnership Parties will apply the net
proceeds from the sale of the Securities in the manner described in each of the
Time of Sale Information and the Offering Memorandum under the heading “Use of
Proceeds.”

 

(j)                 Additional Issuer Information.  Prior to the completion of
the placement of the Securities by the Initial Purchasers with any subsequent
purchasers, the Partnership Parties shall file, on a timely basis, with the
Commission all reports and documents required to be filed under Section 13 or 15
of the Exchange Act.  While the Securities remain outstanding and are
“restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the
Securities Act, each of the Partnership Parties will, during any period in which
the Partnership is not subject to and in compliance with Section 13 or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act, furnish to holders of the Securities and prospective
purchasers of the Securities designated by such holders, upon the request of
such holders or such prospective purchasers, the information required to be
delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

 

(k)               DTC.  The Partnership Parties will assist the Initial
Purchasers in arranging for the Securities and the Guarantees to be eligible for
clearance and settlement through DTC.

 

(l)                 No Resales by the Partnership.  The Partnership Parties will
not, and will not permit any of their affiliates (as defined in Rule 144 under
the Securities Act) to, resell any of the Securities and the Guarantees that
have been acquired by any of them, except for Securities purchased by the
Partnership Parties or any of their affiliates and resold in a transaction
registered under the Securities Act.

 

(m)             No Integration.  None of the Partnership Parties or any of their
affiliates (as defined in Rule 501(b) of Regulation D) will, directly or through
any agent, sell, offer for sale, solicit offers to buy or otherwise negotiate in
respect of, any security (as defined in the Securities Act), that is or will be
integrated with the sale of the Securities and the Guarantees in a manner that
would require registration of the Securities and the Guarantees under the
Securities Act.

 

(n)               No General Solicitation or Directed Selling Efforts.  None of
the Partnership Parties or any of their affiliates or any other person acting on
its or their behalf (other than the Initial Purchasers, as to which no covenant
is given) will (i) solicit offers for, or offer or sell, the Securities and the
Guarantees by means of any form of general solicitation or general advertising
within the meaning of Rule 502(c) of Regulation D or in any manner involving a
public offering within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or
(ii) engage in any directed selling efforts within the meaning of Regulation S,
and all such persons will comply with the offering restrictions requirement of
Regulation S.

 

(o)               No Stabilization.  None of the Partnership Parties will take,
directly or indirectly, any action designed to or that could reasonably be
expected to cause or result in any stabilization or manipulation of the price of
the Securities.

 

(p)               Legended Securities.  Each certificate for a Security will
bear a legend substantially the same as that contained in “Transfer
Restrictions” in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum for the time period and
upon the other terms stated in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum.

 

 23

 



 

The Representative may, in its sole discretion, waive in writing the performance
by the Partnership Parties of any one or more of the foregoing covenants or
extend the time for their performance.

 

5.                  Certain Agreements of the Initial Purchasers.  Each Initial
Purchaser, severally and not jointly, hereby represents and agrees that it has
not and will not use, authorize use of, refer to, or participate in the planning
for use of, any written communication that constitutes an offer to sell or the
solicitation of an offer to buy the Securities and the Guarantees other than
(i) the Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Offering Memorandum, (ii) any
written communication that contains either (a) no “issuer information” (as
defined in Rule 433(h)(2) under the Securities Act) or (b) “issuer information”
that was included (including through incorporation by reference) in the Time of
Sale Information or the Offering Memorandum, (iii) any written communication
prepared pursuant to Section 4(c) above (including any electronic road show),
(iv) any written communication prepared by such Initial Purchaser and approved
by the Partnership in advance in writing or (v) any written communication
relating to or that contains the preliminary or final terms of the Securities
and the Guarantees or their offering and/or other information that was included
(including through incorporation by reference) in the Time of Sale Information
or the Offering Memorandum.

 

6.                  Conditions of Initial Purchasers’ Obligations.  The

Exchange Act; and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that
it has under surveillance or review, or has changed its outlook with respect to,
its rating of the Securities or of any other debt securities or preferred stock
issued or guaranteed by any of the Partnership Parties (other than an

(c)               No Material Adverse Change.  Subsequent to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, no event or condition of a type described in

condition is not described in each of the Time of Sale Information (excluding
any amendment or supplement thereto) and the Offering Memorandum (excluding any
amendment or supplement thereto) the effect of which in the judgment of the
Representative makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the

in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and
the Offering Memorandum.

 

 24

 



 

(d)               Officer’s Certificate.  The Representative shall have received

any party to any other party, except that Sections 7 and 10 hereof shall at all
times be effective and shall survive such termination.

 

7.                  Indemnification and Contribution.

 

(a)               Indemnification of the Initial Purchasers.  The Partnership
Parties jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial
Purchaser, its affiliates who have, or who are alleged to have, participated in
the distribution of the Securities, directors and officers and each person, if
any, who controls such Initial Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, legal
fees and other expenses incurred in connection with any suit, action or
proceeding or any claim asserted, as such fees and expenses are incurred), joint
or several, that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Preliminary
Offering Memorandum, any of the other Time of Sale Information, any Issuer
Written Communication or the Offering Memorandum (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, in each case except
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are
based upon, any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or
omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with any information relating
to any Initial Purchaser furnished to the Partnership in writing by such Initial
Purchaser through the Representative expressly for use therein.

 

 26

 

 

(b)               Indemnification of the Partnership.  Each Initial Purchaser
agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold harmless each of the
Partnership Parties, the directors and officers of each of the Partnership
Parties, as the case may be, and each person, if any, who controls the
Partnership Parties within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or
Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set forth in
paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue statement or
omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in
conformity with any information relating to such Initial Purchaser furnished to
the Partnership in writing by such Initial Purchaser through the Representative
expressly for use in the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, any of the other Time
of Sale Information, any Issuer Written Communication or the Offering Memorandum
(or any amendment or supplement thereto), it being understood and agreed that
the only such written information consists of the following information in the
Preliminary Offering Memorandum and the Offering Memorandum: the third sentence
of the seventh paragraph and the tenth paragraph under the caption “Plan of
Distribution.”

 

(c)               Notice and Procedures.  If any suit, action, proceeding
(including any governmental or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall
be brought or asserted against any person in respect of which indemnification
may be sought pursuant to either paragraph (a) or (b) above, such person (the
“Indemnified Person”) shall promptly notify the person against whom such
indemnification may be sought (the “Indemnifying Person”) in writing; provided
that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any
liability that it may have under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent
that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive
rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided, further, that the failure to
notify the Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it
may have to an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or
(b) above.  If any such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an
Indemnified Person and it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof,
the Indemnifying Person shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Person (who shall not, without the consent of the Indemnified
Person, be counsel to the Indemnifying Person) to represent the Indemnified
Person and any others entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 7
that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such proceeding and shall pay the
fees and expenses of such proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such
counsel related to such proceeding, as incurred.  In any such proceeding, any
Indemnified Person shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees
and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person
unless (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have
mutually agreed to the contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within
a reasonable time to retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Person; (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there
may be legal defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to
those available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any
such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying
Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same
counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests
between them.  It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall
not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm
(in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all
such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Any such
separate firm for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates who have, or who are
alleged to have, participated in the distribution of the Securities, directors
and officers and any control persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be
designated in writing by the Representative and any such separate firm for the
Partnership Parties, their directors and officers and any control persons of the
Partnership Parties shall be designated in writing by the Partnership.  The
Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if
there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to
indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment. No Indemnifying Person shall, without the
written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of any pending
or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could
have been a party and indemnification could have been sought hereunder by such
Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (x) includes an unconditional release
of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims that are the subject
matter of such proceeding and (y) does not include any statement as to or any
admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any
Indemnified Person.

 

 27

 



 

(d)               Contribution.  If the indemnification provided for in
paragraph (a) or (b) above is unavailable to an Indemnified Person or
insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred
to therein, then each Indemnifying Person under such paragraph, in lieu of
indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by the Partnership Parties on the one hand and the
Initial Purchasers on the other from the offering of the Securities and the
Guarantees or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by
applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the
relative benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the
Partnership Parties on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other in
connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Partnership Parties on
the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other shall be deemed to be in
the same respective proportions as the net proceeds (before deducting expenses)
received by the Issuers from the sale of the Securities and the Guarantees and
the total discounts and commissions received by the Initial Purchasers in
connection therewith, as provided in this Agreement, bear to the aggregate
offering price of the Securities and the Guarantees.  The relative fault of the
Partnership Parties on the one hand and the Initial Purchasers on the other
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers or any
Guarantor or by the Initial Purchasers and the parties’ relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission.

 

(e)               Limitation on Liability.  The Partnership Parties and the
Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this Section 7 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the
Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other
method of allocation that does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to in paragraph (d) above.  The amount paid or payable by an
Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities
referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include, subject to the
limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred by such
Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim.  Notwithstanding
the provisions of this Section 7, in no event shall an Initial Purchaser be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
discounts and commissions received by such Initial Purchaser with respect to the
offering of the Securities and the Guarantees exceeds the amount of any damages
that such Initial Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.  No person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Initial Purchasers’
obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 7 are several in proportion
to their respective purchase obligations hereunder and not joint.

 

 28

 



 

 

(f)                Non-Exclusive Remedies.  The remedies provided for in this
Section 7 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies that may
otherwise be available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity.

 

8.                  Termination.  This Agreement may be terminated in the
absolute discretion of the Representative, by notice to the Issuers, if after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and on or prior to the Closing Date
(i) trading generally shall have been suspended or materially limited on the New
York Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market; (ii) trading of any
securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuers or any of the Guarantors shall
have been suspended on any exchange or in any over-the-counter market; (iii) a
general moratorium on commercial banking activities shall have been declared by
federal or New York State authorities; or (iv) there shall have occurred any
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or any change in financial markets or any
calamity or crisis, either within or outside the United States, that, in the
judgment of the Representative, is material and adverse and makes it
impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of
the Securities and the Guarantees on the terms and in the manner contemplated by
this Agreement, the Time of Sale Information and the Offering Memorandum.

 

9.                  Defaulting Initial Purchaser.

 

(a)               If, on the Closing Date, any Initial Purchaser defaults on its
obligation to purchase the Securities and the Guarantees that it has agreed to
purchase hereunder, the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers may in their
discretion arrange for the purchase of such Securities by other persons
satisfactory to the Issuers on the terms contained in this Agreement.  If,
within 36 hours after any such default by any Initial Purchaser, the
non-defaulting Initial Purchasers do not arrange for the purchase of such
Securities, then the Issuers shall be entitled to a further period of 36 hours
within which to procure other persons satisfactory to the non-defaulting Initial
Purchasers to purchase such Securities on such terms.  If other persons become
obligated or agree to purchase the Securities and the Guarantees of a defaulting
Initial Purchaser, either the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers or the Issuers
may postpone the Closing Date for up to five full business days in order to
effect any changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Issuers or counsel for
the Initial Purchasers may be necessary in the Time of Sale Information, the
Offering Memorandum or in any other document or arrangement, and the Issuers
agree to promptly prepare any amendment or supplement to the Time of Sale
Information or the Offering Memorandum that effects any such changes.  As used
in this Agreement, the term “Initial Purchaser” includes, for all purposes of
this Agreement unless the context otherwise requires, any person not listed in
Schedule 1 hereto that, pursuant to this Section 9, purchases Securities that a
defaulting Initial Purchaser agreed but failed to purchase.

 

 29

 

 

(b)               If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase
of the Securities and the Guarantees of a defaulting Initial Purchaser or
Initial Purchasers by the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers and the Issuers as
provided in paragraph (a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such
Securities that remains unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of the
aggregate principal amount of all the Securities, then the Issuers shall have
the right to require each non-defaulting Initial Purchaser to purchase the
principal amount of Securities that such Initial Purchaser agreed to purchase
hereunder plus such Initial Purchaser’s pro rata share (based on the principal
amount of Securities that such Initial Purchaser agreed to purchase hereunder)
of the Securities of such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers for
which such arrangements have not been made.

 

(c)               If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase
of the Securities of a defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers by the
non-defaulting Initial Purchasers and the Issuers as provided in paragraph
(a) above, the aggregate principal amount of such Securities that remains
unpurchased exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of all the
Securities, or if the Issuers shall not exercise the right described in
paragraph (b) above, then this Agreement shall terminate without liability on
the part of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers.  Any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9 shall be without liability on the part of
the Partnership Parties, except that the Partnership Parties will continue to be
liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Section 10 hereof and except
that the provisions of Section 7 hereof shall not terminate and shall remain in
effect.

 

(d)               Nothing contained herein shall relieve a defaulting Initial
Purchaser of any liability it may have to the Partnership Parties or any
non-defaulting Initial Purchaser for damages caused by its default.

 

10.              Payment of Expenses. 

 

(a)               Whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the Partnership Parties jointly
and severally agree to pay or cause to be paid all costs and expenses incident
to the performance of their respective obligations hereunder, including without
limitation, (i) the costs incident to the authorization, issuance, sale,
preparation and delivery of the Securities and the Guarantees and any taxes
payable in that connection; (ii) the costs incident to the preparation and
printing of the Preliminary Offering Memorandum, any other Time of Sale
Information, any Issuer Written Communication and the Offering Memorandum
(including any amendment or supplement thereto) and the distribution thereof
(including any form of electronic distribution); (iii) the costs of reproducing
and distributing each of the Transaction Documents; (iv) the fees and expenses
of the Partnership Parties’ counsel and independent accountants; (v) the fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the registration or qualification and
determination of eligibility for investment of the Securities under the laws of
such jurisdictions as the Representative may designate and the preparation,
printing and distribution of a Blue Sky Memorandum (including the related fees
and expenses of counsel for the Initial Purchasers); (vi) any fees charged by
rating agencies for rating the Securities; (vii) the fees and expenses of the
Trustee and any paying agent (including related fees and expenses of any counsel
to such parties); (viii) all expenses and application fees incurred in
connection with the approval of the Securities for book-entry transfer by DTC;
and (ix) all expenses incurred by the Partnership Parties in connection with any
“road show” presentation to potential investors.

 

 30

 



 

(b)               If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to clause (ii) of
Section 8, (ii) the Issuers for any reason fail to tender the Securities for
delivery to the Initial Purchasers or (iii) the Initial Purchasers decline to
purchase the Securities for any reason permitted under this Agreement, the
Partnership Parties jointly and severally agree to reimburse the Initial
Purchasers for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including the fees and
expenses of their counsel) reasonably incurred by the Initial Purchasers in
connection with this Agreement and the offering contemplated hereby.

 

11.              Persons Entitled to Benefit of Agreement.  This Agreement shall
inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their
respective successors and officers and directors and any controlling persons
referred to herein, and the affiliates of each Initial Purchaser referred to in
Section 7 hereof.  Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed
to give any other person any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or
in respect of this Agreement or any provision contained herein.  No purchaser of
Securities from any Initial Purchaser shall be deemed to be a successor merely
by reason of such purchase.

 

12.              Survival.  The respective indemnities, rights of contribution,
representations, warranties and agreements of the Partnership Parties and the
Initial Purchasers contained in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of the
Partnership Parties or the Initial Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement or any
certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the delivery of and payment
for the Securities and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any
termination of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Partnership Parties or the Initial Purchasers.

 

13.              Certain Defined Terms.  For purposes of this Agreement,
(a) except where otherwise expressly provided, the term “affiliate” has the
meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act; (b) the term “business
day” means any day other than a day on which banks are permitted or required to
be closed in New York City; (c) the term “subsidiary” has the meaning set forth
in Rule 405 under the Securities Act; and (d) the term “written communication”
has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 under the Securities Act.

 

14.              Miscellaneous.

Purchasers hereunder may be taken by the Representative on behalf of the Initial
Purchasers, and any such action taken by the Representative shall be binding
upon the Initial Purchasers.

 31

dispute arising under or related to this Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

 

(d)               Submission to Jurisdiction.  The Partnership Parties hereby
submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. federal and New York state
courts in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New York in any suit or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.  The Partnership Parties waive any objection which they may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such suit or proceeding in
such courts.  Each of the Partnership Parties agrees that final judgment in any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court shall be conclusive and
binding upon the Partnership Parties and may be enforced in any court to the
jurisdiction of which the Partnership Parties are subject by a suit upon such
judgment.

 

(e)               Waiver of Jury Trial.  Each of the parties hereto hereby
waives any right to trial by jury in any suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement.

 

(f)                Counterparts.  This Agreement may be signed in counterparts
(which may include counterparts delivered by any standard form of
telecommunication), each of which shall be an original and all of which together
shall constitute one and the same instrument. The words “execution,” “signed,”
“signature,” “delivery,” and words of like import in or relating to this
Agreement or any document to be signed in connection with this Agreement shall
be deemed to include electronic signatures, deliveries or the keeping of records
in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or
enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or

parties hereto consent to conduct the transactions contemplated hereunder by
electronic means.

 

(g)               Amendments or Waivers.  No amendment or waiver of any

law October 26, 2001)), the Initial Purchasers are required to obtain, verify

respective clients, as well as other information that will allow the Initial
Purchasers to properly identify their respective clients.

 

(j)                 Recognition of the U.S. Special Resolution Regimes.

Agreement, and any such interest and obligation, were governed by the laws of
the United States or a state of the United States.

 

 32

 



 

(ii)              In the event that any Initial Purchaser that is a Covered
Entity or a BHC Act Affiliate of such Initial Purchaser becomes subject to a

laws of the United States or a state of the United States.

where action for that purpose is required.

Exhibit A-5

 

 

As a condition to participating in the Exchange Offer, a Holder will be required
to represent to the Issuers and the Guarantors that (i) any Exchange Securities
to be received by it will be acquired in the ordinary course of its business,
(ii) at the time of the commencement of the Exchange Offer it has no arrangement

provisions of the Securities Act, (iii) it is not an “affiliate” (within the

Prospectus to purchasers) in connection with any resale of such Exchange
Securities.

 

As soon as practicable after the last Exchange Date, the Issuers and the
Guarantors shall:

 

(i)accept for exchange Registrable Securities or portions thereof validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Exchange Offer; and

 

(ii)deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Trustee for cancellation all
Registrable Securities or portions thereof so accepted for exchange by the
Issuers and issue, and cause the Trustee to promptly authenticate and deliver to
each Holder, Exchange Securities equal in principal amount to the principal
amount of the Registrable Securities tendered by such Holder.

 

The Issuers and the Guarantors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
complete the Exchange Offer as provided above and shall comply with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other
applicable laws and regulations in connection with the Exchange Offer.  The
Exchange Offer shall not be subject to any conditions, other than that the
Exchange Offer does not violate any applicable law or applicable interpretations
of the Staff.

 

(b)       In the event that (i) the Issuers and the Guarantors determine that
the Exchange Offer Registration provided for in Section 2(a) above is not
available or the Exchange Offer may not be completed as soon as practicable
after the last Exchange Date because it would violate any applicable law or
applicable interpretations of the Staff, (ii) the Exchange Offer is not for any
other reason completed by December 1, 2021 or (iii) any Initial Purchaser shall
so request in connection with any offer or sale of Registrable Securities (a
“Shelf Request”), the Issuers and the Guarantors shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be filed as soon as practicable after such
determination, date or Shelf Request, as the case may be, a Shelf Registration
Statement providing for the sale of all the Registrable Securities by the
Holders thereof and to have such Shelf Registration Statement become effective;
provided that no Holder will be entitled to have any Registrable Securities
included in any Shelf Registration Statement, or entitled to use the Prospectus
forming a part of such Shelf Registration Statement, until such Holder shall
have delivered a completed and signed Notice and Questionnaire and provided such
other information regarding such Holder to the Issuers as is contemplated by
Section 3(b) hereof.

 



Exhibit A-6

 

 

In the event that the Issuers and the Guarantors are required to file a Shelf
Registration Statement pursuant to clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, the
Issuers and the Guarantors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file and
have declared effective by the SEC (or file and become effective automatically,
as the case may be) both an Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to
Section 2(a) above with respect to all Registrable Securities and a Shelf
Registration Statement (which may be a combined Registration Statement with the
Exchange Offer Registration Statement) with respect to offers and sales of
Registrable Securities held by the Initial Purchasers after completion of the
Exchange Offer.

 

The Issuers and the Guarantors agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
keep the Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective until the earlier
of one year following the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement and
such time as all the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement have been sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (the
“Shelf Effectiveness Period”).  The Issuers and the Guarantors further agree to
supplement or amend the Shelf Registration Statement, the related Prospectus and
any Free Writing Prospectus if required by the rules, regulations or
instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Issuers for such
Shelf Registration Statement or by the Securities Act or by any other rules and
regulations thereunder or if reasonably requested by a Participating Holder with
respect to information relating to such Holder, and, to the extent necessary, to
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such amendment to become
effective and such Shelf Registration Statement, Prospectus or Free Writing
Prospectus, as the case may be, to become usable as soon as thereafter
practicable.  The Issuers and the Guarantors agree to furnish to the
Participating Holders copies of any such supplement or amendment promptly after
its being used or filed with the SEC.

 

(c)       The Issuers and the Guarantors shall pay all Registration Expenses in
connection with any registration pursuant to Section 2(a) or
Section 2(b) hereof.  Each Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and
commissions, brokerage commissions and transfer taxes, if any, relating to the
sale or disposition of such Holder’s Registrable Securities pursuant to the
Shelf Registration Statement.

 

(d)       An Exchange Offer Registration Statement pursuant to
Section 2(a) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has
been declared effective by the SEC.  A Shelf Registration Statement pursuant to
Section 2(b) hereof will not be deemed to have become effective unless it has
been declared effective by the SEC or is automatically effective upon filing
with the SEC as provided by Rule 462 under the Securities Act.

 

In the event that either the Exchange Offer is not completed or the Shelf
Registration Statement, if required hereby, is not declared effective (or does
not automatically become effective) on or prior to December 1, 2021, the Issuers
will pay liquidated damages to Holders of Registrable Securities with the effect
that the interest rate on the Registrable Securities will be increased by 1.00%
per annum until the Exchange Offer is completed or the Shelf Registration
Statement, if required hereby, is declared effective by the SEC (or becomes
automatically effective).  All liquidated damages will be paid by the Issuers on
the next scheduled interest payment date in the same manner as interest is paid
on the Securities under the Indenture.

 



Exhibit A-7

 

 

If the Shelf Registration Statement, if required hereby, has been declared
effective or automatically becomes effective, as the case may be, and thereafter
either ceases to be effective or the Prospectus contained therein ceases to be
usable at any time during the Shelf Effectiveness Period, and such failure to
remain effective or usable exists for more than 30 days (whether or not
consecutive) in any 12-month period, unless such failure to remain effective or
usable relates or is directly attributable to an acquisition or disposition
being undertaken by the Issuers then the Issuers will pay liquidated damages to
the Holders of Registrable Securities with the effect that the interest rate on
the Registrable Securities will be increased by 1.00% per annum commencing on
the 31st day in such 12-month period and ending on such date that the Shelf
Registration Statement has again been declared (or automatically becomes)
effective or the Prospectus again becomes usable.

 

(e)       Without limiting the remedies available to the Initial Purchasers and
the Holders, the Issuers and the Guarantors acknowledge that any failure by the
Issuers or the Guarantors to comply with their obligations under
Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof may result in material irreparable injury
to the Initial Purchasers or the Holders for which there is no adequate remedy
at law, that it will not be possible to measure damages for such injuries
precisely and that, in the event of any such failure, the Initial Purchasers or
any Holder may obtain such relief as may be required to specifically enforce the
Issuers’ and the Guarantors’ obligations under Section 2(a) and
Section 2(b) hereof.  The provisions for liquidated damages set forth in
Section 2(d) above shall be the only monetary remedy available to the Holders
under this Agreement.

 

3.       Registration Procedures.  (a) In connection with their obligations
pursuant to Section 2(a) and Section 2(b) hereof, the Issuers and the Guarantors
shall as expeditiously as possible:

 

(i)prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement on the appropriate

with FINRA, and do any and all other acts and things that may be reasonably
necessary or advisable to enable each Participating Holder to complete the
disposition in each such jurisdiction of the Registrable Securities owned by
such Participating Holder; provided that neither the Issuers nor any Guarantor
shall be required to (1) qualify as a foreign corporation or other entity or as
a dealer in securities in any such jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be

use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file with the SEC a
supplement or post-effective amendment to the Exchange Offer Registration

other required document so that, as thereafter delivered (or, to the extent

effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for the Indenture to be
so qualified in accordance with the terms of the Trust Indenture Act; and
execute, and use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Trustee to
execute, all documents as may be required to effect such changes and all other
forms and documents required to be filed with the SEC to enable the Indenture to
be so qualified in a timely manner;

 



Exhibit A-11

 

 

(xiv)in the case of a Shelf Registration, make available for inspection by a
representative of the Participating Holders (an “Inspector”), any Underwriter
participating in any disposition pursuant to such Shelf Registration Statement,
any attorneys and accountants designated by a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Registrable Securities held by the Participating Holders and any
attorneys and accountants designated by such Underwriter, at reasonable times
and in a reasonable manner, all pertinent financial and other records, documents
and properties of the Partnership and its subsidiaries, and cause the respective
officers, directors and employees of the Issuers and the Guarantors to supply
all information reasonably requested by any such Inspector, Underwriter,
attorney or accountant in connection with a Shelf Registration Statement;
provided that if any such information is identified by any Issuer or any
Guarantor as being confidential or proprietary, each Person receiving such
information shall take such actions as are reasonably necessary to protect the
confidentiality of such information to the extent such action is otherwise not
inconsistent with, an impairment of or in derogation of the rights and interests
of any Inspector, Participating Holder or Underwriter;

 

(xv)if reasonably requested by any Participating Holder, promptly include in a
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information with respect
to such Participating Holder as such Participating Holder reasonably requests to
be included therein and make all required filings of such prospectus supplement
or such post-effective amendment as soon as the Issuers have received
notification of the matters to be so included in such filing;

 



Exhibit A-12

 

 

(xvi)in the case of a Shelf Registration, enter into such customary agreements
and take all such other commercially reasonable actions in connection therewith
(including those requested by the Participating Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Registrable Securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement) in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities including, but not limited to, an Underwritten Offering
and in such connection, (1) to the extent possible, make such representations
and warranties to the Participating Holders and any Underwriters of such
Registrable Securities with respect to the business of the Partnership and its
subsidiaries and the Registration Statement, Prospectus, any Free Writing
Prospectus and documents incorporated by reference or deemed incorporated by
reference, if any, in each case, in form, substance and scope as are customarily
made by issuers to underwriters in underwritten offerings and confirm the same
if and when requested, (2) obtain opinions of counsel to the Issuers and the
Guarantors (which counsel and opinions, in form, scope and substance, shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Participating Holders and such Underwriters and
their respective counsel) addressed to each Participating Holder and Underwriter
of Registrable Securities, covering the matters customarily covered in opinions
requested in underwritten offerings, (3) obtain “comfort” letters from the
independent certified public accountants of the Issuers and the Guarantors (and,
if necessary, any other certified public accountant of any subsidiary of the
Partnership, or of any business acquired by any Issuer or any Guarantor for
which financial statements and financial data are or are required to be included
in the Registration Statement) addressed to each Participating Holder (to the
extent permitted by applicable professional standards) and Underwriter of
Registrable Securities, such letters to be in customary form and covering
matters of the type customarily covered in “comfort” letters in connection with
underwritten offerings, including but not limited to financial information
contained in any preliminary prospectus, Prospectus or Free Writing Prospectus,
and (4) deliver such documents and certificates as may be reasonably requested
by the Participating Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Registrable Securities being sold or the Underwriters, and which are customarily
delivered in underwritten offerings, to evidence the continued validity of the
representations and warranties of the Issuers and the Guarantors made pursuant
to clause (1) above and to evidence compliance with any customary conditions
contained in an underwriting agreement; and

 

(xvii)so long as any Registrable Securities remain outstanding, cause each
Additional Guarantor upon the creation or acquisition by the Partnership of such
Additional Guarantor, to execute a counterpart to this Agreement in the form
attached hereto as Annex A and to deliver such counterpart, together with an
opinion of counsel as to the enforceability thereof against such entity, to the
Initial Purchasers no later than five Business Days following the execution
thereof.

 

(b)       In the case of a Shelf Registration Statement, the Issuers may require
each Holder of Registrable Securities to furnish to the Issuers a Notice and
Questionnaire and such other information regarding such Holder and the proposed
disposition by such Holder of such Registrable Securities as the Issuers and the
Guarantors may from time to time reasonably request in writing.

 

(c)       Each Participating Holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from
the Issuers and the Guarantors of the happening of any event of the kind
described in Section 3(a)(vi)(3) or Section 3(a)(vi)(5) hereof, such
Participating Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement until such Participating
Holder’s receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus and any
Free Writing Prospectus contemplated by Section 3(a)(x) hereof and, if so
directed by the Issuers and the Guarantors, such Participating Holder will
deliver to the Issuers and the Guarantors all copies in its possession, other
than permanent file copies then in such Participating Holder’s possession, of
the Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus covering such Registrable
Securities that is current at the time of receipt of such notice.

 

(d)       If the Issuers and the Guarantors shall give any notice to suspend the
disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement, the
Issuers and the Guarantors shall extend the period during which such
Registration Statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this Agreement
by the number of days during the period from and including the date of the
giving of such notice to and including the date when the Holders of such
Registrable Securities shall have received copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus or any Free Writing Prospectus necessary to resume such dispositions.
The Issuers and the Guarantors may give any such notice only twice during any
365-day period and any such suspensions shall not exceed 30 days for each
suspension and there shall not be more than two suspensions in effect during any
365-day period.

 



Exhibit A-13

 

 

(e)       The Participating Holders who desire to do so may sell such
Registrable Securities in an Underwritten Offering.  In any such Underwritten
Offering, the investment bank or investment banks and manager or managers (each
an “Underwriter”) that will administer the offering will be selected by the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Registrable Securities included
in such offering; provided, however, that such Underwriter must be reasonably
satisfactory to the Partnership.

 

4.       Participation of Broker-Dealers in Exchange Offer.  (a)  The Staff has
taken the position that any broker-dealer that receives Exchange Securities for
its own account in the Exchange Offer in exchange for Securities that were
acquired by such broker-dealer as a result of market-making or other trading
activities (a “Participating Broker-Dealer”) may be deemed to be an
“underwriter” within the meaning of the Securities Act and must deliver a
prospectus meeting the requirements of the Securities Act in connection with any
resale of such Exchange Securities.

 

The Issuers and the Guarantors understand that it is the Staff’s position that
if the Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement
includes a plan of distribution containing a statement to the above effect and
the means by which Participating Broker-Dealers may resell the Exchange
Securities, without naming the Participating Broker-Dealers or specifying the
amount of Exchange Securities owned by them, such Prospectus may be delivered by
Participating Broker-Dealers (or, to the extent permitted by law, made available
to purchasers) to satisfy their prospectus delivery obligation under the
Securities Act in connection with resales of Exchange Securities for their own
accounts, so long as the Prospectus otherwise meets the requirements of the
Securities Act.

 

(b)       In light of the above, and notwithstanding the other provisions of
this Agreement, the Issuers and the Guarantors agree to amend or supplement the
Prospectus contained in the Exchange Offer Registration Statement for a period
of up to 180 days after the last Exchange Date (as such period may be extended
pursuant to Section 3(d) of this Agreement), in order to expedite or facilitate
the disposition of any Exchange Securities by Participating Broker-Dealers
consistent with the positions of the Staff recited in Section 4(a) above.  The
Issuers and the Guarantors further agree that Participating Broker-Dealers shall
be authorized to deliver such Prospectus (or, to the extent permitted by law,
make available) during such period in connection with the resales contemplated
by this Section 4.

 

(c)       The Initial Purchasers shall have no liability to the Issuers, any
Guarantor or any Holder with respect to any request that they may make pursuant
to Section 4(b) above.

 



Exhibit A-14

 

 

5.       Indemnification and Contribution.  (a) The Issuers and the Guarantors,
jointly and severally, agree to indemnify and hold harmless each Initial
Purchaser and each Holder, their respective affiliates, directors and officers
and each Person, if any, who controls any Initial Purchaser or any Holder within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange
Act, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities
(including, without limitation, legal fees and other expenses incurred in
connection with any suit, action or proceeding or any claim asserted, as such
fees and expenses are incurred), joint or several, that arise out of, or are
based upon, (1) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in any Registration Statement or any omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein not misleading, or (2) any untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus, any
Free Writing Prospectus or any “issuer information” (“Issuer Information”) filed
or required to be filed pursuant to Rule 433(d) under the Securities Act, or any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, in each case except insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance
upon and in conformity with any information relating to any Initial Purchaser or
information relating to any Holder furnished to the Issuers in writing through
Merrill or any selling Holder expressly for use therein.  In connection with any
Underwritten Offering permitted by Section 3, the Issuers and the Guarantors,
jointly and severally, will also indemnify the Underwriters, if any, selling
brokers, dealers and similar securities industry professionals participating in
the distribution, their respective affiliates and each Person who controls such
Persons (within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act) to the
same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the
Holders, if requested in connection with any Registration Statement, any
Prospectus, any Free Writing Prospectus or any Issuer Information.

 

(b)       Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and hold
harmless the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Initial Purchasers and the other
selling Holders, the directors of the Issuers and the Guarantors, each officer
of the Issuers and the Guarantors who signed the Registration Statement and each
Person, if any, who controls the Issuers, the Guarantors, any Initial Purchaser
and any other selling Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent as the indemnity set
forth in paragraph (a) above, but only with respect to any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities that arise out of, or are based upon, any untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance
upon and in conformity with any information relating to such Holder furnished to
the Issuers in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any Registration
Statement, any Prospectus and any Free Writing Prospectus.

 



Exhibit A-15

 

 

(c)       If any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental or
regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against
any Person in respect of which indemnification may be sought pursuant to either
paragraph (a) or (b) above, such Person (the “Indemnified Person”) shall
promptly notify the Person against whom such indemnification may be sought (the
“Indemnifying Person”) in writing; provided that the failure to notify the
Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have
under paragraph (a) or (b) above except to the extent that it has been
materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses)
by such failure; and provided, further, that the failure to notify the
Indemnifying Person shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to
an Indemnified Person otherwise than under paragraph (a) or (b) above.  If any
such proceeding shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified Person and
it shall have notified the Indemnifying Person thereof, the Indemnifying Person
shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person to
represent the Indemnified Person and any others entitled to indemnification
pursuant to this Section 5 that the Indemnifying Person may designate in such
proceeding and shall pay the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such
proceeding, as incurred.  In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall
have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Person unless (i) the
Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person shall have mutually agreed to the
contrary; (ii) the Indemnifying Person has failed within a reasonable time to
retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person; (iii) the
Indemnified Person shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it that are different from or in addition to those
available to the Indemnifying Person; or (iv) the named parties in any such
proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnifying
Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both parties by the same
counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests
between them.  It is understood and agreed that the Indemnifying Person shall
not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceeding in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm
(in addition to any local counsel) for all Indemnified Persons, and that all
such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred.  Any such
separate firm (x) for any Initial Purchaser, its affiliates, directors and
officers and any control Persons of such Initial Purchaser shall be designated
in writing by Merrill, (y) for any Holder, its directors and officers and any
control Persons of such Holder shall be designated in writing by the Majority
Holders and (z) in all other cases shall be designated in writing by the
Issuers.  The Indemnifying Person shall not be liable for any settlement of any
proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such
consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying
Person agrees to indemnify each Indemnified Person from and against any loss or
liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, if at any time an Indemnified Person shall have requested
that an Indemnifying Person reimburse the Indemnified Person for fees and
expenses of counsel as contemplated by this paragraph, the Indemnifying Person
shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its
written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after
receipt by the Indemnifying Person of such request and (ii) the Indemnifying
Person shall not have reimbursed the Indemnified Person in accordance with such
request prior to the date of such settlement.  No Indemnifying Person shall,
without the written consent of the Indemnified Person, effect any settlement of
any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Person
is or could have been a party and indemnification could have been sought
hereunder by such Indemnified Person, unless such settlement (A) includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Person, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person, from all liability on claims
that are the subject matter of such proceeding and (B) does not include any
statement as to or any admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or
on behalf of any Indemnified Person.

 

(d)       If the indemnification provided for in paragraphs (a) and (b) above is
unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient in respect of any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities referred to therein, then each Indemnifying
Person under such paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person
thereunder, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified
Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (i) in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
Issuers and the Guarantors from the offering of the Securities and the Exchange
Securities, on the one hand, and by the Holders from receiving Securities or
Exchange Securities registered under the Securities Act, on the other hand, or
(ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable
law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative
benefits referred to in clause (i) but also the relative fault of the Issuers
and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection
with the statements or omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages
or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The
relative fault of the Issuers and the Guarantors on the one hand and the Holders
on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether
the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
Issuers and the Guarantors or by the Holders and the parties’ relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission.

 



Exhibit A-16

 

 

(e)       The Issuers, the Guarantors and the Holders agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5 were determined by
pro rata allocation (even if the Holders were treated as one entity for such
purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d) above.  The amount paid or
payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims, damages and
liabilities referred to in paragraph (d) above shall be deemed to include,
subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses incurred
by such Indemnified Person in connection with any such action or claim. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5, in no event shall a Holder be
required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
price at which the Securities or Exchange Securities sold by such Holder exceeds
the amount of any damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by
reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission.  No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from
any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The
Holders’ obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 5 are several and
not joint.

 

(f)       The remedies provided for in this Section 5 are not exclusive and
shall not limit any rights or remedies that may otherwise be available to any
Indemnified Person at law or in equity.

 

(g)       The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section 5
shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any
termination of this Agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of
the Initial Purchasers or any Holder or any Person controlling any Initial
Purchaser or any Holder, or by or on behalf of the Issuers or the Guarantors or
the officers or directors of or any Person controlling the Issuers or the
Guarantors, (iii) acceptance of any of the Exchange Securities and (iv) any sale
of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement.

 

6.       General.

 

(a)       No Inconsistent Agreements.  The Issuers and the Guarantors represent,
warrant and agree that (i) the rights granted to the Holders hereunder do not in
any way conflict with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the
holders of any other outstanding securities issued or guaranteed by any Issuer
or any Guarantor under any other agreement and (ii) neither the Issuers nor any
Guarantor has entered into, or on or after the date of this Agreement will enter
into, any agreement that is inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders
of Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the
provisions hereof.

 



Exhibit A-17

 

 

(b)       Amendments and Waivers.  The provisions of this Agreement, including
the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended, modified or supplemented,
and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof may not be
given unless the Issuers and the Guarantors have obtained the written consent of
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Registrable Securities affected by such amendment, modification, supplement,
waiver or consent; provided that no amendment, modification, supplement, waiver
or consent to any departure from the provisions of Section 5 hereof or any
provision that could affect adversely the rights of any Holder of Registrable
Securities to receive liquidated damages in the amount and on the payment dates
as provided in Section 2(d) shall be effective as against any Holder of
Registrable Securities unless consented to in writing by such Holder.  Any
amendments, modifications, supplements, waivers or consents pursuant to this
Section 6(b) shall be by a writing executed by each of the parties hereto.

 

(c)       Notices.  All notices and other communications provided for or
permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery, registered
first-class mail, telecopier, or any courier guaranteeing overnight delivery
(i) if to a Holder, at the most current address given by such Holder to the
Partnership by means of a notice given in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 6(c), which address initially is, with respect to the Initial
Purchasers, the address set forth in the Purchase Agreement; (ii) if to the
Issuers and the Guarantors, initially at the Partnership’s address set forth in
the Purchase Agreement and thereafter at such other address, notice of which is
given in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(c); and (iii) to such
other persons at their respective addresses as provided in the Purchase
Agreement and thereafter at such other address, notice of which is given in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(c).  All such notices and
communications shall be deemed to have been duly given: at the time delivered by
hand, if personally delivered; five Business Days after being deposited in the
mail, postage prepaid, if mailed; when receipt is acknowledged, if telecopied;
and on the next Business Day if timely delivered to an air courier guaranteeing
overnight delivery.  Copies of all such notices, demands or other communications
shall be concurrently delivered by the Person giving the same to the Trustee, at
the address specified in the Indenture.

 

(d)       Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the successors, assigns and transferees of each of the
parties, including, without limitation and without the need for an express
assignment, subsequent Holders; provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to
permit any assignment, transfer or other disposition of Registrable Securities
in violation of the terms of the Purchase Agreement or the Indenture.  If any
transferee of any Holder shall acquire Registrable Securities in any manner,
whether by operation of law or otherwise, such Registrable Securities shall be
held subject to all the terms of this Agreement, and by taking and holding such
Registrable Securities such Person shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed
to be bound by and to perform all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
and such Person shall be entitled to receive the benefits hereof.  The Initial
Purchasers (in their capacity as Initial Purchasers) shall have no liability or
obligation to the Issuers or the Guarantors with respect to any failure by a
Holder to comply with, or any breach by any Holder of, any of the obligations of
such Holder under this Agreement.

 

(e)       Third Party Beneficiaries.  Each Holder shall be a third party
beneficiary to the agreements made hereunder between the Issuers and the
Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and
shall have the right to enforce such agreements directly to the extent it deems
such enforcement necessary or advisable to protect its rights or the rights of
other Holders hereunder.

 



Exhibit A-18

 

 

(f)       Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

(g)       Headings.  The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only, are not a part of this Agreement and shall not limit or
otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

 

(h)       Governing Law.  This Agreement, and any claim, controversy or dispute
arising under or related to this Agreement, shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

 

(i)       Entire Agreement; Severability.  This Agreement contains the entire
agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all oral statements and prior writings with respect thereto.  If any
term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this Agreement is held by
a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable or
against public policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and
restrictions contained herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in
no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.  The Issuers, the Guarantors and
the Initial Purchasers shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the
invalid, void or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic
effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, void or
unenforceable provisions.
