plural forms of the defined terms.

Any accounting terms used in this Agreement which are not specifically defined
herein shall have the meanings customarily given them in accordance with
Agreement Accounting Principles.

establishment, maintenance or acquisition of any Subsidiary, except as may
otherwise be permitted hereunder.

Section 1.03 Exchange Rates, Basket Calculations, Eurocurrency Rate and

will be converted into Dollars based on the relevant Exchange Rate(s) in effect

time of such adoption, provided that if and to the extent that such legislation
or member state provides that any such obligation may be paid by debtors in

to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such
borrowing, at the end of the then-current Interest Period.

the European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to
the Euro.

changes of construction as the Administrative Agent may from time to time
specify to be reasonably necessary to reflect a change in currency of any other
country and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the change

(a) Commitment Fee. WBA agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the

Date; provided that no Commitment Fee shall accrue hereunder with respect to the

the Revolving Facility. All fees in respect of the Commitments (including any
Commitment Fees) accrued until the effective date of any termination of such
Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such termination. For the
avoidance of doubt, WBA shall not be permitted to terminate in whole or reduce
in part the Commitments to the extent that, after giving effect to such

Rate Loans shall continue as Alternate Base Rate Loans unless and until such
Alternate Base Rate Loans are converted into Eurocurrency Loans pursuant to this
Section 2.09 or are prepaid or repaid in accordance with Section 2.07. Each
Eurocurrency Loan shall continue as a Eurocurrency Loan until the end of the
then applicable Interest Period therefor, at which time such Eurocurrency Loan
shall be automatically converted into an Alternate Base Rate Loan (provided,
that in the case of a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, such
Eurocurrency Loan shall be continued as a Eurocurrency Loan in its original
currency with an Interest Period of one month), unless (x) such Eurocurrency
Loan is or was repaid in accordance with Section 2.07 or (y) the applicable
Borrower shall have given the Administrative Agent a Conversion/Continuation
Notice (as defined below) requesting that, at the end of such Interest Period,
such Eurocurrency Loan continue as a Eurocurrency Loan for the same or another
Interest Period. The applicable Borrower may elect from time to time to convert
all or any part of an Alternate Base Rate Loan into a Eurocurrency Loan. No Loan
may be converted into or continued as a Loan denominated in a different
currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan and
reborrowed in the other currency. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 2.09 (except with the consent of the Required Lenders)
when any Default has occurred and is continuing each Eurocurrency Loan shall be
continued as a Loan in its original currency with an Interest Period not longer
than one month. The applicable Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent
notice substantially in the form of Exhibit E or such other form as may be
approved by the Administrative Agent (including any form on an electronic
platform or electronic transmission system as shall be approved by the
Administrative Agent), in each case appropriately completed and signed by an
Authorized Officer of the applicable Borrower (a “Conversion/Continuation
Notice”) of each conversion of an Alternate Base Rate Loan into a Eurocurrency
Loan or a continuation of a Eurocurrency Loan, with each such
Conversion/Continuation Notice to be received not later (I) (a) in the event
that HSBC Bank plc is the sole Lender under the Revolving Facility on the date
of delivery of the applicable Conversion/Continuation Notice, 11:00 a.m. (in the
case of a Conversion/Continuation Notice delivered by WBA, New York time, and in
the case of a notice delivered by the Designated Borrower, London time) at least
two (2) Business Days, in the case of any Loans denominated in Dollars, prior to
the date of the requested conversion or continuation and (b) in the event that
more than one Person is a Lender under the Revolving Facility on the date of
delivery of the applicable Conversion/Continuation Notice, with the consent of
the Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) 11:00 a.m. (in the case of a Conversion/Continuation Notice delivered
by WBA, New York time, and in the case of a notice delivered by the Designated
Borrower, London time) at least two (2) Business Days, in the case of any Loans
denominated in Dollars, prior to the date of the requested conversion or
continuation, but in no event shall such notice period be longer than three
(3) Business Days and (II) 11:00 a.m. (in the case of a Conversion/Continuation
Notice delivered by WBA, New York time, and in the case of a notice delivered by
the Designated Borrower, London time) at least four (4) Business Days, in the
case of any Eurocurrency Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, prior to the
date of the requested conversion or continuation, in each case, specifying:

(a) the requested date, which shall be a Business Day, of such conversion or
continuation,

(b) the aggregate amount and Type of the Loan which is to be converted or
continued as a Eurocurrency Loan, and

 

30



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c) the duration of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

Section 2.10 Interest Rates. Each Alternate Base Rate Loan shall bear interest
on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each day from and including the
date such Loan is made or is converted from a Eurocurrency Loan into an
Alternate Base Rate Loan pursuant to Section 2.09 hereof, to but excluding the
date it is paid or is converted into a Eurocurrency Loan pursuant to
Section 2.09 hereof, at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus
the Applicable Margin for such day. Changes in the rate of interest on that
portion of any Loan maintained as an Alternate Base Rate Loan will take effect
simultaneously with each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Each Eurocurrency
Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof, for each
day from and including the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto
to (but not including) the last day of such Interest Period at the Eurocurrency
Rate (with the Eurocurrency Base Rate determined pursuant to clause (a) of the
definition thereof) for the applicable period plus the Applicable Margin. No
Interest Period may end after the Maturity Date.

Section 2.11 Rates Applicable After Default. During the continuance of a Default
under Section 7.02 the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to WBA
and the Designated Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the
Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.02 requiring
unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates, and which
election and notice shall not be required after a Default or Unmatured Default
under Section 7.05 or 7.06), declare that interest on the overdue amount of the
Loans shall be payable at a rate (after as well as before the commencement of
any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws) equal to 2% per annum in excess of
the rate otherwise payable thereon (and, with respect to any other overdue
amounts, shall bear interest at a rate equal to the Alternate Base Rate plus the
Applicable Margin applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans plus 2% per annum)
commencing on the date of such Default and continuing until such Default is
cured or waived.

Section 2.12 Method of Payment. Except as otherwise specified herein, all
payments by each Borrower of principal, interest and its other Obligations shall
be made, (i) with respect to Loans denominated in Dollars and the Aggregate
Commitment, in Dollars, and (ii) with respect to Loans denominated in any
Foreign Currency, in the applicable Foreign Currency in which such Loans are
denominated. All payments of the Obligations hereunder shall be made, without
setoff, deduction, or counterclaim, in immediately available funds to the
Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent’s address specified pursuant to
Article XIII, or at any other Lending Installation of the Administrative Agent
specified in writing by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Borrower, by
2:00 p.m. (in the case of a notice delivered to WBA, New York time, and in the
case of a notice delivered to the Designated Borrower, London time), in the case
of any payments made in Dollars, and not later than the Applicable Time, in the
case of any payments made in a Foreign Currency, in each case, on the date when
due and shall be applied ratably by the Administrative Agent among the Lenders
entitled thereto. Each payment delivered to the Administrative Agent for the
account of any Lender shall be delivered promptly by the Administrative Agent to
such Lender in the same type of funds that the Administrative Agent received at
such Lender’s address specified pursuant to Article XIII or at any Lending
Installation specified in a notice received by the Administrative Agent from
such Lender.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 2.13 Noteless Agreement; Evidence of Indebtedness. (a) Each Lender shall
maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing
the indebtedness of each Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made
by such Lender to such Borrower from time to time, including the amounts of
principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time
hereunder.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will
record (A) the date and the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Type thereof
and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (B) the amount of any principal or
interest due and payable or to become due and payable from each Borrower to each
Lender hereunder, (C) the effective date and amount of each Assignment and
Assumption delivered to and accepted by it and the parties thereto pursuant to
Section 12.01, (D) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent
hereunder from each applicable Borrower and each Lender’s share thereof, and
(E) all other appropriate debits and credits as provided in this Agreement,
including, without limitation, all fees, charges, expenses and interest. In the
event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by the
Administrative Agent and the accounts and records of any Lender in respect of
such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control
absent manifest error.

(c) The entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to clauses
(a) and (b) above shall be prima facie evidence of the existence and amounts of
the Obligations therein recorded; provided, however, that the failure of the
Administrative Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error
therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of each Borrower to repay
its Obligations in accordance with their terms.

(d) Any Lender may request that the Loans made or to be made by it be evidenced
by a promissory note in substantially the form of Exhibit C (each, a “Note”). In
such event, each applicable Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such
Lender such Note or Notes payable to such Lender (or its registered assigns).
Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by each such Note and interest thereon shall at
all times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 12.01) be
represented by one or more Notes payable to the payee named therein or any
assignee pursuant to Section 12.01, except to the extent that any such Lender or
assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that
such Loans once again be evidenced as described in clauses (a) and (b) above.

Section 2.14 Interest Payment Dates; Interest and Fee Basis. Interest accrued on
each Alternate Base Rate Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Payment Date,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the Borrowing Date with
respect to such Alternate Base Rate Loan and on any date on which the Alternate
Base Rate Loan is prepaid, whether due to acceleration or otherwise, and on the
Facility Termination Date. Interest accrued on each Eurocurrency Loan shall be
payable on the last day of its applicable Interest Period and on any date on
which such Eurocurrency Loan is prepaid, whether by acceleration or otherwise,
and on the Facility Termination Date. Interest accrued on each Eurocurrency Loan
having an Interest

 

32



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Period longer than three (3) months shall also be payable on the last day of
each three-month interval during such Interest Period. Interest accrued pursuant
to Section 2.11 shall be payable on demand. With respect to (a) interest on all
Loans (other than Alternate Base Rate Loans where the interest is based on the
Alternate Base Rate), Commitment Fees and other fees hereunder, such interest or
fees shall be calculated for actual days elapsed on the basis of a 360-day year
and (b) interest on Loans which are Alternate Base Rate Loans where the interest
is based on the Alternate Base Rate, such interest shall be calculated for
actual days elapsed on the basis of a 365/366-day year. Interest shall be
payable for the day a Loan is made but not for the day of any payment on the
amount paid if payment is received prior to 2:00 p.m. (in the case of a payment
received from WBA, New York time, and in the case of a payment received from the
Designated Borrower, London time), in the case of a Loan denominated in Dollars
or (y) the Applicable Time, in the case of a Loan denominated in a Foreign
Currency, in each case, at the place of payment. If any payment of principal of
or interest on a Loan, any fees or any other amounts payable to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder shall become due on a day which is
not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business
Day and, in the case of a principal payment, such extension of time shall be
included in computing interest, fees and commissions in connection with such
payment.

Section 2.15 Notification of Loans, Interest Rates, Prepayments and Commitment
Reductions; Availability of Loans. Promptly after receipt thereof, the
Administrative Agent will notify each Lender of the contents of each Commitment
reduction notice, Borrowing Notice, Conversion/Continuation Notice and
prepayment notice received by it hereunder. The Administrative Agent will notify
each Lender of the interest rate applicable to each Loan promptly upon
determination of such interest rate and will give each Lender and each Borrower
prompt notice of each change in the Alternate Base Rate. Not later than 1:00
p.m. (New York time), in the case of any Loan denominated in Dollars, and not
later than the Applicable Time, in the case of any Loan denominated in a Foreign
Currency, in each case, on each Borrowing Date, each Lender shall make available
its Loan or Loans in funds immediately available to the Administrative Agent’s
Office for the applicable currency. The Administrative Agent will make the funds
so received from the Lenders available to the applicable Borrower at the
Administrative Agent’s aforesaid address.

Section 2.16 Lending Installations. Each Lender may book its Loans at any
Lending Installation selected by such Lender and may change its Lending
Installation from time to time. All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any
such Lending Installation and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder shall be
deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Lending Installation.
Each Lender may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent and WBA in
accordance with Article XIII, designate replacement or additional Lending
Installations through which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan
payments are to be made.

Section 2.17 Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback. (a) (i)
Funding by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
proposed date of any Borrowing of Eurocurrency Loans (or, in the case of any
Alternate Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon (New York time) on the date of
the proposed Borrowing of such Loans) that such Lender will not make available
to

 

33



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Loan, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in
accordance with Section 2.15 and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a
Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Loan available to the
Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower
severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such
corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from
and including the date such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower
to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the
case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the Overnight Rate and (B) in the
case of a payment to be made by the applicable Borrower, the interest rate
applicable to Alternate Base Rate Loans. If the applicable Borrower and such
Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an
overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the
applicable Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the applicable Borrower
for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Loan to the
Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s
Loan included in such Loan. Any payment by the applicable Borrower shall be
without prejudice to any claim the applicable Borrower may have against a Lender
that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.

(ii) Payments by Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the applicable Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for
the account of the Lenders hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make
such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the applicable Borrower
has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance
upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event,
if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the
Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on
demand the amount so distributed to such Lender in Same Day Funds with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the
Overnight Rate.

A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the applicable Borrower
with respect to any amount owing under this subsection (a) shall be conclusive,
absent manifest error.

(b) Obligations of Lenders Several. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to
make Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 9.06(c) are several and not
joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under
Section 9.06(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other
Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender
shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or
to make its payment under Section 9.06(c).

 

34



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 2.18 Replacement of Lender. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.01 or 3.02, or if any Lender gives notice to the Borrowers pursuant to
Section 3.03, or if any Borrower is required to pay any additional amount to any
Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.05, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or if a Lender fails to
consent to an amendment or waiver approved by the Required Lenders as to any
matter for which such Lender’s consent is needed then WBA may, at its sole
expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent,
require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with
and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,
Section 12.01), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such
obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such
assignment), provided that:

(a) WBA shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee specified
in Section 12.01(b)(iv);

(b) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the
outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and
all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
(including any amounts under Section 3.04) from the assignee (to the extent of
such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or WBA (in the case of
all other amounts);

(c) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation
under Section 3.01 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 3.05,
such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments
thereafter;

(d) such assignment does not conflict with applicable laws; and

(e) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a failure to consent to an
amendment or waiver approved by the Required Lenders, such assignee shall have
consented to the relevant amendment or waiver.

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if,
prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the
circumstances entitling WBA to require such assignment and delegation cease to
apply.

Section 2.19 Sharing of Payments by Lenders. Except as otherwise specified in
this Agreement, if any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such Lender’s receiving
payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans and accrued
interest thereon greater than its Pro Rata Share of the Revolving Facility to
which it is entitled pursuant hereto, then the Lender receiving such greater
proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and
(b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other
Lenders or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the
benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that:

(i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the
payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded
and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without
interest; and

 

35



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(ii) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any
payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express
terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the
existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as
consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its
Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to WBA or any Subsidiary
thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).

Each Borrower for itself and solely with respect to its Obligations consents to
the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the
foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Borrower rights of setoff and
counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were
a direct creditor of such Borrower in the amount of such participation.

Section 2.20 Defaulting Lenders. (a) Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting
Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender,
to the extent permitted by applicable law:

(i) Waivers and Amendments. That Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or
disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall
be restricted as set forth in Section 8.02 and the definition of Required
Lender.

(ii) Reallocation of Payments. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other
amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting
Lender under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (whether voluntary or
mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 8.01 or otherwise, and including any
amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by that Defaulting Lender
pursuant to Section 11.01), shall be applied at such time or times as may be
determined by the Administrative Agent as follows: first, to the payment of any
amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;
second, as WBA may request (so long as no Default or Unmatured Default exists),
to the funding of any Loan in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has failed
to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the
Administrative Agent; third, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and
WBA, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit account (other than any
interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be
made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent (provided
that such cash collateral shall be invested solely in investments that provide
for preservation of capital)) and released in order to satisfy obligations of
that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement; fourth, to the
payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender

 

36



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of
its obligations under this Agreement; fifth, so long as no Default or Unmatured
Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the applicable Borrower
as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by
such Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting
Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and sixth, to that
Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;
provided that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any
Loans in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its
appropriate share and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set
forth in Section 4.02 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied
first to pay the Loans of all non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior
to being applied as set forth above in this sub-clause (ii). Any payments,
prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are
applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this
Section 2.20(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting
Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

(iii) Certain Fees. The Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any
Commitment Fee pursuant to Section 2.05(a) for any period during which that
Lender is a Defaulting Lender.

(b) Defaulting Lender Cure. If the applicable Borrower and the Administrative
Agent agree in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should
no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so
notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such
notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the
extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other
Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to
be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in
accordance with their Pro Rata Shares of the Revolving Facility, whereupon that
Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender; provided that no adjustments will
be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on
behalf of the applicable Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and
provided further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the
affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will
constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from
that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.

ARTICLE III

YIELD PROTECTION; TAXES

Section 3.01 Yield Protection. If, after the date of this Agreement, any Change
in Law:

(a) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit,
compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of,
deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by,
any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Eurocurrency Rate);

 

37



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b) subjects any Lender to any Tax of any kind whatsoever (except for
(i) Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes covered by Section 3.05 and (ii) Excluded
Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other
obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital
attributable thereto; or

(c) imposes on any Lender or the London interbank market any other condition,
cost or expense affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender;

and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such
Lender of making, continuing, converting to or maintaining any Eurocurrency
Loans or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Eurocurrency Loan, or to
reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder
(whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such
Lender, WBA shall pay, or shall cause the Designated Borrower to pay, to such
Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such
additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no Lender shall be entitled to seek compensation under this Section 3.01 based
on the occurrence of a Change in Law arising solely from (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or
directives promulgated thereunder or issued in connection therewith or (y) all
requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for
International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any
successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in
each case pursuant to Basel III, unless such Lender is generally seeking
compensation from other borrowers that are similarly situated to and of similar
creditworthiness with respect to its similarly affected commitments, loans
and/or participations under agreements with such borrowers having provisions
similar to this Section 3.01.

Section 3.02 Changes in Capital Adequacy Regulations; Certificates for
Reimbursement; Delay in Requests. (a) Changes in Capital Adequacy. If any Lender
determines that any Change in Law after the date of this Agreement affecting
such Lender or any Lending Installation of such Lender or such Lender’s holding
company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have
the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the
capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this
Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a
level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s
policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to
capital adequacy), then from time to time WBA will pay to such Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s
holding company for any such reduction suffered. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
no Lender shall be entitled to seek compensation under this Section 3.02 based
on the occurrence of a Change in Law arising solely from (x) the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or
directives promulgated thereunder or issued in connection therewith or (y) all
requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for
International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any
successor or similar authority) or the United States regulatory authorities, in
each case pursuant to Basel III, unless such Lender is generally seeking
compensation from other borrowers that are similarly situated to and of similar
creditworthiness with respect to its similarly affected commitments, loans
and/or participations under agreements with such borrowers having provisions
similar to this Section 3.02.

 

38



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b) Certificates for Reimbursement. A certificate of a Lender setting forth the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as
the case may be, as specified in Section 3.01 or subsection (a) of this Section
and delivered to WBA shall be conclusive absent manifest error. WBA shall pay,
or shall cause the Designated Borrower to pay, to such Lender the amount shown
as due on any such certificate within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof.

(c) Delay in Requests. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand
compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section or
Section 3.01 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such
compensation, provided that WBA shall not be required to compensate a Lender
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section or Section 3.01 for any
increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to
the date that such Lender notifies WBA of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim
compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period
referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect
thereof).

(d) Additional Reserve Requirements. WBA shall pay (or cause the Designated
Borrower to pay) to each Lender, as long as such Lender shall be required to
comply with any reserve ratio requirement or analogous requirement of any
central banking or financial regulatory authority imposed in respect of the
maintenance of the Commitments or the funding of the Eurocurrency Loans
denominated in a Foreign Currency, such additional costs (expressed as a
percentage per annum and rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest five
decimal places) equal to the actual costs allocated to such Commitment or Loan
by such Lender (as determined by such Lender in good faith, which determination
shall be conclusive), which shall be due and payable on each date on which
interest is payable on such Loan, provided WBA shall have received at least 30
days’ prior notice (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of such additional
costs from such Lender. Such Lender shall deliver a certificate to WBA setting
forth in reasonable detail a calculation of such actual costs incurred by such
Lender and shall certify that it is generally charging such costs to similarly
situated customers of similar creditworthiness of the applicable Lender under
agreements having provisions similar to this Section 3.02(d) after consideration
of such factors as such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant (which
determination shall be made in good faith). If a Lender fails to give notice 30
days prior to the relevant Payment Date, such additional costs shall be due and
payable 30 days from receipt of such notice. For the avoidance of doubt, any
amounts paid under this Section 3.02(d) shall be without duplication of
eurocurrency adjustments in the definition of “Eurocurrency Rate”.

Section 3.03 Illegality. If any Lender determines that any law has made it
unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful,
for any Lender or its applicable Lending Installation to make, maintain or fund
Eurocurrency Loans, or to determine or charge interest rates based upon the
Eurocurrency Base Rate, or any Governmental Authority

 

39



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or
sell, or to take deposits of, Dollars or any Foreign Currency in the London
interbank market, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to WBA through the
Administrative Agent, any obligation of such Lender to make or continue
Eurocurrency Loans or to convert Alternate Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Loans
shall be suspended until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and WBA
that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon
receipt of such notice, each applicable Borrower shall, upon demand from such
Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable and
such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all Eurocurrency Loans of such
Lender to Alternate Base Rate Loans, either on the last day of the Interest
Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such
Eurocurrency Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully
continue to maintain such Eurocurrency Loans. Upon any such prepayment or
conversion, the applicable Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the
amount so prepaid or converted.

Section 3.04 Compensation for Losses. Upon demand of any Lender (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent) from time to time, WBA shall, or shall cause the
Designated Borrower to, promptly compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender
harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:

(a) any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than
an Alternate Base Rate Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest
Period for such Loan or other than upon prior notice to the Administrative Agent
(I) (a) in the event that HSBC Bank plc is the sole Lender under the Revolving
Facility on the date of delivery of the applicable notice, at least two
(2) Business Days in advance in the case of any Loans denominated in Dollars and
(b) in the event more than one Person is a Lender under the Revolving Facility
on the date of delivery of the applicable notice, with the consent of the
Administrative Agent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
at least two (2) Business Days in advance in the case of any Loans denominated
in Dollars, but in no event shall such notice period be longer than three
(3) Business Days and (II) at least four (4) Business Days in advance in the
case of any Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency (in each case, whether
voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise, but
excluding any prepayment or conversion required pursuant to Section 3.03);

(b) any failure by the applicable Borrower (for a reason other than the failure
of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan
other than an Alternate Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount or currency
notified by such Borrower; or

(c) any assignment of a Eurocurrency Loan on a day other than the last day of
the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by WBA pursuant to
Section 2.18;

including any foreign exchange losses and loss or expense arising from the
liquidation or reemployment of funds obtained by it to maintain such Loan or
from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained
or from the performance of any foreign exchange contract. WBA shall also pay any
customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the
foregoing.

 

40



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For purposes of calculating amounts payable by WBA to the Lenders under this
Section 3.04, each Lender shall be deemed to have funded each Eurocurrency Loan
made by it at the Eurocurrency Rate for such Loan by a matching deposit or other
borrowing in the London interbank eurodollar market for such currency and for a
comparable amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurocurrency
Loan was in fact so funded.

Section 3.05 Taxes. (a) Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments
on Account of Taxes. (i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation
of the applicable Borrower hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall to
the extent permitted by applicable laws be made free and clear of and without
reduction or withholding for any Taxes. If, however, applicable laws require the
applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent (as determined in the good faith
discretion of the Administrative Agent) to withhold or deduct any Tax, such Tax
shall be withheld or deducted in accordance with such laws as determined by such
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may be, upon the basis of the
information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (f) below.

(ii) If the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent shall be required by
applicable law to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) such
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall withhold or make such
deductions as are determined by such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as
applicable, to be required based upon the information and documentation it, or
the applicable taxing authority, has received pursuant to subsection (f) below
(for the avoidance of doubt, in the case of any such information and
documentation received by an applicable taxing authority, solely to the extent
such Borrower or the Administrative Agent has been provided with a copy of such
information and documentation or otherwise has actual knowledge of such
information and documentation and, in each case, is entitled to rely thereon),
(B) such Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as applicable, shall timely pay
the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with applicable law, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or
deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, the sum
payable by such Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any
required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the
Administrative Agent or any Lender receives an amount equal to the sum it would
have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.

(b) Designated Borrower. A payment by or on behalf of the Designated Borrower,
or under the Parent Guarantee in respect of an obligation of the Designated
Borrower, shall not be increased under paragraph (a) above by reason of a UK Tax
Deduction if, on the date on which the payment falls due:

(i) the payment could have been made to the relevant Lender without a Tax
Deduction if the Lender had been a UK Qualifying Lender, but on that date that
Lender is not or has ceased to be a UK Qualifying Lender other than as a result
of any change after the date it became a Lender under this Agreement in (or in
the interpretation, administration, or application of) any law or UK Treaty or
any published practice or published concession of any relevant taxing authority;
or

 

41



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(ii) the relevant Lender is a UK Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of
paragraph (b) of the definition of “UK Qualifying Lender” and:

(A) an officer of HM Revenue & Customs has given (and not revoked) a direction
(a “Direction”) under section 931 of the UK ITA which relates to the payment and
that Lender has received from the Designated Borrower a certified copy of that
Direction; and

(B) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any UK Tax Deduction
if that Direction had not been made; or

(iii) the relevant Lender is a UK Qualifying Lender solely by virtue of
paragraph (b) of the definition of “UK Qualifying Lender” and:

(A) the relevant Lender has not given a UK Tax Confirmation to the relevant
payor; and

(B) the payment could have been made to the Lender without any UK Tax Deduction
if the Lender had given a UK Tax Confirmation to the relevant payor, on the
basis that the UK Tax Confirmation would have enabled such payor to have formed
a reasonable belief that the payment was an “excepted payment” for the purpose
of section 930 of the UK ITA; or

(iv) the relevant Lender is a UK Treaty Lender and the party making the payment
is able to demonstrate that the payment could have been made to the Lender
without the UK Tax Deduction had that Lender complied with its obligations under
paragraphs 3.05(f)(iv)(A), (B) or (C) (as applicable) below.

(c) Payment of Other Taxes. Without limiting the provisions of subsection
(a) above, WBA shall timely pay, or shall cause the Designated Borrower to pay,
any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with
applicable laws.

(d) Indemnification. (i) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or
(b) above, WBA shall, or shall cause the applicable Borrower to, indemnify the
Administrative Agent and each Lender, and shall make payment in respect thereof
within thirty (30) days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of
any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section)
withheld or deducted by the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent or
paid by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, and any reasonable expenses
arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes
or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. WBA shall also, or shall cause the Designated Borrower
to, indemnify the Administrative Agent and shall

 

42



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

make payment in respect thereof within thirty (30) days after demand therefor,
for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the
Administrative Agent as required by clause (ii)(x)(1) of this subsection. A
certificate as to the amount of any such payment or liability delivered to WBA
by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative
Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent
manifest error. The indemnities in this paragraph (d)(i) shall not apply to any
Indemnified Taxes which would have been compensated for by an increased payment
under paragraph (a) above but were not so compensated because one or more of the
exclusions in paragraph (b) above applied.

(ii) Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) or (b) above, each Lender
shall, and does hereby, indemnify (x) the Borrowers and the Administrative
Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within thirty (30) days after
demand therefor, against any and all Taxes and any and all related losses,
claims, liabilities, penalties, interest and expenses (including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Borrowers or the Administrative
Agent) incurred by or asserted against any Borrower or the Administrative Agent
by any Governmental Authority as a result of (1) the failure by such Lender to
deliver, or as a result of the inaccuracy, inadequacy or deficiency of, any
documentation required to be delivered by such Lender to the Borrowers or the
Administrative Agent pursuant to subsection (f) or (2) the failure of such
Lender to comply with the provisions of Section 12.01(d) relating to the
maintenance of a Participant Register and (y) the Administrative Agent against
any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to
the extent the Borrowers have not already indemnified the Administrative Agent
for such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes and without limiting the obligation of
WBA to do so or cause the Designated Borrower to do so) or Excluded Taxes
attributable to such Lender, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or
with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally
imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. Each Lender hereby
authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at
any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii). The
agreements in this clause (ii) shall survive the resignation and/or replacement
of the Administrative Agent, any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of,
a Lender, the termination of this Agreement or the Aggregate Commitment and the
repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.

(e) Evidence of Payments. Upon request by WBA or the Administrative Agent, as
the case may be, after any payment of Taxes by WBA, the Designated Borrower or
the Administrative Agent to a Governmental Authority as provided in this
Section 3.05, WBA or the Designated Borrower, as applicable, shall deliver to
the Administrative Agent or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to WBA and
the Designated Borrower, as the case may be, the original or a certified copy of
a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy
of any return required by law to report such payment or other evidence of such
payment reasonably satisfactory to WBA, the Designated Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be.

 

43



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(f) Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation. (i) Each Lender shall (other than with
respect to a UK Tax Deduction to which the provisions of Section 3.05(f)(iv)
below shall apply) deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent, at the
time or times prescribed by applicable laws or when reasonably requested by any
Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed
documentation prescribed by applicable laws or by the taxing authorities of any
jurisdiction and such other reasonably requested information (A) to secure any
applicable exemption from, or reduction in the rate of, deduction or withholding
imposed by any jurisdiction in respect of any payments to be made by any
Borrower to such Lender, and (B) as will permit any Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, as the case may be, to determine (1) whether or not
payments made hereunder, the Fee Letter or under any other Loan Document are
subject to Taxes, (2) if applicable, the required rate of withholding or
deduction, and (3) such Lender’s entitlement to any available exemption from, or
reduction of, applicable Taxes in respect of all payments to be made to such
Lender by any Borrower pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to establish such
Lender’s status for withholding tax purposes in the applicable jurisdiction.

(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if the applicable
Borrower (or, if the applicable Borrower is disregarded as an entity separate
from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Person treated as its
owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is a “United States person” within
the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code,

(A) any Lender (or, if such Lender is disregarded as an entity separate from its
owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Person treated as its owner for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is a “United States person” within the
meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall deliver to each Borrower and
the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a
Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request
of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent) executed originals of Internal
Revenue Service Form W-9 or such other documentation or information prescribed
by applicable laws or reasonably requested by any Borrower or the Administrative
Agent as will enable any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, as the case may
be, to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or
information reporting requirements;

(B) each Foreign Lender (or, if such Foreign Lender is disregarded as an entity
separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Person treated
as its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is entitled under the
Code or any applicable treaty to an exemption from or reduction of withholding
tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall
deliver to each Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies
as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such
Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time
thereafter upon the request of any Borrower or the Administrative Agent, but
only if such Foreign Lender (or, if such Foreign Lender is disregarded as an
entity

 

44



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Person treated
as its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is legally entitled to do
so), whichever of the following is applicable:

(1) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-BEN-E, as
applicable, claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which
the United States is a party,

(2) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI,

(3) executed originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY and all required
supporting documentation,

(4) in the case of a Foreign Lender (or, if such Foreign Lender is disregarded
as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the
Person treated as its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes) claiming the
benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under section 881(c) of the
Code, (x) a certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender (or such other
Person) is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of section 881(c)(3)(A) of the
Code, (B) a “10 percent shareholder” of the applicable Borrower within the
meaning of section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign
corporation” described in section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and (y) executed
originals of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, or

(5) executed originals of any other form prescribed by applicable laws as a
basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding tax
together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by
applicable laws to permit any Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine
the withholding or deduction required to be made.

(C) each Lender shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and each Borrower such
documentation reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or the Borrowers
sufficient for the Administrative Agent and the Borrowers to comply with their
obligations under FATCA and to determine whether payments to such Lender are
subject to withholding tax under FATCA. Solely for purposes of this sub-clause
(C), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this
Agreement.

 

45



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(iii) Each Lender shall promptly (A) notify each Borrower and the Administrative
Agent of any change in circumstances which would modify or render invalid any
claimed exemption or reduction and (B) take such steps as shall not be
materially disadvantageous to it, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender and
as may be reasonably necessary (including the re-designation of its Lending
Installation), to avoid any requirement of applicable laws of any jurisdiction
that any Borrower or the Administrative Agent make any withholding or deduction
for taxes from amounts payable to such Lender.

(iv) Without limiting the effect of Sections 3.05(f)(i), (ii) and (iii) above:

(A) Subject to paragraph (B) below, a UK Treaty Lender and each Borrower which
makes a payment to which that UK Treaty Lender is entitled shall co-operate in
completing any procedural formalities necessary for that Borrower to obtain
authorization to make that payment without a UK Tax Deduction.

(B) (1) A UK Treaty Lender which is a Lender on the Effective Date and that
holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme, and which wishes that
scheme to apply to this Agreement, shall confirm its scheme reference number and
its jurisdiction of tax residence opposite its name in Schedule 3.05; and

(2) a UK Treaty Lender which is not a Lender on the Effective Date and that
holds a passport under the HMRC DT Treaty Passport scheme, and which wishes that
scheme to apply to this Agreement, shall confirm its scheme reference number and
its jurisdiction of tax residence in the relevant Assignment and Assumption (or,
if such Lender becomes Lender otherwise than pursuant to an Assignment and
Assumption, in the relevant documentation which it executes on becoming a Lender
under this Agreement),

and, having done so, that Lender shall be under no obligation pursuant to
paragraph (A) above.

(C) If a UK Treaty Lender has confirmed its scheme reference number and its
jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with paragraph (B) above and:
(a) the Designated Borrower making a payment to that Lender has not made a UK
Borrower DTTP Filing in respect of that Lender; or (b) the Designated Borrower
making a payment to that Lender has made a UK Borrower DTTP Filing but (1) that
UK Borrower DTTP Filing has been rejected by HM Revenue & Customs; or (2) HM
Revenue & Customs have not given the Designated Borrower authority to make
payments to that Lender without a UK Tax Deduction within 60 days of the date of
the UK Borrower DTTP Filing, and in each case, the Designated Borrower has
notified that Lender in writing, that Lender and the Designated Borrower shall
co-operate in completing any procedural formalities necessary for the Designated
Borrower to obtain authorization to make that payment without a UK Tax
Deduction.

 

46



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(D) If a UK Treaty Lender has not confirmed its scheme reference number and
jurisdiction of tax residence in accordance with paragraph (B) above, the
Designated Borrower shall not make a UK Borrower DTTP Filing or file any other
form relating to the HM Revenue & Customs DT Treaty Passport scheme in respect
of that Lender’s Loan(s) unless that Lender otherwise agrees.

(E) The Designated Borrower shall, promptly on making a UK Borrower DTTP Filing,
deliver a copy of that UK Borrower DTTP Filing to the Administrative Agent for
delivery to the relevant UK Treaty Lender.

(F) A UK Non-Bank Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement on the day on
which this agreement is entered into gives a UK Tax Confirmation by entering
into this Agreement. A UK Non-Bank Lender shall promptly notify the Borrowers
and the Administrative Agent if there is any change in the position from that
set out in the UK Tax Confirmation.

(G) Each Lender in respect of the Designated Borrower which becomes a party to
this Agreement after the Effective Date shall indicate in the Assignment and
Assumption (or, if such Lender becomes Lender otherwise than pursuant to an
Assignment and Assumption, in the relevant documentation which it executes on
becoming a Lender under this Agreement) which of the following categories it
falls in: (A) not a UK Qualifying Lender; (B) a UK Qualifying Lender (other than
a UK Treaty Lender); or (C) a UK Treaty Lender. If a Lender fails to indicate
its status in accordance with this paragraph (G) then such Lender shall be
treated for the purposes of this Agreement (including by each Borrower) as if it
is not a UK Qualifying Lender until such time as it notifies the Administrative
Agent which category applies (and the Administrative Agent, upon receipt of such
notification, shall inform each Borrowers). For the avoidance of doubt, any such
Assignment and Assumption or other relevant documentation shall not be
invalidated by any such failure of a Lender to comply with this paragraph (G).

(H) The Designated Borrower shall promptly on becoming aware that it must make a
UK Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or basis of a UK Tax
Deduction) notify the Administrative Agent accordingly. Similarly, a Lender
shall notify the Administrative Agent on becoming so aware in respect of a
payment payable to that Lender. If the Administrative Agent receives such
notification from a Lender it shall promptly notify the Designated Borrower.

(I) If in respect of a Loan extended to the Designated Borrower (A) a Lender
assigns or transfers any of its rights or obligations with respect to such Loan
or changes its lending office in respect of such Loan, and (B) as a result of
circumstances existing at the date the assignment, transfer or change occurs,
the Designated Borrower would be obliged to make a payment (or increased
payment) to the successor or assign or Lender acting through its new lending

 

47



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

office under this Section 3.05 in respect of a UK Tax Deduction, then such
successor or assign or Lender acting through its new lending office is only
entitled to receive payment under this Section 3.05 to the same extent as the
assigning or transferring Lender or Lender acting through its previous lending
office would have been if the assignment, transfer or change had not occurred.

(g) VAT.

(i) All amounts expressed to be payable under any Loan Document by any Party to
a Lender which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply
for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on
that supply, and accordingly, subject to subparagraph (ii) below, if VAT is or
becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Lender to any Party under a Loan
Document and such Lender is required to account to the relevant tax authority
for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Lender (in addition to and at the same
time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the
amount of the VAT (and such Lender must promptly provide an appropriate VAT
invoice to that Party).

(ii) If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Lender (the
“Supplier”) to any other Lender (the “VAT Recipient”) under a Loan Document, and
any Party other than the VAT Recipient (the “Relevant Party”) is required by the
terms of any Loan Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for that
supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify the
VAT Recipient in respect of that consideration):

(A) (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax
authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at the
same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the
VAT. The VAT Recipient must (where this paragraph (A) applies) promptly pay to
the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the VAT Recipient
receives from the relevant tax authority which the VAT Recipient reasonably
determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and

(B) (where the VAT Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant
tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand
from the VAT Recipient, pay to the VAT Recipient an amount equal to the VAT
chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the VAT Recipient
reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the
relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.

(C) Where a Loan Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Finance
Party for any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the
case may be) such Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense,
including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such
Finance Party reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment
in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.

 

48



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(D) In relation to any supply made by a Finance Party to any Party under a Loan
Document, if reasonably requested by such Finance Party, that Party must
promptly provide such Finance Party with details of that Party’s VAT
registration and such other information as is reasonably requested in connection
with such Finance Party’s VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply.

(E) Any reference in this Section 3.05(g)) to any party shall, at any time when
such party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where
appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the person
who is treated as making the supply or (as appropriate) receiving the supply
under the grouping rules (as provided for in Article 11 of the Council Directive
2006/112/EC (or as implemented by the relevant member state of the European
Union or any other similar provision in any jurisdiction which is not a member
state of the European Union)).

(h) Treatment of Certain Refunds. Unless required by applicable laws, at no time
shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise
pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any
refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such
Lender. If the Administrative Agent or any Lender determines, in its sole
discretion, exercised in good faith that it has received a refund of any Taxes
or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by any Borrower or with
respect to which any Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section, it shall pay to such Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only
to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such
Borrower under this Section with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise
to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any
interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund), provided that each Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative
Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to repay the amount paid over
to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest (to the extent accrued from the
date such refund is paid over to such Borrower) or other charges imposed by the
relevant Governmental Authority), to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in
the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such
refund to such Governmental Authority. This subsection shall not be construed to
require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns
(or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to
any Borrower or any other Person.

Section 3.06 Mitigation Obligations. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.01 or Section 3.02, or any Borrower is required to pay any additional
amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender
pursuant to Section 3.05, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to
Section 3.03, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
different Lending Installation for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches
or affiliates, if, in

 

49



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate
or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.01, 3.02 or 3.05, as the case
may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to
Section 3.03, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such
Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be materially
disadvantageous to such Lender. WBA hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs
and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or
assignment.

Section 3.07 Inability to Determine Rates. (a) If the Required Lenders determine
that for any reason in connection with any request for a Eurocurrency Loan or a
conversion to or continuation thereof that (i) deposits (whether in Dollars or a
Foreign Currency) are not being offered to banks in the London interbank
eurodollar market for the applicable amount and Interest Period of such
Eurocurrency Loan, (ii) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
determining the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested Interest Period with
respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Loan (whether denominated in Dollars or a
Foreign Currency), or (iii) the Eurocurrency Base Rate for any requested
Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurocurrency Loan does not adequately
and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the
Administrative Agent will promptly so notify WBA and each Lender. Thereafter,
the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Eurocurrency Loans in the
affected currency shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent (upon the
instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such
notice, any Borrower may revoke any pending request for the making of,
conversion to, or continuation of, Eurocurrency Loans of the affected currency
or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request
for Alternate Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan
Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be
made by notice to the Borrowers and shall be conclusive absent manifest error),
or WBA or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of
the Required Lenders, a copy to Borrower) that the Borrowers or Required Lenders
(as applicable) have determined, that:

(i) (A) deposits (whether in Dollars or any Foreign Currency) are not being
offered to banks in the London interbank eurodollar market for the applicable
amount and Interest Period of any applicable Eurocurrency Loan for the
applicable currency or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
ascertaining LIBOR for the applicable currency for any requested Interest
Period, including, without limitation, because the Eurocurrency Base Rate is not
available or published on a current basis, and in each case such circumstances
are unlikely to be temporary, or

(ii) the administrator of the Eurocurrency Base Rate for the applicable currency
or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent
has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR for
the applicable currency or the Eurocurrency Base Rate for the applicable
currency shall no longer be made available, or used for determining the interest
rate of loans (such specific date, the “Scheduled Unavailability Date”), or

(iii) syndicated loans in the U.S. market denominated in the applicable currency
being executed at the time, or that include language similar to that contained
in this Section 3.07, are being generally executed or amended, as applicable, to
incorporate or adopt, as applicable, a new benchmark interest rate to replace
LIBOR for the applicable currency,

then, reasonably promptly after such determination by the Administrative Agent
or receipt by the Administrative Agent of such notice, as applicable, the
Administrative Agent and WBA may amend this Agreement (a “LIBOR Successor
Amendment”) to replace the Eurocurrency Base Rate with respect to the applicable
currency with an alternate benchmark rate, giving due consideration to any
evolving or then existing convention for similar syndicated credit facilities in
the U.S. market denominated in the applicable currency for such alternative
benchmarks (any such proposed rate, a “Replacement Rate”) and any such amendment
shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on the fifth Business Day
after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all
Lenders and WBA unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required
Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such
Required Lenders do not accept such amendment.

If no Replacement Rate has been determined and the circumstances under clause
(i) above exist or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred (as
applicable), the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify WBA and each
Lender. Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain
Eurocurrency Loans shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected
Eurocurrency Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) the Eurocurrency Base Rate
component shall no longer be utilized in determining the Alternate Base Rate.
Upon receipt of such notice, WBA may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing
of, conversion to or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans (to the extent of the
affected Eurocurrency Loans or Interest Periods) or, failing that, will be
deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of
Alternate Base Rate Loans (subject to the foregoing clause (y)) in the amount
specified therein.

be clearly and conspicuously marked “PUBLIC” which, at a minimum, shall mean
that the word “PUBLIC” shall appear prominently on the first page thereof;
(x) by marking Borrower Materials “PUBLIC,” WBA shall be deemed to have
authorized the Administrative Agent, the Arranger and the Lenders to treat the
Borrower Materials as not containing any material non-public information with

corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity in its
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, as the case may be, and maintain
all requisite authority to conduct its business in each jurisdiction in which
its business is conducted, except in each case (other than valid existence of
any Borrower) where the failure to do so would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

Section 6.05 Compliance with Laws. Each Borrower will (and WBA will cause each
of its Major Subsidiaries to), comply in all material respects with all
applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders (such compliance to include,
without limitation, compliance with ERISA and Environmental Laws and paying

the performance of every covenant of this Agreement on the part of the
applicable Borrower to be performed; and (ii) immediately after giving effect to

thereto, no Default or Unmatured Default would exist.

Section 6.09 Liens. No Borrower will, and WBA will not permit any Major

ACCELERATION, WAIVERS, AMENDMENTS AND REMEDIES

Section 8.01 Acceleration, Etc. If any Default described in Section 7.05 or 7.06
occurs, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans shall automatically
terminate and the Obligations of each Borrower shall immediately become due and
payable without any election or action on the part of the Administrative Agent
or any Lender. If any other Default occurs, the Required Lenders (or the
Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders) may terminate or
suspend (in whole or in part) the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans or
declare the Obligations of each Borrower to be due and payable (in whole or in
part), whereupon such Obligations shall become immediately due and payable,
without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which the
Borrowers hereby expressly waive. Promptly upon any acceleration of the
Obligations, the Administrative Agent will provide each Borrower with notice of
such acceleration.

If, within thirty (30) days after acceleration of the maturity of the
Obligations of each Borrower or termination of the obligations of the Lenders to
make Loans hereunder as a result of any Default (other than any Default as
described in Section 7.05 or 7.06) and before any judgment or decree for the
payment of the Obligations due shall have been obtained or entered, the Required
Lenders (in their sole discretion) shall so direct, the Administrative Agent
shall, by notice to each Borrower, rescind and annul such acceleration and/or
termination.

Section 8.02 Amendments. Subject to the provisions of this Article VIII and
except as otherwise specified in this Agreement (including pursuant to a LIBOR
Successor Amendment), the Required Lenders (or the Administrative Agent with the
consent in writing of the Required Lenders) and WBA may enter into agreements
supplemental hereto for the purpose of adding or modifying any provisions to the
Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of the Lenders or the
Borrowers hereunder or thereunder or waiving any Default hereunder or
thereunder; provided, however, that no such supplemental agreement shall:

(a) Extend the final maturity of any of the Loans of any Lender or forgive all
or any portion of the principal amount thereof payable to any Lender, or reduce
the rate or extend the scheduled time of payment of interest or fees thereon
(other than a waiver of the application of the default rate of interest pursuant
to Section 2.11 hereof) payable to any Lender, without the consent of each
Lender affected thereby.

 

64



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(b) Reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders or any
other percentage of Lenders specified to be the applicable percentage in this
Agreement to act on specified matters or amend Section 2.19 or the definition of
“Pro Rata Share”, without the consent of all Lenders affected thereby. For the
sake of clarity, the addition of one or more term loan facilities or the
increase or addition of one or more revolving credit facilities or an extension
of the maturity of a portion of the Revolving Facility and similar modifications
shall be permitted with the consent of the Required Lenders and the Lenders
agreeing to participate in the new facility or to increase the amount of their
commitment or extend the maturity of their Loans.

(c) Extend the Maturity Date or the Facility Termination Date as it applies to
any Lender, or increase the amount or otherwise extend the term of the
Commitment of any Lender hereunder without the consent of each Lender affected
thereby.

except as provided in Section 6.07 without the consent of all Lenders.

(e) Amend the definition of “Foreign Currency” without the consent of all
Lenders.

(f) Amend this Section 8.02 without the consent of all Lenders.

(g) Release, other than in accordance with the terms hereof, all or
substantially all of the value of the Parent Guarantee.

provided further, that (i) no amendment of any provision of this Agreement
relating to the Administrative Agent shall be effective without the written
consent of the Administrative Agent; (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall,
unless in writing and signed by the Administrative Agent in addition to the
Lenders required above, affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent
under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; (iii) any provision of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document may be amended by an agreement in writing
entered into by WBA and the Administrative Agent to cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency (including, without limitation, amendments,
supplements or waivers to any of documents executed by WBA or any Subsidiary in
connection with this Agreement if such amendment, supplement or waiver is
delivered in order to cause such related documents to be consistent with this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents) and (iv) the Administrative Agent and
WBA may enter into amendments or modifications to this Agreement or enter into
additional documentation as the Administrative Agent reasonably deems
appropriate in order to implement any Replacement Rate or otherwise effectuate
the terms of Section 3.07(b) in accordance with the terms of Section 3.07(b).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting Lender shall have
any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder,
(it being specifically understood and agreed that any amendment, waiver or
consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected
Lender may be effected

 

65



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

with the consent of the applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders),
except that (A) the Commitment of such Lender may not be increased or extended
without the consent of such Lender and (B) any waiver, amendment or modification
requiring the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms
affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall
require the consent of such Defaulting Lender.

Section 8.03 Preservation of Rights. No delay or omission of the Lenders or the
Administrative Agent to exercise any right under the Loan Documents shall impair
such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Default or an acquiescence
therein, and the making of a Loan notwithstanding the existence of a Default or
Unmatured Default or the inability of the applicable Borrower to satisfy the
conditions precedent to such Loan shall not constitute any waiver or
acquiescence. Any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not
preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right,
and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or
provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in writing
signed by, or by the Administrative Agent with the consent of, the requisite
number of Lenders required pursuant to Section 8.02, and then only to the extent
in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan
Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders until all of the Obligations have been
paid in full.

Lender, regardless of any investigation made by the Administrative Agent, any
Lender or on their behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any
Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default at the time of any Loan,

Section 9.05 Several Obligations; Benefits of this Agreement. The respective
obligations of the Lenders hereunder are several and not joint and no Lender
shall be the partner or agent of any other (except to the extent to which the
Administrative Agent is authorized to act as such). The failure of any Lender to
perform any of its obligations hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender from

any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and the reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket legal and other related expenses (including the
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee),

Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including in respect of any matters
addressed in Section 3.05), (ii) any Loan or the use or proposed use of the
proceeds therefrom, (iii) to the extent relating to the foregoing, any actual or
alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property
owned, leased or operated by WBA or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
Environmental Liability related in any way to WBA or any of its Subsidiaries or
(iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding
relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other
theory, whether brought by a third party or by any Borrower, and regardless of
whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall
not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from (x) the
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or its
Related Parties, (y) a material breach of such Indemnitee’s or its Related
Parties’ obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document or (z) a dispute
among two or more Indemnitees not arising from any act or omission of the
Borrowers or their Subsidiaries hereunder (but not including any such dispute
that involves a Lender to the extent such Lender is acting in a different
capacity (i.e., the Administrative Agent or the Arranger) under any Loan
Document). This Section 9.06(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than
any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any non-Tax
claim.

indefeasibly pay any amount required under subsection (a) of this Section or WBA
for any reason fail to indefeasibly pay or cause to be paid any amount required
under subsection (b) of this Section, in each case, to be paid to the
Administrative Agent (or any sub-agent thereof) or any Related Party of any of
the foregoing, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
(or any such sub-agent) or such Related Party, as the case may be, such Lender’s
ratable share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed
expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount, provided that the
unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related
expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the
Administrative Agent (or any such sub-agent) in its capacity as such, or against
any Related Party of any of the foregoing acting for the Administrative Agent
(or any such sub-agent) in connection with such capacity. The obligations of the
Lenders under this subsection (c) are subject to the provisions of
Section 2.17(b).

(d) Waiver of Consequential Damages, Etc. To the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, each party hereto shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim
against any other party hereto, on any theory of liability, for special,
indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual
damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement,
any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the proceeds
thereof (it being agreed that WBA’s indemnity and contribution obligations set
forth in this Section 9.06 shall apply in respect of any special, indirect,
consequential or punitive damages that may be awarded against any Indemnitee in
connection with a claim by a third party unaffiliated with the Indemnitee). No
Indemnitee referred to in subsection (b) above shall be liable for any damages

the Administrative Agent, the replacement of any Lender, the termination of this
Agreement or the Aggregate Commitment and the repayment, satisfaction or
discharge of all the other Obligations.

Section 9.07 Accounting. Except as provided to the contrary herein, all
accounting terms used herein shall be interpreted and all accounting
determinations hereunder shall be made in accordance with the Agreement
Accounting Principles.

Section 9.08 Severability of Provisions. Any provision in any Loan Document that
is held to be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid in any jurisdiction shall,
as to that jurisdiction, be inoperative, unenforceable, or invalid without
affecting the remaining provisions in that jurisdiction or the operation,
enforceability, or validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction, and to
this end the provisions of all Loan Documents are declared to be severable.
Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.08, if and to the
extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to
Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good
faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in

such information, to (i) any assignee of or Participant in, or any prospective
assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to

(i) to the extent such Information (x) is or becomes publicly available other
than as a result of a breach of this Section or (y) becomes available to the

provisions of this Article, other than Section 10.06 below, are solely for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and the Borrowers shall not
have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions (other than
as provided in Section 10.06 below). It is understood and agreed that the use of
the term “agent” herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar
term) with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any
fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency
doctrine of any applicable law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market
custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship
between contracting parties.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 10.02 Rights as a Lender. The Person serving as the Administrative Agent
hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as
any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Administrative Agent and the term “Lender” or “Lenders” shall, unless otherwise
expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person
serving as the Administrative Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such
Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, act as the
financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in
any kind of business with WBA or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if
such Person were not the Administrative Agent hereunder and without any duty to
account therefor to the Lenders.

Section 10.03 Reliance by Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall
be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon,
any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or
other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website
posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been
signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person; provided that the
foregoing shall not relieve the Administrative Agent of its obligations to
comply with the procedures set forth in Section 2.08, including the requirement
to orally confirm the location and number of the applicable Borrower’s account
to which proceeds of Loans are to be disbursed. The Administrative Agent also
may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it
to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for
relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the
making of a Loan that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a
Lender, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory
to such Lender unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the
contrary from such Lender prior to the making of such Loan. The Administrative
Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for WBA), independent
accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any
action taken or not taken by it in good faith in accordance with the advice of
any such counsel, accountants or experts.

Section 10.04 Exculpatory Provisions. The Administrative Agent shall not have
any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the
other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Administrative Agent:

(a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of
whether a Default has occurred and is continuing;

(b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any
discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly
contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent
is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be expressly provided for
herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Administrative Agent
shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of
its counsel, may expose the Administrative Agent to liability or that is
contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of
doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor
Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of
property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law; and

 

72



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(c) shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan
Documents, have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to
disclose, any information relating to WBA or any of its Affiliates that is
communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as the Administrative Agent or
any of its Affiliates in any capacity.

The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken
by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such
other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the
Administrative Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the
circumstances as provided in Article VIII) or (ii) in the absence of its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment. The Administrative Agent shall
be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice
describing such Default is given to the Administrative Agent WBA, any Borrower
or a Lender.

The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to
ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in
or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the
contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or
thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or
observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set
forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default, (iv) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan
Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction
of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to
confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Administrative Agent.

Section 10.05 Delegation of Duties. The Administrative Agent may perform any and
all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any
other Loan Document by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the
Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may
perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or
through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory provisions of this
Article shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the
Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective
activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided
for herein as well as activities as Administrative Agent. The Administrative
Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines in a final and non-appealable judgment that the Administrative Agent
acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct (or breached its material
obligations under the Loan Documents) in the selection of such sub-agents.

 

73



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 10.06 Resignation of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may
at any time give notice of its resignation to the Lenders and WBA. Upon receipt
of any such notice of resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right,
subject to, so long as no Default has occurred and is continuing, the consent of
WBA (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a
successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an
Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such
successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have
accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent
gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may on
behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Administrative Agent meeting the
qualifications set forth above, subject to, so long as no Default has occurred
and is continuing, the consent of WBA (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); provided that if the Administrative Agent shall notify WBA
and the Lenders that no qualifying Person has accepted such appointment, then
such resignation shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such
notice and (1) the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and
(2) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring
Administrative Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided
to be made by, to or through the Administrative Agent shall instead be made by
or to each Lender directly, until such time as the Required Lenders appoint a
successor Administrative Agent as provided for above in this Section. Upon the
acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such
successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring (or retired) Administrative Agent (other
than as provided in Section 3.08 and other than any rights to indemnity payments
or other amounts owed to the retiring Administrative Agent as of the effective
date of its resignation), and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this
Section). The fees payable by WBA to a successor Administrative Agent shall be
the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between WBA
and such successor. After the retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and
Section 9.06 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in
respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the
retiring Administrative Agent was acting as Administrative Agent.

Section 10.07 Non-Reliance on Administrative Agent and Other Lenders. Each of
the Lenders acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and
based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its
own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each of the
Lenders also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and
based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem
appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action
under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

Section 10.08 No Other Duties, Etc. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Arranger listed on the cover page hereof shall not have any
powers, duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, except in its capacity, as applicable, as the Administrative Agent or
a Lender hereunder.

 

74



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 10.09 Administrative Agent May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the
pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial
proceeding relative to the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of
whether the principal of any Loan shall then be due and payable as herein
expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the
Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrowers) shall be
entitled and empowered (but not obligated), by intervention in such proceeding
or otherwise:

(a) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest
owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans and all other Obligations that are
owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or
advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders and the Administrative
Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Lenders and the Administrative Agent and their
respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders and the
Administrative Agent) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and

(b) to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable
on any such claims and to distribute the same;

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Lender to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event
that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Lenders, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Administrative Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to
the Administrative Agent.

Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent
to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender any plan
of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Obligations or the rights of any Lender to authorize the Administrative Agent to
vote in respect of the claim of any Lender in any such proceeding.

Section 10.10 ERISA. (a) Each Lender (x) represents and warrants, as of the date
such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date
such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a
Lender party hereto, that at least one of the following is and will be true:

(i) such Lender is not using “plan assets” (within the meaning of Section 3(42)
of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans in connection with the Loans
or the Commitments,

 

75

exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate
accounts), PTE 91-38 (a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank

performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement,

(iii) (A) such Lender is an investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional
Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of PTE 84-14), (B) such Qualified

and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of
and performance of the Loans, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the
requirements of sub-sections (b) through (g) of Part I of PTE 84-14 and (D) to
the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I
of PTE 84-14 are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into,
participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the
Commitments and this Agreement, or

(iv) such other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in
writing between the Administrative Agent, in its sole discretion, and such
Lender.

(b) In addition, unless either (1) sub-clause (i) in the immediately preceding
clause (a) is true with respect to a Lender or (2) a Lender has provided another
representation, warranty and covenant in accordance with sub-clause (iv) in the
immediately preceding clause (a), such Lender further (x) represents and
warrants, as of the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and
(y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the

the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrowers, that none of the
Administrative Agent, the Arranger or any of their respective Affiliates is a
fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in the Loans, the
Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or
exercise of any rights by the Administrative Agent under this Agreement, any
Loan Document or any documents related to hereto or thereto).

ARTICLE XI

SETOFF

Section 11.01 Setoff. In addition to, and without limitation of, any rights of
the Lenders under applicable law, if any Default occurs, any and all deposits
(including all account balances, whether provisional or final and whether or not
collected or available) and any other Indebtedness at any time held or owing by
any Lender or any Affiliate of any Lender to or for the credit or account of any
Borrower may be offset and applied toward the payment of the Obligations of such
Borrower then owing to such Lender to the extent the Obligations shall then be
due; provided, that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any
such right of

 

76

setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the
Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2.20(a)(ii) and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such

of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall
provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in
reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it
exercised such right of setoff.

ARTICLE XII

BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS; PARTICIPATIONS

Section 12.01 Successors and Assigns. (a) Successors and Assigns Generally. The
provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and thereto and their respective
successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that no Borrower may assign or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder or thereunder
without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Lender
and no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of
subsection (b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with
the provisions of subsection (d) of this Section or (iii) by way of pledge or
assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of subsection
(f) of this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party
hereto shall be null and void).

(b) Assignments by Lenders. Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more
assignees all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents (including all or a portion of its Commitment and
the Loans at the time owing to it); provided that any such assignment shall be
subject to the following conditions:

(i) Minimum Amounts.

(A) in the case of an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning
Lender’s Commitment and the Loans at the time owing to it or in the case of an
assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund, no minimum
amount need be assigned; and

(B) in any case not described in subsection (b)(i)(A) of this Section, the
aggregate amount of the Commitment (which for this purpose includes Loans
outstanding thereunder) or, if the Commitment is not then in effect, the
principal outstanding balance of the Loans of the assigning Lender subject to
each such assignment, determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption
with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent or, if
“Trade Date” is specified in the Assignment and Assumption, as of the Trade
Date, shall not be less than $10,000,000 unless each of the Administrative Agent
and, so long as no Default under Sections 7.02, 7.05 or 7.06 has occurred and is
continuing, WBA otherwise consents (each such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed); provided, however, that concurrent assignments to members
of an

 

77



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assignee Group and concurrent assignments from members of an Assignee Group to a
single Eligible Assignee (or to an Eligible Assignee and members of its Assignee
Group) will be treated as a single assignment for purposes of determining
whether such minimum amount has been met.

(ii) Proportionate Amounts. Each partial assignment shall be made as an
assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and
obligations under this Agreement with respect to the Loans or the Commitment
assigned.

(iii) Required Consents. No consent shall be required for any assignment except
to the extent required by subsection (b)(i)(B) of this Section and, in addition:

(A) the prior written consent of WBA (such consent to be provided in WBA’s sole
discretion) shall be required unless (i) a Default under Sections 7.02, 7.05 or
7.06 has occurred and is continuing at the time of such assignment or (ii) such
assignment is to a Person that is a Lender (as defined under the Existing
Revolving Credit Agreement as in effect on the Effective Date) on the Effective
Date and, as a result of such assignment, the assignee’s Commitment is equal to
or less than such assignee’s Commitment (as defined under the Existing Revolving
Credit Agreement as in effect on the Effective Date) under the Existing
Revolving Credit Agreement as in effect on the Effective Date; and

(B) the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) shall be required if such assignment is to
a Person that is not a Lender, an Affiliate of such Lender or an Approved Fund
with respect to such Lender.

(iv) Assignment and Assumption. The parties to each assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with
a processing and recordation fee in the amount of $3,500; provided, however,
that the Administrative Agent may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such
processing and recordation fee in the case of any assignment. The assignee, if
it is not a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an administrative
questionnaire.

(v) No Assignment to Borrower. No such assignment shall be made to any Borrower
or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

(vi) No Assignment to Natural Persons. No such assignment shall be made to a
natural person.

(vii) No Assignment to Defaulting Lenders. No such assignment shall be made to a
Defaulting Lender.

 

78



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(viii) Certain Additional Payments. In connection with any assignment of rights
and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be
effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set
forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments
to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution
thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee
of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including
funding, with the consent of WBA and the Administrative Agent, the Pro Rata
Share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to
each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent),
to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such
Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and
interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full Pro
Rata Share of all Loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any
assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall
become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of
this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a
Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance
occurs.

Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant
to subsection (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to
this Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment
and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this
Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the
interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Assumption covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.01, 3.03, 3.04, 3.05, and 9.06 with
respect to facts and circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such
assignment. Upon request, each Borrower (at its expense) shall execute and
deliver a Note to the assignee Lender. Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of
rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this
subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such
Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with
subsection (d) of this Section.

(c) Register. The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as a
non-fiduciary agent of WBA, shall maintain at the Administrative Agent’s Office
a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of,
and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and WBA, the
Administrative Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In
addition, the Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information
regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a
Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by WBA at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. In addition,
at any time that a request for a consent for a material or substantive change to
the Loan Documents is pending, any Lender may request and receive from the
Administrative Agent a copy of the Register.

 

79



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(d) Participations. Any Lender may, with the prior written consent of WBA ((i)
such consent to be provided in WBA’s sole discretion, (ii) such consent not to
be required if a Default under Sections 7.02, 7.05 or 7.06 has occurred and is
continuing at the time of the sale of the applicable participation and
(iii) such consent not to be required for a participation to a Person that is a
Lender (as defined under the Existing Revolving Credit Agreement as in effect on
the Effective Date) on the Effective Date), sell participations to any Person
(other than a natural person, Defaulting Lender or the Borrowers or any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries) (each, a “Participant”), in all or a portion of such
Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans); provided that (i) such Lender’s
obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations and (iii) the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement.

Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a
participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any amendment, waiver or other modification described in the first proviso to
Section 8.02 that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (e) of this
Section, WBA agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 3.01, 3.03, 3.04 and 3.05 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and
had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this
Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled
to the benefits of Section 11.01 as though it were a Lender, provided that such
Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.19 as though it were a Lender.

Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as
a nonfiduciary agent of the applicable Borrower, maintain a register on which it
enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and
stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other
Obligations under the Loan Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that
no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the
Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any
information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or
its other Obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the
extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan
or other Obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the
United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register
shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each
Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such
participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to
the contrary. For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its
capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a
Participant Register.

 

80



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(e) Limitations upon Participant Rights. A Participant shall not be entitled to
receive any greater payment under Section 3.01, 3.03, 3.04 or 3.05 than the
applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the
participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to
such Participant is made with the applicable Borrower’s prior written consent. A
Participant shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 3.05 unless such
Participant agrees to comply with Section 3.05 as though it were a Lender (it
being understood that the documentation required under Section 3.05(f) shall be
delivered to the Lender who sells the participation).

(f) Certain Pledges. Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security
interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including
under its Note, if any) to secure obligations of such Lender, including any
pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or other
central banking authority having jurisdiction over such Lender; provided that no
such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from any of its obligations
hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party
hereto.

Section 12.02 Dissemination of Information. WBA authorizes each of the Lenders
to disclose to any Participant or any other Person acquiring an interest in the
Loan Documents by operation of law (each a “Transferee”) and any prospective
Transferee any and all information in such Lender’s possession concerning the
creditworthiness of WBA and its Subsidiaries, including without limitation any
information contained in any reports or other information delivered by WBA
pursuant to Section 6.01; provided that each Transferee and prospective
Transferee agrees to be bound by Section 9.10 of this Agreement or other
provisions at least as restrictive as Section 9.10 including making the
acknowledgments set forth therein.

Section 12.03 Tax Treatment. If any interest in any Loan Document is transferred
to any Transferee which is organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other
than the United States or any State thereof, the transferor Lender shall cause
such Transferee, concurrently with the effectiveness of such transfer, to comply
with the provisions of Section 3.05(f); provided, that damages for any breach of
this Section 12.03 shall in no event exceed the reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Borrowers in collecting or attempting to collect from
the Transferee any forms it reasonably requires in order to determine its
withholding and reporting obligations in accordance with Section 3.05(f) herein.

provided in paragraph (b) below, shall be effective as provided in said
paragraph (b).

(b) Electronic Communications. Notices and other communications to the Lenders
hereunder may be delivered or furnished by electronic communication (including
e-mail and internet or intranet websites) pursuant to procedures approved by the
Administrative Agent or as otherwise determined by the Administrative Agent,
provided that the foregoing shall not apply to notices to any Lender pursuant to
Article II if such Lender has notified the Administrative Agent that it is
incapable of receiving notices under such Article by electronic communication.
The Administrative Agent or the Borrowers may, in its respective discretion,
agree to accept notices and other communications to it hereunder by electronic
communications pursuant to procedures approved by it or as it otherwise
determines, provided that such determination or approval may be limited to
particular notices or communications.

Unless the Administrative Agent otherwise prescribes, (i) notices and other
communications sent to an e-mail address shall be deemed received upon the
sender’s receipt of an acknowledgement from the intended recipient (such as by
the “return receipt requested” function, as available, return e-mail or other
written acknowledgement), provided that if such notice or other communication is
not given during the normal business hours of the recipient, such notice or
communication shall be deemed to have been given at the opening of business on
the next Business Day for the recipient, and (ii) notices or communications
posted to an Internet or intranet website shall be deemed received upon the
deemed receipt by the intended recipient at its e-mail address as described in
the foregoing clause (i) of notification that such notice or communication is
available and identifying the website address therefor.

(c) The Platform. THE PLATFORM (IF ANY) IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”
THE AGENT PARTIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) DO NOT WARRANT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS
OF THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE ADEQUACY OF THE PLATFORM, AND EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIM LIABILITY FOR ERRORS IN OR OMISSIONS FROM THE BORROWER MATERIALS. NO
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD
PARTY RIGHTS OR FREEDOM FROM VIRUSES OR OTHER CODE DEFECTS, IS MADE BY ANY AGENT
PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE BORROWER MATERIALS OR THE PLATFORM. In no event shall the Administrative
Agent or any of its Related Parties (collectively, the “Agent Parties”) have any
liability to the Borrowers, any Lender, or any other Person for losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses of any kind (whether in tort, contract or
otherwise) arising out of WBA’s or the Administrative Agent’s transmission of
Borrower Materials through the Internet, except to the extent that such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by a final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Agent Party; provided, however,
that in no event shall any Agent Party have any liability to the Borrowers, any
Lender, or any other Person for indirect, special, incidental, consequential or
punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages).

(d) Change of Address, Etc. Each of the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent
may change its address, telecopier or telephone number for notices and other
communications hereunder by written notice to the other parties hereto. Each
other Lender may change its address, telecopier or telephone number for notices
and other communications hereunder by written notice to WBA and the
Administrative Agent. In addition, each Lender agrees to notify the
Administrative Agent from time to time to ensure that the Administrative Agent
has on record (i) an effective address, contact name, telephone number,
telecopier number and electronic mail address to which notices and other
communications may be sent and (ii) accurate wire instructions for such Lender.
Furthermore, each Public Lender agrees to cause at least one individual at or on
behalf of such Public Lender to at all times have selected the “Private Side
Information” or similar designation on the content declaration screen of the
Platform in order to enable such Public Lender or its delegate, in accordance
with such Public Lender’s compliance procedures and applicable law, including
United States Federal and state securities laws, to make reference to Borrower
Materials that are not made available through the “Public Side Information”
portion of the Platform and that may contain material non-public information
with respect to WBA or its securities for purposes of United States Federal or
state securities laws.

(e) Reliance by Administrative Agent and Lenders. The Administrative Agent and
the Lenders shall be entitled to rely and act upon any notices purportedly given
by or on behalf of any Borrower so long as such notices appear on their face to
be authentic even if (i) such notices were not made in a manner specified
herein, were incomplete or were not preceded or followed by any other form of
notice specified herein, or (ii) the terms thereof, as understood by the
recipient, varied from any confirmation thereof. The Borrowers shall jointly and
severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Related
Parties of each of them from all losses, costs, expenses and liabilities
resulting from the reliance by such Person on each notice purportedly given by
or on behalf of any Borrower. All telephonic communications with the
Administrative Agent may be recorded by the Administrative Agent, and each of
the parties hereto hereby consents to such recording.

Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the

shall be deemed to include electronic signatures, the electronic matching of
assignment terms and contract formations on electronic platforms approved by the
Administrative Agent, or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of
which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a
manually executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as
the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law,
including the Federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act,
the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar
state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act; provided that
notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Administrative
Agent is under no obligation to agree to accept electronic signatures in any

of remedies, bankruptcy proceedings or litigation among the Administrative

paper original copies of any Loan Documents, including with respect to any
signature pages thereto.

NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT THE RIGHT OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT, THE ARRANGER
OR LENDERS TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW.

Section 15.04 U.S. Patriot Act Notice. Each Lender that is subject to the U.S.
Patriot Act and the Administrative Agent (for itself and not on behalf of any
Lender) hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of the
U.S. Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that
identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of the
Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender or the
Administrative Agent, as applicable, to identify the Borrowers in accordance

the Administrative Agent or any Lender, provide all documentation and other
information that the Administrative Agent or such Lender requests in order to
comply with its ongoing obligations under applicable “know your customer” and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the U.S. Patriot Act.

Section 15.05 No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility. In connection with all
aspects of each transaction contemplated hereby (including in connection with
any amendment, waiver or other modification hereof or of any other Loan
Document), the Borrowers acknowledge and agrees, and acknowledges its
Affiliates’ understanding, that: (i) (A) the arranging and other services
regarding this Agreement provided by the Administrative Agent, the Arranger and

Borrowers or any of its Affiliates, or any other Person and (B) neither the

Agent could purchase the first currency with

 

86



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment
is given. The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it
to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder or under the other Loan
Documents shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “Judgment
Currency”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with
the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the “Agreement Currency”), be
discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to
be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as
the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the
Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement
Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Administrative
Agent or any Lender from any applicable Borrower in the Agreement Currency, such
applicable Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any
such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case
may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased
is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender
in such currency, the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be,
agrees to return the amount of any excess to such applicable Borrower (or to any
other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).

Section 15.07 Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of Affected Financial
Institutions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or

accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or

(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the
exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of the applicable Resolution

ARTICLE XVI

WBA GUARANTEE

Section 16.01 WBA Guaranty. WBA hereby guarantees (the undertaking of WBA
contained in this Article XVI being the “Parent Guarantee”) the punctual payment
when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all
Obligations of the Designated Borrower under this Agreement, whether for
principal, interest, fees, expenses or otherwise, which Obligations shall
include such indebtedness, obligations, and liabilities which may be or
hereafter become unenforceable or shall be an allowed or disallowed claim under
any proceeding or case commenced by or against WBA or the Designated Borrower
under any Debtor Relief Laws, and shall include interest that accrues after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws (such obligations,
collectively, being the “Subsidiary Borrower Obligations”), and any and all
expenses (including counsel fees and expenses) incurred by the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders in enforcing any rights under the Parent Guarantee. The
Parent Guarantee is a guaranty of payment and not of collection. WBA agrees
that, as between WBA and the Administrative Agent, the Subsidiary Borrower
Obligations may be declared to be due and payable for purposes of the Parent
Guarantee notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition which may
prevent, delay or vitiate any declaration as regards the Designated Borrower and
that in the event of a declaration or attempted declaration, the Subsidiary
Borrower Obligations shall immediately become due and payable by WBA for
purposes of the Parent Guarantee.

Section 16.02 Guaranty Absolute. WBA guarantees that the Subsidiary Borrower
Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect
in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the
Administrative Agent or the Lenders with respect thereto. The liability of WBA
under the Parent Guarantee shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional
irrespective of:

(a) any lack of validity, enforceability or genuineness of any provision of this
Agreement, any Subsidiary Borrower Obligations or any other agreement or
instrument relating thereto;

(b) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term
of, all or any of the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations, or any other amendment or
waiver of or any consent to departure from this Agreement;

(c) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral, or any release or
amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all
or any of the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations;

(d) the existence of any claim, set-off or other rights which WBA may have at
any time against any Lender, whether in connection herewith or any unrelated
transactions, provided that nothing herein shall prevent the assertion of any
such claim by separate suit or compulsory counterclaim;

 

88



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(e) any law or regulation of any jurisdiction or any other event affecting any
term of a Subsidiary Borrower Obligation; or

(f) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available
to, or a discharge of, WBA or the Designated Borrower.

The Parent Guarantee shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the
case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Subsidiary Borrower
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the
Designated Borrower or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

Section 16.03 Waivers.

(a) WBA hereby waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance and any other
notice with respect to any of the Subsidiary Borrower Obligations and the Parent
Guarantee and any requirement that the Administrative Agent or any Lender
protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest or lien or any property
subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action against the Designated
Borrower or any other Person or any collateral.

(b) WBA hereby irrevocably waives any claims or other rights that it may now or
hereafter acquire against the Designated Borrower that arise from the existence,
payment, performance or enforcement of the obligations of WBA under the Parent
Guarantee, including, without limitation, any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification and any right to
participate in any claim or remedy of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
against the Designated Borrower or any collateral, whether or not such claim,
remedy or right arises in equity or under contract, statute or common law,
including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Designated
Borrower, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in
any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim, remedy or right.
If any amount shall be paid to WBA in violation of the preceding sentence at any
time prior to the later of the payment in full of the Subsidiary Borrower
Obligations and all other amounts payable under the Parent Guarantee and the
Facility Termination Date, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and shall forthwith be paid to the
Administrative Agent to be credited and applied to the Subsidiary Borrower
Obligations and all other amounts payable under the Parent Guarantee, whether
matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Parent Guarantee, or to be held as collateral for any Subsidiary Borrower
Obligations or other amounts payable under the Parent Guarantee thereafter
arising. WBA acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from
the financing arrangements contemplated by this Agreement and the Parent
Guarantee and that the waiver set forth in this Section 16.03(b) is knowingly
made in contemplation of such benefits.

Section 16.04 Continuing Guaranty. The Parent Guarantee is a continuing guaranty
and shall (i) remain in full force and effect until the payment in full of the
Subsidiary Borrower Obligations (including any and all Subsidiary Borrower
Obligations which remain outstanding after the Facility Termination Date) and
all other amounts payable under the Parent Guarantee, (ii) be binding upon each
of WBA and its successors and assigns and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Lenders, the Administrative Agent and their respective
successors, transferees and assigns.

 

89



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section 16.05 Subrogation. Upon making any payment with respect to the
Designated Borrower, WBA shall be subrogated to the rights of the payee against
the Designated Borrower with respect to such payment; provided that WBA shall
not enforce any payment by way of subrogation until all amounts of principal and
of interest on the Notes and all other amounts payable by the Designated
Borrower under this Agreement have been paid in full.
