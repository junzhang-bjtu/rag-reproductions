subsequently the subject of a Deemed Repurchase) in whole by the Administrative
Agent (on behalf of the Purchasers) hereunder is irrevocable and unconditional
on the part of each such Seller and shall occur (without any further action by
any such Seller) on each Business Day prior to the Termination Date.
(b)    Subject to Section 2.2, on each Business Day prior to the Termination
Date, the Administrative Agent shall be deemed to sell in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement to each Purchaser, and each such Purchaser shall be
deemed to purchase from the Administrative Agent, without recourse, an undivided
percentage ownership interest (each an “Asset Interest”) equal to the Pro Rata
Share of such Purchaser in and to each Purchased Receivable deemed purchased by
the Administrative Agent on such day in accordance with clause (a) above. The
deemed offer by the Administrative Agent to sell and the deemed offer by each
Purchaser to purchase such Asset Interests hereunder is irrevocable and
unconditional on the part of the Administrative Agent or such Purchaser and
shall occur (without any further action by any party) on each Business Day prior
to the Termination Date.
Section 2.2.    Deemed Repurchase by the Sellers. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, if the Administrative Agent does not, on or before 12:00
p.m. (New York time) on a given Settlement Date, receive from the Purchasers the
full amount of the expected Payment Amount payable on such Settlement Date, then
any positive Payment Amount for such Settlement Date will be reduced to $0 in
accordance with the definition thereof, and without any further action on the
part of the Administrative Agent, any Purchaser or any Seller, the Net Face
Value of Billed Receivables acquired by the Administrative Agent (on behalf of
the Purchasers) during the immediately preceding Settlement Period will
automatically be deemed to be repurchased by the relevant Seller (a “Deemed
Repurchase”); provided, that nothing in this Section 2.2 shall cause any
Receivables subject to a Deemed Repurchase to be ineligible for future sale by
such Seller to the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Purchasers) under
Section 2.1.
Section 2.3.    Purchase Price. The Purchase Price (the “Discounted Purchase
Price”) for each Purchased Receivable purchased on any given Purchase Date will
be calculated as follows:
DPP = NFV – Purchase Discount, in which “Purchase Discount” = NFV x DR x (DP /
360), in which:

TermDefinition
“DPP”    equals     
Discounted Purchase Price of such Receivable
“NFV”    equals     
Net Face Value of such Receivable as of such Purchase Date
“DR”     equals
Discount Rate applicable to such Receivable
“DP”    equals
Discount Period applicable to such Receivable



    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the
Purchasers) may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to purchase a
Receivable for an amount equal to such Receivable’s Net Face Value, as reduced
by any amount (including any Accrued Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Discount) then due and payable by a Seller to the Administrative Agent or any
Purchaser hereunder (such amount, the “Adjusted Purchase Price”). In this event,
an amount equal to the Accrued Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase Discount for such
Purchased Receivable will be payable by the Seller Representative on each
Settlement Date and each Termination Settlement Date until such time as the
Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase Discount or such Purchased Receivable has been
paid in full. The Seller shall not be entitled to set-off its obligation to pay
the Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase Discount (or any portion thereof) against
the Refundable Discount Advance.


    With respect to each Purchased Receivable, the Purchase Price thereof shall
be payable by the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Purchasers) to the
Seller Representative (on behalf of the relevant Seller) by deposit into the
Remittance Account on the Settlement Date immediately following the Settlement
Period during which such Purchased Receivable was purchased. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Purchase Price shall be subject to netting and set-off as
provided for under Section 5.6.


Section 2.4.    Maximum Funded Amount; Payment Amount; Termination Payment
Amount. (a)
On each Settlement Date and Termination Settlement Date, the Administrative
Agent shall (by reference to the Servicing Report received via the PrimeRevenue
System by the Administrative Agent on the immediately preceding Reconciliation
Date) determine the Maximum Funded Amount, the Payment Amount (in the case of a
Settlement Date) or Termination Payment Amount (in the case of a Termination
Settlement Date), as applicable, and shall notify the Seller Representative of
the same.


    (b)    Following the determination of the Payment Amount, and in accordance
with Section 5.7, on each Settlement Date (x) if the Payment Amount is positive,
the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Purchasers) shall pay the full amount
thereof to the Seller Representative, and upon payment of such amount, the
Administrative Agent’s payment obligations with respect to the Purchased
Receivables acquired during the Settlement Period ending immediately prior to
such Settlement Date shall be satisfied in full and (y) if the Payment Amount is
negative, the Seller Representative shall pay the full absolute value thereof to
the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Purchasers) by deposit into the
Administrative Agent’s Account. Furthermore, in connection with Sections 3.5 and
3.6, the Administration Fee and the Unused Fee payable by the Seller
Representative on each Settlement Date shall be set-off against any positive
Payment Amount payable by the Administrative Agent (and the surplus of the
Administration Fee and Unused Fee, if any, after effecting such set-off shall be
payable by the Seller Representative to the Administrative Agent), and the
absolute value of any negative Payment Amount payable by the Seller
Representative shall be combined with the Administration Fee and Unused Fee
payable on such Settlement Date (such that both amounts will be paid
simultaneously to the Administrative Agent).


    (c)    Following the determination of the Termination Payment Amount, and in
accordance with Section 5.7, on each Termination Settlement Date until the
Funded Amount has been reduced to zero and all other amounts payable to the
Administrative Agent and the Purchasers by the Sellers hereunder have been paid
in full, the Seller Representative shall pay the full amount of the Termination
Payment Amount to the Administrative Agent by deposit into the Administrative
Agent’s Account. Furthermore, in connection with Sections 3.5, the
Administration Fee payable by the Seller Representative on each Termination
Settlement Date shall be combined with the Termination Payment Amount payable on
such Termination Settlement Date (such that both amounts will be paid
simultaneously to the Administrative Agent).



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Section 2.5.    Seller Representative. Each Seller hereby appoints Enterprise as
its agent, attorney-in-fact and representative (in such capacity, the “Seller
Representative”), and Enterprise accepts such appointment, for the purpose of
(i) making any requests required under this Agreement, (ii) the receipt of any
notice of required repurchase pursuant to Section 11.2, (iii) the giving and
receipt of any other notices to, or demand of, any Seller under this Agreement,
(iv) the delivery of all documents, reports, financial statements and written
materials required to be delivered by any Seller under this Agreement, (v) the
receipt of all payments owing to a Seller hereunder, together with the
subsequent allocation of such payment proceeds between the Sellers, (vi) taking
any and all other actions required to be undertaken hereunder by the Seller
Representative, and (vii) all other purposes incidental to any of the foregoing.
Each Seller agrees that any action taken by the Seller Representative as the
agent, attorney-in-fact and representative of each such Seller shall be binding
upon it, as applicable, to the same extent as if directly taken by such Seller,
as applicable.
Section 2.6.    Termination and Reduction of Commitments.
(a)    In addition, the Seller Representative may terminate or reduce
permanently the Commitments of the Purchasers in its sole discretion at any time
by delivering thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Administrative Agent
and the Purchasers; provided that, (i) if the Commitments are terminated in
full, the Termination Date shall be the first (1st) Business Day following such
thirty (30) day period, (ii) if the Commitments are reduced, such reduction
shall be effective on the first Business Day following such thirty (30) day
period, (iii) each reduction of Commitments shall be in a minimum amount of
$50,000,000 or in an integral multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof, (iv) no
reduction of the Commitment may cause the Aggregate Commitments to be less than
the greater of $200,000,000 and the Funded Amount and (v) each reduction in the
Commitments shall be made ratably among the Purchasers in accordance with their
respective Pro Rata Share. Once reduced or terminated, the Commitments may not
be reinstated.
(b)    Upon the occurrence of a Facility Suspension Event, the Administrative
Agent may, and at the direction of the Required Purchasers, shall, terminate the
Commitments of the Purchasers at any time by providing written notice of such
termination to the Seller Representative (in which case the Termination Date
shall be the day specified as such in the written notice, which may be the date
upon which such written notice is received by the Seller Representative (or, in
each case, if such date is not a Business Day, the Termination Date shall be the
immediately following Business Day)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
occurrence of the Termination Date will have no effect on any rights or
obligations hereunder in respect of any Purchased Receivables outstanding as of
the Termination Date and all covenants, representations and warranties,
repurchase obligations and indemnities made herein shall continue in full force
and effect so long as any Purchased Receivables remain outstanding.
(c)    Provided that no Facility Suspension Event has occurred and is
continuing, the Sellers may from time to time advise the Administrative Agent
(on behalf of the Purchasers) in writing of their desire to extend the Scheduled
Termination Date for an additional six (6) month period; provided, that such
request is made not more than two hundred and ten (210) days prior to, and not
less than sixty (60) days prior to, the then current Scheduled Termination Date.
The Administrative Agent shall promptly communicate such request to the
Purchasers. The Administrative Agent and each Purchaser shall notify the Sellers
and the Administrative Agent in writing whether or not such Person is agreeable
to such extension (it being understood that the Administrative Agent and the
Purchasers may accept or decline such a request in their sole discretion and on
such terms as they may elect) not more than sixty (60) days after receiving the
Seller’s request to extend the Scheduled Termination Date; provided, however,
that if



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



the Administrative Agent or any Purchaser fails to so notify the Seller
Representative and the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent or such
Purchaser, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have declined such extension.
In the event that the Administrative Agent and one or more Purchasers have so
notified the Seller Representative and the Administrative Agent in writing that
they are agreeable to such extension, the Seller Representative, the
Administrative Agent and the applicable Purchasers shall enter into such
documents as the Administrative Agent and the applicable Purchasers may deem
necessary or appropriate to effect such extension, and all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent
and the applicable Purchasers in connection therewith (including attorney costs)
shall be paid by the Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby agreed
that as of any day at no time shall the Scheduled Termination Date extend for
more than one (1) year from such day.
Section 2.7.    Effect of Termination Date.
(a)    For the sake of clarity, the parties agree that, at all times on and
following the Termination Date:
    (i)    Except to the extent otherwise removed in accordance with Section 5,
each Seller shall continue to service and administer the Purchased Receivables
sold by it as agent for the Administrative Agent and the Purchasers, all on
terms further set out in this Agreement.
    (ii)    The Seller Representative shall continue to pay the Accrued
Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase Discount on each Termination Settlement Date
until the Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase Discount has been paid in full to the
Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the Purchasers) by deposit into the
Administrative Agent’s Account. The Refundable Discount Advance will be promptly
repaid by the Administrative Agent to the Seller Representative upon payment in
full by the Seller Representative of the Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase
Discount in accordance with Section 2.8.
Section 2.8.    Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase Discount; Refundable Discount
Advance.
(a)    The Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase Discount shall be payable in full by
the Seller Representative on the Final Maturity Date; provided, however, that
following the occurrence of the Termination Date, if a Seller’s appointment as
servicer hereunder is terminated by the Administrative Agent as the result of a
Facility Suspension Event, the Administrative Agent may, and at the direction of
the Required Purchasers, shall, by written notice to the Seller Representative,
demand payment in full of the Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase Discount. In any
such case, the Seller Representative shall pay the Aggregate Unreimbursed
Purchase Discount to the Administrative Agent (for the benefit of the
Purchasers) on the date designated for such payment in the written notice from
the Administrative Agent (which date must be at least one (1) Business Day
following the date upon with such written notice is received by the Seller
Representative) by deposit into the Administrative Agent’s Account. The parties
hereto agree that the Seller Representative’s obligation to pay the Aggregate
Unreimbursed Purchase Discount is not credit recourse for any failure of an
Approved Obligor to pay the full outstanding balance of any Purchased
Receivable, but rather is an obligation to reimburse the Administrative Agent
and the Purchasers for electing not to deduct the Purchase Discount from the
Purchase Price with respect to the applicable Purchased Receivables for the
purpose of administrative convenience.
(b)    On the Closing Date, the Seller Representative will pay to the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Purchasers, a refundable purchase
discount advance (the “Refundable Discount Advance”) equal to 0.4% of the
Aggregate Commitments. For administrative convenience it is agreed



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



and the Sellers hereby instruct the Administrative Agent and the Purchasers to
withhold the entire Refundable Discount Advance from the initial purchase of
Receivables hereunder and to transfer such amount to the Refundable Discount
Advance Account as described below. The Refundable Discount Advance shall be
held in a blocked account established with the Administrative Agent and
maintained in the name of the Seller Representative (the “Refundable Discount
Advance Account”). The Refundable Discount Advance Account shall at all times be
blocked with respect to the Seller Representative, such that only the
Administrative Agent will be permitted to transfer funds out of the Refundable
Discount Advance Account. Subject to repayment in full of the Aggregate
Unreimbursed Purchase Discount, the Administrative Agent will promptly repay the
Refundable Discount Advance to the Seller Representative by deposit into the
Remittance Account; provided, however, that if the Seller Representative has not
paid the Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase Discount in full as of the Final
Maturity Date (or any such earlier date as required by Section 2.8(a)), the
Administrative Agent may set-off the Refundable Discount Advance against the
unpaid balance of the Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase Discount, and upon doing
so, the Administrative Agent will promptly repay the excess Refundable Discount
Advance (if any) to the Seller Representative by deposit into the Remittance
Account. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that, to the
extent there remains any deficiency in the Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase
Discount after any such set-off and application, such deficiency shall remain
the obligation of the Sellers.
Section 2.9.    Eligible Unbilled Receivables. The Seller Representative shall
procure that each Eligible Unbilled Receivable sold, transferred and assigned to
the Administrative Agent hereunder will be the subject of an Invoice as soon as
reasonably practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following
the Seller Representative’s receipt of a written request to issue such Invoice
from the Administrative Agent; provided, however, that if any Approved Obligor
becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts or fails or admits in writing
its inability generally to pay its debts as they become due, the Seller
Representative shall promptly (and in any event, within five (5) Business Days)
issue an Invoice for each Purchased Receivable that is an Eligible Unbilled
Receivable payable by such Approved Obligor, and shall provide the
Administrative Agent with a copy of each such Invoice. In the event of the
occurrence of the Termination Date or a revocation of the Purchasers’ approval
of any Approved Obligor pursuant to Section 14.21, the Administrative Agent
shall have the option to (i) retain ownership of any Eligible Unbilled
Receivable and/or (ii) at any time following such termination or revocation, but
solely to the extent that an Approved Obligor Termination Event has not occurred
with respect to the Approved Obligor of the applicable Eligible Unbilled
Receivable, cause the applicable Seller to repurchase such Eligible Unbilled
Receivable from the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 11. The
Administrative Agent shall promptly inform the Seller Representative following
any such termination or revocation of its decision to either retain ownership or
cause a Repurchase Event with respect to any such Eligible Unbilled Receivable.
In the event that the Administrative Agent elects to retain ownership of any
Eligible Unbilled Receivable after the Termination Date or the revocation of the
Purchasers’ approval of any Approved Obligor pursuant to Section 14.22, the
Seller Representative shall promptly (and in any event, within five (5) Business
Days) issue an Invoice for any such retained Eligible Unbilled Receivable. Upon
issuance by the relevant Seller of an Invoice for a Purchased Receivable that is
an Eligible Unbilled Receivable, such Purchased Receivable shall immediately
become a Billed Receivable for purposes hereof (the date upon which such
Purchased Receivable becomes a Billed Receivable, the “Conversion Date”).
Section 2.10.    Increase in Aggregate Commitments.
(a)    Request for Increase. Provided there exists no Facility Suspension Event,
upon notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly notify the
Purchasers), the Seller Representative may



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



from time to time request an increase in the Aggregate Commitments by an amount
(for all such requests) not exceeding $100,000,000; provided that (i) any such
request for an increase shall be in a minimum amount of $25,000,000, (ii) the
Seller Representative may make a maximum of four (4) such requests. At the time
of sending such notice, the Seller Representative (in consultation with the
Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Purchaser
is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten (10) Business
Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Purchasers).
(b)    Purchaser Elections To Increase. Each Purchaser shall notify the
Administrative Agent within such time period whether or not it agrees to
increase its Commitment and, if so, whether by an amount equal to, greater than
or less than its Pro Rata Share of such requested increase. Any Purchaser not
responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to increase
its Commitment.
(c)    Notification by Administrative Agent; Additional Purchasers. The
Administrative Agent shall notify the Sellers and each Purchaser of the
Purchasers’ responses to each request made hereunder. To the extent that the
existing Purchasers do not agree to the full amount of a requested increase, in
order to achieve the full amount of such requested increase and subject to the
approval of the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld), the Seller Representative may also invite additional financial
institutions (each, a “New Purchaser”) to become Purchasers pursuant to a
joinder agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent
and its counsel; provided that the Commitment of each New Purchaser shall be at
least $50,000,000.
(d)    Increase Effective Date and Allocations. If the Aggregate Commitments are
increased in accordance with this Section, the Administrative Agent and the
Sellers shall determine the final allocation of such increase and the effective
date thereof (the “Increase Effective Date”). The Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the Sellers and the Purchasers of the final allocation of such
increase and the Increase Effective Date and the Purchasers shall receive at
least two (2) Business Days’ notice thereof. The Asset Interests of the
Purchasers shall be reallocated among all Purchasers (including the New
Purchasers) such that the Asset Interests of each Purchaser on the Increase
Effective Date shall be consistent with such Purchaser’s new Pro Rata Share on
such date. In order to achieve such reallocation, certain Purchasers will be
required, and hereby agree, to purchase a portion of the Asset Interests from
the other Purchasers in exchange for cash on the Increase Effective Date. The
Administrative Agent shall coordinate such reallocation among the Purchasers and
its determination shall be final absent manifest error.
(e)    Conditions to Effectiveness of Increase. As a condition precedent to each
increase in the Aggregate Commitments, the Sellers shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent a certificate dated as of the Increase Effective Date (in
sufficient copies for each Purchaser) signed by the secretary or an assistant
secretary of each Seller (i) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by
the Sellers approving or consenting to such increase and (ii) certifying that,
before and after giving effect to such increase, (A) the representations and
warranties of the Sellers contained in this Agreement and the other Purchase
Documents are true and correct on and as of the Increase Effective Date, except
to the extent that such representations and warranties specifically refer to an
earlier date, in which case they were true and correct as of such earlier date
and (B) no Facility Suspension Event exists. As an additional a condition
precedent to each increase in the Aggregate Commitments, the Sellers shall have
deposited an amount equal to 0.4% of such increase in the Aggregate Commitments
into the Refundable Discount Advance Account to serve as additional Refundable
Discount Advance.
Section 2.11.    Defaulting Purchaser Provisions.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(a)     Replacement of Defaulting Purchaser. If any Purchaser is a Defaulting
Purchaser, then (i) the Seller Representative, upon notice to the Administrative
Agent or the Administrative Agent upon notice to the Seller Representative, and
the Purchasers, may require such Defaulting Purchaser to assign and delegate,
without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained
in, and consents required by, Section 14.6), all of its interests, rights (other
than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Sections 3.3, 12.1 or 14.1) and
obligations under this Agreement and the related Purchase Documents to one or
more permitted assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may
be another Purchaser, if such Purchaser accepts such assignment); provided that
(i) such Purchaser shall have received payment of an amount equal to its
outstanding Asset Interests, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it
hereunder and under the other Purchase Documents, (ii) such assignment does not
conflict with applicable Law and (iii) if such Purchaser is also acting as
Administrative Agent, (A) such Purchaser shall have the right to immediately
resign as Administrative Agent upon the effectiveness of such assignment and (B)
the non-Defaulting Purchasers may in their discretion require that such
Purchaser resign as Administrative Agent. Each Purchaser hereby grants to the
Administrative Agent an irrevocable power of attorney (which power is coupled
with an interest) to execute and deliver, on behalf of such Purchaser if such
Purchaser becomes a Defaulting Purchaser, as assignor, any Assignment and
Assumption necessary to effect any assignment of such Defaulting Purchaser’s
interests hereunder in the circumstances contemplated by this Section 2.11(a).
Each Purchaser agrees that if the Seller Representative or the Administrative
Agent exercises its option hereunder to cause an assignment by such Purchaser if
such Purchaser becomes a Defaulting Purchaser, such Defaulting Purchaser shall,
promptly after receipt of written notice of such election, execute and deliver
all documentation necessary to effect such assignment in accordance with Section
14.6. In the event that a Purchaser does not comply with the requirements of the
immediately preceding sentence within one (1) Business Day after receipt of such
notice, each Purchaser hereby authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to
execute and deliver such documentation as may be required to give effect to an
assignment in accordance with Section 14.6 on behalf of such Defaulting
Purchaser and any such documentation so executed by the Administrative Agent
shall be effective for purposes of documenting an assignment pursuant to Section
14.6.
(b)    Defaulting Purchaser Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Purchaser becomes a Defaulting
Purchaser, then, until such time as such Purchaser is no longer a Defaulting
Purchaser, to the extent permitted by applicable Law (i) such Defaulting
Purchaser’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with
respect to this Agreement or any other Purchase Document shall be restricted as
set forth in the definition of Required Purchasers and (ii) no Defaulting
Purchaser shall be entitled to receive any Unused Fee pursuant to Section 3.6
for any period during which that Purchaser is a Defaulting Purchaser (and the
Sellers shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been
required to have been paid to that Defaulting Purchaser).
(c)    Defaulting Purchaser Cure. If the Seller Representative and the
Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Purchaser is no longer a Defaulting
Purchaser, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon
as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions
set forth therein, such Purchaser will take such actions as the Administrative
Agent may determine to be necessary (which may include a requirement for such
Purchaser to purchase certain Asset Interests from the other Purchasers in order
to equalize all such Asset Interests in accordance with the Pro Rata Shares of
the Purchasers as in effect immediately prior to any assignment that occurred as
a result of such Purchaser becoming a Defaulting Purchaser), whereupon such
Purchaser will cease to be a Defaulting Purchaser; provided that no adjustment
will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or
on behalf of the Sellers while that Purchaser was a Defaulting Purchaser; and
provided, further, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the
affected parties, no change



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



hereunder from Defaulting Purchaser to Purchaser will constitute a waiver or
release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Purchaser’s having
been a Defaulting Purchaser.
Section 2.12.    Joining Seller Sale Commencement Date.
(a)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement or
any other Purchase Document, no Joining Seller shall sell to the Administrative
Agent (on behalf of the Purchasers) any Receivables pursuant to this Agreement
until such time, if any, that each of the following conditions precedent have
been satisfied:
(i)    such Joining Seller shall have executed and delivered to the
Administrative Agent and each Purchaser an agreement substantially in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit D (a “Joining Seller Commencement Notice”) at least
ten (10) calendar days prior the proposed Joining Seller Sale Commencement Date
(as defined below) and shall have provided such other information with respect
to such Joining Seller as the Administrative Agent or any Purchaser may
reasonably request;
(ii)    such Joining Seller Commencement Notice shall specify the date (such
date, a “Joining Seller Sale Commencement Date”) that such Joining Seller shall
commence selling Receivables to the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the
Purchasers) pursuant to this Agreement, which Joining Seller Sale Commencement
Date shall be a Settlement Date;
(iii)    such Joining Seller Sale Commencement Date shall be no later than ten
(10) calendar days prior to the Scheduled Termination Date;
(iv)    the Administrative Agent shall have received an executed Account Control
Agreement with respect to each Existing Account with respect to such Joining
Seller, in form and substance satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and each
Purchaser in its sole discretion; and
(v)    no Facility Suspension Event or event which, with the passage of time or
the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a Facility Suspension Event,
shall have occurred and be continuing.
(b)    On the Joining Seller Sale Commencement Date related to such Joining
Seller, the Seller Representative shall submit a Servicing Report to the
Administrative Agent via the PrimeRevenue System (which, for the avoidance of
doubt shall include Receivables of such Joining Seller), and simultaneously with
the submission of such Servicing Report, such Joining Seller will be deemed to
offer to the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Purchasers), and subject to
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.2 and clause (a)
above, and the Administrative Agent (on behalf of the Purchasers) will be deemed
to purchase from each such Joining Seller, without any further action on the
part of such Joining Seller, all of such Joining Seller’s right, title and
interest in and to all outstanding Eligible Receivables of such Joining Seller
specified on such Servicing Report.
SECTION 3.FEES; LATE PAYMENT AMOUNT.
Section 3.1.    Late Payment Amount. In the event that any amount payable by any
Seller hereunder or under any of the other Purchase Documents remains unpaid for
any reason for five (5) Business Days after the Administrative Agent provides
notice to the Seller Representative that such amounts are past due, the
Administrative Agent shall charge (for its benefit or the benefit of the
Purchasers, as applicable), and such Seller shall pay, an amount (the “Late
Payment Amount”) equal to (x) such unpaid amount due



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



from such Seller to the Administrative Agent or the Purchasers during the period
from (and including) the due date thereof to, but excluding the date payment is
received by the Administrative Agent in full, times (y) a rate per annum equal
to the Prime Commercial Rate, computed on the basis of a three hundred and sixty
(360) day year, and for actual days elapsed. Late Payment Amounts shall be
payable on demand and, if no prior demand is made, on the last Business Day of
each calendar month.
Section 3.2.    Payments Generally. All payments to be made under any Purchase
Document or in respect of a Purchased Receivable shall be made in immediately
available funds. Any amounts that would fall due for payment on a day other than
a Business Day shall be payable on the succeeding Business Day, and interest
calculations, if any, shall be adjusted accordingly for such later or earlier
payment. All amounts payable by any Seller or the Seller Representative to the
Administrative Agent or any Purchaser pursuant to or in connection with any
Purchase Document shall be paid in full, free and clear of all deductions,
set-off or withholdings whatsoever except only as may be required by Law, and
shall be paid on the date such amount is due no later than 1:00 p.m. (New York
City time) to the Administrative Agent’s Account. Any amount to be paid by the
Administrative Agent or any Purchaser to any Seller or the Seller Representative
under any Purchase Document shall be paid to the Seller Representative by
deposit into the Remittance Account, and shall be paid on the date such amount
is due no later than 5:00 p.m. (New York City time).
Section 3.3.    Breakage. Each Seller agrees, jointly and severally, to
indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Purchaser on demand against any loss
or expense (including, but not limited to, any loss or expense sustained or
incurred or to be sustained or incurred by a Purchaser in liquidating or
employing deposits acquired or contracted for to effect or maintain its
acquisition of its Asset Interest in Purchased Receivables or any part thereof,
but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the loss of any anticipated profits)
which the Administrative Agent or such Purchaser has sustained or incurred as a
consequence of (a) the non-fulfillment of any of the conditions precedent
described in Section 8.2 or otherwise or (b) a repurchase of Purchased
Receivables by the Seller; provided, that no Seller shall be obligated to
indemnify any Purchaser pursuant to this provision if such loss or expense is
caused by such Purchaser’s failure to fund its Pro Rata Share of the applicable
Payment Amount.
Section 3.4.    Ratable Sharing. If any Purchaser shall, by exercising any right
of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any
Purchased Receivable or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Purchaser
receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount payable under any
Purchased Receivable to such Purchaser greater than its Asset Interest would
warrant as provided herein, then such Purchaser receiving such greater
proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b)
purchase (for cash) participations in the other Purchasers’ Asset Interests (not
in excess of the applicable Purchase Price thereof), or make such other
adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments
shall be shared by the Purchasers ratably in accordance with the aggregate
amount owing to them; provided: (i) if any such participations are purchased and
all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such
participations shall be rescinded and the Purchase Price restored to the extent
of such recovery, without interest; and (ii) the provisions of this Section
shall not be construed to apply to (A) any payment made by a Seller pursuant to
and in accordance with the express terms hereof, or (B) any payment obtained by
a Purchaser as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in
any of its Purchased Receivables to any assignee or Participant including,
without limitation, any assignments effectuated pursuant to Section 2.11(a).
Each Seller consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may
effectively do so under applicable Law, that any Purchaser acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such
Seller rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Purchaser were a direct creditor of such Seller in the amount
of such participation.

Section 3.5    Payment of Administration Fee. On each Settlement Date and each
Termination Settlement Date, the Seller Representative shall pay to the
Administrative Agent, for its own account, an administration fee (the
“Administration Fee”) in an amount provided for in the Administration Fee
Letter.
Section 3.6.    Unused Fee. On each Settlement Date, the Seller Representative
shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Purchasers, an
unused commitment fee (the “Unused Fee”) in an amount equal to:
UF = (AC – FA) x R x (SP / 360), in which:

TermDefinition
“UF”    equals     
The Unused Fee payable on a given Settlement Date
“AC” equals
The Aggregate Commitments as of the immediately preceding Settlement Date
“FA” equals
The Funded Amount as of the immediately preceding Settlement Date
“R”    equals     
Unused Fee Rate
“SP”    equals
The Settlement Period ending immediately prior to the Settlement Date on which

The Unused Fee distributable by the Administrative Agent to each Purchaser on
each Settlement Date for each day during the preceding Settlement Period shall
be equal to such Purchaser’s Pro Rata Share of the Unused Fee earned for such
day; provided, however, if a Shutdown of the U.S. Government (but not a Shutdown
of the applicable State and Local Obligor) shall have occurred and be continuing
on any day, no Unused Fee shall accrue with respect to such day.
SECTION 4.NATURE OF FACILITY.
Section 4.1.    True Sale. The parties hereto agree that each purchase and sale
of Receivables under this Agreement is intended to be an absolute and
irrevocable transfer constituting a “true sale” for bankruptcy law purposes,
without recourse by the Administrative Agent or the Purchasers to any Seller for
any credit risk or financial inability to pay of any Obligor. The parties hereto
have structured the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as a sale, and
each party hereto agrees to treat each such transaction as a “true sale” for all
purposes under applicable law and accounting principles, including, without
limitation, in their respective books, records, computer files, Tax returns
(federal, state and local), regulatory and governmental filings (and shall
reflect such sale in their respective financial statements). Each Seller will
advise all Persons inquiring about the ownership of the Receivables that all
Purchased Receivables have been sold to the Administrative Agent on behalf of
the Purchasers. Against the possibility that, contrary to the mutual intent of
the parties, the purchase of any Receivable is not characterized as a sale by
any applicable court, each Seller hereby grants to the Administrative Agent (for
the benefit of the Purchasers) a security interest in, and right of setoff with
respect to, all of the Purchased Receivables to secure the payment and
performance of the Seller’s payment and performance obligations hereunder and
under each other Purchase Document. The grant of this security interest is a
supplemental protection to the Administrative Agent and the Purchasers and is
not meant to negate or affect in any way the intended sale of the Receivables by
the Sellers to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Purchasers. In
addition, each Seller hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit
of the Purchasers, a security interest in, and right of setoff with respect to,
all of the Seller Account Collateral related to such Seller and all proceeds
thereof to secure the payment and performance of the Seller’s payment and
performance obligations hereunder and under each other Purchase Document.
Furthermore,



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



the Seller Representative hereby grants to the Administrative Agent (for the
benefit of the Purchasers) a security interest in, and right of setoff with
respect to, the Refundable Discount Advance Account and all proceeds therein to
secure the payment of the Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase Discount by each
Seller hereunder. The Administrative Agent is hereby authorized to file UCC
financing statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder,
including the security interests granted herein, together with any continuations
and amendments relating thereto.
Section 4.2.    No Liability. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Seller Representative and each Seller hereby acknowledges and agrees that
neither the Administrative Agent nor any Purchaser shall be in any way
responsible for the performance of any Contract and no such Person shall have
any obligation to intervene in any Dispute arising out of the performance of any
Contract. All obligations of a Seller as seller of the Goods and Services and
provider of any related services, including, without limitation, all obligations
of such Seller as seller under the Contracts, all representations and warranty
obligations, all servicing obligations, all maintenance obligations, and all
delivery, transport and insurance obligations, shall be retained by such Seller
(the “Retained Obligations”). Any claim which a Seller may have against an
Obligor or any other party, and/or the failure of an Obligor to fulfill its
obligations under the applicable Contract, shall not affect the obligations of
such Seller to perform its obligations and make payments hereunder, and shall
not be used as a defense or as set-off, counterclaim or cross-complaint as
against the performance or payment of any of its obligations.
Section 4.3.    Further Assurances. Seller Representative and each Seller agrees
that from time to time, at its expense, it will promptly execute and deliver all
further instruments and documents, and take all further action, that the
Administrative Agent or any Purchaser may reasonably request in order to
perfect, protect or more fully evidence or implement the transactions
contemplated hereby, or to enable the Administrative Agent or any Purchaser to
exercise or enforce any of its rights with respect to the Purchased Receivables,
including, in the case of a Facility Suspension Event and/or a Non-Payment
Event, any action reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent or any
Purchaser in order to make the sale, assignment and transfer of any Purchased
Receivables compliant with FACA.
SECTION 5.SERVICER; PURCHASER FUNDING; DISTRIBUTION FROM THE COLLECTION ACCOUNT.
Section 5.1.    Appointment of each Seller as a Servicer. Each Seller hereby
agrees to service and administer the Purchased Receivables sold by it as agent
for the Administrative Agent and the Purchasers, all on the terms set out in
this Agreement. Each Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
collect each Purchased Receivable sold by it as if such Purchased Receivable had
not been purchased by the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Purchasers. Each
Seller agrees that such Seller shall cooperate with the Administrative Agent and
shall take any and all commercially reasonable actions requested by the
Administrative Agent including, without limitation, initiating appropriate legal
proceedings and exercising all rights and remedies that may be available to the
Seller under its commercial arrangements with the Approved Obligors, in each
case, in connection with collecting and recovering all amounts owed by any
Approved Obligor with respect to such Purchased Receivable. The Administrative
Agent (on behalf of the Purchasers) agrees to pay the reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses) incurred by each
Seller in connection with the performance by each such Seller of the actions
requested by the Administrative Agent and specified in the immediately preceding
sentence, provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for any costs and/or expenses of any Seller with respect to (i) the
preservation of any rights of, or the exercise of any rights by, the
Administrative Agent under, or the enforcement (whether through legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, this Agreement against any Seller and (ii) actions
necessary for a Seller to perform its representations,



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement (it being
understood that any such costs and expenses shall be for the account of the
Sellers). Without limiting the foregoing, each Seller agrees to devote to the
servicing of Purchased Receivables at least the same amount of time and
attention, and to exercise at least the same level of skill, care and diligence
in such servicing, as if each Seller were servicing Receivables legally and
beneficially owned by it. Each Purchaser shall pay each Seller a Servicing Fee
as consideration for the performance of such obligations as servicer under this
Section 5.1 and this Agreement. On or before each Settlement Date, the
Administrative Agent shall provide to the Seller Representative (on behalf of
each Seller) and each Purchaser, a calculation for the servicing fee (the
“Servicing Fee”) accrued for the related Settlement Period most recently ended.
Such Servicing Fee shall be payable by the Administrative Agent, on behalf of
the Purchasers, on such Settlement Date as provided in Section 2.4. The
Servicing Fee shall be calculated as follows:
Servicing Fee = TOA x Rate X  y/360
Where:

TermDefinition
“TOA”    equals     
Total Outstanding Amount of all Purchased Receivables as of the first day of the
relevant Settlement Period
“Rate”    equals     
0.03% per annum
“Y”     equals
The number of days in the relevant Settlement Period

Section 5.2.    Servicing Covenants. Each Seller covenants and agrees, in
connection with its servicing obligations pursuant to Section 5.1, (i) that the
payment instructions currently in force and provided to each Approved Obligor
specify that each such Approved Obligor shall pay all amounts owing under the
Purchased Receivables to the applicable Existing Account, (ii) not to change
such payment instructions while any Purchased Receivable remains outstanding
without the Administrative Agent’s prior consent, (iii) that it shall keep
accurate books and records with respect to each relevant Seller Account, clearly
identifying the source of all amounts deposited and otherwise held therein, and
(iv) to take any and all other commercially reasonable actions, including such
commercially reasonable actions as may be requested by the Administrative Agent
from time to time, to (a) recover and enforce payment of any defaulted Purchased
Receivable and (b) ensure that all amounts owing under the Purchased Receivables
be deposited by the Approved Obligors exclusively to the applicable Existing
Account or as otherwise instructed by the Administrative Agent. Each Seller
further covenants and agrees (A) that at all times on or prior to the Final
Collection Date, all Collections and other funds received into any Existing
Account will be swept (on a same-day basis) in immediately available funds to
the Collection Account; provided that any amounts credited to any Existing
Account after 2:00 p.m. New York time on any Business Day shall be deemed
received on the next following Business Day, (B) upon receipt into the
Collection Account of any Collections and other funds swept from an Existing
Account, such Seller shall identify and reconcile such funds with its books and
records, (C) not to give instructions to any other Person to pay any amounts
into the Collection Account and (D) to take any and all other commercially
reasonable actions, including commercially reasonable actions as may be
requested by the Administrative Agent from time to time, to ensure that all
Collections will be transferred from the applicable Existing Account to the
Collection Account within such one (1) Business Day period, and that amounts
deposited in or otherwise standing to the credit of the Collection Account will
be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.7. Any payment by an
Approved Obligor of any amount owing under any Purchased Receivable that is not
paid to the applicable Seller Account and is received by the applicable Seller
directly shall be held in trust by such Seller as the Purchasers’ exclusive
property, such funds shall



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



be safeguarded for the benefit of the Purchasers, and such funds shall promptly,
and in any event within two (2) Business Days of receipt thereof, be transferred
by wire transfer to the Collection Account. No Seller shall, directly or
indirectly, utilize such funds for its own purposes, nor shall any Seller have
any right to pledge such funds as collateral for any obligations of any Seller
or any other party. Collections shall not be deemed received by the
Administrative Agent for purposes of this Agreement until credited to the
Administrative Agent’s Account as immediately available funds or otherwise
actually received by the Administrative Agent.
Section 5.3.    Unidentified Collections on Receivables; Return of Collections.
(a)    If any payment is received by a Seller from an Approved Obligor, and such
payment is not identified by such Approved Obligor as relating to a particular
Receivable or Purchased Receivable and cannot otherwise be reasonably identified
as relating to a particular Receivable or Purchased Receivable, such Seller will
first attempt to confer with the Approved Obligor to identify the Receivable(s)
to which such payment should be applied. In the event such Seller is unable to
identify within two (2) Business Days the Receivable(s) to which such payment
should be applied, the Seller Representative and the Administrative Agent will
negotiate in good faith as to the allocation of such payment, and once the
allocation of any such payment has been agreed by the Seller Representative and
the Administrative Agent, such allocated payment shall be considered to be
relating to the particular Receivable or Purchased Receivable agreed upon by the
Seller Representative and the Administrative Agent. To the extent the preceding
sentence results in collections received by a Seller being deemed Collections on
a Purchased Receivable, such Seller shall promptly, and in any event within two
(2) Business Days, deposit such Collections into the Collection Account for
application in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.7.
(b)    If following the application of any funds in the Collection Account which
is deemed to be Collections on a Purchased Receivable pursuant to this Section,
such payment is identified by the applicable Seller to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Administrative Agent as being payment on a Receivable which
is not a Purchased Receivable, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly, and
in any event within one (1) Business Day of such identification, repay such
amount to the applicable Seller, in immediately available funds, by deposit to
the Remittance Account for the benefit of such Seller.
Section 5.4.    Past Due Receivables. In the event a Purchased Receivable that
is a Billed Receivable has not been paid in full by the date that is thirty (30)
days after the Maturity Date therefor (an “Overdue Receivable”), the applicable
Seller shall determine the cause of such payment delay or non-payment, including
whether it is due to a Dispute, and the applicable Seller shall deliver to the
Administrative Agent and each Purchaser by no later than the third (3rd)
Business Day following such thirty (30) day period, a certification and report
(a “Non-Payment Report”) identifying the Overdue Receivable and the Approved
Obligor thereof and describing in reasonable detail the cause of such
non-payment, including whether a Dispute exists with respect to such Overdue
Receivable, or certifying that such cause is unknown. In the event that a
Purchased Receivable that was sold hereunder has not been paid in full by the
date that is sixty (60) days after the Maturity Date therefor and no Non-Payment
Report with respect thereto has been delivered or the Non-Payment Report
delivered with respect thereto does not report a Dispute or states that the
cause of such payment delay or non-payment is unknown (a “Non-Payment Event”),
the Administrative Agent may in its sole discretion (a) contact such Approved
Obligor by phone or in person to discuss the status of such Overdue Receivable
and to inquire whether such payment delay or non-payment is due to a Dispute and
when payment can be expected and/or (b) take any other lawful action to collect
such Purchased Receivable directly from such Approved Obligor and/or (c) without
limitation on any rights of the Administrative Agent under Section 4.3 and
elsewhere in this



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Agreement, require that the applicable Seller take any action reasonably
requested by the Administrative Agent in order to make the sale, assignment and
transfer of any Overdue Receivable compliant with FACA and/or (d) terminate the
appointment of the applicable Seller as its servicer and agent solely for the
purposes of servicing such Purchased Receivable. If the Approved Obligor advises
the Administrative Agent and the Purchasers of the existence of a Dispute, the
Administrative Agent shall advise the applicable Seller of such Overdue
Receivable that the Approved Obligor has asserted a Dispute.
Section 5.5.    Termination of Appointment. Upon the occurrence of any Servicer
Replacement Event, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, or shall at
the election of the Required Purchasers (i) take any lawful action to collect
any Purchased Receivable purchased from such Seller directly from the respective
Approved Obligors, and/or (ii) terminate the appointment of such Seller as its
servicer and agent for the servicing of the Purchased Receivables, and/or (iii)
take any steps required to obtain or exercise exclusive control over any Seller
Account related to such Seller (including the delivery of a “notice of exclusive
control” (howsoever defined) to the relevant depository bank). In addition, (1)
if any Approved Obligor becomes insolvent or is unable to pay its debts or fails
or admits in writing its inability generally to pay its debts as they become
due, the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, or shall at the election
of the Required Purchasers (i) take any lawful action to collect any Purchased
Receivable directly from such Approved Obligor, and/or (ii) terminate the
applicable Seller as its servicer and agent solely for the purpose of servicing
of the Purchased Receivables of such Approved Obligor and (2) upon the
occurrence of a Non-Payment Event, the Administrative Agent may, in its
discretion, or shall at the election of the Required Purchasers (i) take any
lawful action to collect the relevant Purchased Receivables subject to such
Non-Payment Event directly from such Approved Obligor, and/or (ii) terminate the
applicable Seller as its servicer and agent solely for the purpose of servicing
of the Purchased Receivables subject to such Non-Payment Event. In the event of
any termination of any Seller as servicer with respect to any Purchased
Receivable, (A) each Seller agrees to take action reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent in order to make the sale, assignment and transfer of the
applicable Purchased Receivables compliant with FACA and to provide the
Administrative Agent with all underlying documentation that the Administrative
Agent may reasonably require in order to enable the Administrative Agent to
enforce the payment obligation of any Approved Obligor with respect to a
Purchased Receivable, (B) the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be
obligated to, notify each applicable Approved Obligor of the transfers hereunder
and direct each applicable Approved Obligor to make payments as the
Administrative Agent may elect or desire, and (C) no Seller shall interfere with
such servicing or collection of such Purchased Receivable or attempt to receive
or make collection from any Approved Obligor in respect of such Purchased
Receivable. In addition, each Seller hereby grants to the Administrative Agent
an irrevocable power of attorney (coupled with an interest) authorizing and
permitting the Administrative Agent, at its option, with or without notice to
any Seller, to do any one of the following that are necessary, in the
determination of the Administrative Agent, to collect amounts due with respect
to any Purchased Receivable and to otherwise direct any one or more Approved
Obligors to make payment directly to an account of the Administrative Agent at
any time following a Non-Payment Event or a Servicer Replacement Event: (I)
endorsing the name of such Seller upon any check or other instrument, document
or agreement with respect to any Purchased Receivable; (II) endorsing the name
of such Seller on any freight or express bill or bill of lading relating to any
Purchased Receivable; (III) deliver and execute any documents and provide any
information, in each case, as may be required in order to make the sale,
assignment and transfer of any Purchased Receivables compliant with FACA; (IV)
take any lawful action to enforce and otherwise collect any Purchased Receivable
directly from such Approved Obligor; and (V) taking all action as the
Administrative Agent deems appropriate in connection with the foregoing. Each
Seller agrees that the Administrative Agent will not be liable for any acts of
commission or omission or for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or Law in
connection with the exercise of such power of attorney except to the extent the
same constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of the Administration Fee and Unused Fee, to the Administrative Agent from

shall be paid directly by the Seller Representative or the applicable Seller
from its general funds by deposit into the Administrative Agent’s Account. Upon
payment in full of the Payment Amount and the Administration Fee and the Unused

withdraw any and all Collections remaining in the Collection Account on such
Settlement Date (other than any Collections that are transferred from an
Existing Account to the Collection Account on such Settlement Date) for its own
account; and



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



    (ii)    if the Payment Amount is positive, then the amount thereof will be
payable by the Administrative Agent (on behalf the Purchasers) to the Seller
Representative (for further distribution to the applicable Seller); furthermore,
if the Payment Amount is positive the Seller Representative or any applicable

its own account.
(b)    Application of Collections. On each Termination Settlement Date, the
Seller Representative or any applicable Seller shall apply Collections held in
the Collection Account in accordance with the following procedure: the Seller
Representative or any applicable Seller will pay the Termination Payment Amount

such Purchaser’s Asset Interests. The Administrative Agent may, at its
discretion from time to time, setoff from Collections payable to the Purchasers

Purchaser’s share of the Payment Amount due and payable hereunder from time to
time and other applicable obligations due to the Administrative Agent from such
Purchaser. The Administrative Agent shall hold all Collections received by the
Administrative Agent in trust for the Purchasers until paid by the
Administrative Agent to the Purchasers. Any amounts payable by the
Administrative Agent under this Section 5.7(c) shall be paid on the same day
that the corresponding amounts are received by the Administrative Agent into the
Administrative Agent’s Account, provided that if such amounts are received by
the Administrative Agent after 3:00 p.m. on a Business Day, or if they are
otherwise received on a day that is not a Business Day, then the corresponding

the Administrative Agent in respect of any Collection is rescinded or must
otherwise be returned by the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent
has already paid to a Purchaser its share of such payment pursuant to this
Agreement, such Purchaser will, upon notice from the Administrative Agent,
promptly pay to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such Purchaser’s
share of the amount so rescinded or returned, together with interest thereon at
the overnight rate for Federal funds transactions between member banks of the
Federal Reserve System, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



York for each day from and including the making of the payment to such
Purchaser, to but excluding the date of said payment to the Administrative
Agent, plus its pro rata share of any penalty or similar such amount, if any, as
is required to be paid by the Administrative Agent with respect to such
rescinded or returned payment; provided that such Purchaser shall not be
obligated to pay any portion of any penalty or similar such amount to the extent
that such rescinded or returned payment resulted from the gross negligence or
the willful misconduct of the Administrative Agent. For the avoidance of doubt,
any amounts that are returned pursuant to this provision will continue to be

Section 6.1.    Servicing Reports. The Seller Representative shall be
responsible for submitting a Servicing Report via the PrimeRevenue System to the
Administrative Agent on each Reconciliation Date and on the Termination Date;
provided, however, and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the
PrimeRevenue System is not operational or is otherwise offline on any
Reconciliation Date or on the Termination Date, then for such Reconciliation

Section 6.3.    Reconciliation Prior to the Termination Date. If, at any time
prior to the Termination Date, the Total Outstanding Amount is greater than the
Maximum Funded Amount, then the following procedure will be used by the Seller
Representative for purposes of determining which Eligible Receivables constitute
Purchased Receivables: first, all Eligible Receivables that were Purchased
Receivables as of the immediately preceding Reconciliation Date, and that remain
outstanding, shall be designated as Purchased Receivables (including, for the
sake of clarity, any Eligible Unbilled Receivables that were Purchased
Receivables as of the immediately preceding Reconciliation Date and that have
subsequently been converted into Billed Receivables), and second, new Billed
Receivables arising after the immediately preceding Reconciliation Date shall be
designated as Purchased Receivables based on Maturity Date (designating the
Billed Receivable with the closest Maturity Date as a Purchased Receivable, then
designating the Billed Receivable with the second closest Maturity Date as a
Purchased Receivable, and continuing in the same manner until either all new
Billed Receivables have been designated as Purchased Receivables or the
designation of the next following Billed Receivable as a Purchased Receivable
would result in the aggregate outstanding Net Face Value of all Purchased
Receivables exceeding the Maximum Funded Amount).    
Section 6.4.    Reconciliation Following the Termination Date. If, as of the
Termination Date, the Total Outstanding Amount is greater than the Funded
Amount, then the following procedure will be used by the Seller Representative
for purposes of determining which Eligible Receivables constitute Purchased
Receivables: first, all Eligible Receivables that were Purchased Receivables as
of the immediately preceding Reconciliation Date, and that remain outstanding,
shall be designated as Purchased Receivables (including, for the sake of
clarity, any Eligible Unbilled Receivables that were Purchased Receivables as of
the immediately preceding Reconciliation Date and that have subsequently been
converted into Billed Receivables), and second, new Billed Receivables arising
after the immediately preceding Reconciliation Date shall be designated as
Purchased Receivables based on Maturity Date (designating the Billed Receivable
with the closest Maturity Date as a Purchased Receivable, then designating the
Billed



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Receivable with the second closest Maturity Date as a Purchased Receivable, and
continuing in the same manner until either all new Billed Receivables have been
designated as Purchased Receivables or the designation of the next following
Billed Receivable as a Purchased Receivable would result in the aggregate
outstanding Net Face Value of all Purchased Receivables exceeding the Funded
Amount).
SECTION 7.OTHER INFORMATION; THE SELLERS’ BOOKS AND RECORDS; INSPECTION; THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT’S RECORDS.
Section 7.1.    Other Information. Each Seller will provide the Administrative
Agent and the Purchasers with such other reports, information, documents, books

convenient to such Seller during regular business hours and upon reasonable
prior notice, permit the Administrative Agent or any of its agents or

permit the Administrative Agent to take such copies and extracts from the Sales
Records and to provide the Administrative Agent with copies or originals (as
required by the Administrative Agent) of the Invoices relating to Purchased
Receivables as it may require and generally allow the Administrative Agent to

visit the offices and properties of each Seller for the purpose of examining
such records and to discuss matters relating to Purchased Receivables or each
Seller’s performance hereunder with any of the officers or employees of each
Seller having knowledge of such matters; and (b) without limiting the provisions
of clause (a), from time to time on request of the Administrative Agent and upon
reasonable prior notice and subject to the Seller Representative receiving
acceptable confidentiality undertakings thereof, permit certified public
accountants or other auditors acceptable to the Administrative Agent to conduct,
at the applicable Seller’s expense, a review of each Seller’s books and records

approvals required to carry on its business as now conducted and (ii) is
qualified to do business in every jurisdiction where the nature of its business
requires it to be so qualified, except, with respect to clause (ii), to the
extent that failure to so qualify would not reasonably be expected to have a

therewith, do not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state
a material fact (known to such Seller in the case of any documents, certificates
or written statements not prepared by it) necessary in order to make the
statements contained therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under
which the same were made.
(e)    Neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement, the other
Purchase Documents or any of the other documents related hereto or thereto, nor

any Laws, (ii) any indenture, loan agreement, security agreement, instrument or
other material agreement binding upon such Seller or any of its properties, or
(iii) any provision of such Seller’s organizational documents which could, in
the case of clause (ii) only, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.
(f)    No authorization, consent or approval or other action by, and no notice
to or filing (other than the UCC financing statements required to be filed
hereunder) with, any Governmental Authority is required to be obtained or made
by such Seller for the due execution, delivery and performance by it of this

Administrative Agent’s or any Purchaser’s ownership interest in the Purchased
Receivables) or the ability of such Seller to perform its obligations hereunder.
(i)    No effective financing statement or other instrument similar in effect
covering any Purchased Receivable is on file in any recording office, except

absolutely assigned, transferred and sold to the Administrative Agent and the
Administrative Agent shall acquire a legally valid ownership interest in such
Purchased Receivable, free and clear of any Adverse Claim without any need on

respect to any Purchased Receivable shall be calculated as follows:
RP = PP + AD + AI + AO, in which:



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




TermDefinition
“RP”    equals
Repurchase Price for such Purchased Receivable as of the applicable Repurchase
Date
“PP”     equals
The aggregate Purchase Price for such Purchased Receivable, net of any
Collections received by the Administrative Agent with respect to such Purchased
Receivable
“AD”     equals
The Purchase Discount applicable to such Receivable and accrued for the period
from the applicable Purchase Date to the applicable Repurchase Date; provided
that AD shall only apply in the case of a Receivable purchased at its Discounted
Purchase Price
“AI” equals
Interest on the total amount payable by the Approved Obligor with respect to
such Receivable, calculated at a rate equal to the LIBOR for the period from the
last day of the applicable Discount Period to the applicable Repurchase Date
plus the Applicable Margin; provided that the AI shall only apply if the
Repurchase Date occurs after the last day of the applicable Discount Period
“AO”     equals
All other amounts then payable (including, to the extent not included in PP, the
full amount of the Aggregate Unreimbursed Purchase Discount corresponding to
such Receivable) by the applicable Seller under the Purchase Documents with
respect to such Purchased Receivable as of such Repurchase Date

    
Section 11.2.    Repurchase. Upon the occurrence of a Repurchase Event with
respect to any Purchased Receivable, the Administrative Agent may, upon written

SECTION 12.TAXES, ETC.
Section 12.1.    Taxes. All payments to be made by any Seller under this
Agreement shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for or on
account of all Taxes, except to the extent required by applicable law. All Taxes
required to be deducted or withheld from any amounts paid or payable by a Seller
under this Agreement, if any, shall be paid by such Seller to the applicable
Governmental Authority within the time allowed under the relevant law. In
addition, if any Taxes or amounts in respect of Taxes must be deducted from any
amounts payable by a Seller under this Agreement and such Tax is an Indemnified
Tax, such Seller shall pay such additional amounts as may be necessary to ensure
that the Administrative Agent and the Purchasers receive a net amount equal to
the full amount which the Administrative Agent and the Purchasers would have
received had payment not been made subject to deduction of Tax by such Seller.
Within thirty (30) days of each payment to the relevant Governmental Authority
by a Seller under this Section 12.1 of Tax or in respect of Taxes, such Seller
shall deliver to the



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Administrative Agent and the Purchasers if the same is available an original
receipt, certified copy or other appropriate evidence issued by the Governmental
Authority to whom the payment was made that the Tax has been duly remitted to
the appropriate authority. If the Administrative Agent or any Purchaser
determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received
a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been paid additional amounts pursuant
to this Section 12.1, such Person shall pay to the applicable Seller an amount
equal to such refund (but only to the extent of additional amounts made under
this Section 12.1 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of such Person and without interest (other
than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to
such refund); provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement shall
interfere with the right of the Administrative Agent and each Purchaser to
arrange its Tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit and, in particular,
none of the Administrative Agent or any Purchaser shall be under any obligation
to claim credit, relief, remission, repayment or other benefit from or against
its corporate profits or similar Tax liability in respect of the amount of any
deduction in priority to any other claims, reliefs, credits or deductions
available to it, nor shall any Seller be entitled to make any enquiries of the
Administrative Agent or any Purchaser in relation to such Person’s Tax affairs.
The Administrative Agent and each Purchaser shall (if and to the extent that it
is entitled to do so under applicable law) submit in duplicate to the Seller
Representative prior to the date of the first payment by any Seller to the
Administrative Agent or such Purchaser, as applicable, duly completed and signed
copies appropriate Internal Revenue Service forms claiming complete or partial
exemption from withholding on all amounts (to which such withholding would
otherwise apply) to be received by the Administrative Agent or such Purchaser,
as applicable, including fees, from such Seller pursuant to this Agreement. In
addition and from time to time the Administrative Agent and each Purchaser shall
(if and to the extent that it is entitled to do so under applicable law) submit
to the Seller Representative such additional duly completed and signed copies of
one or the other of such forms (or such successor forms as shall be adopted from
time to time by the relevant United States taxation authorities) and any
additional information as may be required under then current United States Law,
regulations or any income tax treaty to which the United States is a party to
claim the inapplicability of, or exemption or partial exemption from, United
States withholding (including backup withholding) taxes on payments in respect
of all amounts (to which such withholding would otherwise apply) to be received
by the Administrative Agent or such Purchaser including fees, from such Seller
pursuant to this Agreement. The Administrative Agent and each Purchaser agree
that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes
obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or
certification or promptly notify the Seller Representative in writing of its
legal inability to do so.
Section 12.2.    Duties and Taxes. All stamp, documentary, registration or other
like duties or Taxes (excluding Excluded Taxes and any Taxes that are the
subject of Section 12.1), including Taxes and any penalties, additions, fines,
surcharges or interest relating thereto, or any notarial fees which are imposed
or chargeable on or in connection with this Agreement or any other Purchase
Document or any other document executed pursuant hereto or thereto shall be paid
by each of the Sellers, it being understood and agreed that the Administrative
Agent and each Purchaser shall be entitled but not obligated to pay any such
duties or Taxes (whether or not they are its primary responsibility), and each
of the Sellers shall on demand indemnify the Administrative Agent or such
Purchaser, as applicable, against those duties or Taxes and against any
reasonable costs and expenses so incurred by it in discharging them. Without
prejudice to the survival of any other provision hereof, the terms of this
Section 12.2 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and payment of all
other amounts payable hereunder.

misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible to any Purchaser
or other Person for (i) any recitals, representations, warranties or other

any Purchaser to ascertain or inquire about the observance or performance of any
agreement contained in any Purchase Document or to inspect the properties, books
or records of any Seller or any of its Affiliates.

conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed,
sent or made by the proper Person and upon advice and statements of legal
counsel (including counsel to the Seller), independent accountants and other
experts selected by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent shall in
all cases be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under any
Purchase Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Required Purchasers, and assurance of its indemnification, as it deems
appropriate.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(b)    The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting,
or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement in accordance with a request
of the Purchasers, and such request and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all Purchasers and the Administrative
Agent.
Section 13.5.    Actions by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
shall take such actions, or refrain from taking such actions, under each of the
Purchase Documents with respect to the rights and remedies of the Purchasers,
including with respect to any Purchased Receivable, in each case as may be
directed by the Required Purchasers; provided, that until the Administrative
Agent receives such directions, the Administrative Agent may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action, as
Administrative Agent deems advisable and in the best interests of the
Purchasers.
Section 13.6.    Non-Reliance on the Administrative Agent and Other Purchasers.
Each Purchaser expressly acknowledges that none of the Administrative Agent or
any of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or
Affiliates has made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by
the Administrative Agent hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of
any Seller, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by the
Administrative Agent. Each Purchaser represents and warrants to the
Administrative Agent that, independently and without reliance upon the
Administrative Agent or any other Purchaser and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, it has made and will continue to make
its own appraisal of an investigation into the business, operations, property,
prospects, financial and other conditions and creditworthiness of each Seller
and the Purchased Receivables and its own decision to enter into this Agreement
and to take, or omit, action under any Purchase Document. Except for items
specifically required to be delivered hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall
not have any duty or responsibility to provide any Purchaser with any
information concerning a Seller or any of its Affiliates that comes into the
possession of the Administrative Agent or any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.
Section 13.7.    Administrative Agent and Affiliates. Each of the Purchasers and
the Administrative Agent and their respective Affiliates may extend credit to,
accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, debt,
entity or other business with any Seller or any of its Affiliates and MUFG Bank
may exercise or refrain from exercising its rights and powers as if it were not
the Administrative Agent. With respect to the purchase of Asset Interests in
Receivables pursuant to this Agreement, the Administrative Agent, in its
capacity as a Purchaser, shall have the same rights and powers under this
Agreement as any other Purchaser and may exercise the same as though it were not
such an agent, and the terms “Purchaser” and “Purchasers” shall include the
Administrative Agent in its capacity as a Purchaser.
Section 13.8.    Successor Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent may,
upon at least twenty (20) days’ notice to each Seller and each Purchaser, resign
as Administrative Agent. If the Person serving as Administrative Agent is
subject to an Insolvency Event, the Purchasers (excluding the Purchaser that is
also the Administrative Agent at such time, if applicable) may, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, by notice in writing to each Seller and such Person
remove such Person as Administrative Agent. Any resignation or removal, as the
case may be, shall not become effective until a successor agent is appointed by
the Purchasers (excluding the Purchaser that is also the Administrative Agent at
such time, if applicable), but with the consent of each Seller (provided, such
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), and has
accepted such appointment. Upon such acceptance of its appointment as
Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such
successor Administrative Agent shall succeed to and become vested with all the
rights and duties of the retiring or removed, as applicable, Administrative
Agent, and the retiring or removed, as applicable, Administrative Agent shall be
discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent under



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



the Purchase Documents. After any retiring or removed, as applicable,
Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal, as applicable, hereunder, the
provisions of Sections 13 and 14 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent.
Section 13.9.    Reimbursement by the Purchasers. Each Purchaser will reimburse
the Administrative Agent, to the extent that the Administrative Agent is not
reimbursed by the Sellers pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, its Pro Rata
Share of any and all reasonable costs and expenses (including without
limitation, reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Administrative
Agent in connection with the protection or enforcement of its rights under or in
connection with this Agreement and the other Purchase Documents.
SECTION 14.MISCELLANEOUS.
Section 14.1.    Indemnity. Except with respect to Taxes (which is governed by
Section 12 above), each Seller agrees to indemnify, defend and save harmless the
Administrative Agent (including each of its branches), each Purchaser (including
each of its branches), each Participant, any liquidity or credit enhancement
provider of any Purchaser or Participant and each of their Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees or other agents (each, an “Indemnified Party”), forthwith
on demand, from and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs (including
interest), expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever
(including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for each Indemnified
Party in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial
proceeding or hearing commenced or threatened by any Person, regardless of
whether any such Indemnified Party shall be designated as a party or a potential
party thereto, and any fees or expenses incurred by each Indemnified Party in
enforcing this indemnity), whether direct, indirect, special or consequential
and whether based on any federal, state or foreign Laws, on common law or
equitable cause or on contract or otherwise, that may be imposed on, incurred
by, or asserted against any such Indemnified Party, in any manner relating to or
arising out of or incurred in connection with this Agreement, the other Purchase
Documents, any Purchased Receivable or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including, without limitation, with respect to (y) any
representation or warranty or statement made or deemed made by a Seller under or
in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Purchase Documents which
shall have been incorrect as of the date when made or the occurrence of a
Dispute or any failure of a Seller to comply with its covenants and other
agreements contained in this Agreement or any other Purchase Document and (z)
any Retained Obligations of a Seller (the “Indemnified Liabilities”); provided,
no Seller shall have any obligation to any Indemnified Party hereunder with
respect to (i) any Indemnified Liabilities to the extent such Indemnified
Liabilities arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that
Indemnified Party, in each case, as determined by a final, non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, (ii) any non-payment of any
Purchased Receivable except to the extent that such non-payment is caused by or
is otherwise attributable to any event, circumstance or condition that gives
rise to the occurrence of a Repurchase Event and (iii) any Indemnified
Liabilities to the extent that such Indemnified Liabilities are otherwise
payable by the Administrative Agent or a Purchaser under Section 5.1. Without
prejudice to the survival of any other provision hereof, the terms of this
Section 14.1 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and payment of all
other amounts payable hereunder.
Section 14.2.    Expenses. Each of the Sellers agree to pay promptly on demand
(a) all actual and reasonable costs and expenses (including due diligence
expenses) incurred by the Administrative Agent in connection with (i) the
negotiation, preparation and execution of the Purchase Documents (including this
Agreement) and (ii) any consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications
thereto and the transactions contemplated thereby, including, in either case and
without limitation, the reasonable fees,



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



expenses and disbursements of counsel to the Administrative Agent in connection
therewith; and (b) all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees
and costs of settlement, incurred by the Administrative Agent or any Purchaser
in enforcing any obligations of any of the Sellers under any Purchase Document
or in collecting any payments due from any Seller hereunder or under the other
Purchase Documents or in connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the
purchase arrangements provided hereunder in the nature of a “work-out” or
pursuant to any insolvency or bankruptcy cases or proceedings. Without prejudice
to the survival of any other provision hereof, the terms of this Section 14.2
shall survive the termination of this Agreement and payment of all other amounts
payable hereunder.
Section 14.3.    Setoff. In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted
under applicable Law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, the
Administrative Agent and each Purchaser is hereby authorized by each Seller at
any time or from time to time, without notice to any Seller or to any other
Person, any such notice being hereby expressly waived, to set off and to
appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or special, including
indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured,
but not including trust accounts) and any other indebtedness at any time held or
owing by the Administrative Agent or such Purchaser to or for the credit or the
account of any Seller against and on account of the obligations and liabilities
of such Seller to the Administrative Agent or such Purchaser hereunder and under
the other Purchase Documents, including all claims of any nature or description
arising out of or connected hereto or with any other Purchase Document,
irrespective of whether or not (a) the Administrative Agent or such Purchaser
shall have made any demand hereunder or (b) any amounts payable hereunder shall
have become due and payable pursuant hereto and although such obligations and
liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or unmatured; provided that the
Administrative Agent or such Purchaser may only exercise its right of setoff in
this Section 14.3 if a Facility Suspension Event has occurred and is continuing
with respect to such Seller.
Section 14.4.    Notices, Addresses. All notices, requests and demands given or
made under the Purchase Documents shall be given or made in writing and unless
otherwise stated shall be made by email or letter using the address as specified

Section 14.5.    Certificates and Determinations. Any certification or
determination by the Administrative Agent or any Purchaser of a rate or amount
under any Purchase Document shall be, absent manifest error, conclusive evidence
of the matters to which it relates.
Section 14.6.    Assignments and Transfers.
(a)    The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, except that no Seller may



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without
the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and each Purchaser, and no
Purchaser may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder except (i) to an assignee in accordance with the provisions of clause
(b) of this Section, (ii) by way of participation in accordance with the
provisions of clause (d) of this Section, or (iii) by way of pledge or
assignment of a security interest subject to the restrictions of clause (e) of
this Section (and any other attempted assignment or transfer by any party hereto
shall be null and void).
(b)    Any Purchaser may at any time assign to one or more assignees all or a
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a
portion of its Commitment and its interest in Purchased Receivables); provided
that:
    (i)     after such assignment no Purchaser has a Commitment of less than
$50,000,000;
    (ii)     if such assignment is a partial assignment, it is an assignment of
a proportionate part of all the assigning Purchaser’s rights and obligations
under this Agreement with respect to the Purchaser’s interest in Purchased
Receivables or the Commitment assigned;
    (iii)     such assignment has been approved by the Administrative Agent
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless such assignment
is to another Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof;
    (iv)    the parties to such assignment shall have executed and delivered to
the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a
processing and recordation fee of $5,000; provided that the Administrative Agent
may, in its sole discretion, elect to waive such processing and recordation fee
in the case of any assignment; and
    (v)    such assignee is not (A) a Seller or any Affiliate or Subsidiary
thereof, (B) a natural Person (or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust
for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person) or (C)
an Ineligible Assignee or a Defaulting Purchaser.
Subject to acceptance and recording thereof by the Administrative Agent pursuant
to clause (c) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified in
each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party to this
Agreement and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Purchaser under this Agreement,
and the assigning Purchaser thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering
all of the assigning Purchaser’s rights and obligations under this Agreement,
such Purchaser shall cease to be a party hereto) but shall continue to be
entitled to the benefits of Sections 14.1 and 14.2 with respect to facts and
circumstances occurring prior to the effective date of such assignment. Any
assignment or transfer by a Purchaser of rights or obligations under this
Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes
of this Agreement as a sale by such Purchaser of a participation in such rights
and obligations in accordance with clause (d) of this Section.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



(c)    The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of
the Sellers, shall maintain at one of its offices in New York City a copy of
each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Purchasers, and the Commitments of
each Purchaser, and each Purchaser’s interests in the Purchased Receivables
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “Register”). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Sellers, the
Administrative Agent and the Purchasers shall treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Purchaser hereunder
for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be available for
inspection by any Seller and any Purchaser, at any reasonable time and from time
to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d)    Any Purchaser may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, any
Seller or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other
than a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or
owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person, or any Seller
or any Seller’s Affiliates or Subsidiaries or an Ineligible Assignee) (each, a
“Participant”) in all or a portion of such Purchaser’s rights and/or obligations
under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or such
Purchaser’s interests in Purchased Receivables); provided that (i) such
Purchaser’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Purchaser shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the
performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Sellers, the Administrative Agent
and the other Purchasers shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Purchaser in connection with such Purchaser’s rights and obligations under this
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Purchaser shall be responsible for
the indemnity under Section 13.9 with respect to any payments made by such
Purchaser to its Participant(s).
Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Purchaser sells such a
participation shall provide that such Purchaser shall retain the sole right to
enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of
any provision of this Agreement; provided that such agreement or instrument may
provide that such Purchaser will not, without the consent of the Participant,
agree to any amendment, modification or waiver of the type described in the
proviso to Section 14.8 without the consent of each Participant. Each
Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 3.3, 12.1 and 12.2
(subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements
under Section 12.1 (it being understood that the documentation required under
Section 12.1 shall be delivered to the participating Purchaser)) to the same
extent as if it were a Purchaser and had acquired its interest by assignment
pursuant to clause (b) of this Section; provided that such Participant shall not
be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 12.1 or 12.2, with
respect to any participation, than its participating Purchaser would have been
entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater
payment results from a change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired
the applicable participation. To the extent permitted by Law, each Participant
also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 14.3 as though it were a
Purchaser; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 3.4 as
though it were a Purchaser. Each Purchaser that sells a participation shall,
acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Sellers, maintain
a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and each
Participant’s interest in the Purchased Receivables or other obligations under
the Purchase Documents (the “Participant Register”); provided that no Purchaser
shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant
Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating
to a Participant’s interest in the Purchased Receivables or its other
obligations under any Purchase Document) to any Person except to the extent that
such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment or other
obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States
Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be
conclusive absent manifest error, and such Purchaser shall treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such
participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to
the contrary.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as
Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant
Register.
(e)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any Purchaser may assign
or pledge a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this
Agreement to secure obligations of such Purchaser, including any pledge or
assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank or any other central
bank. No such assignment and/or pledge shall release any Purchaser from its
obligations hereunder.
Section 14.7.    No Waivers, Remedies Cumulative. No failure to exercise, nor
any delay in exercising, on the part of the Administrative Agent or any
Purchaser, any right or remedy under the Purchase Documents shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or remedy
prevent any further or other exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right
or remedy. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.
Section 14.8.    Amendment. No waiver, alteration, modification, amendment or
termination hereof or of any of the provisions hereof shall be binding unless
made in writing and duly executed by each Seller, the Administrative Agent and
the Required Purchasers; provided that no such waiver, alteration, modification,
amendment or termination shall, without the consent of all Purchasers: (i)
increase or extend the Commitment of any Purchaser, (ii) alter the definition of
the term Pro Rata Share or Asset Interest, (iii) extend the maturity of any
Purchased Receivable or reduce any fee payable by any Seller to the Purchasers,
(iv) alter the definition of the term Required Purchasers or alter, amend or
modify this Section 14.8, (v) alter the term Purchase Price or is component
parts, (vi) release any Seller or other Person from its obligations under this
Agreement or any other Purchase Document (including the Parent Guaranty), (vii)
release the general security interest granted herein to the Administrative
Agent, for the benefit of the Purchasers, in the Purchased Receivables (unless
such release relates to a sale or other disposition of assets permitted under
the terms of this Agreement) or (viii) release or terminate any Account Control
Agreement; provided that the Administrative Agent may amend, alter or modify any
fee letter executed in connection with this Agreement without consent of the
other Purchasers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Defaulting
Purchaser shall have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or
consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms
requires the consent of all Purchaser or each affected Purchaser may be effected
with the consent of the applicable Purchasers other than Defaulting Purchasers),
except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Purchaser may not be increased
or extended without the consent of such Purchaser and (y) any waiver, amendment
or modification requiring the consent of all Purchasers or each affected
Purchaser that by its terms affects any Defaulting Purchaser disproportionately
adversely relative to other affected Purchasers shall require the consent of
such Defaulting Purchaser.
Section 14.9.    Accounting Treatment; Non-Reliance. Each Seller agrees and
acknowledges that (i) it is a sophisticated party in relation to this Agreement;
(ii) it has made its own independent decision to enter into the Agreement, the
other Purchase Documents to which it is a party and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and, in connection therewith, has obtained such
independent accounting, legal, Tax, financial and other advice as it deems
necessary and appropriate (including, without limitation, as to the appropriate
treatment of such transactions for accounting, legal, Tax and other purposes)
and (iii) it has not relied upon any representation or advice from the
Administrative Agent, any Purchaser, any of their Affiliates or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, counsel, advisors or
other representatives in this regard.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Section 14.10.    Third Party Rights. Other than as specifically provided in
this Agreement, no Person not a party to this Agreement shall be deemed a third
party beneficiary hereof, provided that each Participant is an intended third
party beneficiary of, and entitled to rely on, Section 14.1.
Section 14.11.    Counterparts. Each Purchase Document may be executed in any
number of counterparts, and by the different parties thereto on separate
counterparts; each such counterpart shall be deemed an original and all of such
counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
instrument. A facsimile or electronic copy of an executed counterpart of this
Agreement shall be effective as an original for all purposes.
Section 14.12.    Entire Agreement. The Purchase Documents constitute the entire
agreement between the parties hereto in relation to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and supersede all previous proposals, agreements and other
written and oral communications in relation thereto.
Section 14.13.    Exclusion of Liability. To the extent permitted by applicable
Law, no Seller shall assert, and each Seller hereby waives, any claim against
the Administrative Agent, the Purchaser and their Affiliates, members of the
board of directors, employees, attorneys, agents or sub-agents, on any theory of
liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed
to direct or actual damages) (whether or not the claim therefor is based on
contract, tort or duty imposed by any applicable legal requirement) arising out
of, in connection with, as a result of, or in any way related to, this Agreement
or any other Purchase Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated
hereby or thereby or referred to herein or therein, the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, any purchase or the use of the proceeds thereof
or any act or omission or event occurring in connection therewith, and each
Seller hereby waives, releases and agrees not to sue upon any such claim or any
such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to
exist in its favor.
Section 14.14.    Invalidity. If at any time any provision of the Purchase
Documents shall be adjudged by any court or other competent tribunal to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the validity, legality, and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof shall not in any way be affected or impaired,
and the parties hereto will use their best efforts to revise the invalid
provision so as to render it enforceable in accordance with the intention
expressed in this Agreement.
Section 14.15.    Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York without regard to
the principles of conflicts of law thereof (other than Sections 5-1401 and
5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law).
Section 14.16.    Consent to Jurisdiction. Any litigation based hereon, or
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Purchase
Document, shall be brought and maintained in the courts of the State of New York
sitting in New York County, New York or in the United States district court for
the Southern District of New York; provided, any suit seeking enforcement
against any Receivables or other property may be brought, at the Administrative
Agent’s option, in the courts of any jurisdiction where such Receivables or
other property may be found. Each Seller hereby expressly and irrevocably
submits to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York sitting in
New York County, New York and of the United States district court for the
Southern District of New York for the purpose of any such litigation. Each
Seller further irrevocably consents to the service of process by registered
mail, postage prepaid, to the address specified in Section 14.4 or by personal
service within or without the State of New York. Each Seller expressly and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any such litigation
brought in any such court and any claim that any such litigation has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Section 14.17.    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH SELLER, THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
AND EACH PURCHASER HEREBY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR
PROCEEDING TO ENFORCE OR DEFEND ANY RIGHTS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER
PURCHASE DOCUMENT OR ANY APPLICATION, INSTRUMENT, DOCUMENT, AMENDMENT OR
AGREEMENT DELIVERED OR WHICH MAY IN THE FUTURE BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION
HEREWITH OR THEREWITH OR ARISING FROM ANY BANKING RELATIONSHIP EXISTING IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER PURCHASE DOCUMENTS, AND AGREES THAT
ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING SHALL BE TRIED BEFORE A COURT AND NOT BEFORE A
JURY.
Section 14.18.    USA PATRIOT Act. The Administrative Agent hereby notifies each
Seller that pursuant to the requirements of the USA PATRIOT Act, Title III of
Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001), as amended from time to time
(the “PATRIOT Act”), it and each Purchaser is required to obtain, verify, and
record information that identifies each Seller, which information includes the
name and address of each Seller and other information that will allow it and
such Purchaser to identify each Seller in accordance with the PATRIOT Act.
Section 14.19.    Confidentiality. Each party hereto agrees to hold the Purchase
Documents, the transactions contemplated thereby and all non-public information
received by it in connection therewith from any other party hereto or its agents
or representatives in confidence and agrees not to provide any Person with
copies of this Agreement or such non-public information other than to (a) its
Affiliates and any officers, directors, members, managers, employees or outside
accountants, auditors or attorneys of such party or its Affiliates, (b) any
prospective or actual assignee or Participant which (in each case) has signed a
confidentiality agreement containing provisions substantively identical to this
Section 14.19 or has agreed to be subject to the terms of this Section 14.19,
(c) credit support providers if they agree to hold it confidential pursuant to
customary commercial terms, (d) Governmental Authorities with appropriate
jurisdiction (including filings required under securities Laws) and (e)
appropriate filings under the UCC. Notwithstanding the above stated obligations,
the parties hereto will not be liable for disclosure or use of such information
which: (i) was required by Law, including pursuant to a valid subpoena or other
legal process, (ii) is disclosed or used in connection with the exercise of any
remedies hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement
or any other Purchase Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or
thereunder, (iii) was in such Person’s possession or known to such Person prior
to receipt or (iv) is or becomes known to the public through disclosure in a
printed publication (without breach of any of such Person’s obligations
hereunder).
Section 14.20.    Additional Sellers. From time to time during the term of this
Agreement, the Seller Representative may request that one or more of its
Affiliates be added as an additional seller (each, an “Additional Seller”) under
this Agreement. Any such request shall be made by the Seller Representative to
the Administrative Agent and the Purchasers, and provided that the Additional
Seller Conditions Precedent are satisfied (as determined by each Purchaser in
its sole and absolute discretion), the Administrative Agent (at the direction of
the Purchasers) shall approve any such request. In the event that any such
request is approved, prior to becoming an Additional Seller such approved
Affiliate must execute a Joinder Agreement and deliver the same to the
Administrative Agent and the Purchasers. Once an Affiliate has been added as an
Additional Seller hereunder, such Additional Seller shall be a Seller hereunder,
and each reference in this Agreement to “Seller” or “Sellers” shall also mean
and be a reference to such Additional Seller.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Section 14.21.    Termination of Approved Obligor. Following the occurrence of
an Approved Obligor Termination Event, the Administrative Agent may, and shall,
at the direction of the Required Purchasers, revoke its approval of the relevant
Approved Obligor without providing any prior written notice to the Seller
Representative or any other Person. Once the Administrative Agent has revoked
its approval of an Approved Obligor, such Person shall immediately cease to be
an Approved Obligor hereunder (except with respect to outstanding Purchased
Receivables) and the Administrative Agent shall provide an updated copy of
Schedule A to the Seller Representative reflecting the then-current Approved
Obligors.
Section 14.22.    Addition of Approved Obligor. From time to time during the
term of this Agreement, the Seller Representative may request that one or more
account debtors be added as an additional Approved Obligor under this Agreement.
Any such request shall be made by the Seller Representative to the
Administrative Agent and the Purchasers and shall include a proposed Approved
Obligor Buffer Period. The Purchasers shall, in their absolute discretion,
determine whether or not to accept any such request. Once each Purchaser has
provided written approval of a proposed Approved Obligor to the Seller
Representative and the Administrative Agent, such Person shall immediately
become an Approved Obligor hereunder, and the Administrative Agent shall provide
an updated copy of Schedule A to the Seller Representative reflecting the
then-current Approved Obligors.
Section 14.23.    Optional Repurchase of Purchased Receivables. Notwithstanding
any other provisions in this Agreement, any Seller shall have the right after
receiving notice from the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 5.4, upon not
less than ten (10) Business Days’ notice to the Administrative Agent, to
repurchase any outstanding Overdue Receivable arising from the failure of an
Approved Obligor to pay the Overdue Receivable within sixty (60) days of its
Maturity Date at a repurchase price equal to the fair market value of such
Overdue Receivable, which fair market value shall be calculated in the
reasonable discretion of the Administrative Agent (it being understood, for the
avoidance of doubt, that, under certain circumstances, the fair market value of
any Overdue Receivable may be higher than its original Net Face Value).
Section 14.24.    Amendment and Restatement. This Agreement amends and restates
in its entirety, as of the date hereof, the Original Agreement. Notwithstanding
the amendment and restatement of the Original Agreement by this Agreement, (i)
the Seller Representative and each Seller shall continue to be liable to the
Administrative Agent or any other Indemnified Party (as such terms are defined
in the Original Agreement) for fees, expenses and all other amounts and
liabilities which are accrued and unpaid under the Original Agreement on the
date hereof (collectively, the “Original Agreement Outstanding Amounts”) and all
agreements to indemnify or otherwise for the benefit of such parties in
connection with events or conditions arising or existing prior to the date
hereof and (ii) the security interest created under the Original Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect as security for such Original Agreement
Outstanding Amounts until such Original Agreement Outstanding Amounts have been
paid in full. Upon the effectiveness of this Agreement, each reference to the
Original Agreement in any Purchase Document or in any other document, instrument
or agreement shall mean and be a reference to this Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, until terminated by mutual consent of the parties thereto, the
Suspension Letter shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms notwithstanding the amendment and restatement of the Original Agreement by
this Agreement. The Parties may agree to execute additional side letters related
to the suspension of sales of Receivables hereunder from time to time.

Schedule C To
Amended and Restated Master Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement


ELECTRONIC SERVICES SCHEDULE
This Electronic Services Schedule (the “Schedule”) is attached and made a part
of the Agreement (as defined herein). In the event of any conflict between the
terms and conditions of the Agreement and the terms and conditions of this
Schedule, the terms and conditions of this Schedule shall control. Capitalized
terms used herein not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed
thereto in the Agreement.
Section 1.As used herein:
“Agreement” means the Amended and Restated Master Accounts Receivable Purchase
Agreement, dated as of October 30, 2020 (as amended, restated, amended and
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time), among Perspecta
Enterprise Services LLC (“Enterprise”) and any other seller from time to time
party thereto (each, in such capacity, a “Seller” and collectively, the
“Sellers”), the PURCHASERS described therein and MUFG BANK, LTD. (“MUFG”), as
administrative agent for the Purchasers (the “Administrative Agent”), including
this Schedule, as such agreement may be amended, restated, amended and restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with its
terms.
“Message” means all messages or other information sent or received by any Seller
in connection with the Agreement using the Program web portal.
“PrimeRevenue” means PrimeRevenue, Inc., which is a Service Provider hereunder.
“Program web portal” means the system interface of the Service Provider to be
used by MUFG and the Sellers so as to operate the Agreement or any updated or
replacement system from time to time.
“Service Provider” means any person with whom an agreement has been entered into
by MUFG and to whom the performance of certain obligations or exercise of
certain rights in respect of the giving and receiving of Messages, and not in
respect of any purchase of Receivables, is from time to time sub-contracted by
MUFG.
Section 2.Service Provider
2.1. The parties to the Agreement agree that the Service Provider is and will be
the service provider solely for MUFG and not the sub-contractor or agent of each
Seller. Each Seller consents to MUFG outsourcing to the Service Provider the
management of certain administrative functions under the Agreement, it being
understood that only the rights and obligations issuing from this Schedule shall
be outsourced.1
Section 3.Service Provider’s Systems and Platform
3.1. To operate the Agreement, each Seller and MUFG shall use the Program web
portal, subject to Section 4.9 below.
3.2. Program related data will be updated and available for view access by the
Sellers and MUFG on a day to day basis in the Program web portal.

1     Services with respect to Messages are only being offered as an
accommodation and not as a requirement for any Seller’s use of the facility. As
such, in the event the service provider cannot or does not perform, MUFG’s
liability is limited to MUFG performing under MUFG’s obligations stated in the
Agreement.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



3.3. Each Seller will upload and download information pertaining to purchase
requests from the Program web portal.
3.4. As of the date of this Schedule, the Service Provider means PrimeRevenue.
MUFG may replace the Service Provider at any time or terminate this Schedule,
and will give written notice thereof to the Sellers.
Section 4.Use of Service Provider’s Systems and Platform
4.1. Each Seller shall have the right to use the content of the Program web
portal to print and use reports downloaded from the Program web portal, and to
save reasonable copies to its hard drive, in each case solely for the purposes
contemplated by the Agreement. Any copying, distribution, or commercial use of
any of the content of the Program web portal not in furtherance of or related to
the commercial purposes of the Agreement is strictly forbidden. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, each Seller is entitled to share any such content with its
Affiliates and its and such Affiliates’ attorneys, accountants, and tax
advisors, or any Governmental Authority.
4.2. Service Provider retains all right, title, and interest in and to its
Program web portal, including all software and other intellectual property
underlying the Program web portal and associated therewith, all derivative works
thereof, and in all media, but specifically excluding any materials,
intellectual property or information provided by the Sellers or MUFG
(collectively, “Member Content”), all of which shall remain the property of the
contributing party. Other than a royalty-free license to use the Program web
portal during the term of this Schedule, nothing contained herein shall be
construed as the grant of a license or other right by Service Provider to the
Sellers of the Program web portal or any intellectual property underlying or
associated with the Program web portal. Each Seller grants to Service Provider
for the term of this Schedule C a royalty free, non-exclusive license to use,
reproduce, display and modify such Seller’s Member Content for the purpose of
allowing Service Provider to render the contracted-for services to MUFG.
4.3. All of the design, text, graphics and the selection and arrangement thereof
included in the Program web portal are protected by the copyright laws of the
United States and foreign countries. The Program web portal and all associated
intellectual property rights are owned by Service Provider and its licensors.
All rights not expressly granted to the Sellers are reserved to Service Provider
and its licensors. Each Seller acknowledges that (a) the Program web portal
incorporates confidential and proprietary information developed or acquired by
Service Provider, including the software underlying the Program web portal;
(b) it shall use such information solely for the purposes set forth herein; and
(c) it shall not disclose any such information to third parties except to its
Affiliates, and its and their employees, officers, legal counsel, financial
advisors and auditors, so long as such parties are bound by written or fiduciary
obligations no less stringent than those set forth herein, and such Seller
remains primarily responsible for any unauthorized use or disclosure of the
information by such third parties. This Section 4.3 shall survive the
termination of this Schedule for a period of one (1) year.
4.4. Service Provider may access and use the non-public financial, transactional
and other information that is processed under the Agreement or otherwise
acquired by Service Provider in connection with the Program web portal (“Seller
Data”) for the purposes of providing and operating the Program web portal. In
addition, Service Provider may access and use Seller Data on an aggregate basis
for the purpose of preparing statistical analyses, reports, and benchmarking
statistics for Service Provider’s own use and for general marketing purposes
related to trends and overall use of the Program web portal and related
services; provided, however, that any public


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



marketing uses shall not individually identify any Seller or Seller Data. Each
Seller represents that it has the right to permit Service Provider to use Seller
Data as described in the Agreement and that such use will not violate any third
person’s rights.
4.5. Each Seller acknowledges that Service Provider may transfer Seller Data to
a third person, in connection with: (a) any assignment arising from the
acquisition of all or substantially all of its assets or equity interests; or
(b) a delegation of hosting or other duties, provided that such third party
service provider agrees to abide by appropriate confidentiality obligations. Any
such transferee shall only be permitted to use the data as contemplated by this
Schedule.
4.6. The parties may disclose Seller Data if required by applicable law to any
government body, or duly authorized representatives thereof, upon an audit or
other inspection by any of the same of the records or facilities of Service
Provider. The applicable Seller will be notified promptly upon receipt of any
order (to the extent allowed by the terms of such order or applicable law) and
upon the implementation of any change in laws which requires disclosure of
Seller Data.
4.7. Each Seller hereby acknowledges that Service Provider reserves the right
to: (a) terminate such Seller’s access to and use of the Program web portal if
such Seller permits any unauthorized third person or entity to access and use
the Program web portal; and (b) interrupt or disable access to and use of all or
any part of the Program web portal if necessary to prevent or protect against
fraud, hacking, or illegal conduct or otherwise protect Service Provider’s
personnel or the Program web portal, in Service Provider’s sole discretion and
without notice.
4.8. EACH SELLER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NO WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE MADE BY SERVICE PROVIDER WITH RESPECT TO
THE PROGRAM WEB PORTAL, THE UNDERLYING SOFTWARE, OR ANY SERVICES PROVIDED BY
SERVICE PROVIDER, AND SUCH PROGRAM WEB PORTAL, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES ARE
PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS, WHERE IS, AND AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. SERVICE PROVIDER
EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS LIABILITY AND SPECIFICALLY DENIES ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR
(A) THE COMPLETENESS, ACCURACY OR QUALITY OF INFORMATION OR ANY MEMBER CONTENT
OBTAINED THROUGH THE PROGRAM WEB PORTAL, AND (B) SUCH SELLER’S USE OF OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM WEB PORTAL. THE USE OF THE PROGRAM WEB PORTAL, AND
ANY MEMBER CONTENT OR INFORMATION OBTAINED VIA THE PROGRAM WEB PORTAL, IS AT
EACH SELLER’S OWN RISK. SERVICE PROVIDER SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO ANY SELLER FOR
ANY INDIRECT LOSS, INCLUDING LOSS OF TIME, MONEY OR GOODWILL, INCIDENTAL,
SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF ANY KIND UNDER ANY
LEGAL THEORY OR CAUSE OF ACTION IN EACH CASE BASED ON SELLER’S, USE, INABILITY
TO USE, OPERATE OR MODIFY THE PROGRAM WEB PORTAL. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT,

LOST DATA, OR LOST GOODWILL EVEN IF THE PARTY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF SUCH
DAMAGE. EXCEPT FOR SERVICE PROVIDER’S INTENTIONAL TORTIOUS ACTS, FRAUD, OR GROSS
NEGLIGENCE, SERVICE PROVIDER’S TOTAL LIABILITY FOR PROVEN DIRECT DAMAGES
RESULTING FROM ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF SELLER’S USE OF THE PROGRAM
WEB PORTAL SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS (USD$10,000.00).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



4.9. MUFG has the obligation to view the Messages sent in accordance with this
Schedule and to act upon them under the terms of the Agreement, and, during any
unavailability of the Program web portal for the purposes hereof, or following
the change of Service Provider, accept or receive purchase requests and other
notices as otherwise provided in the Agreement.
Section 5.Security. Each Seller agrees that:
5.1. such Seller’s authorized employees may access the Program web portal using
a unique user ID and password issued by Service Provider to such Seller’s
administrative user or any user ID and password maintained by a Seller user.
Such Seller and each authorized employee shall not allow any other individual to
use such employee’s unique user ID and password to access the Program web
portal. Such Seller and each authorized employee shall remain responsible for
maintaining the strict confidentiality of the user IDs and passwords created for
such Seller’s authorized employees;
5.2. it will not intentionally or knowingly interfere with, defeat, disrupt,
circumvent or tamper with or attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Program
web portal or other information or instruction that is, by the terms of the
Agreement to be transmitted through the Program web portal, or with the

Program web portal any device, software or routine, including but not limited to

Section 6.Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Sellers. Each Seller
hereby represents, warrants and covenants to and with MUFG as follows:
6.1. Such Seller’s use of the Program web portal is solely to settle genuine and
lawful commercial trade transactions, arising in the ordinary course of
business, for the purchase or sale of goods (including Receivables as defined
under the Agreement) and/or services by or to a Seller from or to MUFG or other
third parties. Such Seller shall not use the Program web portal for investment
or arbitrage functions or purposes, or for any money laundering purpose, or in
contravention of any law or regulation, and any activity undertaken via the
Program web portal shall not be used in furtherance of any of the foregoing.
6.2. Information provided by such Seller to MUFG or Service Provider from time
to time in connection with this Schedule is and shall be true and accurate in

shall be read or implied into this Schedule against MUFG. MUFG shall have no
duties or obligations under this Schedule to any person or entity other than the
Sellers and, without limiting the foregoing, does not assume any obligation or
relationship of agency or trust under this Schedule for, or with any other
person or entity.

Service Provider is an intended third party beneficiary of, and entitled to rely
on Sections 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 of this Schedule and Section 14.19 of the Agreement
