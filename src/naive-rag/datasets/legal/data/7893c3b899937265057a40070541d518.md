income taxes, transfer taxes, excise taxes, sales taxes and/or similar taxes in
the event of a Closing (such returns and forms, the “Tax Returns”) and (ii)

raises any such objections, Pabst and Optionor shall, for the thirty (30) days
thereafter, exercise good faith efforts to resolve those objections, and, if
Pabst and Optionor cannot resolve any disagreements relating to the Allocation
Appraisal within such thirty (30)-day period, Pabst and Optionor shall submit
the matter for resolution to the Independent Accountants as provided in Section
12.5 below, who shall in such case make the final determination with respect to
the Allocation Appraisal. Each of the Parties shall file all Tax Returns and
other forms with all applicable tax authorities on a basis consistent with the
Allocation Appraisal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




make Pabst products), related know-how, and specific applications corresponding
to Transferred Software (including any specific configurations or customized
environments specific to the Brewery) owned by Optionor or MillerCoors or their
Affiliates and used in the operation of the Brewery. For the avoidance of doubt,

Optionor's ERP system and certain other hardware servers and software that are
necessary for the Brewery to operate, designated by an “N” in columns G and H on

permitted to be transferred or cannot be transferred without consent. Pabst
acknowledges that it must obtain at its election its own licenses for all
software that is listed with a “Y” in column G on Schedule 1.2(a)(iii) and such
software will only be assigned to Pabst with the approval of the third parties
and if such license can be separated. Pabst acknowledges that it will not be
entitled to any software that is listed with a “N” on Schedule 1.2(a)(iii).
1.3    No Assumption; Liability Disclosure Notice. 
(a)    Subject to Section 12.15 (As-Is Sale) and other than pursuant to
applicable laws or the express terms of this Agreement, Pabst shall not assume
or have any responsibility for any Liability relating to the Purchased Assets
(or any portion thereof) for any acts, omissions or occurrences of the Optionor
Parties prior to the Closing, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, Optionor and MillerCoors shall retain, and Optionor and MillerCoors
shall discharge and perform when due and payable, all Liabilities relating to
the Purchased Assets (or any portion thereof) for any acts, omissions or
occurrences of the Optionor Parties prior to the Closing. For instance, if an
employee of MillerCoors brings a wage and hour claim after Closing relating to
acts, omissions or occurrences of the Optionor Parties that exist or arise prior
to Closing or amends a pre-Closing claim after Closing to add additional claims
such as waiting time penalties relating to acts, omissions or occurrences of the
Optionor Parties that exist or arise prior to Closing, MillerCoors shall be
responsible for any resulting Liabilities. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that Pabst shall assume all Liabilities arising from the Assumed Contracts
(including with respect to the Leased Assets leased thereunder) following the
Closing pursuant to the Assignment and Bill of Sale entered into at Closing, as
well as the Permits assigned thereunder. For clarity, any claim pursuant to this
Section 1.3(a) shall be made pursuant to Section 11.2(d).
(b)    Within sixty (60) days of the Effective Date, Optionor agrees to deliver
to Pabst a list, as of such date of delivery, of any pending or, to Optionor's
Knowledge, threatened (in writing) lawsuits or governmental actions, which are
of the type to be set forth on Schedule 3.1(d) (the “Liability Disclosure
Notice”).
(c)    In the event the Closing occurs, MillerCoors shall not assume or have any
responsibility for any Liability relating to the Purchased Assets (or any
portion thereof) for acts or occurrences on or after the Closing, and Pabst
shall assume, and shall discharge and perform when due and payable, all
Liabilities relating to the Purchased Assets (or any portion thereof) for acts
or


9


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




occurrences on or after the Closing. MillerCoors shall have no obligation to
maintain any insurance on the Purchased Assets after the Closing. For instance,
if an employee falls or is injured by an unsafe piece of equipment the day
following the Closing, Pabst shall be responsible for any Liabilities related to
a claim arising from such fall or injury. In the event that an employee or third
party contractor falls and is injured the day prior to the Closing, Optionor
shall be responsible for any Liabilities related to a claim arising from such
fall or injury. For clarity, any claim pursuant to this Section 1.3(c) shall be
made pursuant to Section 11.3(a)(iv).
(d)    Pabst shall be responsible for any Liabilities solely for Pabst’s
unlawful actions with respect to Optionor’s and MillerCoors’ employees prior to
or after the Closing (including wrongful termination, discrimination,
retaliation or unlawful harassment claims) (any such Liabilities, “Pabst’s
Hiring Liability”).
(e)    This Section 1.3 shall survive the Closing.
1.4    Employees. The Parties agree to the terms and conditions of Schedule 1.4.
Further, in connection with the termination of any of its employees, MillerCoors
and its Affiliates shall pay out all paid time off to its employees in
accordance with California law for the pre-Closing period. This Section 1.4
shall survive the Closing indefinitely.
1.5    Option Term.
(a)    Exercise. Pabst may exercise the Option by delivering (i) written notice
to Optionor electing to purchase the Purchased Assets (the “Exercise Notice”;
and the date of delivery of the Exercise Notice, the “Exercise Date”) at any
time during the one hundred twenty (120) days following Pabst’s receipt of the
Closure Notice and (ii) the Deposit (as defined below) to Escrow Agent in
accordance with Section 6.1 below. If Pabst fails to timely deliver the Exercise
Notice and the Deposit in accordance with this Section 1.5 and Section 6.1
below, the Option and this Agreement shall immediately expire, terminate and be
of no further force or effect, and Optionor may (x) commence the Plant Closure,
(y) commence to market the Purchased Assets for sale, and/or (z) sell any of the
Purchased Assets free of Pabst’s Option.
(b)    Plant Closure. Optionor shall elect, prior to March 1, 2020 (the timing
of such election prior to March 1, 2020 to be made by Optionor in its sole and
absolute discretion), to discontinue its operations at the Brewery and close the
Brewery (hereinafter referred to as a “Plant Closure”); provided that
MillerCoors shall comply with its obligations set forth in Article 4. Optionor
shall provide Pabst with written notice of its election to effectuate a Plant
Closure no later than March 1, 2020 (the “Closure Notice”; and the date of
delivery (including deemed delivery), the “Closure Notice Delivery Date”), it
being understood that if Optionor does not timely provide the Closure Notice to
Pabst, the Closure Notice shall be deemed delivered by Optionor and received by
Pabst on March 1, 2020. Optionor and Pabst agree to discuss any modifications to
the Plant Closure process to allow for a more seamless transition and sale
process; provided that MillerCoors and its Affiliates shall not be required to
pay any stay bonuses to any of its employees or to guarantee the number of
employees who will continue to work through any transition.

(c)    Closing Date. The Exercise Notice must include a date for the closing of
the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets (the “Closing”), which Closing
shall be within six (6) months after the Exercise Date, but in no event earlier
than September 1, 2020 or later than December 31, 2020. The date of the Closing,
as the same may be extended pursuant to Section 10.1 and/or Section 10.2, is
referred to herein as the “Closing Date.”
(d)    Transition Services. Within sixty (60) days of the Exercise Date upon the
prior written request by Pabst delivered to Optionor, the Parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts to negotiate a transition services agreement
(the “Transition Services Agreement”) that would remain in place for a maximum
of ninety (90) days after the Closing; provided however, that Optionor shall not
be liable for any damages under the Transition Services Agreement (except breach
by Optionor of the standard of service set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement) and the Transition Services Agreement shall provide commercially
reasonable compensation to Optionor for the services provided thereunder. The
Transition Services Agreement shall cap MillerCoors’ liability at 10% of the
amount it is paid under the Transition Services Agreement.
1.6    Option Consideration. The Option is granted in part as consideration for
the Settlement Agreement, separate and independent of the Deposit. The Purchase
Price contained herein is not subject to reduction or credit except as set forth
in Sections 9.1 and 9.2.
1.7    Inspections.


(a)    Data Room. From the Effective Date until the Closing or earlier
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Optionor shall grant
and provide access to the Data Room to Pabst and such Authorized Persons as
Pabst from time to time requests. From and following the Effective Date, (1) to
the extent not heretofore made available to Pabst and uploaded to the Data Room,
Optionor and MillerCoors shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to
Pabst the information and documents included in Schedule 1.7(a)(1) (the
“Transition Outline”) and the information and documents included in Schedule
1.7(a)(2) (the “Due Diligence List”) in each case via the Data Room and in
approximately the timeframes set forth therein (if any, otherwise reasonably
promptly upon request), and in each case other than any materials or information
which the Transition Outline or the Due Diligence List states will not be
provided, and (2) to the extent not heretofore completed, MillerCoors shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to do such acts as the Transition Outline
specifically provides in approximately the timeframes set forth therein.
Promptly (and in any case no later than sixty (60) days following the Closure
Notice Delivery Date), Optionor shall populate the Data Room with all Contracts,
but only to the extent in each case that such items are to the then-current
knowledge of Optionor or MillerCoors then in the possession or reasonable
control of the Optionor Parties. Optionor shall reasonably promptly after any
request by Pabst therefor from time to time upload to the Data Room such
documents as Pabst may reasonably request from time to time with respect to the
Purchased Assets, subject to the succeeding provisions of this Section 1.7(a);
other than any materials or information, which the Transition Outline and the
Due Diligence List states will not be provided. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, no Optionor Party has any obligation under this Section 1.7(a)
to deliver or make available to Pabst any Optionor Party’s internal memoranda,
internally-produced reports, financial statements, attorney-client privileged
materials, information which would cause a breach of any obligations to a third
party (including confidentiality), any competitively sensitive information
and/or any pricing

or costs. Except as may be otherwise specifically and expressly set forth in
Article 3 below, Optionor Parties make no representations or warranties of any
kind regarding the accuracy, thoroughness or completeness of, or conclusions
drawn in, the information contained in the Documents. The Parties agree that, in
an effort to minimize or eliminate the risk of any unintended antitrust concerns
arising from the exchange of information in the diligence process, upon request
of any Party, the Parties will implement reasonable customary precautions to
protect information provided in the diligence process (such as, by way of
example only, establishing a “clean team” to review certain diligence
materials).
(b)    General. Upon execution of this Agreement until the earlier of Closing
and termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Pabst and
Pabst’s employees, agents, consultants, representatives and contractors
(hereinafter collectively referred to as “Pabst’s Agents”) shall have the right
to enter upon the Real Property at reasonable times during normal business hours
to perform such inspections, testing, and surveys at the Real Property, at
Pabst’s sole risk, cost and expense, provided that the times and methods of such
inspections and investigations shall, prior to the Closure Notice Delivery Date,
be subject to MillerCoors’ prior written approval, which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Pabst’s and Pabst’s Agents’
access to the Real Property shall be for the purposes of (a) reviewing such
materials in Optionor’s or MillerCoors’ possession regarding the Purchased
Assets as may be provided or made available to Pabst at the Real Property by
Optionor (or its Affiliates, agents or representatives), (b) inspecting the
physical condition of the Real Property and the other Purchased Assets and
conducting physical and environmental tests and assessments of the Real
Property, including a Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessment or any
similar testing of the Real Property, (c) performing a land title survey of the
Real Property (the “Survey”), and (d) otherwise conducting Pabst’s diligence
review of the Purchased Assets consistent with the terms of this Agreement.
Optionor agrees that Pabst’s and Pabst’s Agents’ access and inspection rights
may include the following: (I) PZR or another third party zoning consultant
engaged by Pabst may make contact with the zoning and/or building department of
the city and/or county in which the Real Property is located as part of Pabst’s
customary due diligence to confirm compliance with applicable zoning and
building code requirements, and (II) only after the delivery of an Exercise
Notice, Pabst may contact Governmental Entities having jurisdiction over the
Real Property and/or Optionor in order to discuss Pabst’s acquisition of the
Brewery. Pabst shall not have any contact or conversations with Optionor’s nor
MillerCoors’ employees (other than those who are on the transition team for the
Transaction) or unions until after the Closure Notice Delivery Date.
Furthermore, with regard to any Phase II environmental testing or any invasive
testing of building materials, Pabst shall first provide Optionor with a
detailed explanation of the reasons and methods for such test and obtain
Optionor’s prior written consent to such testing, which consent shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed. Furthermore, unless required by
law, Pabst agrees not to discuss or disclose the results of such Phase II
environmental testing nor the results of the tests on building materials with or
to Optionor and shall treat such information as Confidential Information. For
avoidance of doubt, this is an “as is, where is” transaction intended to resolve
ongoing disputes between the Parties and, therefore, Optionor shall be under no
obligation whatsoever to reduce the Purchase Price further nor to provide Pabst
with any credits (except as expressly provided in Section 9) under any
circumstances, including but not limited to in the event Pabst’s inspections
and/or due diligence investigation of the Purchased Assets reveal any material
defects, liabilities or imperfections. Pabst


12


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




agrees not to renegotiate the Purchase Price. Provided that Optionor and
MillerCoors have complied with Section 4.1 (and, with respect to the following
prong (y) only, Section 4.2 below) and subject to the provisions of Section 7.3
and Section 10.2 below, if Pabst (x) discovers any material defect, liabilities
or imperfections with the Purchased Assets at any time prior to Closing or (y)
is unable to secure all Material Consents or permission to transfer or assume
any of Material Agreements and Permits, then Pabst may (i) waive such finding or
condition precedent or (ii) as its sole and exclusive remedy, terminate this
Agreement and forfeit the Deposit (if the Option has been exercised), without
any further recourse against MillerCoors and/or Optionor.
(c)    Others at the Property; Notice. Pabst agrees that, in exercising its
rights under this Section 1.7, Pabst will not, and will cause Pabst’s Agents not
to, unreasonably interrupt or interfere with the activities of Optionor’s
employees, guests, tenants or other persons or entities occupying or providing
service at the Real Property or with respect to its operation of the Brewery.
Pabst shall, upon at least three days’ prior notice before entering upon the
Real Property for purpose of the permitted activities set forth in this Section
1.7, give Optionor notice of its intention to conduct such activity (which such
notice may be given by e-mail to the member of the transition team designated by
the officers of MillerCoors) so that Optionor shall have an opportunity to have
a representative present during any such inspection. Following delivery of an
Exercise Notice, Pabst may (subject to the terms of Section 1.7(b)) discuss the
Purchased Assets with any Governmental Entities.
(d)    Employee Matters. At any time within one (1) year after the Closure
Notice Delivery Date, Pabst may initiate discussions and make offers of
employment to any of Optionor’s or MillerCoors’ employees at the Brewery that
Pabst would like to retain, provided that such offers of employment are not
effective until on or after Closing. In addition, at any time after the Closure
Notice Delivery Date, Pabst may initiate discussions with any or all of the
unions representing employees at the Brewery, provided that Pabst gives at least
3 days advance notice to MillerCoors. Pabst may consult with certain of
Optionor’s or MillerCoors’ employees regarding the discussions with the unions
but whether any employee or representative of Optionor or MillerCoors
participates in the union meetings shall be at Pabst sole and absolute
discretion. Optionor and MillerCoors agree to make such personnel, including but
not limited to labor relations and human resources employees, reasonably
available to Pabst. Any agreement(s) reached between Pabst and any union may be
binding but shall not have an effective date prior to Closing. The Parties will
keep each other reasonably informed on an ongoing basis about their respective
negotiations with the unions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closure
Notice Delivery Date or earlier if MillerCoors gives notice to Pabst that it
will be issuing notices pursuant to the WARN Laws, Pabst shall be permitted at
Pabst's own expense to offer retention incentives to non-union employees it may
wish to retain, and such offers may be payable at any time at, before or after
Closing, provided Pabst pays all taxes associated with such retention
incentives. Similarly, Pabst shall be permitted to negotiate with the unions
retention incentives for certain union employees it may wish to retain, and such
offers may be payable by Pabst at any time before or after Closing, as well as
all taxes associated therewith. The Parties agree to follow the additional
procedures set forth on Schedule 1.7(d) with respect to the Unions.




13


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




(e)    Restoration. With respect to any damage or alteration of the physical
condition of the Real Property (or any other Purchased Assets) caused by Pabst
or Pabst’s Agents’ entry upon and on-site inspections of the Real Property (and
the Purchased Assets), Pabst shall, at its sole cost and expense, promptly
repair and restore the Real Property (or any other Purchased Assets) to the same
condition as existed prior to such inspection.
(f)    Independent Investigation. During the 120 day period after the Closure
Notice Delivery Date, Pabst is to conduct its own independent investigation,
review and analysis of the Purchased Assets. In the event Pabst makes a decision
to provide an Exercise Notice, Pabst is making its own decision at such time to
exercise the Option or not and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, and Pabst acknowledges it is to rely on its own investigation.
(g)    Indemnification. Pabst agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Optionor and
MillerCoors pursuant to Article 11 free and harmless from any loss, damage,
claim, liability, cost or expense (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and
costs) caused by Pabst or Pabst’s Agent’s entry upon and inspection of the Real
Property, excluding any loss or damage arising from (i) the mere discovery of
pre-existing conditions at the Real Property without exacerbation by Pabst or
Pabst’s Agents and (ii) Optionor’s (or its agents’, employees’, representatives’
or contractors’) negligence or willful misconduct (the “Pabst Inspection
Liabilities”).


14


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




1.8    Assumed Contracts. Within sixty (60) days after the Exercise Date, Pabst
shall notify Optionor in writing as to which of the Service Contracts and
Equipment Leases (which, for the avoidance of doubt, do not include the Master
Leases) and all other Contracts which Pabst elects (in its sole discretion) to
assume (each of the foregoing, subject to obtaining any third-party consents
needed for such assignments, and each of the Lease(s), an “Assumed Contract”).
At Closing, (x) Pabst shall assume all obligations of Optionor accruing after
the Closing Date under each Assumed Contract and Pabst shall be responsible for
the payment of the assumption fee in respect of each such Assumed Contract (if
any); and (y) all other Contracts (herein, collectively, the “Cancelled
Contracts”) shall be cancelled by Optionor at Closing, it being agreed that at
Closing Optionor shall, at Optionor’s expense and risk, (i) terminate all such
Cancelled Contracts (in which case Optionor shall deliver to Pabst at or
promptly following Closing copies of such written notices and/or agreements of
termination of all such Cancelled Contracts; provided, that Optionor shall not
be required to deliver such written notices of termination with regard to such
Cancelled Contracts until if, as and when the Closing occurs, at which time
Optionor shall deliver such notices of termination (and provide copies of such
notices to Pabst) in accordance with the applicable terms and provisions of each
such Cancelled Contract) and/or (ii) maintain such Cancelled Contracts at no
liability to Pabst. In the event Pabst provides notice of a Cancelled Contract,
Optionor Party may cancel such contract at any time prior to the Closing Date.
Notwithstanding the above, if the Closing occurs, Pabst must assume the Union
Contracts as currently written or as amended pursuant to Sections 1.2(a)(iv) and
1.7(d). Pabst shall not be permitted to cancel or terminate the Union Contracts
(as currently written or as amended pursuant to Section 4.6) at or prior to
Closing pursuant to this Section 1.8, provided that if a Closing occurs Pabst
complies with its obligations to assume the Union Contracts either as written or
amended pursuant to Section 4.6. Notwithstanding the above, if the Closing
occurs, Pabst must assume the Leases affecting the Land and Improvements.
1.9    Non-Assignable Assets. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, to the extent that the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or
delivery, or attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, to
Pabst of any Purchased Asset would result in a violation of applicable law, or
would require the consent, authorization, approval or waiver of a Person who is
not a Party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a Party to this Agreement
(including any Governmental Entity), and such consent, authorization, approval
or waiver shall not have been obtained prior to the Closing, this Agreement
shall not constitute a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or an
attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, thereof; provided,
however, that, subject to the satisfaction or waiver (by the applicable Party
for whom such condition was intended to benefit) of the conditions contained in
Article VII, the Closing shall occur notwithstanding the foregoing without any
adjustment to the Purchase Price on account thereof. Following the Closing, the
Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts (applying Section 4.2 mutatis
mutandis) to obtain any such required consent, authorization, approval or
waiver. Once such consent, authorization, approval or waiver is obtained,
Optionor Parties shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Pabst the
relevant Purchased Asset to which such consent, authorization, approval or
waiver relates for no additional consideration. Applicable sales, transfer and
other similar taxes in connection with such sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or license shall be paid in accordance with Section 12.1.
1.10    Post-Closing Transactions.


15


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




(a)     The Parties agree to the terms and provisions of Schedule 1.10(a).
(b)     The Parties agree to the terms and provisions of Schedule 1.10(b).


(c)    Competitors. For five (5) years after the Closing Date, Pabst shall not
sell title to all or a material portion of the Brewery to any of the Prohibited
Transferees (as defined on Schedule 1.10(c)) or any Affiliate directly or
indirectly controlled by any of the Prohibited Transferees; provided, that, the
foregoing restriction shall not apply to a Security Transaction or any “Sale of
Pabst”, meaning (i) any change of control of, or direct or indirect sale of,
Pabst or its any of its direct or indirect owners (or any other transaction
effected at the Pabst level or above), or (ii) any direct or indirect investment
in Pabst or any of its direct or indirect owners, or a merger, restructuring or
change of control of Pabst or any of its direct parent entities.
(d)    Audit Rights.
(i)
As Optionor reasonably deems appropriate and at Optionor’s reasonable request,
but in no event more often than once per calendar year, and only after Optionor
and its independent auditors shall have entered into an appropriate
confidentiality agreement with Pabst, the independent auditors of Pabst will
examine the relevant books and records of Pabst to verify its compliance with
the provisions of this Section 1.10 or that an Excluded Transaction has occurred
(“Compliance”). Pabst’s auditors will promptly thereafter disclose the results
of the audit and their work product to the independent auditors of Optionor,
provided that the independent auditors of Optionor have entered into the
appropriate confidentiality agreements prohibiting them from disclosing the
details of such audit to Optionor.

(ii)
As to any Dispute arising between the Parties pertaining to Compliance, both
parties agree to be bound by any mutual resolution of that Dispute reached by
Optionor’s and Pabst’s respective auditors.

(iii)
The details of each audit shall remain confidential to the respective auditors
and only the ultimate result of the audit will be communicated to Optionor,
except that if a Dispute regarding Compliance is not mutually resolved by the
parties’ respective independent auditors, then Optionor’s auditors may disclose
the details of the audit to Optionor to the extent necessary to fully apprise
Optionor of the issues underlying the Dispute; provided that in no event shall
any competitively sensitive information (including details regarding bills of
materials) be disclosed to Optionor for any reason whatsoever. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the Agreement, (i) neither Pabst nor any of its
Affiliates shall be required to transfer or make available to MillerCoors any
tax returns or information with respect to Taxes of Pabst or any of its
Affiliates, and (ii) Optionor’s



16


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




auditors may not disclose to any Person any tax returns or information with
respect to Taxes of Pabst or any of its Affiliates; provided that Optionor’s
auditors may disclose to MillerCoors information with respect to Taxes of Pabst
or its Affiliates solely and specifically relating to the consideration received
by Pabst in exchange for the Pits in a Qualifying Transaction (other than any
Excluded Transaction).
(iv)
Thereafter, at either Party’s request, the Dispute will be submitted to the
Independent Accountants as set forth in Section 12.5. Optionor and Pabst hereby
agree to be bound by the decision of such third party accounting firm. Such
third party accounting firm may be required by either party to execute an
appropriate confidentiality agreement.

(v)
The cost of the original audit conducted by Optionor shall be borne by Optionor;
provided that Pabst shall reimburse Optionor the amount of the fee up to and
including the net amount found by the auditor to be due to Optionor pursuant to
this Section 1.10(d) and Section 12.5, as applicable. The Independent
Accountants shall determine the percentage of its fees and expenses to be paid
by Pabst and the Optionor Parties, with such fees and expenses being borne in
inverse proportion to the degree to which the accountants accepted the positions
of the respective parties. Payment of any such reimbursements will be due within
eleven (11) Business Days of the Independent Accountants’ final determination.

1.11    Further Acknowledgements. Pabst acknowledges that the B3 line included
in the Purchased Assets was decommissioned in 2008. Pabst acknowledges that the
B5 line is currently decommissioned and is only capable of running a grenade
shaped bottle.
1.12    Asset List and Hardware and Software List. The asset list attached
hereto as Schedule 1.12 (the “Asset List”) includes certain key equipment used
in the operation of the Brewery according to various records relied upon by
Optionor over the last 5 years at differing times, and the Asset List is
intended as a general matter to detail the Equipment to be included in the
Purchased Assets at Closing, it being agreed that property ancillary to such
Equipment needed to make such Equipment functional (for example, piping, valves
and the like) shall be included in the sale to the extent not specifically
excluded herein. The parties acknowledge that the Asset List and Schedule
1.2(a)(iii) shall be updated by Optionor within sixty (60) days from the
Effective Date (and Schedule 1.12 and Schedule 1.2(a)(iii) shall thereby be
deemed updated accordingly) by delivery of a written notice to Pabst, (1) in the
case of the Asset List, containing a more detailed list, with additions or
deletions to the Equipment that have occurred in the ordinary course prior to
the Effective Date and (2) in the case of Schedule 1.2(a)(iii), in good faith
populating columns J and K therein (it being understood that the analysis
contained in such columns shall be for reference only and that Pabst will
conduct its own review as to the transferability of items referenced in Schedule
1.2(a)(iii)).
1.13    Possible Transition of Coors’ Products. On the Exercise Date and
concurrent with the Exercise Notice, Pabst shall notify MillerCoors as to
whether it intends to produce, package and ship Pabst products from the Brewery
immediately after the Closing Date. If Pabst provides notice that it will not
produce, package and ship Pabst products from the Brewery immediately after the
Closing Date (a “Notice of Intent to Transition”), (i) MillerCoors shall prior
to the Closing Date transition the production of Pabst products produced at the
Brewery to MillerCoors’ other facility or facilities (such as the Golden,
Colorado brewery), which transition and production shall be governed by the
Brewing Agreement and (ii) Pabst agrees to the use of Coors’ yeast with respect
to any Pabst products brewed in the Golden Colorado Brewery. To the extent Pabst
provides notice that it will produce, package and ship Pabst products from the
Brewery immediately after the Closing Date, Pabst agrees that, upon Closing and
notwithstanding anything contained in the parties’ Brewing Agreement to the
contrary, Optionor or its Affiliates shall no longer be required to brew the
Pabst products made at the Brewery, and Optionor and its Affiliates shall not be
required to move the production of Pabst products which are made at the Brewery
to other locations within MillerCoors and its affiliates’ other breweries. To
the extent that Pabst provides a Notice of Intent to Transition and subsequently
determines to produce, package and ship Pabst products from the Brewery, Pabst
shall provide notice thereof to MillerCoors pursuant to the terms of and in the
time periods required by the Brewing Agreement and Pabst and MillerCoors shall
transition the volume subject to such notice from MillerCoors’ facility or
facilities to the Brewery in accordance with the terms of the Brewing Agreement.
This Section 1.13 shall survive the Closing.

Date), as follows:
(a)    Authority; Qualification. Optionor (i) has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own the Purchased Assets and operate the

Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by Optionor and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the purchase and sale of

prevent, materially delay or materially impair the consummation of the
Transaction.

(ii)
Except with respect to any Cancelled Contracts and except as set forth on
Schedule 3.1(b)(ii), the execution, delivery and performance by Optionor of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and the consummation of the Transaction,

Date (with or without notice, lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination or loss of rights or result in the creation of any Lien on,
over, upon or in respect of any of the Purchased Assets under any provision of

have operated (or did operate) the Brewery in the ordinary course, consistent
with past practices in all material respects.
(d)    Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(d), there are no material
civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, demands, claims, hearings,
arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings pending or for which Optionor
Parties have received notice in the last two years or to Optionor's Knowledge
threatened in the last two years against Optionor or any of the other Optionor
Parties related to the Purchased Assets that would, or would be reasonably
likely to have or cause material liability or a material adverse impact on the
Purchased Assets or on the operation of the Brewery. Except as set forth on
Schedule 3.1(d), neither Optionor nor any of the other Optionor Parties is a
party to or subject to the provisions of any Order which has had, or would,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have or cause a
material liability or otherwise have an material adverse impact on the Purchased
Assets or on the operation of the Brewery. For clarity, the Regional Groundwater
Plume need not be disclosed on Schedule 3.1(d) as no claim has been made that
any Optionor Party is a potentially responsible party for such action.
(e)    Compliance with Laws. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(e), the
operation of the Brewery and the other Purchased Assets has not in the past two
(2) years been, and is not being, conducted in material violation of any Laws.
In the last two years, no investigation or review by any Governmental Entity
with respect to Optionor or any of the Optionor Parties is pending for which
Optionor or MillerCoors has received notice or, to Optionor’s Knowledge,
threatened, in each case in connection with any of the Purchased Assets. Except
as set forth on Schedule 3.1(e), in the prior two years, Optionor has not
received any notice or communication of any material noncompliance in connection
with any of the Purchased Assets with any Law that has not been cured. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.1(e), during the prior two years, Optionor obtained and
is in material compliance with all permits, licenses, certifications, approvals,
registrations, consents, authorizations, franchises, variances, exemptions and
orders issued or granted by any Governmental Entity necessary to conduct the
business of the Brewery as presently conducted and to own and operate the
Purchased Assets as currently owned and operated. Except as set forth on

assuming receipt of any consents affecting any Assumed Contract and required to
be obtained in connection with the Transaction, each Assumed Contract is valid,
binding and enforceable on Optionor, and, to Optionor’s Knowledge, each other
party thereto, and is in full force and effect. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.1(f), to Optionor’s Knowledge there is no uncured material violation of, or
uncured default under, any Assumed Contract by Optionor or any of its
Affiliates, no material default by the counterparty under any Assumed Contract,
and no event has occurred that, with the lapse of time or the giving of notice
or both, would constitute a default thereunder by Optionor or any of its
Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, this representation shall not be
applicable with respect to any Cancelled Contracts.

SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




(i)
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.1(g)(i), Optionor is the sole owner of the
Real Property and has, and if the Exercise Notice is timely delivered and the
Closing occurs, Optionor shall transfer to Pabst, good, indefeasible and
marketable fee simple title to the Real Property, free and clear of all Liens
other than Permitted Liens.

(ii)
Other than the rights of Pabst pursuant to this Agreement, Optionor has not
granted nor are there any preemptive or other outstanding options, warrants,
purchase rights, rights of first offer or first negotiation, rights of first
refusal or any similar rights in favor of any other party to purchase the Real
Property (or any portion thereof) or that require any Optionor Party to sell or
offer the owned property included within the Purchased Assets or any portion
thereof (nor, to Optionor’s Knowledge, the leased property included in the
Purchased Assets).

(iii)
Optionor has valid and marketable title to all owned items of personal property
and equipment located on or used in connection with the Real Property or other
Purchased Assets (collectively, the “Personal Property”), free and clear of all
Liens other than Permitted Liens and Mandatory Cure Items. Other than the rights
of Pabst pursuant to this Agreement, Optionor has not granted nor are there any
preemptive or other outstanding options, warrants, purchase rights, rights of
first offer or first negotiation, rights of first refusal or any similar rights
in favor of any other party to purchase any of the Purchased Assets or any

the Real Property, which is not addressed in this paragraph (g)(iii)) or that
require any Optionor Party to sell or offer the Purchased Assets or any portion
thereof (other than the Real Property, which is not addressed in this paragraph
(g)(iii)).

(iv)
The Purchased Assets include such land, equipment and personal property as are

to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to

cooperate with Pabst’s effort to obtain the Material Consents, using their
commercially reasonable efforts, which shall not include payment of any fees or
costs by MillerCoors or any of its Affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, the
failure of any Governmental Entity or other third party to grant any consent

Optionor and Pabst shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.
(b)    Remedies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
nothing in this Agreement, including Section 4.4(a), shall require Pabst or any
of its Affiliates (except where, following a change of control of Pabst, such
action or inaction would not materially impair the benefits or advantages Pabst

hereby or give rise to a material adverse effect on the business plan or
business strategy of Pabst or any of its Affiliates) to: (a) proffer to, agree

consents from Optionor, MillerCoors, or any Affiliate, for Pabst to obtain and
use any specific configurations or customized environments of third-party
software used at the Brewery for the production of Pabst beer, and (2) shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to make introductions to third-party vendors for
the software set forth on Schedule 1.2(a)(iii) as needed to make available to

used (provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that neither Optionor nor
MillerCoors shall have any obligation to cause any third-party vendor to make

(12) months.
4.6    Pabst Notice to MillerCoors. The parties agree to the terms and

29


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




4.7    Estoppels. At Pabst’s request, Optionor shall deliver estoppel
certificates or certifications in the form required or permitted by any Lease(s)
or contract or agreement counterparties (or as otherwise reasonably approved by
Pabst if no such form exists) to any tenant(s) under the Lease(s) and/or
contract or agreement counterparties and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain such tenant(s)’ or contract counterparties’ execution of such
estoppels and deliver them to Pabst; provided, for the avoidance of doubt, that
the delivery of any tenant estoppel(s) shall not be a condition precedent to
Closing or (for the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Section 9.1(d)),
the basis for a Purchase Price reduction.
4.8     Legal Description.  If a Closing occurs, MillerCoors and Optionor
covenant to convey to Pabst at the Closing pursuant to the Deed all real
property that any Optionor Party owns and which is located at or in the near
vicinity of 81 East First Street and 15801 First Street in Irwindale,
California, including without limitation all real property owned by any Optionor
Party designated by the following tax parcel identification numbers: APN
8533-011-052, 8533-009-023, 8533-009-024 and 8533-009-021.  In furtherance of
the foregoing, and to account for any changes reasonably requested by Pabst,
MillerCoors and Optionor agree, at Pabst’s request, to cooperate with Pabst
prior to the Closing to update the legal description attached as Exhibit A
hereto and intended to be included in the Deed. Further, the real property
excepted out of the legal description and described on the last two pages of
Exhibit A hereto shall only be so excepted from the real property conveyed to
Pabst at Closing to the extent that such real property (1) was actually conveyed
to Metro Gold Line Foothill Construction Authority pursuant to the Condemnation
Judgment and, (2) for the avoidance of doubt, is not as of the Effective Date
owned by any Optionor Party.


5.    DAMAGE OR CONDEMNATION
5.1    Damage or Condemnation. All risk of loss resulting from any fire, flood
or any other casualty before the Closing shall remain with Optionor. If, before
the Closing, any Purchased Assets shall be materially damaged, or if the
Purchased Assets or any material portion thereof shall become the subject of any
proceedings, judicial, administrative or otherwise, with respect to the taking
by eminent domain or condemnation, Optionor shall notify Pabst in writing in
reasonable detail within five (5) Business Days of the damage or taking, and, if
Pabst has prior to its receipt of such notice delivered the Exercise Notice to
Optionor, then Pabst may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Optionor
given within ten (10) Business Days after Pabst receives written notice from
Optionor of the damage or taking, in which event Escrow Agent shall deliver the
Deposit to Pabst. If the Closing Date is within the aforesaid 10-Business Day
period, then Closing shall be extended to the next Business Day following the
end of said 10-Business Day period. If no such election to terminate is made,
and in any event if the taking or damage is not material (as applicable), this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and, upon the Closing, Optionor
shall assign, transfer and set over to Pabst all of the right, title and
interest of Optionor in and to any awards that have been or that have or may
thereafter be made for such taking, and Optionor shall assign, transfer and set
over to Pabst any insurance proceeds that may thereafter be made for such damage
or destruction, less any amounts reasonably and actually expended by Optionor to
collect any such insurance proceeds or to remedy any unsafe conditions at the
Real Property or, to the extent reasonably approved by Pabst (it being
understood that it would not be considered “reasonable” for Pabst not to approve
any repair or restoration work that any Optionor is required by applicable law)


30


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




to repair or restore any damage provided and the Purchase Price allocated to the
Property will be credited by the amount of the deductible applicable to such
insurance payout to the extent not paid or satisfied as of the Closing. For the
purposes of this paragraph, the phrases “material damage”, “materially damaged”,
“material portion”, and “material taking” shall mean, damage to, or one or more
takings of, all or any portion of the Purchased Assets, (a) exceeding in the
cost of repair and/or value of taken property $5,000,000 in the aggregate, (b)
not covered by insurance, unless Optionor agrees to credit the Purchase Price
for the repair cost of such uninsured casualty not expended by Optionor prior to
Closing or (c) adversely affecting access to the Real Property or Brewery
operations.
6.    ESCROW PROVISIONS
6.1    Deposit. Not later than two (2) Business Days after the Exercise Date,
Pabst shall deposit in escrow with First American Title Insurance Company and,
in such capacity, the “Escrow Agent”; and in its capacity as issuer of the Title
Policy, the “Title Company”), in immediately available federal funds, the sum of
Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) (including interest thereon, the “Deposit”).
In the event that Pabst fails to timely deposit the Deposit with the Escrow
Agent, this Agreement shall terminate and be of no further force and effect
except for such obligations as expressly survive the termination of this
Agreement. At Closing, the Deposit shall be applied to the Purchase Price.
Otherwise, the Deposit shall be delivered to the Party entitled to receive the
Deposit in accordance with the provisions of this Article 6. The Party that
receives the benefit of the Deposit shall be responsible for any income taxes on
the interest portion (if any) of the Deposit.
6.2    Investment and Use of Funds. The Escrow Agent shall invest the Deposit in
government insured interest‑bearing accounts satisfactory to Pabst and Optionor,
shall not commingle the Deposit with any funds of the Escrow Agent or others,
and shall promptly provide Pabst and Optionor with confirmation of the
investments made. If the Closing under this Agreement occurs, the Escrow Agent
shall apply the Deposit to the Purchase Price at Closing and deliver it to
Optionor.
6.3    Termination. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
upon not less than ten (10) Business Days’ prior written notice to the Escrow
Agent and the other Party, Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit to the Party
requesting the same; provided, however, that if the other Party shall, within
said ten (10) Business Day period, deliver to the requesting Party and the
Escrow Agent a written notice that it disputes the claim to the Deposit, Escrow
Agent shall retain the Deposit until it receives written instructions executed
by both Optionor and Pabst as to the disposition and disbursement of the
Deposit, or until ordered by final court order, decree or judgment, which is not
subject to appeal, to deliver the Deposit to a particular Party, in which event
the Escrow Agent shall deliver the Deposit in accordance with such notice,
instruction, order, decree or judgment.
6.4    Interpleader. Pabst and Optionor mutually agree that in the event of any
controversy regarding the Deposit, unless mutual written instructions are
received by the Escrow Agent directing the Deposit’s disposition, the Escrow
Agent shall not take any action, but instead shall await the disposition of any
proceeding relating to the Deposit or, at the Escrow Agent’s option, the Escrow
Agent may interplead all parties and deposit the Deposit with a court of
competent jurisdiction in


31


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




which event the Escrow Agent may recover all of its court costs and reasonable
attorneys’ fees. Pabst and Optionor, whichever loses in any such interpleader
action, shall be solely obligated to pay such costs and fees of the Escrow
Agent, as well as the reasonable attorneys’ fees of the prevailing party in
accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement.
6.5    Liability of Escrow Agent. The Parties acknowledge that the Escrow Agent
is acting solely as a stakeholder at their request and for their convenience,
that the Escrow Agent shall not be deemed to be the agent of either of the
Parties, and that the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to either of the Parties
for any action or omission on its part taken or made in good faith, and not in
disregard of this Agreement, but shall be liable for its negligent acts and for
any loss, cost or expense incurred by Pabst or Optionor resulting from the
Escrow Agent’s mistake of law respecting the Escrow Agent’s scope or nature of
its duties. Optionor and Pabst jointly and severally indemnify and hold the
Escrow Agent harmless from and against all costs, claims and expenses, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees, incurred in connection with the performance of the
Escrow Agent’s duties hereunder, except with respect to actions or omissions
taken or made by the Escrow Agent in bad faith, in disregard of this Agreement
or involving negligence on the part of the Escrow Agent.

Date being allocated to Pabst), and Pabst shall be responsible for payment of

period of ownership. Payments in connection with the final adjustment shall be
due within ten (10) days of written notice. In the event Optionor’s Appeal of

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




10.    DEFAULT AND DAMAGES
10.1    Default by Pabst. If Pabst, following delivery of the Exercise Notice,
defaults in its obligation to purchase the Purchased Assets on the Closing Date,
Optionor shall have the right, after written notice to Pabst and a thirty (30)
day opportunity for Pabst to cure the same (provided however, that in no event
may the Closing Date be extended beyond December 31, 2020), to terminate this
Agreement by written notice to Pabst and thereafter to obtain and retain the
Deposit as liquidated damages to recompense the Optionor and MillerCoors for
time spent, labor and services performed, and the loss of its bargain. Pabst and
MillerCoors and Optionor agree that it would be impracticable or extremely
difficult to affix damages if Pabst so defaults and that the Deposit represents
a reasonable estimate of Optionor’s damages. Optionor and MillerCoors agree to
accept the Deposit as Optionor’s total damages and relief hereunder if Pabst
defaults in any of its obligations to be performed on the Closing Date, and
Optionor thereafter exercises its termination right. If this Agreement is so
terminated, Pabst shall have no further right to purchase the Purchased Assets
and the Option shall have no force and effect.

10.2    Default by Optionor. If (i) Optionor or MillerCoors default in a
material obligation under this Agreement to be performed on or prior to the

the same: (a) to terminate this Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date, in
which event Pabst shall be entitled to the return of the Deposit to Pabst
without any further action by Optionor and MillerCoors and to recover from
Optionor and MillerCoors (on a joint and several basis) an amount equal to third
party out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Pabst in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) to bring a suit for
specific performance of this Agreement or any of its terms, and/or (c) to pursue
any and all other remedies at law or in equity, but (1) in respect of any claims
for breach of the Fundamental Covenant, subject to a liability cap of
$40,000,000, and (2) in respect of any claims for breach of any other covenant,
subject to a liability cap of $10,000,000, except in each case in the event of
intentional misconduct that materially impairs the value of, or Pabst’s use or
operation of, the Purchased Assets. In the event that a Representation Schedule
Update or Optionor’s Rep Certificate discloses information revealing that any of
the representations and warranties of Optionor and/or MillerCoors set forth in
Article 2 or Article 3 is or was untrue in any manner which would have a
Material Adverse Effect or would be untrue in a material respect were it to be
re-made at Closing without the benefit of such Representation Schedule Update or
the inclusion of such information in such Optionor’s Rep Certificate, then,
provided that the relevant information became untrue after the Representation
Date and is not the cause or result of a breach of Optionor’s or MillerCoors’
covenants or agreements herein, then Pabst may elect in its sole discretion (i)
to waive such breach or (ii) to terminate this Agreement, in which event Pabst
shall be entitled to the return of the Deposit to Pabst without any further
action by Optionor and MillerCoors and (if such Representation Schedule Update
or Optionor’s Rep Certificate evidences a material impairment to the value, use
or operation of the

several basis) an amount equal to third party out-of-pocket costs and expenses

which an indemnifying party (an “Indemnifying Party”) may have liability to any
Indemnified Party under this Agreement asserted against or sought to be
collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party (a “Third Party Claim”),
such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event more than twenty (20)
Business Days following such Indemnified Party’s receipt of a Third Party Claim,
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Third Party Claim, the amount
or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then
ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of
such Third Party Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time
constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material
details pertaining thereto (a “Claim Notice”); provided, however, that the
failure timely to give a Claim Notice shall affect the rights of an Indemnified
Party hereunder only to the extent that such failure has a prejudicial effect on
the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to
such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have fifteen (15) Business
Days (or such lesser number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be
required by court proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after receipt
of the Claim Notice (the “Notice Period”) to notify the Indemnified Party that
it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.

a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the
Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and, subject to the provisions of
Section 9.1(b) with respect to an Appeal, shall have the power to direct and
control such defense at the Indemnifying Party’s expense, unless (i) the amount
claimed in such Third Party Claim, together with the aggregate amount of any
pending claims for indemnification by the Indemnifying Party under this Article
11, exceeds (or may exceed) the liability to the Indemnified Party, (ii) such
Third Party Claim is made by any Governmental Entity


43


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




or (iii) such Third Party Claim is made in respect of an Order that would
materially restrict or otherwise materially adversely affect the future activity
or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates (including, in the
case of any Pabst Indemnified Party, the future operations or conduct of the
Purchased Assets (or any portion thereof)). If the Indemnifying Party does not
have the right to defend the Indemnified Party pursuant to the previous
sentence, then the Indemnified Party shall take all reasonable steps necessary
to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days after
the date on which the Claim Notice was required to be delivered. The Indemnified
Party (or the Indemnifying Party if the Indemnifying Party does not have the
right to direct and control defense of a matter) shall have the right, but not
the obligation, to participate in any such defense and to employ separate
counsel of its choosing. If the Indemnified Party elects to participate and
employ separate counsel, the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not
constitute Losses unless the Indemnifying Party does not have the right to
direct and control the defense of such matter or has the right to direct and
control the defense of such matter and fails to take all reasonable steps to
defend diligently such claim, in which case such fees and expenses shall
constitute Losses. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim on a basis that would result in %3. the
imposition of an Order that would restrict or otherwise adversely affect the
future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates
(including, in the case of any Pabst Indemnified Party, the future operations or
conduct of the Purchased Assets (or any portion thereof)), %3. a finding or
admission of a violation of Law or violation of the rights of any Person by the
Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, %3. any monetary liability of the
Indemnified Party that will not be fully and promptly indemnified hereunder by
the Indemnifying Party, or %3. such Indemnified Party not being completely and
unconditionally released from any and all liabilities (including any and all
debts, guaranties, assurances, commitments and obligations of any kind, whether
fixed, contingent or absolute) claimed in the Third Party Claim.
(c)    If the Indemnifying Party %3. elects not to defend the Indemnified Party
against a Third Party Claim, whether by not delivering the Indemnified Party
timely notice of its election to so defend or otherwise, or %3. after assuming
the defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to take reasonable steps necessary to
defend diligently such Third Party Claim within ten (10) Business Days after
receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to the effect that the
Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party shall have the right but
not the obligation to assume its own defense (including settling, compromising
or offering to settle or compromise such Third Party Claim, without the
Indemnifying Party’s consent); provided that the Indemnified Party’s right to
indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected by
assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim.
(d)    The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall reasonably
cooperate in the defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 11.4(b),
including by providing reasonable access to each other’s relevant information,
business records and other documents, and employees; provided that any costs and
expenses related to the investigation and defense of a Third Party Claim
incurred by the Indemnified Party shall be counted as Losses.
(e)    The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use reasonable
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
applicable law), and to cause


44


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




employees, counsel and others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to
avoid production or disclosure of information that would reasonably be expected
to cause the loss or waiver of the protection of any attorney-client privilege,
attorney work product or other relevant legal privilege.
11.5    Direct Claims. In the event of a Closing, if an Indemnified Party wishes
to make a claim for indemnification under this Agreement for a Loss that does
not result from a Third Party Claim (a “Direct Claim”), the Indemnified Party
shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Direct Claim, the amount
or the estimated amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then
ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of
such Direct Claim), any other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time
constraints relating thereto and, to the extent practicable, any other material
details pertaining thereto as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event
no more than twenty (20) Business Days after the Indemnified Party becomes aware
of circumstances indicating that the Indemnified Party has incurred or could
reasonably be expected to incur Losses in respect of which it is entitled to
indemnification hereunder; provided, however, that the failure to timely deliver
notice of a Direct Claim pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall affect the rights
of an Indemnified Party hereunder only to the extent that such failure has a
prejudicial effect on the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnifying
Party with respect to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying Party rejects all
or any part of the Direct Claim or fails to respond within twenty (20) Business
Days of such notice, the Indemnified Party shall be free to seek enforcement of
its rights to indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such Direct
Claim.
11.6    Payments. The Indemnifying Party shall pay all amounts payable pursuant
to this Article 11, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, promptly
following receipt from an Indemnified Party of an invoice, together with all
accompanying reasonably detailed back-up documentation (including bank account
information), for a Loss that is the subject of indemnification hereunder,
unless the Indemnifying Party in good faith disputes the Loss, in which event it
shall so notify the Indemnified Party. In any event, the Indemnifying Party
shall pay to the Indemnified Party, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, the amount of any Loss for which it is liable hereunder no later than
three (3) Business Days following any final determination of such Loss and the
Indemnifying Party’s liability therefor. A “final determination” shall exist
when %4. the Parties have reached an agreement in writing, or %4. with respect
to any Dispute, when such Dispute has been finally settled by arbitration
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 12.4 of this Agreement or by the
Independent Accountants pursuant to and in accordance with Section 12.5 of this
Agreement.
11.7    Characterization of Indemnification Payments. All payments made by an
Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party in respect of any claim pursuant to
Section 11.2 or Section 11.3 shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase
Price for tax purposes.
11.8    Remedies. If the Closing occurs, the rights and remedies of the Parties
under this Article 11 shall be exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights
and remedies the Parties may have after the Closing under this Agreement and
Optionor each expressly waives any and all other rights or causes of action it
or its Affiliates may have against the other Party or its Affiliates arising
under or based on applicable Law with respect to the subject matter hereof. Each
Indemnified Party shall take and shall cause its Affiliates to take reasonable
steps to mitigate the Losses to the extent


45


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




required by Law after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Losses.

third party in respect of such Loss, in each case relating to the matters
described in the notice for the claim.
(d)    No claim for indemnification under Article 11 may be made by either Party
for any Losses to the extent such Losses were specifically included in the

(e)    Any amounts payable pursuant to the indemnification obligations under
this Article 11 shall be paid without duplication, and in no event shall any
Party be entitled to recover indemnification payments under different provisions
of the Agreement in respect of the same Loss.
(f)    If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a third party in respect
of a Loss after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid by an Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this Article 11, the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to
the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the amount paid by the
Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the amount received from the
third party in respect thereof, less (ii) the full amount of the Loss.
(g)    Optionor and MillerCoors shall not be liable with respect to any claim
made pursuant to Section 11.2(a) for breach of representation and warranty if

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




such breach prior to the Closing and (ii) Pabst has the right (due to such
breach) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(a) and nonetheless
elects to Close the transactions contemplated hereunder. For purposes of this
Section 11.9, Pabst shall be deemed to have knowledge of any breach of a
representation or warranty contained herein if the breach was disclosed to Pabst
in the Data Room at least forty-eight (48) hours prior to Closing.
(h)    NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, EXCEPT TO THE
EXTENT AWARDED BY A COURT TO A THIRD PARTY PURSUANT TO A THIRD PARTY CLAIM, AN
INDEMNIFIED PARTY WILL NOT BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER ANY CONSEQUENTIAL OR
INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIM
ASSERTED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE 11 OR INCLUDING ANY RECOVERY UNDER A “MULTIPLE
OF PROFITS,” “MULTIPLE OF CASH FLOW,” “MULTIPLE OF EBITDA” OR SIMILAR VALUATION
METHODOLOGY IN CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF ANY INDEMNIFIABLE LOSSES.
(i)    EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF (A) FRAUD OR AN INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION WITH
AN INTENT TO MISLEAD OR DECEIVE, (B) WITH RESPECT TO THE COVENANTS OF OPTIONOR
AND/OR MILLERCOORS (AND NOT ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES), INTENTIONAL
MISCONDUCT THAT MATERIALLY IMPAIRS THE VALUE OF, OR PABST’S USE OR OPERATION OF,
THE PURCHASED ASSETS OR (C) AS OTHERWISE SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IN SECTION 10.2, SECTION 12.1 OR SECTION
12.2, THE RIGHTS OF INDEMNITY PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE 11 ARE PABST’S SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (INCLUDING ANY AND ALL BREACHES OR ALLEGED
BREACHES OF ANY REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS OR AGREEMENTS OF THE
PARTIES, OR ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY) AND ALL OTHER REMEDIES AND RIGHTS OF INDEMNITY OR

SC1:4886116.33

(a)    Fees of Agents, Advisors. Subject to Section 12.1(b) and Section 12.1(c)

12.2    Confidentiality.
(a)    Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or
stock exchange requirements (based upon reasonable advice of counsel),
no Party to this Agreement shall make any public announcements in respect of
this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or the information obtained
regarding the Purchased Assets or otherwise communicate with any news media in
respect of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Parties
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld). Without the consent of Pabst,

8-K, 10-K or 10-Q filing with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission


48


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




regarding this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that no such filing shall include the Schedules to the
Agreement, unless otherwise required under applicable law or by regulatory
authority. No Party shall make any other press releases, and neither Optionor
nor MillerCoors shall make any announcements to its employees, in each case
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
without the consent of the other Parties hereto, not to be unreasonably
withheld.
(b)    “Confidential Information” of a Party means all information (whether in
written, oral, verbal, electronic, visual or any other form) and materials
regarding the Purchased Assets, the employees of the Optionor Parties, or the
business of the Party which such Party and/or its Affiliates, including without
limitation any employee or representative of such Party and/or its Affiliates
(“Disclosing Party”) has furnished or hereafter furnishes to the other Party
(“Recipient”) or its representatives which the Party and/or its Affiliates would
consider to be proprietary, trade secret or other non-public information of the
Disclosing Party and/or its Affiliates. Confidential Information specifically
includes all information developed or obtained by Pabst in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transition Services
Agreement. A Party’s Confidential Information specifically includes, but is not
limited to, such Party’s and its Affiliates’; pricing, costs and other financial
information, financial projections, customer prospects, customer and supplier
information, employee lists, employee records, employee information, strategic
initiatives, marketing plans, business methods, operating and production
procedures, drawings, artwork, designs, schematics, formulations, processes,
patent applications, research procedures, models, computer programs, unpatented
inventions (including inventions that are the subject of patent applications),
recipes, formulas, prototypes, samples, specifications, test results, analyses,
software, forecasts and studies, and any third party confidential information
included within the information provided by the Disclosing Party and any notes,
reports or analyses prepared by Recipient that contain the foregoing.
“Confidential Information” includes the fact that discussions or negotiations
have taken place or are taking place between the Parties regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the “Purpose”) or any of the terms
or conditions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential
Information of a Disclosing Party does not include any information or materials
which (i) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as result
of a breach by Recipient or its Authorized Persons (defined below) of this
Agreement, (ii) was specifically known to Recipient or its Authorized Persons
prior to receipt thereof by Recipient or its Authorized Persons from Disclosing
Party (other than with respect to information or materials known to Recipient or
its Authorized Persons subject to the terms of a separate confidentiality
agreement with any Optionor Party), (iii) was or is independently developed
without breaching this Agreement by the Recipient or by Recipient’s employees or
agents and where Recipient can demonstrate such independent development, or (iv)
is approved for release by the express written authorization of Disclosing
Party, and then only after such approval and only for the purpose specified.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no Party shall be
prohibited from disclosing the Purchase Price as required by Law or applicable
filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (including an 8-K, 10-K
or 10-Q) and the delivery or recording of the Deed and other Closing documents,
and no Party shall be prohibited from disclosing the Purchase Price or other
relevant terms or conditions of this Agreement in connection with any Appeal or
other action to enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement.


49


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




(c)    Recipient shall keep or cause to be kept in strict confidence all
Confidential Information of Disclosing Party and shall not disclose it to anyone
except to it and its Affiliates, directors, officers, accountants, attorneys,
and a limited group of its employees who are engaged in the evaluation of such
Confidential Information in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, any other person or entity assisting Recipient with the
transaction or participating in the transaction (including potential and actual
co-packers or alternating proprietorships with which Pabst may transact after
the Closing Date) and, in the case of Pabst, Recipient’s prospective and actual
(x) debt and equity sources and (y) Financing Transaction counterparties and (z)
potential and actual co-packers or alternating proprietorships with whom Pabst
may brew beer for after the Closing Date (“Authorized Persons”). All Authorized
Persons shall, prior to any disclosure to them, be informed of the
confidentiality provisions of this Agreement and instructed to treat such
information as confidential as provided for herein. Recipient will use all
Confidential Information only in connection with the Purpose (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, evaluating and/or implementing the transaction with respect
to the Purchased Assets, determining whether to proceed with the contemplated
purchase, or if same is consummated, in connection with the ownership or
operation of the Purchased Assets post-Closing) or for the purpose of fulfilling
its responsibilities hereunder. Recipient shall use at least the same degree of
care in safeguarding Confidential Information of Disclosing Party as Recipient
uses for its own proprietary information of like importance, but in no event
less than reasonable care. Each of the Authorized Persons of Recipient to whom
Confidential Information of Disclosing Party is disclosed will be advised by
Recipient of its confidential nature and of the terms of this Agreement. In the
event of the breach of this Agreement by an Authorized Person, the Disclosing
Party shall have rights against the Authorized Person and the Recipient to the
fullest extent permitted by law, and Recipient agrees to take all steps
necessary to secure such rights. In the event that Disclosing Party deems any of
the Confidential Information to be competitively sensitive information,
Disclosing Party may request that such competitively sensitive information be
reviewed only by Authorized Persons who are third parties and who are not
directors, officers or employees of Recipient or its Affiliates.
(d)    Upon Disclosing Party’s written request after the termination or
expiration of this Agreement, Recipient will either destroy or return to
Disclosing Party all Confidential Information of Disclosing Party which is in
tangible form, including any copies thereof which Recipient or its Authorized
Persons may have made, and Recipient will destroy all abstracts, notes and
summaries thereof and destroy or delete all references thereto in its documents;
provided, however, that Recipient (and its Authorized Persons) may retain copies
of Confidential Information to the extent that failing to do so would be
reasonably likely to violate any applicable law, regulation, request from a
Governmental Entity, or would contravene Recipient’s (or such Authorized
Person’s) record document retention policies or procedures for legal, compliance
or regulatory purposes. If Disclosing Party notifies Recipient in writing as to
any of the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party which it does not wish
copied, Recipient shall comply. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
nothing in this Agreement shall require the destruction of any standard
electronic back-up or archival copies made in the ordinary course of business;
provided that any Confidential Information so retained shall continue to be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, subject to subsection (j)
below. If Recipient or anyone to whom Recipient transmits the Confidential
Information of Disclosing Party is requested or required by applicable law or
regulation, or securities exchange, or by order of a court or Governmental
Entity or otherwise in connection with a legal


50


SC1:4886116.33

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




proceeding (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or
documents, subpoenas, civil investigative demands or otherwise) to disclose any
of such Confidential Information, Recipient will use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide Disclosing Party with prompt notice, if lawful, so that
Disclosing Party may seek, at Disclosing Party’s expense, a protective order or
other appropriate remedy or Disclosing Party will waive compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement. If such protective order or other remedy is not
obtained, or if Disclosing Party waives compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement, Recipient will furnish only that portion of the Confidential
Information of Disclosing Party which Recipient is advised by its counsel it is
legally required to be furnished.
(e)    Recipient recognizes that irreparable injury may result to Disclosing
Party if Recipient breaches any provision of this Section 12.2 and agrees money
damages might not be a sufficient remedy for any breach. Accordingly, if
Recipient or any of its Representatives engage in any act in violation of any
provision of this Section 12.2, Disclosing Party shall be entitled, in addition
to such other remedies as may be available to it under applicable law, to seek
an injunction prohibiting Recipient and its Representatives from engaging in any
such act, or specifically enforcing the terms of this Section 12.2, as the case
may be. The Parties waive any requirement for the posting of any bond or the
showing of actual monetary damages.
(f)    Except as provided in Article 3, neither the Disclosing Party nor any of
its Representatives or Affiliates makes any representation or warranty,
expressed or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential
Information disclosed to the Recipient hereunder. Except as expressly provided
in this Agreement, neither the Disclosing Party nor any of its Representatives
or its Affiliates shall be liable to the Recipient or any of its Representatives
relating to or resulting from the Recipient’s use of any of the Confidential
Information or any errors therein or omissions therefrom; provided that this
shall apply only with respect to this Agreement and not with respect to any
other agreement entered into between the Parties.
(g)    Each Party agrees to comply with all laws in connection with its receipt
and any transmission of Confidential Information, including without limitation
any privacy and data security laws. Recipient shall not be held criminally or
civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for any disclosure of
a trade secret that is made in confidence to a federal, state or local
government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and solely
for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law or is
made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or
other proceeding.
(h)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Pabst may
record a memorandum of this Option in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C (the
“Option Memorandum”) with the Los Angeles County Recorder’s Office.
(i)    This Section 12.2 is subject to the additional terms and provisions set
forth in Section 1.7 above.
(j)    The Parties’ obligations under this Section 12.2 will continue until the
earlier of (a) Closing and (b) five (5) years following the Effective Date, at
which time the Parties obligations under this Section 12.2 shall terminate and
be of no further force or effect; provided that any trade


51

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------




secrets shall survive for so long as such trade secret is considered to be a
trade secret under applicable law.
12.3    Notices. All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications under
this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given

12.4    Dispute Resolution.
(a)    Dispute. As used in this Agreement, “Dispute” means any dispute or
disagreement between or among Optionor, Pabst and/or MillerCoors concerning the
interpretation of this Agreement, the validity of this Agreement, any breach or
alleged breach by any Party of this Agreement or any other matter relating in
any way to this Agreement; provided that Dispute shall not include a dispute
concerning Section 12.2 or any other confidentiality agreement between the

subsections (c) through (e) below.
(c)    Negotiations. The Parties will promptly attempt to resolve any Dispute by

resolved by these Parties within thirty-five (35) calendar days of the disputing
Party’s notice, or if the Parties fail to meet within such thirty (30) calendar
days, either the Optionor or Pabst may initiate arbitration as provided in
Section 12.4(d). If a Party intends to be accompanied at a meeting by legal
counsel, the other Party will be given at least three (3) Business Days’ notice
of such intention and may also be accompanied by legal counsel.

(WITH AT LEAST TEN (10 YEARS EXPERIENCE ARBITRATING COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE OR
MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS DISPUTES IN CALIFORNIA) IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE JAMS
COMPREHENSIVE ARBITRATION RULES AND PROCEDURES. SUCH DECISION SHALL BE BINDING

extended by mutual agreement between the Optionor and Pabst.

(ii)

binding on them. In case of a violation of the obligations in Section 12.4(b),
(c) and (d) by any Party, the other Party may bring an action to seek
enforcement of such obligations in a court of law as set forth in Section 12.7
(subject to the terms of Section 12.6).

(iv)
Replacement. With respect to proceedings under Section 12.4(d), if JAMS is no

for purposes of settling the items in dispute. In the event the Parties cannot
mutually agree on the Independent Accountants after providing at least three
suggestions each, either Party may choose to have an arbitrator determine the

the provisions of this Agreement. The Independent Accountants may specify
appropriate procedures for resolving the disputed items, including requesting

Accountants shall have the legal effect of an arbitral award and shall be final
and binding on the Parties. The Independent Accountants shall determine the

Parties, with such fees and expenses being borne in inverse proportion to the
degree to which the Independent Accountants accepted the positions of the

12.8    Waiver. The rights and remedies of the Parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any Party
in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right,
power, or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power,
or privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power,
or privilege or the exercise of any other right, power, or privilege.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent Pabst does not exercise its option
rights within the time periods set forth herein, Pabst’s rights shall be deemed
to be waived. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or
right arising out of this Agreement or the documents referred to in this
Agreement can be discharged by one Party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or
renunciation of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other Party;

specific instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one
Party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such Party or of the
right of the Party giving such notice or demand to take further action without
notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in

12.9    Entire Agreement and Modification. This Agreement and the Settlement
Agreement supersede all prior discussions and agreements between the Parties
with respect to the option to purchase the Brewery. This Agreement, the
Settlement Agreement and, with respect to the site visit referenced therein, the
Location Access Agreement dated January 28, 2019, constitute a complete and
exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the Parties with
respect to the Option to purchase the Brewery. This Agreement may not be amended
except by a written agreement executed by all of the Parties hereto. In the
event of a conflict between this Agreement and the Settlement Agreement, this
Agreement shall control.
12.10    Assignments, Successors, and No Third-Party Rights. No Party may assign
or transfer any of its rights under this Agreement, whether voluntarily or by
operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and
any such assignment shall be null and void; provided, however, that Pabst shall
have the right to assign and transfer this Agreement (and/or any right to
acquire the Purchased Assets under this Agreement) without Optionor’s or
MillerCoors’ consent if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (a) as of
the date of such assignment, the assignee of Pabst must be an entity (x) in
which Pabst directly or indirectly owns and controls at least a fifty one
percent (51%) equity or like ownership and fifty one percent (51%) voting
interest (each, a “Pabst Entity”) or (y) an entity which is at least 51% owned
(directly or indirectly) by an entity which also directly or indirectly owns at
least 51% of Pabst, (b) the assignee shall assume all obligations of Pabst
hereunder (but, subject to the last sentence of this Section 12.10, from and
after such assumption Pabst shall not be conditionally discharged from any of
its obligations and liabilities under or in connection with this Agreement
unless discharged in writing by Optionor and MillerCoors); and (c) a copy of the
fully executed assignment and

delivered to Optionor at least 30 days prior to Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the assignee may not be a Prohibited Transferee. If Pabst assigns
this Agreement in accordance with this Section 12.10, Optionor shall not be
obligated to use its commercially reasonable efforts to aid Pabst in having
consents re-assigned if already obtained or re-assigned or re-issued to Pabst’s
assignee. Nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will be construed
to give any person other than the Parties to this Agreement any legal or
equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or any
provision of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
any restriction on Pabst set forth in this Section 12.10 shall be terminated as
of the Closing; provided that Section 1.10 (Post-Closing Transactions) shall be
in full force and effect. For the avoidance of doubt, no Sale of Pabst shall
constitute an assignment or transfer for purposes of this Section 12.10.
12.11    Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or
unenforceable by any arbitrator or in the case of breaches of the
confidentiality obligations or any access agreements, a court of competent
jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force
and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only
in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to the extent not held
invalid or unenforceable.
