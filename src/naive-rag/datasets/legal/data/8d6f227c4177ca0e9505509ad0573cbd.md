clause (b) being referred to herein as the “Floor Price” and being calculated as
set forth in this Section 5.1).
(a)    If the Company issues any Equity Securities after the Effective Date that
are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (a “Derivative Security”),
then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the
instrument relating thereto) issuable upon the exercise or conversion of such
Derivative Securities shall be used in determining the effective price per share
at which the underlying Common Stock was offered and sold in calculating the
Floor Price.


11



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





(b)     If the terms of any Derivative Security are revised as a result of an
amendment to such terms (or any other adjustment pursuant to the provisions of
such Derivative Security) to provide for either (1) any increase or decrease in
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise, conversion
and/or exchange of any such Derivative Security or (2) any increase or decrease
in the consideration payable to the Company upon such exercise, conversion
and/or exchange, then, effective upon such increase or decrease becoming
effective, the effective sale price of the underlying Common Stock for purposes
of this Section 5.1 shall be readjusted to such price as would have obtained had
such revised terms been in effect upon the original date of issuance of such
Derivative Security.
(c)    If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise,
conversion and/or exchange of any Derivative Security, or the consideration
payable to the Company upon such exercise, conversion and/or exchange, is
calculable at the time such Derivative Security is issued or amended but is
subject to adjustment based upon subsequent events, any adjustment to the Floor
Price shall be effected at the time of such issuance or amendment based on such
number of shares or amount of consideration without regard to any provisions for
subsequent adjustments (and any subsequent adjustments shall be treated as
provided in Section 5.1(b)). If the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon the exercise, conversion and/or exchange of any Derivative Security, or the
consideration payable to the Company upon such exercise, conversion and/or
exchange, cannot be calculated at all at the time such Derivative Security is
issued or amended, any adjustment to the Floor Price that would result at the
time of such issuance or amendment shall instead be effected at the time such
number of shares and/or amount of consideration is first calculable (even if
subject to subsequent adjustments), assuming for purposes of calculating such
adjustment to the Conversion Price that such issuance or amendment took place at
the time such calculation can first be made.
(d)    The Company shall provide prompt (and in any event, within two Business
Days) written notice to the Purchasers of any event or occurrence that gives
rise to an adjustment in the Conversion Price under this Section 5.1.
5.2    Conversion Mechanics. If a Purchaser elects to convert any portion of a
Note pursuant to Section 5.1, the Purchaser shall (a) tender to the Company a
conversion notice in substantially the form attached as Exhibit A to the Note (a
“Conversion Notice”), and (b) surrender to the Company the Note to be converted,
which shall be tendered to the Company within two Trading Days from the delivery
of the Conversion Notice. The Company shall deliver the Common Stock to a
Purchaser by the later of (x) two Trading Days after delivery of the Conversion
Notice, or (y) delivery of the Note that is the subject of the Conversion Notice
(the “Share Delivery Date”).
5.3    Beneficial Ownership Conversion Limits. Notwithstanding Section 5.1, the
Purchaser shall not have the right to convert all or any portion of the Notes
held by such Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.1 or otherwise, to the extent that
after giving effect to such conversion the Purchaser (together with its
Affiliates and any other Persons acting as a group together with the Purchaser
or any of the Purchaser’s Affiliates (such Persons, collectively, the
“Attribution Parties”)), would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation


12



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





(as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares
of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Purchaser and its Affiliates and
Attribution Parties shall not include the number of shares of Common Stock that
would be issuable upon (i) exercise of the non-exercised portion of the Warrants
beneficially owned by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Attribution
parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted
portion of any other securities of the Company in each case to the extent
subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation
contained herein beneficially owned by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or
Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes
of this Section 5.3, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with
Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being
acknowledged by the Purchaser that the Company is not representing to the
Purchaser that such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the Purchaser is solely responsible for any schedules required
to be filed in accordance therewith. A determination as to any “group” status as
contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes
of this Section 5.3, in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common
Stock, a Purchaser may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock
as reflected in (A) the Company’s most recent periodic or annual report filed
with the SEC, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the
Company or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company setting forth the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request
of the Purchaser, the Company shall, within one Trading Day, confirm orally and
in writing to the Purchaser the number of shares of Common Stock then
outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of
the Company by the Purchaser or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the
date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was last
publicly reported or confirmed to the Purchaser. The “Beneficial Ownership
Limitation” shall initially be 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to, and immediately after giving effect to, the
conversion of all or any portion of the Notes. The Purchaser, upon written
notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation provisions in this Section 5.3, provided that the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 19.99% of the number of shares of the
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to, and immediately after giving
effect to, the conversion of all or any portion of the Notes. Any increase in
the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61st day
after such notice is delivered to the Company.
5.4    Nasdaq Conversion and Exercise Limits. Without limiting the Purchaser’s
rights under Section 5.5, in no event shall the Company be required to issue
shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Notes or exercise of the Warrants
in excess of 9,939,689 shares in the aggregate, without stockholder approval of
such issuances in excess of that level pursuant to Nasdaq Marketplace Rule
5635(d) (the “Nasdaq Issuance Limit”). The Company will seek stockholder
approval of the waiver of the Nasdaq Issuance Limit (“Stockholder Approval”) at
a special meeting of Stockholders, which will be held no later than three months
after the Effective Date (the “2020 Special Meeting”). To the extent that the
Company does not receive such stockholder approval at the initial special
meeting, then the Company will, at the request of any


13



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Purchaser, use reasonable best efforts to receive such approval at subsequent
special or annual meetings of stockholders, which special meetings will be
called at such times as may be requested by the Purchaser(s); provided that, in
no event shall more than three such additional special meetings be called.
5.5    Alternate Settlement. If, at any time after the earlier of the 2020
Special Meeting or six months after the Effective Date, the Company is unable to
timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon an attempted exercise of the Warrants
or conversion of the Notes (other than solely due to the application of the
Beneficial Ownership Limitation), then in lieu of the Company’s obligation to
deliver such shares of Common Stock, the Company shall instead pay an amount in
cash to the Purchaser(s) on the settlement date, with such amount equal to the
product of: (i) the number of shares of Common Stock that the Company is unable
to deliver at the time of the attempted exercise or conversion (as applicable),
multiplied by (ii) the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the
Trading Market on the day on which such notice of conversion or exercise was
delivered to the Company (the “Alternate Settlement Payment”). If applicable,
the Company shall provide prompt notice (and in any event within 24 hours) of
its inability to deliver the underlying shares of Common Stock and thereafter
shall deliver the Alternate Settlement Payment by wire transfer within two
Trading Days to an account designated by the Purchaser.
5.6    Untimely Settlement. If the Company has the ability to timely deliver
shares of Common Stock upon an attempted exercise of the Warrants or conversion
of the Notes but nevertheless fails to issue and deliver such shares to the
Purchaser (or its designee) by 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) on the Share Delivery
Date, then a “Conversion Failure” shall be deemed to exist. In that case, the
Purchaser can either: (a) elect to receive an Alternate Settlement Payment in
lieu of the shares of Common Stock that gave rise to the Conversion Failure, or
(b) if the Purchaser purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise)
Common Stock corresponding to all or any portion of the Common Stock that gave
rise to the Conversion Failure, then the Company shall, within two Trading Days
after receipt of the Purchaser’s request and in the Purchaser’s discretion,
either (i) pay cash to the Purchaser in an amount equal to the Purchaser’s total
purchase price (including brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket
expenses, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased (the “Buy-In
Price”), at which point the Company’s obligation to deliver such certificate
(and to issue such Common Stock) shall terminate, or (ii) promptly honor its
obligation to so issue and deliver to the Purchaser a certificate or
certificates representing such Common Stock and pay cash to the Purchaser in the
amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product of (x)
such number of shares of Common Stock that are the subject of the Conversion
Failure multiplied by (y) the VWAP of the Common Stock on the date of the
Conversion Notice.
5.7    Put Right in Favor of Purchaser.
(a)    If a Repurchase Event occurs, then each Purchaser may, at its option,
elect to require the Company to repurchase in cash the Notes held by such
Purchaser (or any portion thereof) at a repurchase price equal to 110% of the
Outstanding Balance of such Notes, plus accrued but unpaid interest thereon. The
Company shall provide the Purchasers with prompt


14



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





(and in any event within three Business Days) written notice of the occurrence
of any Repurchase Event. Any such payment shall be due within three Business
Days after the date that the applicable Purchaser delivers notice of such
election.
(b)    If (i) an Event of Default occurs or (ii) upon a Change of Control or
liquidation of the Company, each Purchaser may elect, at its option, to require
the Company to repurchase in cash the Notes held by such Purchaser (or any
portion thereof) at a repurchase price equal to the sum of: (x) three times sum
of the Outstanding Balance of such Notes and any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon, and (y) the Make-Whole Amount. The Company shall provide the Purchasers
with prompt (and in any event within three Business Days) written notice of the
occurrence of such Event of Default or Change of Control or liquidation of the
Company. Any such payment shall be due within three Business Days after the date
that the applicable Purchaser delivers notice of such election.

Shares and the provision to the Purchaser of the rights contemplated by the
Transaction Documents) will not (i) result in a violation of the certificate of

Company or any Subsidiary is a party, nor has the Company or any Subsidiary

16



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





notice of a claim that it is in default under, or that it is in violation of,
any Material Contract (whether or not such default or violation has been
waived), (iii) in violation of, or in receipt of written notice that it is in
violation of, any law, ordinance or regulation of any Governmental Entity,

6.5    Capitalization.
(a)    As of the Effective Date, the authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 305,000,000 shares of capital stock, of which 300,000,000 are
designated as Common Stock and 5,000,000 are designated as preferred stock,

or other rights to acquire Equity Securities from the Company.
6.6    Subsidiaries. Except as set forth on Exhibit 21.1 to the Company’s most
recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company does not have any Subsidiaries,
and each such Subsidiary is wholly owned (directly or indirectly) by the

6.7    Material Contracts. Each Material Contract is the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Company or a Subsidiary, as the case may be,
enforceable against the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that enforceability may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
conveyance, and any other laws of general application affecting enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally, and as limited by laws relating to the availability
of specific performance, injunctive relief, or other equitable remedies. The
Company and each Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in compliance with all
material terms of the Material Contracts to which it is party, and there has not
occurred any breach, violation or default or any event that, with the lapse of
time, the giving of notice or the election of any Person, or any combination
thereof, would constitute a breach, violation or default by the Company or any
Subsidiary under any such Material Contract or, to the knowledge of the Company
and each Subsidiary, by any other Person to any such contract


17



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





except where such breach, violation or default would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has been notified that any party
to any Material Contract intends to cancel, terminate, not renew or exercise an
option under any Material Contract, whether in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or otherwise.
6.8    The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Common Stock is listed on The Nasdaq Capital
Market (“Nasdaq”) and, at the time of the issuance, the Shares will be listed
for trading on Nasdaq. To the Company’s knowledge, there are no proceedings to
revoke or suspend such listing or the listing of the Shares. The Company is in
compliance with the requirements of Nasdaq for continued listing of the Common
Stock thereon and any other Nasdaq listing and maintenance requirements, and the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company and the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the issuance of the Shares) will not result in any noncompliance by the Company
with any such requirements.
6.9    SEC Reports; Financial Statements; Shell Company Status.
(a)    The Company’s Common Stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange
Act. The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents required to be filed by the Company under the Exchange Act, including
pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) thereof, since January 1, 2019 (the foregoing
materials, including the exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by
reference therein, being collectively referred to herein as the “SEC Reports”)
on a timely basis or has received a valid extension of such time of filing and
has filed any such SEC Reports prior to the expiration of any such extension. As
of their respective dates, the SEC Reports complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and, in each case, to the rules
promulgated thereunder, as applicable, and none of the SEC Reports, when filed,
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.
(b)    The financial statements and the related notes of the Company included in
the SEC Reports comply in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the rules and regulations of the Commission with respect
thereto as in effect at the time of filing. Such financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP, except as may be otherwise specified in such
financial statements or the notes thereto and except that unaudited financial
statements may not contain all footnotes required by GAAP, and fairly present
the consolidated financial position of the Company as of and for the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended, subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal,
immaterial, year-end audit adjustments. There is no transaction, arrangement, or
other relationship between the Company or any Subsidiary and an unconsolidated
or other off balance sheet entity that is required to be disclosed by the
Company in SEC Reports and is not so disclosed and would have or reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
(c)    The Company is not, and has never been, an issuer identified in Rule
144(i)(1) under the Securities Act.


18



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





6.10    Disclosure Controls and Procedures; Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting.
(a)    The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are
effective in all material respects to ensure that material information relating
to the Company, including any consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to its
principal executive officer and principal financial officer by others within
those entities. The Company’s certifying officers have evaluated the
effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end
of the period covered by the most recently filed quarterly or annual periodic
report under the Exchange Act (such date, the “Evaluation Date”). The Company
presented in its most recently filed quarterly or annual periodic report under
the Exchange Act the conclusions of the certifying officers about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures based on their
evaluations as of the Evaluation Date.
(b)    The Company maintains internal control over financial reporting (as such
term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with GAAP and such internal control over financial reporting is effective. The
Company presented in its most recently filed annual report under the Exchange
Act the conclusions of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on their evaluations
as of the end of the period covered by such report. Since the Evaluation Date,
there have been no significant changes in the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting or, to the Company’s knowledge, in other factors that could
significantly affect the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
6.11    Absence of Litigation. There is no claim, action, suit, arbitration,
investigation or other proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of the
Company and each Subsidiary, threatened against or affecting, the Company, any
Subsidiary or any of the Company’s or any Subsidiary’s properties or, to the
knowledge of the Company and each Subsidiary, any of its respective officers or
directors before any Governmental Entity, in each case other than legal
proceedings that are not reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary, nor any director or officer
thereof, is or has been the subject of any action involving a claim of violation
of or liability under federal or state securities laws or a claim of breach of
fiduciary duty relating to the Company or any Subsidiary. There has not been,
and to the knowledge of the Company and each Subsidiary, there is not pending or
contemplated, any investigation by the Commission of the Company or any
Subsidiary or any current or former director or officer of the Company or any
Subsidiary. The Company has not received any stop order or other order
suspending the effectiveness of any registration statement filed by the Company
under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act and, to the Company’s knowledge,
the SEC has not issued any such order.
6.12    Due Authorization; Consents. All corporate action on the part of each
Loan Party and its officers, directors and stockholders necessary for (a) the
authorization, execution and delivery of, and the performance of all obligations
of such Loan Party under this Agreement and


19



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





the other Note Documents, (b) the authorization, issuance, execution and
delivery of the Notes and Warrants by the Company and (c) the authorization,
issuance, reservation for issuance and delivery by the Company of all of the
equity securities issuable upon conversion of the Outstanding Balance (and the
securities issuable upon conversion thereof) has been taken. This Agreement, the
Note Documents and each of the Notes and Warrants constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Loan Parties party thereto, enforceable in accordance
with its terms, subject, as to enforcement of remedies, to applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization and similar laws affecting
creditors’ rights generally and to general equitable principles. All consents,
approvals and authorizations of, and registrations, qualifications and filings
with, any federal or state governmental agency, authority or body, or any third
party, required in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement, the Notes, Warrants and the other Note Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been
obtained; provided, however, that with respect to any required filings under
Regulation D or any other federal or state securities filings, the Company will
make such filings within fifteen business days after the Effective Date.
6.13    Valid Issuance of Stock. The outstanding shares of the capital stock of
each Loan Party have been duly and validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable, and such shares of such capital stock, and all outstanding
options and other securities of each Loan Party have been issued in full
compliance with the registration and prospectus delivery requirements of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and the registration
and qualification requirements of all applicable state securities laws, or in
compliance with applicable exemptions therefrom, and all other provisions of
applicable federal and state securities laws, including, without limitation,
anti-fraud provisions.
6.14    Compliance with Laws.
(a)    Except as would not result in a Material Adverse Effect: (i) the Company
is and has been in compliance with statutes, laws, ordinances, rules and

“Authorizations”) and such Authorizations are valid and in full force and effect
and the Company is not in violation of any term of any such Authorizations;
(iii) the Company has not received any written notice of adverse finding,
warning letter or other written correspondence or notice from the U.S. Food and

or Authorizations or has any knowledge that any such Governmental Entity or
third party is considering any such claim, litigation, arbitration, action,
suit, investigation or proceeding, nor, to the Company’s knowledge, has there

that would reasonably be expected to require the issuance of any such written
notice or result in an investigation, corrective action, or enforcement action
by the FDA or similar Governmental Entity with respect to a Company Product; (v)
the Company has not received written notice that any Governmental Entity has

(vi) the Company has filed, obtained, maintained or submitted all reports,

the Company, have been and, if still pending, are being conducted in all

descriptions of the results of such clinical studies and tests contained in the
SEC Reports are accurate and complete in all material respects and fairly
present the data derived from such clinical studies and tests; the Company is
not aware of any clinical studies or tests, the results of which the Company
believes reasonably call into question the research, nonclinical or clinical
study or test results described or referred to in the SEC Reports when viewed in
the context in which such results are described; and the Company has not
received any written notices or correspondence from any Governmental Entity

challenging the validity or scope of any Company Intellectual Property. There is
no pending or, to the Company’s knowledge, threatened action, suit, proceeding
or claim by others that the Company infringes or otherwise violates any patent,
trademark, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary rights of others. The
Company is not aware of any facts required to be disclosed to the USPTO which

patent in connection with any patent application of the Company Intellectual
Property or could form the basis of a finding of invalidity with respect to any

authority, and (d) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has incurred any
material liabilities except in the ordinary course of business.
6.17    Application of Takeover Protections. The Company and its Board of
Directors have taken all necessary action, if any, in order to render

(including any distribution under a rights agreement) or other similar
anti-takeover provision under the Company’s Charter Documents or the laws of its
state of incorporation (including Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law) that is or could become applicable to each Purchaser as a
result of such Purchaser and the Company fulfilling their obligations or
exercising their rights under this Agreement, including without limitation as a
result of the Company’s issuance of the Shares and such Purchaser’s ownership of
the Shares.
6.18    Compliance with Other Instruments. The authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the issuance and delivery of the Notes, the
execution and delivery of any other Note Document and the performance of all
obligations hereunder and thereunder, will not constitute or result in a breach,
default or violation of: (a) any law or regulation applicable to any Loan Party,
(b) any term or provision of the Company’s current certificate of incorporation
or bylaws (or any comparable organization document of any Loan Party), or (c)
any material agreement or instrument by which any Loan Party is bound or to

result in a Material Adverse Effect.

whole.
(b)    Each Loan Party owns, or is licensed or otherwise has the right to use,
all intellectual property necessary to conduct its business as currently

either individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, business, or operations of the Loan Parties taken as a
whole. To the knowledge of each Loan Party, (a) the conduct and operations of
the businesses of each Loan Party do not, and the anticipated products and

Person and (b) no other Person has contested any right, title or interest of any
Loan Party in any Intellectual Property Collateral or any anticipated products

representations or warranties with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby other than those specifically set forth in Section 7 hereof.
(b)    To the extent that the Company makes a material misrepresentation under
Section 6 and, within one year from the applicable Closing, a Purchaser provides
written notice of such material misrepresentation, then such Purchaser may elect
to rescind the purchase of the Securities purchased within that one-year period,
whereupon such Purchaser will tender the Note and the Warrant to the Company in
consideration for the applicable Purchase Price. The foregoing rescission right
shall be in addition to any other rights or remedies that the Purchaser may have
under the Transaction Documents or under applicable law, provided that if such


23

Purchaser elects the foregoing rescission remedy and is refunded the Purchase
Price, then such Purchaser may not assert any other remedies under the
Transaction Documents.

unconditionally guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, to
each Purchaser and its successors and assigns the full and punctual payment when
due and full and punctual performance within applicable grace periods of all
Secured Obligations (all the foregoing being hereinafter collectively called the
“Guaranteed Obligations”). Each Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranteed
Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice or
further assent from each such Guarantor, and that each such Guarantor shall
remain bound under this Section 11 notwithstanding any extension or renewal of
any Guaranteed Obligation.
(b)    Each Guarantor waives presentation to, demand of payment from and protest
to the Company of any of the Guaranteed Obligations and also waives notice of
protest for nonpayment. Each Guarantor waives notice of any Event of Default
under this Agreement or the Notes or the Guaranteed Obligations. The obligations
of each Guarantor hereunder shall not be affected by (i) the failure of any
Purchaser or the Designated Agent to assert any claim or demand or to enforce
any right or remedy against the Company or any other Person under this
Agreement, the Note Documents or any other agreement or otherwise; (ii) any
extension or renewal of any thereof; (iii) any rescission, waiver, amendment or
modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, the Notes or
any other agreement; (iv) the release of any security held by any Purchaser or
the Designated Agent for the Guaranteed Obligations or any of


32



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





them; (v) the failure of any Purchaser or the Designated Agent to exercise any
right or remedy against any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations; or
(vi) any change in the ownership of such Guarantor.
(c)    Each Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee herein constitutes a
guarantee of payment, performance and compliance when due (and not a guarantee
of collection) and waives any right to require that any resort be had by any
Purchaser or the Designated Agent to any security held for payment of the
Guaranteed Obligations.
(d)    Except as expressly set forth in this Section 11, the obligations of each
Guarantor hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation,
impairment or termination for any reason, including any claim of waiver,
release, surrender, alteration or compromise, and shall not be subject to any
defense of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever or by
reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of the Guaranteed
Obligations or otherwise (other than the defense of payment in full of the
Secured Obligations, other than unasserted contingent obligations). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the obligations of each Guarantor
herein shall not be discharged or impaired or otherwise affected by the failure
of any Purchaser or the Designated Agent to assert any claim or demand or to
enforce any remedy under this Agreement, the Note Documents or any other
agreement, by any waiver or modification of any thereof, by any default, failure
or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of the obligations, or by any
other act or thing or omission or delay to do any other act or thing which may
or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any Guarantor or would
otherwise operate as a discharge of any Guarantor as a matter of law or equity.
(e)    Except as otherwise provided herein, each Guarantor agrees that its
guarantee shall remain in full force and effect until payment in full of all the
Guaranteed Obligations, other than unasserted contingent obligations. Each
Guarantor further agrees that its guarantee herein shall continue to be
effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any
part thereof, of principal of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation is
rescinded or must otherwise be restored by any Purchaser or the Designated Agent
upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or otherwise.
(f)    In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right
which any Purchaser or the Designated Agent has at law or in equity against any
Guarantor by virtue hereof, upon the failure of the Company to pay the principal
of or interest on any Guaranteed Obligation when and as the same shall become
due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, by redemption or otherwise, or to
perform or comply with any other Guaranteed Obligation, each Guarantor hereby
promises to and shall, upon receipt of written demand by the Designated Agent,
forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to the Purchasers or the Designated
Agent an amount equal to the sum of (i) the unpaid principal amount of such
Guaranteed Obligations, (ii) accrued and unpaid interest on such Guaranteed
Obligations required under the Note Documents (but only to the extent not
prohibited by law) and (iii) all other monetary obligations of the Company to
the Purchasers and the Designated Agent required under the Note Documents.


33



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





(g)    Each Guarantor agrees that it shall not be entitled to any right of
subrogation in relation to the Purchasers in respect of any Guaranteed
Obligations guaranteed hereby until payment in full of all Guaranteed
Obligations, other than unasserted contingent obligations. Each Guarantor
further agrees that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Purchasers and the
Designated Agent, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of the Guaranteed
Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 9 for
the purposes of any guarantee herein, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or
other prohibition preventing such acceleration in respect of the Guaranteed
Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (ii) in the event of any declaration of
acceleration of such Guaranteed Obligations as provided in Section 9 of this
Agreement, such Guaranteed Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall
forthwith become due and payable by such Guarantor for the purposes of this
Section 11.1.
(h)    Each Guarantor also agrees to pay any and all costs and expenses
(including reasonable documented attorney’s fees and expenses) incurred by the
Designated Agent or any Purchaser in enforcing any rights under this Section
11.1.
(i)    Upon request of the Designated Agent, each Guarantor shall execute and
deliver such further instruments and do such further acts as may be reasonably
necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purpose of this Agreement.
11.2    Limitation on Liability. Any term or provision of this Agreement to the
contrary notwithstanding, the maximum aggregate amount of the Guaranteed
Obligations guaranteed hereunder by any Guarantor shall not exceed the maximum
amount that can be hereby guaranteed without rendering this Agreement, as it
relates to such Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent
conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally.
12.    MISCELLANEOUS.
12.1    Participation in Future Offerings.
(a)    From the Initial Closing Date through the date on which the Company
achieves the Funding Threshold, the Company shall not issue, sell or exchange,
agree or obligate itself to issue, sell or exchange, or reserve or set aside for
issuance, sale or exchange, in any Equity Financing any Equity Securities,
unless in each case the Company shall have first offered to the Purchasers the
right to purchase (in the aggregate) at least 20% of such securities, including
any overallotment options (collectively, the “Offered Securities”). Each
Purchaser shall have the right to subscribe for a portion of the Offered
Securities in any such offering (a “Subsequent Financing”) equal to the portion
of the Notes purchased at the Initial Closing relative to the aggregate value of
the Notes issued at the Initial Closing, with such purchase at a price and on
such other terms as will be offered to third parties. In the event the
Subsequent Financing is an underwritten offering, the Company shall instruct its
underwriter or placement agent for such offering to contact each Purchaser
promptly following the first public announcement of such offering and thereafter
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Purchaser is provided a full
allocation of securities in such offering.


34



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





(b)     In furtherance of the purchase right in Subsequent Financings as set
forth in Section 12.1(a), at least 10 Business Days prior to the closing of the
Subsequent Financing, the Company shall deliver to the Purchasers a written
notice of its intention to effect a Subsequent Financing (“Pre-Notice”), which
Pre-Notice shall ask each Purchaser if it wishes to review the details of such
financing in order to confirm whether such Purchaser wishes to participate in
such financing (such additional notice, a “Subsequent Financing Notice”). Upon
the request of a Purchaser, and only upon a request by such Purchaser, for a
Subsequent Financing Notice, the Company shall promptly, but no later than one
Business Day after such request, deliver a Subsequent Financing Notice to the
Purchaser. By receipt of such Subsequent financing Notice, the requesting
Purchaser shall be deemed to have acknowledged that the Subsequent Financing
Notice may contain material non-public information. The Subsequent Financing
Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the proposed terms of such Subsequent
Financing, the amount of proceeds intended to be raised thereunder and the
person or persons through or with whom such Subsequent Financing is proposed to
be effected and shall include a term sheet or similar document relating thereto
as an attachment.
(c)    If a Purchaser wishes to participate in such Subsequent Financing, such
Purchaser must provide written notice to the Company by not later than 5:30 p.m.
(New York City time) on the fifth Business Day after the Purchaser has received
the Subsequent Financing Notice that the Purchaser is willing to participate in
the Subsequent Financing, the amount of the Purchaser’s participation, and
representing and warranting that the Purchaser has such funds ready, willing,
and available for investment on the terms set forth in the Subsequent Financing
Notice. If the Company receives no such notice from the Purchaser as of such
fifth Business Day, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have notified the Company
that it does not elect to participate and the Company may effect the Subsequent
Financing on the terms and with the persons set forth in the Subsequent
Financing Notice.
(d)    If by 5:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth Business Day after the
Purchaser has received the Subsequent Financing Notice, the Company has received
written notification by the Purchaser of its willingness to participate in the
Subsequent Financing (or to cause its designees to participate), then the
Company shall effect the Subsequent Financing with the Purchaser (in the amount
indicated in its notification up to the Participation Maximum) and, with respect
to the remaining portion of such Subsequent Financing on the terms and with the
Persons set forth in the Subsequent Financing Notice.
(e)    The Company must provide the Purchaser with a second Subsequent Financing
Notice, and the Purchaser will again have the right of participation set forth
above in this Section 12.1, if the Subsequent Financing subject to the initial
Subsequent Financing Notice is amended in any material respect or is not
consummated for any reason on the terms set forth in such Subsequent Financing
Notice within 30 Business Days after the date of the initial Subsequent
Financing Notice.
(f)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12.1 and unless
otherwise agreed to by the Purchaser, the Company shall either confirm in
writing to the Purchaser that the transaction with respect to the Subsequent
Financing has been abandoned or


35



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





shall publicly disclose its intention to issue the securities in the Subsequent
Financing, in either case, in such a manner such that the Purchaser will not be
in possession of any material, non-public information, by the 30th Business Day
following delivery of the Subsequent Financing Notice. If by such 30th Business
Day, no public disclosure regarding a transaction with respect to the Subsequent
Financing has been made, and no notice regarding the abandonment of such
transaction has been received by the Purchaser, such transaction shall be deemed
to have been abandoned and the Purchaser shall not be deemed to be in possession
of any material, non-public information with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.
12.2    Disclosure; Publicity. Prior to public disclosure of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated herein (including in any Current Report on Form
8-K and any proxy statement), the Company shall provide the Purchasers with such
draft disclosure and provide the Purchasers an opportunity to review and comment
on such disclosure, which comments the Company will incorporate where reasonably
requested. The Company will not, without the prior written consent of the
Purchasers, use in advertising, publicity, marketing communications regarding
any Company financing (whether oral or written) or other external communication
or filing, the “Baker Brothers” name or, to its knowledge, the name of any
partner or employee thereof, nor any trade name, trademark, trade device,
service mark, symbol or any abbreviation, or contraction thereof owned by the
Purchasers, except that the Company may make any such disclosure if, upon the
advice of counsel, there is no alternative to such disclosure because it is
required by applicable law or regulation and the Purchasers are notified in
advance and given reasonable opportunity to minimize such disclosure. In
addition, the Company may respond to inquiries about any public disclosure that
was required by law or regulation, by confirming the accuracy of such
disclosure.
12.3    Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. This Agreement shall
be governed in all respects by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of New York without regard to provisions regarding choice of laws. Each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself
and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of any New York State court
or Federal court of the United States of America sitting in New York City, and
any appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any of the other Note Documents to which it is
a party, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims in
respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such
New York State court or, to the fullest extent permitted by law, in such Federal
court. Each of the Company, the Designated Agent and the Purchasers irrevocably
waives all right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim
(whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to any
of the Note Documents or the actions of the Designated Agent or any Purchaser in
the negotiation, administration, performance or enforcement thereof.
12.4    Successors and Assigns.
(a)    Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the provisions hereof
shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the successors and assigns
of the parties hereto.


36



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Without the prior written consent of the Requisite Purchasers, the Company may
not assign any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, any Note, any
Intellectual Property Security Agreement or any other Note Document, and any
such purported assignment shall be void. Each Purchaser, so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Company (not to
be unreasonably withheld), may assign or grant a participation in its Note or
its rights and obligations hereunder or under any Note; provided, that (i) no
such consent shall be required in connection with any assignment to another
Purchaser, an Affiliate of a Purchaser or any stockholder of the Company, (ii)
with respect to any assignment, such Purchaser or any registered assign, as
applicable, shall provide to the Company the relevant documentation effecting
the assignment and, for the avoidance of doubt, no such assignment shall be
effective until recorded in the Register in accordance with Section 12.4(b),
(iii) any assignee shall agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and
any other Note Document, as applicable, and (iv) with respect to any grant of a
participation right, the Purchaser or registered assign that grants such
participation right shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary
agent of the Company, maintain a register on which it enters the name and
address of the participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of
the participant’s interest in the Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser or Designated Agent, as
the case may be, may not assign the rights set forth in Sections 2.3(b), 8.1(k)
and 12.1 of this Agreement.
(b)    The Company shall maintain a copy of the assignment documentation
provided to it by any Purchaser (or any registered assign) and a register for
the recordation of the names and addresses of the Purchasers, and the principal
amounts (and stated interest) of each Note owing to each Purchaser (or any
registered assign) pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the
“Register”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest
error, and the Company and each Purchaser (and registered assign) shall treat
each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof
as a Purchaser hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall
be available for inspection by any Purchaser (or registered assign) at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
12.5    Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Notes, the Warrants, the other
Note Documents and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and thereto (all of which
are hereby expressly incorporated herein by this reference) (collectively, the
“Transaction Documents”) constitute the entire understanding and agreement
between the parties with regard to the subjects hereof and thereof.
12.6    Certain Adjustments. All share and per-share values set forth in the
Transaction Documents shall be automatically adjusted to reflect any stock
splits, reverse stock splits or similar recapitalization events affecting such
securities that occur after the Effective Date. By way of example only, if the
Company effects a two-for-one split of the Common Stock after the Effective Date
and, prior to that event, a Purchaser held a Warrant to purchase 100 shares of
Common Stock at a price of $5.00 per share, then the Warrant shall be adjusted
to represent the right to purchase 200 shares of Common Stock at a price of
$2.50 per share.


37



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





12.7    Notices. All notices, requests, waivers and other communications made
pursuant to this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed delivered,
given and received when delivered (by hand, by registered mail, by courier or
express delivery service, by e-mail or by facsimile) to the address, e-mail
address or facsimile telephone number set forth beneath the name of such party
on its signature page to this Agreement (or to such other address, e-mail
address or facsimile telephone number as such party will have specified in a
written notice given to the other parties hereto). Notice shall be deemed given
when sent electronically (via email or facsimile), provided that a confirming
copy of such notice shall be sent in print form, unless the sender receives an
acknowledgement of receipt of the electronic notice (e.g., reply email). In the
even that notice is given to the Company, a courtesy copy, which shall not
constitute notice, shall also be provided to Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky
and Popeo, P.C., 3580 Carmel Mountain Road, Suite 300, San Diego, California,
Attention: Adam C. Lenain.
12.8    Amendments and Termination. Any term of this Agreement and any other
Note Document or Warrant may be amended only with the written consent of the
Company, the Designated Agent and the Requisite Purchasers. However, no
amendment may, without the consent of all affected Purchasers (a) reduce the
percentage of Purchasers required to take or approve any action hereunder or
thereunder; (b) reduce the amount or change the time of payment of any amount
owing or payable with respect to any Note or change the rate of interest or the
manner of calculation of interest payable with respect to any Note; (c) release
the securities interest granted in respect of all or substantially all of the
Collateral for the Notes, or modify the manner of payment or the order of
priorities in which payments or distributions hereunder will be made as between
the Purchasers and the Company or as among the Purchasers; (d) alter or modify
in any respect, or waive, the provisions with respect to the conversion or
redemption of the Notes; or (e) consent to any assignment of the Company’s
rights under the Note Documents. The Collateral Documents shall terminate
automatically upon the conversion of the Notes in full pursuant to the terms
hereof or when the Secured Obligations (other than contingent indemnification
obligations for which no claim has been asserted) have been paid in full.
12.9    Titles and Subtitles. The titles of the sections and clauses of this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and are not to be considered in
construing this Agreement.
12.10    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but all of which together
shall constitute one instrument. Delivery by facsimile or e-mail of an executed
counterpart of a signature page shall be effective as delivery of an original
executed counterpart.
12.11    Severability. Should any provision of this Agreement be determined to
be illegal or unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the remaining
provisions of this Agreement.
12.12    Expenses. The Company agrees to reimburse the Designated Agent on
demand for the reasonable costs and expenses of one counsel for the Designated
Agent actually incurred in connection with (i) the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification and amendment of, or any consent or
waiver under, the Note Documents; and (ii) the enforcement of the Note
Documents, whether in any action, suit or litigation, or any bankruptcy,
insolvency or


38



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





other similar proceeding affecting creditors’ rights generally (including the
reasonable documented fees and expenses of counsel for the Designated Agent and
each Purchaser with respect thereto).
12.13    Agent. Each of the Purchasers hereby irrevocably appoints the
Designated Agent as its agent, and the Designated Agent accepts such
appointment, and each of the Purchasers authorizes the Designated Agent to take
such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the
Designated Agent by the terms of the Note Documents, together with such actions
and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Designated Agent is hereby expressly authorized to execute
any and all documents (including releases) with respect to the Collateral and
the rights of the Purchasers with respect thereto, as contemplated by and in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the other Note Documents.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Designated Agent shall
have the sole and exclusive right and authority (to the exclusion of the
Purchasers), and is hereby authorized by the Purchasers as provided in this
Agreement and the other Note Documents or as directed in writing by the
Requisite Purchasers, to take and exercise all actions in connection with the
Collateral and any other exercise of remedies hereunder or thereunder. None of
the Designated Agent or any of its directors, officers, employees or agents
shall (a) be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of them
under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Note Document or the
transactions contemplated hereby (except to the extent resulting from its own
gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined in a final non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction), or (b) be responsible in any
manner to any Purchaser for any recital, statement, representation or warranty
made by any Loan Party or Affiliate of any Loan Party, or any officer thereof,
contained in this Agreement or in any other Note Document, or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by the Designated Agent under or in connection with, this Agreement
or any other Note Document, or the validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Note Document (or
the creation, perfection or priority of any Lien or security interest therein),
or for any failure of any Loan Party or any other party to any Note Document to
perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Designated Agent shall not
be under any obligation to the Purchasers to ascertain or to inquire as to the
observance or performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions
of, this Agreement or any other Note Document, or to inspect the properties,
books or records of any Loan Party or Affiliate of any Loan Party.
12.14    Allocation of Payments. The Purchasers acknowledge that the Notes are
pari passu obligations against each of the other Notes. Each payment of interest
or principal on the Notes shall be allocated among all of the Notes at the time
outstanding in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective unpaid
balances of principal outstanding thereunder. If any Purchaser shall, by
exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in
respect of any principal of or interest under any of his, her or its Notes or
other obligations hereunder in an amount in excess of his, her or its pro rata
share thereof as provided herein, then such Purchaser shall forthwith pay such
excess to the Designated Agent which amount the Designated Agent shall thereupon
pay to the Purchasers on a pro rata basis.


39



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





12.15    Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in any Note Document, the interest paid or agreed to be paid under the
Note Documents shall not exceed the maximum rate of non-usurious interest
permitted by applicable Law (the “Maximum Rate”). If any Purchaser shall receive
interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall
be applied to the principal of the Notes or, if it exceeds such unpaid
principal, refunded to the Company. In determining whether the interest
contracted for, charged, or received by the Purchasers exceeds the Maximum Rate,
such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, (a) characterize any
payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than
interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c)
amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total
amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the obligations
hereunder.
12.16    Certain Tax Matters. Any and all payments by or on account of any
obligation of the Company under the Notes or this Agreement shall be made
without deduction or withholding for any taxes, levies, imposts, duties,
deductions, withholdings or assessments, fees or other charges imposed by any
governmental authority, including any interest, additions to tax or penalties
applicable thereto (“Taxes”), except as required by applicable law. If the
Company is required by applicable law to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any
such payment, then the Company shall withhold or deduct such Taxes, the Company
shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant taxing
authority in accordance with applicable law, and the sum payable by the
applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after deduction or
withholding has been made for any such Tax (other than any such Tax that is an
income Tax), including such deductions or withholdings applicable to additional
sums payable under this Section 12.16, the applicable recipient receive an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or
withholding been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the increase of the sum
payable described in the immediately preceding sentence shall not be required
with respect to payments by or on account of any obligation of the Company under
the Notes or this Agreement for Taxes withheld or deducted from such payments
(A) to the extent such Taxes result from the failure of the applicable recipient
to provide to the Company (i) a valid properly executed Internal Revenue Service
Form W-9 (if such recipient is a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) or (ii) a valid properly executed appropriate Internal Revenue Service
Form W-8 (if such recipient is not a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax
purposes) establishing a complete exemption from U.S. federal tax withholding to
the extent it is legally entitled to do so or (B) in the case of a Purchaser (or
registered assign) that is not a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, to the extent such Taxes are U.S. federal withholding Taxes imposed on
amounts payable to or for the account of such person with respect to an
applicable interest in a Note pursuant to a law in effect on the date on which
(i) such person acquires such interest in the Note or (ii) such person changes
its lending office, except in each case to the extent that amounts with respect
to such Taxes were payable either to such person’s assignor immediately before
such person became a party hereto or to such person immediately before it
changed its lending office. The Company agrees to pay any and all stamp, court
or documentary, intangible, recording, filing or similar Taxes that arise in
respect of this Agreement or the Note.
